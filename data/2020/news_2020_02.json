Check out our Windows Insider Page for the latest builds from all the channels, information on the program, links, and more!\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft has just announced the release of the Windows 10 20H1 build 19041.84 for Slow Ring Insiders, which brings more minor fixes for the upcoming Windows 10 version 2004. It\u2019s been a month since the Windows Insider team last shipped a new 20H1 build to the Slow Ring, and today\u2019s update brings security fixes for various Windows components, as well as fix for an issue PC causing PCs to get into an unbootable in the previous 20H1 build.\nYou can learn more about all the changes and known issues in the build 19041.84 below:\n\nKey changes\n\nSecurity updates to Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Windows App Platform and Frameworks, Microsoft Graphics Component, Windows Input and Composition, Windows Media, Windows Shell, the Microsoft Scripting Engine, Windows Fundamentals, Windows Management, Windows Virtualization, Windows Peripherals, Windows Network Security and Containers, Windows Storage and Filesystems, and Windows Server.\nWe have fixed an issue where in certain cases, after Windows runs a scheduled task during a maintenance window, a PC may get into an unbootable state after installing Build 19041.21 (KB4535550).\nFor more information about the resolved security vulnerabilities, please refer to the Security Update Guide.\n\nKnown issues\n\nWe are aware Narrator and NVDA users that seek the latest release of Microsoft Edge based on Chromium may experience some difficulty when navigating and reading certain web content. Narrator, NVDA and the Edge teams are aware of these issues. Users of legacy Microsoft Edge will not be affected. NVAccess has released a NVDA 2019.3 that resolves the known issue with Edge.\n\n\nWe expect Microsoft to continue servicing the 20H1 build 19041 with more cumulative updates in the coming weeks, and we also shouldn\u2019t have to wait to long for Insiders in the Release Preview ring to receive their first 20H1 build. Unless Microsoft discovers a major bug in the latest 20H1 preview builds, Windows 10 version 2004 may start rolling out to users in April or May.\n\nRelated\n \n\nCategories News Tags 20H1, Slow Ring, Windows, Windows 10, Windows Insider \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Microsoft Edge Dev build is out with PDF reader improvements\n\n\nForza Street mobile game is coming soon to Android devices and you can pre-register now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisqus Latest Comments\nsathvik: there always is.Commented on: Microsoft-affiliated study reveals vulnerabilities and toxicity risks in GPT-4sathvik: it's really was.Commented on: Welcoming a New Chapter: Transition to WindowsReportsathvik: it's not even was surprise about that.Commented on: Only 1% of Netflix subscribers are playing games on the servicesathvik: it's was really usefulCommented on: Tip of the Week #7: Taskbar icons for Edge profiles (and other apps)sathvik: i bit confused it.Commented on: Microsoft releases Radius, an open-source cloud-native app platform\nOur Latest Posts\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III PC system requirements, preload times revealedby Robert CollinsOctober 31, 2023\nPowerToys 0.75 released; Environment Variables editor is hereby Devesh BeriOctober 31, 2023\nFormer Halo developer Bungie announces layoffs in wake of game delaysby Robert CollinsOctober 31, 2023\nSiemens and Microsoft partner to bring GenAI to industries worldwideby Devesh BeriOctober 31, 2023\n43 Microsoft Edge keyboard shortcuts to remember for stylish and speedy web surfingby Dave W.

After years of winning, growth stocks were no longer on the menu as investors switched to their dividend-paying/cheaper value cousins. Well, you can throw that out the window.\nGrowth stocks are once again back in charge.\nSo far this year, growth stocks have continued to outperform their value sisters. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:IWF) is up over 4% so far in 2020. This contrasts with the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (NYSEARCA:IWD), which is around even for the year. And the difference may continue.\nWith the trade war now behind us and the spread of the coronavirus starting to slow, the pump is primed for more growth gains ahead. In the end, its too early to count out growth stocks. They\u2019re still going to be one of the major drivers of returns for the near future. And in that, investors still need to own them.\nBut which ones? Here are five growth stocks that have plenty of \u201coomph\u201d behind them and could make a great addition to your portfolio.\n\n\nGrowth Stocks to Buy: Nvidia (NVDA)\n\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbout 41%. That\u2019s how much Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) year-over-year revenue surged in its latest quarter. That\u2019s a massive jump and just goes to show that there is still plenty of the growth in NVDA\u2019s tank. Where\u2019s that growth coming from? A hefty does of data center and artificial intelligence demand.\nNVDA has long been the graphics card/processor king. However, these days many of those chips aren\u2019t going into computers to play the latest version of Quake. It turns out those chips are perfect for the rapid-fire computing power you need to make A.I. and data centers run efficiently. Without them, many cloud computing apps and other things we take for granted wouldn\u2019t work.\nThis fact has sent many OEM\u2019s right to Nvidia. Both CEO Jensen Huang and Colette Kress highlighted this fact on Nvidia\u2019s conference call \u2014 with the firm\u2019s performance driven by the rapid adoption of A.I. by data center customers. Data center sales grew by 33% alone in the last quarter.\nThe best part is that Nvidia still has plenty of growth potential ahead. With driverless cars, overall rising data center demand driven by natural language applications as well as interconnected technology all becoming big tech trends, its chips will undoubtedly be in big demand. No wonder analysts predict the firm would see a big 13% jump to its earnings each fiscal year for the next five years.\nAll in all, Nvidia could be one of the best growth stocks around \u2014 both now and far into the future.\n\nRoku (ROKU)\n\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhile it may have some new competition on the horizon, the reality is, Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) is the name when it comes to streaming video. That power continues to be in its platform.\nWith a seemingly endless supply of new digital channels and networks offering streaming packages, only one firm really lets you watch them all via one device. And that\u2019s ROKU. Thanks to its open source OS that\u2019s found on its own devices and now many TV\u2019s as the standard, ROKU has become the platform play for all streaming channels. Over 5,000 in fact. Consumers can watch Hulu, their Disney+ and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) subscriptions all from the same device.\nThis has made ROKU a powerhouse of growth.\nDuring its last quarter, total revenues at Roku jump grew 52% year-over-year to $1.13 billion. However, the real win for the firm has continued to be its \u201cplatform\u201d revenues. This includes selling ads on its Roku channel as well as \u201cclick-through\u201d fees when users buy subscriptions to other channels via its devices. Here, revenues jumped by more than 78% during the quarter.\nThe best part is that despite being the streaming champion, there are still plenty of households left when it comes to cord cutting. And there\u2019s a real good chance they\u2019ll choose a Roku device.\nAll in all, ROKU has the growth potential to keep its revenues moving higher for the long haul.\n\nBoston Scientific (BSX)\n\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAside from tech, the healthcare sector is full of growth stocks that offer years worth of capital gains and potential. A top contender could be Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX).\nBSX stock\u2019s main bailiwick are products designed to improve heart health. The firm is famous for its stents used in a variety of bypass and other cardiac-related surgeries. However, the firm\u2019s pipeline is now vast and covers a variety of rhythm management, urology, oncology and neuromodulation products. This has made the medical firm a giant.\nFor full year 2019 earnings, Boston Scientific managed to pull in $10.73 billion in sales. That\u2019s a decent 9.3% jump over last year\u2019s numbers. On an GAAP EPS basis, that\u2019s roughly triple what it pulled in over all of 2018.\nAnd there\u2019s a great chance that these gains will continue.\nWhile Boston Scientific has warned on the coronavirus impacting its results in the short-term as a hefty amount of sales do come from overseas, the longer term is rosy. That comes down to its pipeline of new devices. Recently, BSX received approval for its new Exalt Model D Duodenoscope. Every year over 1.5 million endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures are done every year. As the one approved single use device of this procedure, BSX has a blockbuster on its hands.\nWith the pipeline growth counteracting any short-term corona virus weakness, BSX has a long runway for continued growth.\n\nBeyond Meat (BYND)\n\n\nSource: calimedia / Shutterstock.com\n\nI am in no way saying you should take a second mortgage on you house to buy Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), but you can\u2019t deny the firm\u2019s growth potential at this point. The maker of plant-based meat substitutes has continued to rack up sales and interest from consumers. Driving that has not been on the grocery store shelves, but via its massive partnerships with casual dining and quick-service restaurants. It\u2019s recent partnership with Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) KFC to sell meatless fried chicken is a prime example of that. And it turns that has been a success.\nWith demand for plant-based options growing and an eye on China, it may finally be worthy of its parabolic share price.\nFellow InvestorPlace contributor Tezcan Gecgil highlighted BYND\u2019s performance during the last quarter \u2014 with both restaurant and direct-to-consumer sales jumping. This led to the firm\u2019s better-than-expected revenue announcement. With the firm set to report again at the end of February, the results should be equally as impressive. This is especially true now that many of its fast-food deals are starting to be in place and consumer demand has risen.\nAt the same time, the stock is still about 50% below its all-time high reached last summer. While valuation for Beyond Meat stock is still pretty expensive, that dip makes an interesting buy point. It\u2019s a risky play, but given its growth trajectory and the continued surge in plant-based foods, its worth some capital in a portfolio.\n\nFive Below (FIVE)\n\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nRetail is a bloodbath these days as the sector continues to split into the haves and have nots. For the haves, there can be plenty of growth stock potential \u2014 and leading the way could be Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE).\nFIVE is considered a dollar store. The kicker is that it\u2019s not targeting adults, but their kids. It sells a variety of toys, candy, health & beauty items, fashion and gadgets \u2014 all the stuff seven-to-fourteen-year-old kids just can\u2019t get enough of. The best part, as its name implies, is that everything is a Lincoln or less.\nIt turns out this niche is amazing. Over the last five years, the retailer has managed to produce annual compound sales growth of 24%. Meanwhile, its new locations take just one year to pay back their initial start-up costs.\nPart of this high sales growth comes from Five Below generally targeting more affluent areas to build its stores. It\u2019s not shooting for necessarily the same demographic as a Dollar General (NYSDE:DG).\nAnd things could get better for Five Below over the next few years. The firm keeps opening new stores in great locations as well as new \u201cTen Below\u201d zones in several of its more affluent stores. These locations will feature slightly more expensive gear that would cover iPhone, gaming, Bluetooth speakers and similar gadgets. Perhaps the best growth driver continues to new deals with firms like Disney (NYSE:DIS) to offer exclusive products branded with characters from Star Wars, Marvel and Frozen.\nOver the long haul, Five Below\u2019s niche will provide plenty of growth for its bottom line.\nAt the time of writing, Aaron Levitt was long FIVE and ROKU.\n\nAaron Levitt is an investment journalist living in Ohio.

(PHOTO: Getty Creative)   By Francis Kan While much attention has been focused on Budget support measures for the hard-hit travel and tourism-related sectors, businesses leaders said that enterprises outside these industries may also need assistance as the fallout from COVID-19 spreads to the broader economy. \u201cIt's coming fast and furious, and hitting all the frontline industries like tourism, hospitality and F&B, but other sectors are also starting to feel the impact of the economic slowdown,\u201d said Kurt Wee, President of The Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME).  SMEs, which make up 99 per cent of businesses here, are likely to bear the brunt of any economic fallout, as they struggle with a drop in demand and the resulting strain on cash flow, he added. Singapore Business Federation Chairman S.S. Teo agreed, saying in a statement that the business chamber would have liked for the government to address the knock-on effects of COVID-19 on other industries. Support for SMEs Measures targeted at SMEs in the S$4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package unveiled by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Tuesday include a Jobs Support Scheme that subsidises the wages of local workers, while all tax-paying companies will receive a 25% corporate income tax rebate for 2020, capped at S$15,000 per company. The Enterprise Financing Scheme\u2019s Working Capital Loan will double its maximum loan quantum to S$600,000, giving easier access to working capital, and tenants and lessees of government-managed properties can also request for more flexible rental payments.  In the longer term, an Enterprise Grow Package will help businesses adopt digital solutions, and support their internationalisation efforts. An Enterprise Transform Package was also launched to groom business leaders of promising SMEs. Fears of knock-on effects While business leaders welcomed the measures, they said more might be needed. Manufacturers and logistics players are already being affected due to disruptions to their supply chains. Hubei province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak is one of China\u2019s major manufacturing hubs. At a press conference earlier this month, Enterprise Singapore chairman Peter Ong said that it has been \u201cvery difficult\u201d to ship goods in and out of China. Singapore-based contract manufacturing firm Watson EP Industries, which has factory in Dongguan in Guangdong province, may consider shifting some production back to Singapore if the situation does not improve soon, group executive director Joyce Seow said. Other sectors, from HR outsourcing firms to construction companies could also be impacted by supply chain disruptions, noted Wee.   Story continues Companies not yet feeling affected are also bracing for impact. Edy Tan, CEO of environmental services firm Chye Thiam Maintenance, said that while his business is being buoyed in the short term by increased demand for cleaning services, things could quickly go south if the economy enters a more protracted slowdown.\u201cIn the long run if demand falls and more businesses are affected, they may re-look\u2026 our contracts, and we may have to do some cost-cutting,\u201d he said.Gaps to be addressedWee said businesses had hoped for more help to address costs and cash flow issues in the short-term. \u201cWe're in the eye of the storm right now. So businesses were hoping for a bit more to help to alleviate their cost and liquidity pressure, preferably a six-month long package to help them through this.\u201dHe proposed that the government work closely with financial institutions to put into place a moratorium on loan repayments for an initial period of six months.Chia Tek Yew, Head of Financial Services Advisory, KPMG Singapore said banks could look at waiving certain conditions such as personal guarantees from shareholders or directors, or profitability track records to make the loan application process more friendly.Given that the success of measures lie in their implementation, SBF also urged the government to \u201csimplify access to these schemes, which are a much-needed boost in these difficult times, so companies can easily leverage them\u201d.Related stories:Singapore Budget 2020 may set the tone for regional economies: OCBCTourism sector: Will COVID-19 impact outlast Budget relief measures?Singapore Budget 2020: More winners than losers  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nAfter the starting bell rang today, NVIDIA stock breached the $300 psychological barrier and blew past $312 to achieve a new all-time high for the company. NASDAQ:NVDA is currently creating support at this critical level and putting on the hurt to the shorts. This is something that the company's investors have been wishing for almost a year and a half and looks like Christmas has come early.\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) reaches a new all-time high of $312.87 with a market cap of $191 Billion\nUp until September 2018, Jensen was putting out record quarters on record quarters and NVIDIA's stock seemed likely to breach the $300 level, taking it to new heights. Its GPUs had been powering the cryptocurrency boom for the past few years and GPGPU for AI was taking off as well. History, it transpired had different plans. A break in its record quarters preceded a collapse in the stock price. It was a bumpy ride for investors as the stock plummeted to $145 and recovered slowly as the company's next-generation graphics cards based on the Turing architecture were mostly deadpanned.\n\n\n2020, it seems, is going to be NVIDIA's year, because the stock has been undergoing an insane recovery and has finally breached $300 and achieved a new all-time high of $312.87. This is mostly on the back of anticipation of the launch of its brand new Ampere GPUs as well as a speculated shift to 7nm which would allow it to drive down costs while increasing the performance profile of its graphics cards. The company has also seen a lot of windfall from Nintendo Switch sales (although these might be affected by the Coronavirus slowdown that Nintendo expects to face).\nAnother driver for this comeback is the fact that Turing is finally becoming affordable. The SUPER lineup has brought down the cost of gaming by offering more powerful GPUs for (relatively) cheaper prices and the non-RTX Turing series has proven to be a crowd favorite with affordable GPUs and great performance. AMD has also remained mostly uncompetitive in the high-end gaming segment and has only offered any competition in the mainstream segment.\nThe company's Ampere GPUs will be able to drive down the cost of gaming even further and turn up the heat for AMD Radeon cards, and if the rumors about 7nm is true, kick start another buying frenzy as PC gamers enter an upgrade cycle to take advantage of the generational leap in performance (which is pretty large during node changes). The Total Available Market (TAM) for gamers also continues to increase as more and more users in the target demographic increase their purchasing power.\nThe company's GPUs have also been tapped for various AI-related workloads as well as on-board driving computers and remain the only viable choice for employing a GPGPU on the go. Short of Tesla's mysterious self-driving computer, nothing comes close. With Nintendo switch sales and SUPER Turing already fully priced in, investors should look out for news related to Ampere GPUs launch as well as the lineup and positioning associated with it. The company is also teaming with Intel to launch its SUPER mobility GPUs soon (as covered in our exclusive earlier).\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n49\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n39\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n32\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n31\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n29\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1147\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Now Nvidia has gone official with the product, sharing images and a video of a specially crafted GPU which will be a version of its top end consumer graphics card, the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti.\n\nThe previous teaser image didn't give much away but the new video and images provide an excellent preview of what will be a limited edition product. How limited? Just 200 will be made, says Nvidia. How will you be able to buy one with such limited stock? You won't, Nvidia will not be selling these beauties, they will feature in various social media giveaways and charity auctions.\n\nTo kick off the giveaways, Nvidia has 77 available in what it has dubbed the 'RTX On Sweepstakes'. TO participate you have to complete a couple of tiresome social media tasks on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook . In brief you have to reply to one of these posts via retweet, like or comment, then save something positive about a fellow gamer, tag them and include the #RTXOn hashtag.\n\nIf you are one of the 77 lucky ones who win a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Cyberpunk 2077 Edition you will receive one of the cards, as pictured. Nvidia provides a smattering of extra details about this product; it features a custom AL5052 aluminium shroud, with Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s signature yellow styling, and it comes in a gift box which will look great on your hardware shelf. Underneath the twin fan shroud you will have a powerful GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU.\nIf you are planning on playing Cyberpunk 2077 at launch with raytracing effects there isn't anything else in the consumer space now that can beat this card. Obviously as such an object of desire, the resale values of these cards on places like eBay looks set to be astronomical.\n\nHEXUS has previously reviewed Nvidia's reference Edition GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, as well as samples from the likes of MSI, and the liquid cooled Inno3D iChill Black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 17 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

The company's game streaming platform went live recently and features 1 hour of free session length as well as a subscription for unlimited play. Powered by their own GPUs, it wasn't clear what performance levels the RTX servers were rocking until leaks of certain unreleased CPUs and GPUs started popping up.\nThe GeForce NOW CPU Node: 4 Cores of Intel CC150 coupled with 7.1 GB RAM\nNVIDIA's GeForce NOW is powered by the Intel CC150 CPU. The reason we know this is true is that benchmarks of virtualized instances of server stacks have started popping up that contain a certain unreleased GPU from NVIDIA that we know was created specifically for the GeForce NOW/RTX server ecosystem. This is going to get confusing really fast so let's take this one step at a time. Earlier today the following leaks were published by the usual suspects (namely TUM_APISAK):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe leak seems to reference a mysterious Intel CPU, the CC150, that has beeen popping up here and there over the last week. While we do know a few things about this SKU, this is the first time it has been benched in conjunction with another whimsical entry: the T10-8 GPU (more on this later). The Intel CC150 is known to have 8 cores and 16 threads as documented by a previous leak we covered:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThis new leak however is running a hypervisor, Xen HVM, (which is further evidence for this being a Geforce NOW bench by the way) and features a very interesting read by the software: 2 processors, 4 cores 8 threads. What we are probably seeing here is the HVM splitting the 8-core Intel CC150 into two seperate instances - each with 4 cores. This means that gamers that using GeForce NOW will have access to 4 cores / 8 threads on a shared Intel CC150 per node. The CPU is paired to 14.3 GB of usable FPM (fast page) RAM. The actual RAM might be a 16GB Dynamic RAM kit with some of the memory reserved by the system.\nA quad-core instance running Hyper-Threading will usually be more than enough for most modern games, especially if 60 fps is the target (which it is) and shows that NVIDIA has chosen to go with Intel processors instead of AMD ones. The CC150 is locked at a solid 3.5 GHz all-core clock which is pretty decent for a server processor.\nThe GeForce NOW GPU Node: NVIDIA T10-8 graphics card (shared between two nodes) with 8GB vRAM\nNow let's talk a bit about the GPU. One of the reasons we are sure that this leak is of a GeForce NOW/RTX Server instance is because it utilizes an enigmatic GPU called the NVIDIA T10-8. We know very little about this card and it was actually speculated to be the RTX 2080 Ti (but we know now that this is not true). We do know however that it is based on the TU102 die and is a GPU that NVIDIA released only internally, specifically for the GeForce NOW service and for use in RTX servers.\nConsidering this benchmark leak features the T10-8 more than suggests that we are looking at a GeForce NOW bench. TUM_APISAK, being the champ that he is, also leaked the following benchmark of GeForce NOW featuring the RTX T10-8 GPU and the Intel CC150 CPU:\n\nThis benchmark of GeForce NOW running Ashes of the Singularity pretty much confirms our theory. The game can see the shared NVIDIA GeForce RTX T10-8 GPU but only 4 of the CC150's 8-cores. This is the gaming performance that you can expect from a single instance of GeForce NOW. This level of gaming performance is mostly adequate for streaming 1080p games. This performance might also vary depending on the type of sharing going on.\nI would imagine NVIDIA would usually club users playing low graphically demanding games (like Cuphead) with users playing high graphically demanding games (like Destiny) to optimize the load over a node. Also keep in mind that it is very much possible that we are looking at just one instance configuration and multiple node configurations could exist.

GoodFeb 21, 2020, 10:22 PM UTCFacebookLinkIf you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.Wolfenstein: Youngblood is the only Bethesda game remaining for Nvidia GeForce Now customers. Image: MachineGames, Arkane Lyon/Bethesda SoftworksOwen S. Good is a longtime veteran of video games writing, well known for his coverage of sports and racing games.A week after losing all its Activision Blizzard games, Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now streaming service has lost \u201cmost Bethesda Softworks titles,\u201d Nvidia said in an announcement Friday afternoon.Wolfenstein: Youngblood will remain available for all users, Nvidia said. An Nvidia representative later told Polygon that Youngblood will be the only Bethesda title to stay on the service. Other Bethesda games leaving GeForce Now include the remainder of the Wolfenstein series; Fallout 3, 76, and New Vegas; The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim (and its Special Edition); Doom (2016); Dishonored and Dishonored 2; and The Evil Within 2.Nvidia had no additional comment beyond the brief blog post. On Feb. 11, Nvidia announced that GeForce Now was losing support for 20 Activision Blizzard games. The company later said in a statement that it had removed those titles because of a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d over permissions to continue offering them when the cloud gaming service left its beta period.GeForce Now came out of beta at the beginning of February. It allows users to stream select games that they already own and have access to through other digital storefronts (such as Steam or the Epic Games Store). GeForce Now offers free one-hour trial sessions to anyone, as well as a \u201cFounders\u201d membership that is free for the first 90 days, then $4.99 per month for the next nine months.RelatedActivision Blizzard pulls all its games off Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now streaming serviceLast week, Bloomberg reported that Activision Blizzard had sought a commercial agreement with Nvidia specifically for its games\u2019 support, which Nvidia declined. In addition, The Verge reported that GeForce Now chief Phil Eisler acknowledged that publishers \u201care taking a while to make up their minds,\u201d which somewhat explains the transient nature of GeForce Now\u2019s catalog. Games from other publishers like Capcom, Rockstar, and Square Enix also left the service before its full launch.On Thursday, Eisler wrote a recap post calling the 90-day trial period offered to Founders subscribers \u201can important transitional period where gamers, developers, and publishers can try the premium experience with minimal commitment while we continue to refine our offering.\u201cAs we approach a paid service, some publishers may choose to remove games before the trial period ends,\u201d Eisler continued. \u201cUltimately, they maintain control over their content and decide whether the game you purchase includes streaming on GeForce Now. Meanwhile, others will bring games back as they continue to realize GeForce Now\u2019s value (stay tuned for more on that).\u201dEisler added that \u201cgame removals should be few and far between, with new games added to GeForce Now each week.\u201d Reached by Polygon, an Nvidia rep declined to comment when asked if Nvidia expected GeForce Now to lose access to other publishers\u2019 titles. Ubisoft has several games in the streaming service\u2019s catalog, as do 2K Games, Warner Bros. Games, Sega, and Codemasters.Polygon also reached out to a Bethesda representative for comment, but did not receive a reply by publication time.See More: GamingNewsPCWolfenstein: YoungbloodMost PopularBrandon Sanderson shared a list of his 10 favorite games, and they make perfect senseBring back the 2000s-era sci-fi flopbusterThere will likely never be a Hunger Games sequel, says Suzanne Collins\u2019 editorThe Lord of the Rings illustrated box set is on sale for its lowest price everWorld of Warcraft players are flocking to taverns with their altsPatch NotesThe best of Polygon in your inbox, every Friday.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

No one\u2019s better at explaining the action, in real time, than Cvijetic.\nCvijetic, senior manager of autonomous vehicles at NVIDIA, drives our NVIDIA DRIVE Labs series of videos and blogs breaking down the science behind autonomous vehicles.\nA Serbian-American electrical engineer, Cvijetic seems destined for this role. She literally grew up in the shadow of Nikola Tesla. His statue in Belgrade stood across the street from her childhood home.\nOn this week\u2019s AI Podcast, Cvijetic spoke to host Rick Merritt about what\u2019s driving autonomous vehicles.

Multiple cameras with overlapping fields of view, radar, and more provide a wealth of perception data for the highest level of accuracy.\n\nTweetables:\n\u201cI want every driver out there to feel that they understand AI, to understand how AI works in self-driving cars, and feel empowered by that understanding\u201d \u2014 Neda Cvijetic [1:56]\n\u201cThe NVIDIA DRIVE simulator seeks to create some of these corner cases that might take years to actually observe\u201d \u2014 Neda Cvijetic [10:36]\nYou Might Also Like\nDeep Learning 101: Will Ramey, NVIDIA Senior Manager for GPU Computing\nIf you\u2019ve ever wanted a guided tour through the history of AI, this is the episode for you.

GoodFeb 15, 2020, 3:50 PM UTCFacebookLinkIf you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 19 other games were abruptly pulled from Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now streaming service earlier this week. Image: Infinity Ward/ActivisionOwen S. Good is a longtime veteran of video games writing, well known for his coverage of sports and racing games.Nvidia says its GeForce Now service lost its library of 20 Activision and Blizzard games because of a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d over permission to continue offering them once the cloud gaming service left its beta period.Nvidia didn\u2019t describe exactly what the misunderstanding was in a statement yesterday, but did say it hoped to bring back Activision Blizzard games in the future. The full statement:Activision Blizzard has been a fantastic partner during the GeForce Now beta, which we took to include the free trial period for our founders\u2019 membership. Recognizing the misunderstanding, we removed their games from our service, with hope we can work with them to re-enable these, and more, in the future.Bloomberg reported that Activision Blizzard wanted to negotiate a new commercial agreement for its games when GeForce came out of its beta period. Nvidia, according to Bloomberg, doesn\u2019t want that kind of arrangement for GeForce Now. Its players may only stream games they already own from marketplaces like Steam, uPlay, Epic Games Store, and (until this week) Battle.net.GeForce Now had also removed games from publishers such as Rockstar Games, Square Enix, and Capcom before the service went to premium pricing. The Verge noted Friday night that GeForce Now\u2019s boss said publishers \u201care taking a while to make up their minds\u201d about participating according to Nvidia\u2019s no-commercial-agreements model, which doesn\u2019t give them any extra money.Furthermore, the disappearance of Activision Blizzard games from GeForce Now does not have anything to do with the exclusive streaming agreement the publisher and Google signed in January. In its quarterly conference call with investors on Feb. 6, the publisher said Stadia is not a part of that arrangement. That pact dedicates the publisher\u2019s esports events to YouTube and specifies Google Cloud as the \u201cpreferred provider\u201d of network infrastructure. What this really means to a PC gamer considering GeForce Now is that they\u2019re paying a premium for streaming access to games they already own \u2014 and yet they may lose that access at any time. GeForce Now offers free one-hour trial sessions to anyone, and a \u201cFounders\u201d membership that is free for the first 90 days, then $4.99 a month for the following nine months.See More: GamingNewsPCMost PopularBrandon Sanderson shared a list of his 10 favorite games, and they make perfect senseBring back the 2000s-era sci-fi flopbusterIndie game\u2019s \u2018lesbian toggle\u2019 makes it hilariously unplayableThere will likely never be a Hunger Games sequel, says Suzanne Collins\u2019 editorThe Lord of the Rings illustrated box set is on sale for its lowest price everPatch NotesThe best of Polygon in your inbox, every Friday.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

This GPU was released in June 2016, nearly four years ago which is crazy in GPU years and more so considering this part is technically still on sale today and is sold in fairly large quantities.\nThe Radeon RX 480 was originally intended to do battle with Nvidia's upcoming Pascal-based GTX 1060, released only a month later. At the time, the 8GB RX 480 was priced at $240 and the GTX 1060 6GB was sold for $250. Three months after release we compared the two, head to head in 22 games and found on average that the GeForce GPU was 6% faster. We noted then that in more recent titles, based on modern DX12 and Vulkan APIs, the RX 480 was almost always faster. Half a dozen of the titles tested supported a modern API and when comparing the data from those select titles, the GTX 1060 6GB was actually 5% slower on average. It seemed like over time, the Radeon RX 480 would end up being the faster product, while the GTX 1060 was more efficient and therefore AIB models generally ran cooler and quieter.\n\nWe've revisited the same comparison a few times over the years. In 2016, AMD released new drivers claiming big performance upgrades and with 19 games tested in total we found the GTX 1060 6GB was now just 1% faster on average.\nA year after launching the RX 480, AMD refreshed it as the RX 580 with a mild overclock and a price cut. To combat this Nvidia released a 9 Gbps memory version of the GTX 1060 which improved memory bandwidth by 13% over the standard 8 Gbps models. That sounded reasonably substantial, but without increasing the core clock frequency this change had little impact on performance.\n\nBy mid 2017 on a 27 game benchmark, the Radeon RX 580 was already 3% faster than the GTX 1060 9Gbps model. The tables had turned you could say, though it was fair to say performance was a match between the two and the ultimate choice came down to which games you played the most. A year later in 2018 we revisited this battle once again with 25 games, many of them new and previously untested for this comparison. This time the GTX 1060 was found to be on top by a marginal 3% faster on average result.\n\nThen the most recent update was published in 2019 with our biggest sample of games yet at 36. This time the RX 580 was around 3% faster than the GTX 1060. What's perhaps most surprising, the RX 580 is still on sale and remains one of the best value sub-$200 graphics card on the market. Easily beating out the newer 5500 XT and matching the GTX 1650 Super. It's possible to buy an 8GB RX 580 for as little as $160 and that makes this ancient GPU better value than most of the latest offerings.\n\nToday's comparisong is a big 32 game benchmark, as usual we'll go over the results for about a dozen of the newer titles and then we'll check out some head to head comparisons with all games in a few performance breakdown graphs. Our test rig consisted of a Core i9-9900K clocked at 5 GHz with 32GB of DDR4-3400 memory. Representing the green team is the Gigabyte Aorus GTX 1060 6G 9Gbps and for the red team the Gigabyte Aorus RX 580 XTR 8G. The latest available display drivers at the time of testing we're used and all results have been updated. Let's get to the good stuff...\nBenchmarks\nFirst up we have Rainbow Six Siege using its new Vulkan implementation. Previously using DX11, the RX 580 was around 15% faster than the GTX 1060. However, we're now looking at around twice that margin as the RX 580 was 27% faster at 1080p and 30% faster at 1440p.\nClearly Nvidia hasn't bothered to optimize their drivers for Pascal GPUs using the newer API in this title.\n\n\nWorld War Z is another title that makes use of Vulkan and here the RX 580 is seen to be 23% faster at 1080p and 27% faster at 1440p, so another massive win for the red team.\n\nResident Evil 2 is yet another title that makes use of a low-level API and here the RX 580 comfortably beats the 1060 by a 23% margin at 1080p and a 24% margin at 1440p.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 requires at least 8GB of VRAM when using high quality settings and as a result, we see rather poor 1% low performance from the GTX 1060 due to its 6GB buffer.\nSo while the RX 580 was 18% faster when comparing average frame rate performance at 1080p, it was a whopping 77% faster when comparing the 1% low data, and more crucially, didn't suffer from frame stuttering.\n\nApex Legends uses a modified version of Valve's Source engine and we had previously found the RX 580 to have a large performance advantage in this title. However, after the most recent update performance has swung around in Nvidia's favor, and for now at least, the GTX 1060 is up to 12% faster.\n\nPlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds uses the Unreal Engine 4 which is optimized for Nvidia hardware and as such the GTX 1060 beats the RX 580 by a handy margin in this title, offering 14% more frames at 1080p and 10% more at 1440p.\n\nInterestingly, although Fortnite also uses the Unreal Engine 4, AMD has been able to optimize the RX 580 for better performance. We know AMD was focused for a while on improving performance for this super popular title, and it seems they've done just that as the RX 580 was faster at both tested resolutions by up to a 12% margin.\n\nPerformance in Assassin's Creed Odyssey is neck and neck, no real winner here.\n\nInterestingly despite being an Nvidia sponsored title, Metro Exodus plays much better on the RX 580, though it does also use the DX12 API. Here the Radeon GPU was 23% faster at 1080p and 21% faster at 1440p.\n\nPerformance in the newly released Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order is very similar and this is a DirectX 11 title using the highly popular Unreal Engine.\n\nLast year when testing F1 2018 the RX 580 and GTX 1060 were ever so close. However, this latest version, F1 2019 makes use of DX12 and here the Radeon GPU has a huge performance advantage that sees it deliver 21% more frames at 1080p and 23% more at 1440p.\n\nPerformance in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is fairly even, though the RX 580 was 6% faster at 1080p and 9% faster at 1440p. Not a huge difference, though you will notice the performance boost at 1440p in particular.\nPerformance Breakdown\nThe Radeon RX 580 looked somewhat dominant in that 12 game sample, but we tested many more games...\nLet's see how the 580 and 1060 stack up across 32 new and popular titles.\n\nAt 1080p the RX 580 was 5% faster on average and looking at the results overall, you have a much better chance of receiving an extra 10% or more performance with the Radeon GPU in modern titles. Many of the newly released titles where the RX 580 didn't look so great use the Unreal Engine such as The Outer Worlds and PUBG, for example.\n\nOf the 32 games tested, 10 of them saw margins within 5%, which we'd consider a tie. There were 16 games where the RX 580 was faster by a 6% margin or greater and just 6 games where it was slower by a 6% margin or greater. The RX 580 is clearly the more consistent performer in 2020.\n\nThe margins grow in AMD's favor at 1440p. Here the RX 580 was 8% faster on average, it's biggest win over the GTX 1060 since this battle started. It would seem as though the extra 2GB of VRAM is now coming into play and we certainly saw this in titles such as Red Dead Redemption 2, for example.\nLong Term Bets\nRoughly four years after putting together our first big benchmark comparison between these two GPUs, it seems many of our original thoughts were accurate. We suspected that due to the strong initial low-level API performance of the RX 480, the Radeon would eventually end up becoming the superior GPU. We didn't recommend buying the RX 480 on that hunch alone though, as it was impossible to know just how long it would be before the superior DX12 and Vulkan performance would pay off.\n\nWhile the RX 580 has clearly aged better, the GTX 1060 6GB hasn't turned out to be a poor choice after all these years either. Current owners of the GTX 1060 6GB may still be content about their investment. In some titles the RX 580 delivers in excess of 20% more frames, but overall performance is still good. For the most part the 6GB frame buffer is fine and you can easily work around that limitation.\nHad you planned to keep the Radeon RX 480 for many years, then the better low-level API support would have been a major consideration, but if you upgrade every 2 or 3 years, then probably not as much. Since the RX 480 was released and then refreshed as the RX 580, there's been no obvious alternative in the $180 to $250 price range.\n\nNvidia's attempt with the GTX 1660 a year ago was welcome, but offering just 15% more performance didn't make the $220 upgrade worth it, plus AMD kept cutting RX 580's prices in retaliation.\nRight now, for $160-$180, Radeon RX 580 graphics cards offer good value but for the same price we'd prefer the newer GeForce GTX 1650 Super. Both GPUs are mostly matched on performance, with the GeForce getting the upper hand on efficiency and thermals.\nIf you want to spend over $200 on a new graphics card today, go with the $230 GeForce GTX 1660 Super which offers ~30% more performance, or $300 on a GeForce RTX 2060 for a little over 50% more performance.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nGeForce GTX 1650 Super on Amazon\nGeForce GTX 1660 Super on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 2060 on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 2060 Super on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 580 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 570 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 5700 on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 2070 Super on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 35\n\n\n Got something to say?

The new mobile graphics cards are here to replace their respective MX200-series counterparts that debuted just one year ago. The new Turing-powered MX graphics cards should land in the second half of this year.The GeForce MX350 is based on Nvidia's GP107 die from the Pascal days. This is the same silicon hidden inside the GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti. In the MX350's case, it only comes with 640 CUDA cores though, whereas the the GTX 1050 has 640 (2GB) or 768 (3GB) and the 1050 Ti has 768.\u00a0The GeForce MX350 and GeForce GTX 1050 might have similar dies and can have the same CUDA core count, but there should be a sizable performance gap between them. The GeForce MX350 sports 32 TMUs (texture mapping units), 16 ROPs (render output units) and a 64-bit memory bus. However, the GeForce GTX 1050 flexes 40 TMUs, 32 ROPs and a 128-bit memory interface. Not to mention that the GTX 1050 has a 75W TDP, which gives it more breathing room.As for its other specifications, the GeForce MX350 features a 1,354 MHz base clock and 1,468 MHz boost clock. The 2GB of GDDR5 memory runs at 7 Gbps across a 64-bit memory interface to output a memory bandwidth of 56.7 GBps.SpecsSwipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 GeForce MX350GeForce MX250GeForce MX330GeForce MX230GPU ArchitecturePascal (GP107)Pascal (GP108)Pascal (GP108)Pascal (GP108)Shading Units640384384256Texture Units32242416ROPs16161616Base Clock Rate1,354 MHz1,519 MHz1,531 MHz1,519 MHzBoost Clock Rate1,468 MHz1,582 MHz1,594 MHz1,582 MHzMemory Clock7 Gbps6 Gbps6 Gbps6 GbpsMemory Capacity2GB GDDR52GB GDDR52GB GDDR52GB GDDR5Memory Bus64-bit64-bit64-bit64-bitMemory Bandwidth56.06 GBps48.06 GBps48.06 GBps48.06 GBpsL2 Cache512KB512KB512KB512KBTDP25W25W25W25WTransistor Count3.3 billion1.8 billion1.8 billion1.8 billionDie Size132 mm\u00b274 mm\u00b274 mm\u00b274 mm\u00b2The GeForce MX330, on the other hand, continues to leverage the GP108 die. It has 384 CUDA cores with base and boost clock speeds up to 1,531 MHz and 1,594 MHz, respectively. In essence, the GeForce MX330 is a slightly overclocked GeForce MX250.The graphics card also has 2GB of GDDR5 memory communicating across a 64-bit memory bus, just like the GeForce MX350. However, the memory here is clocked at 6 Gbps, so the memory bandwidth is down to 48.06 GBps.Both the GeForce MX350 and MX330 target laptops, so they abide to strict TDP standards. The pair operate within the 25W restriction.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.GeForce MX350 and MX330 Benchmark ResultsAlthough Nvidia just lifted the curtains off the GeForce MX350 and MX330, there are already early reviews of both SKUs. It's important to keep in mind that the MX-series is on the lower end of the spectrum. While the GeForce MX350 and MX330 are generally better than integrated graphics, they are nowhere near as powerful as Nvidia's GTX 16-series, and any gaming would have to be limited to low or very low settings at low resolutions.\u00a0Image 1 of 1GeForce MX350 and MX330(Image credit: Zhihu)A user on Chinese website Zhihu ranked the GeForce MX350 between the GTX 1050 and GTX 960M in terms of performance. The GeForce MX350 reportedly held a healthy performance improvement over the GeForce MX250 but still fell far behind the GTX 1050. Notebookcheck's review lends credence to the validity of the results from the Zhihu review. Ultimately, it looks like we can look at the GeForce MX350 like a gimped GTX 1050 with a performance that's in the same ballpark as the GTX 960M.\u00a0Given the similar specifications, the GeForce MX330 should deliver the same level of performance as the GeForce MX250.Pascal Rides Into the Sunset?According to Notebookcheck's sources, the GeForce MX350 and MX330 could represent the mighty Pascal's last rodeo. Nvidia is reportedly working on a Turing-powered replacement for the GeForce MX350 to rival Intel's Xe DG1 mobile graphics solutions.The Turing successor to the GeForce MX350 is internally known as N18S-G5. It allegedly taps into Nvidia's TU117 silicon, which the chipmaker uses in the GeForce GTX 1650. The TU117 die houses up to 1,024 CUDA cores, but the possibility of the N18S-G5 having all of them at its disposal is pretty slim.The N18S-G5 is believed to feature PCIe 4.0 support and a 25W TDP. It seems that it will be available in two different flavors. The A variant is rumored to measure 23 x 23mm and the B variant at 29 x 29mm.\u00a0The N18S-G5-A should be the more flexible of the two as it's expected to arrive with GDDR5 memory at 3.5 GHz or GDDR6 memory at 5 GHz, compared to the N18S-G5-B's GDDR6 memory at 5 GHz. Independent of the variant, both reportedly adhere to the the typical 64-bit memory interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nBenchmark\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (0)\n\n\n\nZhiye LiuSocial Links NavigationNews Editor and Memory ReviewerZhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

A makeup department couldn\u2019t realistically transform the actors back to their 20s and 30s. And director Martin Scorcese was against using the typical motion capture markers or other intrusive equipment that gets in the way of raw performances during filming.\nTo meet this requirement, ILM developed a new three-camera rig to capture the actors\u2019 performances on set \u2014 using the director\u2019s camera flanked by two infrared cameras to record 3D geometry and textures. The team also developed software called ILM Facefinder that used AI to sift through thousands of images of the actors\u2019 past performances.\nThe tool located frames that matched the camera angle, framing, lighting and expression of the scene being rendered, giving ILM artists a relevant reference to compare against every frame in the shot. These visual references were used to refine digital doubles created for each actor, so they could be transformed into the target age for each specific scene in the film.\n\u201cAI and machine learning are becoming a part of everything we do in VFX,\u201d said Pablo Helman, VFX supervisor on The Irishman at ILM. \u201cPaired with the NVIDIA Quadro RTX GPUs powering our production pipeline, these technologies have us excited for what the next decade will bring.\u201d\nBuilding Better VFX Villains\nThe highest-grossing film of all time, Marvel\u2019s Avengers: Endgame included over 2,500 visual effects shots. VFX teams at Digital Domain used machine learning to animate actor Josh Brolin\u2019s performance onto the digital version of the film franchise\u2019s villain, the mighty Thanos.\nA machine learning system called Masquerade was developed to take low resolution scans of the actor\u2019s performance and facial movements, and then accurately transfer his expressions onto the high-resolution mesh of Thanos\u2019 face. The technology saves time for VFX artists who would otherwise have to painstakingly animate the subtle facial movements manually to generate a realistic, emoting digital human.\n\u201cKey to this process were immediate realistic rendered previews of the characters\u2019 emotional performances, which was made possible using NVIDIA GPU technology,\u201d said Darren Hendler, head of Digital Humans at Digital Domain. \u201cWe now use NVIDIA RTX technology to drive all of our real-time ray-traced digital human projects.\u201d\nRTX It in Post: Studios, Apps Adopt AI-Accelerated VFX\u00a0\nILM and Digital Domain are just two of a growing set of visual effects studios and apps adopting AI tools accelerated by NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\nIn HBO\u2019s The Righteous Gemstones series, lead actor John Goodman looks 30 years younger than he is. This de-aging effect was achieved with Shapeshifter, a custom software that uses AI to analyze face motion \u2014 how the skin stretches and moves over muscle and bone.\nVFX studio Gradient Effects used Shapeshifter to transform the actor\u2019s face in a process that, using NVIDIA GPUs, took weeks instead of months.\nCompanies such as Adobe, Autodesk and Blackmagic Design have developed RTX-accelerated apps to tackle other visual effects challenges with AI, including live-action scene depth reclamation, color adjustment, relighting and retouching, speed warp motion estimation for retiming and upscaling.\nNetflix Greenlights AI-Powered Predictions\u00a0\nOffscreen, streaming services such as Netflix use AI-powered recommendation engines to provide customers with personalized content based on their viewing history, or a similarity index that serves up content watched by people with similar viewing habits.\nNetflix also customizes movie thumbnails to appeal to individual users, and uses AI to help optimize streaming quality at lower bandwidths. The company uses NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate its work with complex data models, enabling rapid iteration.\n\nRolling Out the Red Carpet at GTC 2020\nTop studios including Lucasfilm\u2019s ILMxLAB, Magnopus and Digital Domain will be speaking at NVIDIA\u2019s GPU Technology Conference in San Jose, March 23-26.\nCheck out the lineup of media and entertainment talks and register to attend.

Log in.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is a huge player in the artificial intelligence industry because its chips help power many advanced applications.\nIts products are put to the test at the company's robotics lab in Seattle, where researchers are trying to build the next-generation systems that will be able to interact independently with humans.\nSenior director of robotics research Dieter Fox and his team chose to use common kitchen tasks as a challenge because they represent many of the broader problems with robotics Nvidia is aiming to solve.\u00a0\nBusiness Insider got an exclusive tour of the facility and was able to demo several of the projects under development.\nClick here for more BI Prime content.\n\n\n\nSign up here to receive updates on all things Innovation Inc.\u00a0\nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON \u2014 On the sixth floor of a nondescript building in Seattle's University District sits a model Ikea kitchen surrounded by the type of open-air office you'd find in most corporate buildings.\n\n\nBut the countertops, stove, and cabinets aren't meant to be operated by humans. Instead, the room serves as the testing ground for Nvidia's research into next-generation robots.\u00a0\nUnlike the tech platform that supports self-driving cars \u2014 which is trained to avoid pedestrians \u2014 or robots that are preprogrammed for specific tasks like those used in many manufacturing operations, Nvidia is trying to build systems that can interact with the environment and humans independently.\nThe kitchen was a logical first choice because the challenges represented many of the broader problems Nvidia was aiming to solve, like how to create a robot that could grasp a slew of everyday objects, according to senior director of robotics research Dieter Fox. Those could range from a rigid saucepan to something more malleable \u2014 like a bag of flour.\u00a0\n\n\nThe applications the company is testing also fit into a larger, more practical goal: building robots that can help people with disabilities better tackle everyday tasks. \"If we want to ever enable these kinds of robots, there's a lot of research that has to be done,\" Fox told Business Insider.\u00a0\nLed by renowned CEO Jensen Huang \u2014\u00a0who last year was named the top performing leader by Harvard Business Review \u2014 Nvidia has emerged as a key player in the ballooning artificial intelligence industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                The former Ikea kitchen showroom where Nvidia is testing its robots.\n                                \n                        \n                        \n                        Joe Williams\n                        \n                        \n\n\nLocated near the University of Washington campus, its research lab currently employs 12 research scientists, with a goal to grow to 20. The center also attracts top academic luminaries who are interested in pursuing robotics-based projects (like the University of Washington's Byron Boots, a well known expert in machine learning) and various interns (it had 20 last summer). \n                        \n                      \n\n\n\"The idea is to have a really close collaboration with the academic community,\" Fox said.\u00a0\nAnd Nvidia is not just looking for robotics experts. The lab also has employees skilled in areas like simulation, perception, and computer vision. \"All of these things have to come together if you want to develop these kinds of robotic systems that can interact with people,\" Fox added.\nSuch coordination makes sense when you think about all the different tasks a robot has to process\u00a0when performing a basic function \u2014 things we as humans probably don't even think twice about.\n\n\nSay Nvidia wants to build a robot that can independently move a plate from the cabinet to the table \u2014 a system that the company is currently testing. It might seem simple at first, but the robot must initially locate where the plate is and address potential complexities. Is the cabinet door open? Is it closed? What objects may be blocking the way that prevent it from opening the door?\nThat doesn't even factor in the challenges in getting the robot to then place the plate on a table. Those are all significant hurdles to overcome, and it's why such a broad range of expertise is needed to make the models successful.\u00a0\n\"[With] cool videos of robots doing a certain task, people tend to overgeneralize. They say, 'If the robot can do that, I'm sure it can do all these other things as well.' And that is clearly not the case,\" Fox said.\u00a0\n\n\nFox gave Business Insider an exclusive look into the robots Nvidia is developing to tackle those problems \u2014 and that are paving the way for the kinds of tech that will eventually work alongside humans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThis robot can mimic the actions of a human companion to pick up a block (like the below demo) or a business card, unscrew the lid of a jar of peanuts, or even grab money out of a wallet.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe robot can even twirl the block arounds its fake hand, showing off the dexterity that makes it possible for humans to accomplish so many basic tasks.\n\n\n\u00a0\nWhile still early, the demonstration hints at a potential future where, for example, a manufacturing plant could be outfitted with robotic arms that can be controlled by workers remotely.\nMore demonstrations are available here.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThis robotic arm is able to grasp many common objects, like this bowl or a saucepan.\n\n\nWhile it had difficulty with more obscure shapes \u2014 like a fake banana \u2014 the system begins to tackle a major challenge in perfecting robots: how to make it possible to independently grip the litany of objects humans come into contact with every day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis robot is programmed to also detect shapes on a table and stack them on top of one another almost perfectly.\n\n\nIt's an impressive accomplishment when you think about how difficult is it to teach children to stack blocks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe robots can get \"confused,\" but it only required a quick fix from the skilled Nvidia researchers to restart the system on its quest to stack the blocks.\n\n\nIn this demo, for example, the robot continued to look for the green block despite my valiant attempt to get it to pick up the red block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when one of the researchers interrupted the robot's workflow, it was able to reassess almost immediately and get back on track.\n\n\nWhile there are obviously still technical hurdles to overcome before Nvidia gets much closer to its vision of fully functioning, independent robots, the work they are doing now is a major step toward that goal.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n      subscribers.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: TechRadar)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is about to release a new graphics card, and the net has lit up with speculation on what it might be \u2013 although it seems pretty clear that whatever the incoming GPU actually consists of, it will be a (likely limited edition) Cyberpunk 2077 themed product.In what is clearly a scripted exchange on Twitter, in response to a prompt from the Cyberpunk 2077 devs, Nvidia teased a blurry, smoky picture of some kind of GPU which clearly has the same neon yellow coloring as used on the Cyberpunk 2077 website (and it\u2019s the striking background color of the retail box for the game).Hey @NvidiaGeForce, what do you think about making a limited edition #Cyberpunk2077 GPU?February 16, 2020\ud83d\ude0fStay tuned\u2026 pic.twitter.com/wahUtfw3f6February 16, 2020The mysterious semi-visible card looks to have pretty much the same design as existing GeForce RTX products, and it\u2019s likely a new spin on one of the RTX 20 series \u2013 given that the \u2018stay tuned\u2019 statement, and the fact that we have an actual image (sort of) to go with the teaser, would indicate that it\u2019s fairly close to release (or at least being revealed).GeForce RTX 3080 and 3070 leaked specs seem too good to be trueFind the best Nvidia GPU for youCheck out all the\u00a0best PC games of 2020Many denizens of Twitter (and elsewhere online) leapt to the immediate conclusion that this will be the GeForce RTX 2077, which would be a neat spin combining the title of the game with Nvidia\u2019s product names, and would presumably indicate a version of the RTX 2070 \u2013 perhaps with a bit more pep (so maybe even an RTX 2070 Super-Duper).Or it might just look different, and come bundled with Cyberpunk 2077 (although the game isn\u2019t out until September) plus maybe some extra goodies\u2026RTX 2080 Ti Super?All we have is wild speculation at the moment, of course, but the other prominent theory is that this might herald the launch of the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Super, which has been rumored for a while now, and perhaps needs to be sprung as a pre-emptive measure to counter AMD\u2019s \u2018Nvidia killer\u2019 which is due out later this year. Presumably it could come in normal and Cyberpunk 2077 flavors\u2026If the 2080 Ti Super does indeed exist, the rumor mill has previously pegged it as something of a beast, running with 4,608 CUDA cores and 16Gbps memory bandwidth.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The other possibility churning around the mill currently is that this could even be a next-gen RTX 3000 card, but that seems highly unlikely to us (and that Nvidia would tease its next product line in this way, for that matter). Still, we guess you can never say never, as theoretically this GPU could be anything\u2026About all we can be certain of is the Cyberpunk 2077 tie-in. Nvidia has done this sort of thing in the past, of course \u2013 you may recall the Titan Xp had a very smart-looking Star Wars Collector's Edition.We\u2019ll just have to wait and see what happens in the end, but as we\u2019ve already mentioned, this teaser certainly gives us the impression that we won\u2019t have long to wait. Indeed, perhaps we\u2019ll hear more at the imminent GTC (there have been whispers of consumer products being revealed at Nvidia\u2019s conference in March, even if the focus is more likely to be on heavyweight data center offerings).These are the best graphics cards of 2020Via Wccftech\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianAndroid This article is more than 5 years oldReviewNvidia Shield TV review: the best Android TV box with brilliant AI upscalingThis article is more than 5 years oldNew hide-away design, great remote, top performance and impressive HD to 4K upscaling make for a killer smart TV boxSamuel Gibbs Consumer technology editorWed 26 Feb 2020 07.00 GMTLast modified on Wed 26 Feb 2020 07.04 GMTShareThe Nvidia Shield TV is a refined version of the best Android TV box for years, packed with impressive new AI-based upscaling technology and a novel space-saving design.The new Nvidia Shield TV comes in two versions: a \u00a3149.99 media streamer and a \u201cPro\u201d alternative for \u00a3199 that is aimed more at gaming.For those unfamiliar with these types of media streaming devices, they in effect add a smart TV experience to older televisions or replace the often terrible or out-of-date smart elements of more modern sets, so that you can use apps such as Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer and Netflix.Nvidia is arguably the biggest name in graphics, and also makes mobile chips called Tegra, on which these two Android TV boxes are based. The previous Shield was released in 2015 and, unlike many other smart TVs and streaming boxes, is being kept fresh with a steady stream of updates, making it the best, most supported Android TV experience available either baked into a TV or in a set-top box.The new Shield TV doesn\u2019t mess with the formula. You get one of the most powerful media-streaming boxes available, running the latest version of Android TV and similar long-term software support.User-centric designView image in fullscreenThe triangular remote looks odd at first glance, but works really well and won\u2019t slip around or get lost down the side of the sofa. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianWhat\u2019s new is the form factor. The standard Shield TV is not a box but a small tube with a power cable and ethernet socket in one end and an HDMI socket and microSD card slot in the other. The idea is you hide this small tube behind your TV in series with the cable without taking up any significant space.The remote too has been rethought. Instead of being a thin, touch-sensitive remote, the new version has a triangular profile, takes two standard AAA batteries including rechargeables, has a good weight to it and an assortment of buttons that are backlit when the remote is picked up, including dedicated pause and volume buttons.The shape may seem odd but it\u2019s designed to prevent it slipping down the side or backs of sofas, and it works. A simple, user-friendly design.The remote communicates with the Shield TV via Bluetooth and has an IR blaster in the end for controlling the volume on your TV, amp or soundbar. It works great.Specifications\n\nProcessor: Nvidia Tegra X1+\n\nRAM: 2 or 3GB\n\nStorage: 8 or 16GB + microSD card\n\nConnectivity: wifi ac, Bluetooth 5, gigabit ethernet, HDMI 2.0b (HDCP2.2), 2x USB 3.0 (Pro only)\n\nSoftware: Android TV (Android 9 Pie)\n\nFormat support: up to 4K @ 60Hz, Dolby Vision, HDR10, Dolby Atmos, TrueHD and Digital Plus, DTS-X\n\nDimensions: 40mm diameter, 165mm length or 98 x 159 x 259.3mm\n\nWeight: 137g or 250g\nAndroid TVView image in fullscreenThe Shield TV has is the standard, customisable Android TV interface, without adverts, with a few Nvidia additions for things such as the AI upscaling, GeForce Now game streaming and accessory updates. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianGoogle\u2019s Android TV platform is a fairly simple system based on apps and a customisable carousel layout that highlights content from certain apps. On the Shield TV it\u2019s fast and easy to navigate in a way it often isn\u2019t on smart TVs.Getting around the interface is straightforward with the home, back and up, down, left and right buttons in a ring around the select button. Holding the home button pops up a quick access a list of apps, while double-pressing home takes you to recently used apps like on a smartphone or tablet.Holding the back button brings up quick access to the settings menu, while the menu button in the top right can be customised to launch particular apps, settings or functions. There\u2019s even a dedicated Netflix button for jumping straight in.View image in fullscreenThe tube has an HDMI socket and microSD card slot in one end. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianOne of the biggest advantages Android TV has compared to other systems built into TVs is the wide app support from most of the major UK and US streaming services. Google Play, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, YouTube, BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All 4, My5 and Spotify are available, with the two notable exceptions being BT Sport (although BT TV is available) and the Apple TV app. Plex Media Server support is limited to the Pro model of Shield TV.The apps are routinely updated too, meaning they continue to work, unlike some other platforms, which combined with Nvidia\u2019s long support means you get a streaming box that should stand the test of time.Alongside direct app support, the Shield TV has Chromecast 4K support built in, which means any app that can be cast from your Android or iPhone, tablet or even computer can be sent to your screen wirelessly, which includes BT Sport but not Apple TV.Apps other than TV and video streaming services are also available, including Android games and Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now game-streaming service, which has both paid and free tiers of PC games and works surprisingly well. You\u2019ll need a controller for games, and while Nvidia sells one, you can use any Xbox or PlayStation joypad that supports Bluetooth.Google AssistantView image in fullscreenPress and hold the mic button on the remote to talk to Google Assistant. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianGoogle Assistant is built into Android TV and works like a cross between an Android phone and a smart display such as the Nest Hub Max. Press and hold the mic button on the remote to talk to Assistant.You can control playback in apps, such as playing, pausing or skipping to the next track in Spotify or even a particular time in a song, movie or TV show. You can launch apps, adjust the volume or search for shows, movies or tracks via voice. Ask Assistant to play Lost in Space and it will offer to play it via Netflix or Google Play Movies.Then there are all the standard Assistant functions. Ask it how to get to work and it\u2019ll give you the current state of traffic or transport and a small map. Ask it for the weather and you\u2019ll get the forecast with visual cards. It\u2019ll answer questions, command smart home devices, stream footage from smart cameras and hundreds of other things. The only exception I found was an inability to search for images from the web.Next-generation AI upscalingView image in fullscreenNvidia\u2019s AI-powered HD-to-4K upscaling technology is very impressive, and ideal for dealing with the many shows and movies across the various UK TV catchup services, Netflix, Amazon and Google Play that are still in HD. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Shield TV\u2019s ace in the hole is Nvidia\u2019s new AI upscaling technology, which takes HD content and turns it into 4K with some very impressive results. While practically every TV or set-top box can handle basic upscaling of content \u2013 stretching HD content to fit a 4K screen with four times as many pixels \u2013 Nvidia\u2019s technology is a cut above, particularly when viewing highly detailed scenes.Cityscapes look incredibly crisp and detailed, while faces, cars and even wildlife are all significantly improved even compared to basic upscaling. Feed it a modern HD picture and the differences between it and real 4K content are surprisingly hard to spot. It even makes a decent job of handling something as old as NCIS, Futurama or Knight Rider.Only comparing something such as the faces of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence in Bad Boys in proper 4K versus the HD AI-upscaled version can you begin to spot the differences in closeup scenes or when the original picture was a little grainy in low light.ObservationsView image in fullscreenThe standard figure-of-eight power lead and optional ethernet plug into the other end of the tube. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nYou can play music in the background from Spotify or similar while doing other things.\n\nThe Shield TV can be controlled through Alexa on an Echo smart speaker via the Nvidia Shield TV skill.\n\nThe Shield TV comes with a two-year warranty, but Nvidia doesn\u2019t currently offer a repair, recycling or trade-in programme, ultimately making it disposable.\nPriceThe Nvidia Shield TV costs \u00a3149.99 while the Shield TV Pro costs \u00a3199. The optional Shield Controller costs \u00a359.99.For comparison, Amazon\u2019s Fire TV Stick 4K costs \u00a349.99, Fire TV Cube costs \u00a3109.99, the Google Chromecast Ultra costs \u00a369 and the Apple TV 4K costs \u00a3179.VerdictThe original Nvidia Shield has long been the power user\u2019s Android TV streaming box of choice, and realistically the only one I could recommend. But with its redesign as a hide-away tube and with a new, much more user-friendly and smartly designed remote, the new Shield TV is not only the best streaming box for power users, but one of the very best for regular people too \u2013 right up there with the Apple TV 4K and Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K.On most fronts it beats or matches everything else, be it support for the latest Dolby Atmos, Vision and HDR standards, app support or even the built-in 4K Chromecast support. But it is the impressive AI upscaling that is the killer feature. If you predominantly watch HD content from Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, Google Play or BBC iPlayer et al on your 4K TV then the Shield TV is the box to buy.The only fly in the ointment is a lack of the Apple TV or BT Sport apps in the Google Play Store on Android TV, but at least the latter can be Chromecast to the Shield TV from your phone or tablet. Only the Apple TV 4K has a wider selection of apps than available on Android TV.The Shield TV isn\u2019t cheap, coming in at \u00a3150, but it\u2019s fast and feature-packed, will be supported for a long time and has one of the best remotes you can buy.\nPros: AI upscaling, Android TV, fast, bloat-free, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, long support, space-saving design, excellent remote, built-in 4K Chromecast, Google Assistant, GeForce Now\nCons: fairly expensive, no BT Sport or Apple TV apps\nOther reviews\n\nAmazon Fire TV Cube review: great smart TV box, irritating smart speaker\n\nSky Q 2019 review: premium TV at a premium price\n\nVirgin V6 TV review: jack of all trades, master of none\nExplore more on these topicsAndroidTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldUS politicsUKClimate crisisMiddle EastUkraineEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

We're highly skeptical, for reasons we will discuss in a moment. However, it is fun to speculate as we await the next big GPU from NVIDIA, in what figures to be a busy year overall in the graphics space.\n\n\nWe already covered what we know about Ampere to date, or think we know, based on past rumors and speculations. In short, past leaks indicate NVIDIA will be making a transition to a 7-nanometer manufacturing process, a place AMD is already at with its latest generation Navi GPU architecture, and previous generation Vega. Ampere is also rumored to deliver a big performance uplift over Turing, at half the power cost.\n\n\nWill those things come to pass? It is impossible to know right now, though the previous claims are all the more interesting in light of newer rumors.\nNVIDIA's Next Generation GA100 Ampere GPU Rumored To Be Massive\nLet's get started with it, shall we? Twitter user KittyCorgi (@CorgiKitty) has drawn some attention over a handful of tweets regarding Ampere. The latest one, posted on Friday, claims Ampere will feature a die size of around 826mm2. To put that into perspective, NVIDIA's current generation Turing GPU (12nm) tops out at 754mm2 (TU012), with 18,600 million transistors, AMD's 7nm Navi GPU tops out at 251mm2 (Navi 10), 14nm Vega (Vega 10) is 495mm2, and 7nm\u00a0Vega (Vega 20) is around 331mm2.\n\r\nWhat makes KittyCorgi's claim interesting is not just the raw size, but the notion of NVIDIA unpacking a 7nm GPU that big. If Ampere does end up measuring 826mm2, it seems more likely it would leverage a 12nm manufacturing process instead, which goes against previous rumors. But hey, anything is possible, right?\n\n\n\nSource: KittyCorgi (via Twitter)\n\n\n\nKittyCorgi also posted some diagrams they constructed based on the information they posted. Bear in mind that KittyCorgi is not claiming that these are leaked diagrams, hence why it is easy to spot details that are not consistent with real diagrams that NVIDIA produces.\n\n\nThat said, the supposed leaker makes the following claims about Ampere...\n\n\nINT32 Unit remains unchanged\nDouble the FP32 Unit for shader proportion\nDouble the Tensor Core performance\nEnhanced L1 data cache for more comprehensive functions\n\nThe diagram also points to a more advanced RT core design, which is an easy guess to make\u2014RT cores are what power NVIDIA's real-time ray tracing efforts, and there is every reason to believe we will see both an increase in the number of RT cores and a tweaked design to allow for more performance, when Ampere arrives.\n\n\n\n\nSource: KittyCorgi (via Twitter)\n\n\n\nKittyCorgi posted a couple of block diagrams as well. The one on the left supposedly depicts a GA103 GPU and the one on the right highlights the GA104 GPU. As with the other diagram, these are not leaked slides, but ones KittyCorgi constructed based on the information they are leaking.\n\n\nAccording to KittyCorgi, the higher end GA103 GPU will feature 60 streaming multiprocessors (SMs), 10GB or 20GB of memory, and a 320-bit memory bus. That would give the GPU 3,840 CUDA cores, which is less than the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, though that's assuming NVIDIA sticks with 64 CUDA cores per SM. Being a much denser GPU, according to the information posted, we could be looking at 128 SMs per core, which would give the GA103 GPU 7,680 CUDA cores.\n\n\n\nThe GA104, meanwhile, is said to feature 48 SMs for either 3,072 CUDA cores (64 CUDA cores per SM) or 6,144 CUDA cores (128 CUDA cores per SM), 8GB or 16GB of memory, and a 256-bit memory bus.\nWhy The Latest Leaked Ampere GPU Specifications Are Definitely (Maybe?) Real\nNothing is official until NVIDIA says so, it is simple as that. But if you are looking for reasons why these specifications could be legitimate, it really boils down to Navi. How so? We know AMD is coming out with an upgraded version of Navi later this year, one that will bring performance to the fold, along with support for real-time ray tracing. A custom version of this so called 'Big Navi' will be featured in both Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X game consoles, and AMD confirmed we will see Big Navi in the PC space this year as well.\n\n\nNVIDIA is not one to rest on its laurels. Big Navi could conceivably dethrone the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, which is something the Radeon RX 5700 XT is not able to do. There is a perceived threat to the performance crown, and so Ampere is on tap.\n\n\nPast rumors suggest Ampere will deliver big performance gains, both in rasterized rendering performance and ray-traced workloads. The supposedly leaked specifications would certainly keep NVIDIA in the lead, and probably by a big margin.\nWhy The Latest Leaked Ampere GPU Specifications Are Definitely Hogwash\nWhile it is fun to consider a 7nm GPU with an 826mm2 die size and 20GB of video memory piping data through a 320-bit bus, it all seems...optimistic. That's a tough ask of TSMC (or any chip fab), and we see problems with yields at that density. All of the resulting defective dies means we would be looking at an astronomical price tag for working parts, and quite frankly, we don't see it happening. As in, go ahead and bet the farm against these leaked specs playing out.\n\n\n\nIf this does somehow come to pass, we are almost certainly looking at a server GPU, with consumer variants being less ambitious with better yields and better pricing. Still, our BS meter is ringing with this one. [EDIT: To be fair, KittyCorgi made the 826mm2 die size claim in regards to the GA100 GPU, which would be a server-bound chip rumored to have a 6,144-bit memory bus.]\n\n\n\nThere's also the source to consider. KittyCorgi has only been on Twitter for a month and has not built up a reputation as a leaker. So what this all boils down to is a fantastic claim by an unknown person with home-grown block diagrams.\n\n\nWe have little doubt Ampere will bring the boom, we just don't think the leaked specifications are going to play out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, GPU, (nasdaq:nvda), ampere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

Driver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Fixes High Severity Flaw in Windows GPU Display Driver\n\n\n                            By Sergiu Gatlan\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 28, 2020\n03:17 PM\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA has released a GPU display driver security update today, February 28, 2020, that fixes high and medium severity vulnerabilities that might lead to code execution, local escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and denial of service on unpatched Windows computers.\nAll GPU display driver security flaws patched today by NVIDIA require local user access which means that attackers will not be able to exploit them remotely but, instead, will need to first get a foothold on the system to execute exploit code targeting one the fixed bugs.\nWhile these security flaws require would-be attackers to have local user access, they can also be abused via malicious tools remotely dropped on systems running vulnerable NVIDIA GPU display drivers.\nToday's security updates also fix one high severity and two medium severity flaws in the NVIDIA Virtual GPU Manager and the NVIDIA vGPU graphics driver for guest OS that could lead to denial of service states when triggered.\nWindows driver security issues\nThe two GPU display driver issues come with CVSS V3 base scores ranging from 6.7 to 8.4 and impact Windows machines, while the three NVIDIA vGPU software bugs have severity ratings between 5.5 and 7.8.\nBy abusing these security issues, attackers can easily escalate their privileges without needing user interaction to gain permissions above the ones initially granted by the compromised systems.\nThe bugs could also allow them to render unpatched machines temporarily unusable by triggering denial of service states, to execute malicious code, or to access sensitive information on targeted systems.\nThe software security issues fixed by NVIDIA as part of the February 2020 security update are listed in the table below, with full descriptions and CVSS V3 base scores.\n\nCVEs for NVIDIA GPU Display Driver\nCVE\nDescription\nBase Score\nCVE\u20112020\u20115957\nNVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the NVIDIA Control Panel component in which an attacker with local system access can corrupt a system file, which may lead to denial of service or escalation of privileges.\n8.4\nCVE\u20112020\u20115958\nNVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the NVIDIA Control Panel component in which an attacker with local system access can plant a malicious DLL file, which may lead to code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.\n6.7\nCVEs for NVIDIA vGPU Software\nCVE\nDescription\nBase Score\nCVE\u20112020\u20115959\nNVIDIA Virtual GPU Manager contains a vulnerability in the vGPU plugin, in which an input index value is incorrectly validated, which may lead to denial of service.\n7.8\nCVE\u20112020\u20115960\nNVIDIA Virtual GPU Manager contains a vulnerability in the kernel module (nvidia.ko), where a null pointer dereference may occur, which may lead to denial of service.\n6.5\nCVE\u20112020\u20115961\nNVIDIA vGPU graphics driver for guest OS contains a vulnerability in which an incorrect resource clean up on a failure path can impact the guest VM, leading to denial of service.\n5.5\n\nAccording to NVIDIA's security bulletin published today, the \"risk assessment is based on an average of risk across a diverse set of installed systems and may not represent the true risk of your local installation.\"\nHowever, as the advisory adds, \"NVIDIA recommends consulting a security or IT professional to evaluate the risk to your specific configuration.\"\nThe high severity CVE\u20112020\u20115957 flaw affecting the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver which may lead to denial of service or escalation of privileges was reported by Zhiniang Peng of Qihoo 360 Core Security and Xuefeng Li.\nImpacted GPU driver versions\nToday's NVIDIA GPU Display Driver - February 2019 security bulletin also lists the affected and patched GPU display driver versions:\n\nCVE\nSoftware

R440 versions\nAvailable the week of March 9, 2020\nAll R418 versions prior to 426.50\n426.5\n\nNVIDIA says that some users who will not patch the flaws manually may also receive the Windows GPU display driver 442.05 and 436.73 versions containing today's security updates from their computer hardware vendors.\n\"The table above may not be a comprehensive list of all affected versions or branch releases and may be updated as more information becomes available,\" NVIDIA adds.\n\"Earlier software branch releases that support these products are also affected. If you are using an earlier branch release, upgrade to the latest branch release.\"\nNVIDIA advises all customers to patch their GeForce, Quadro, NVS, and Tesla Windows GPU display drivers by applying the security update available on the NVIDIA Driver Downloads page.\nEnterprise NVIDIA vGPU software users will have to log into the  NVIDIA Enterprise Application Hub to get the updates from the NVIDIA Licensing Center.\nTo find out which NVIDIA display driver version you currently have installed on your computer you can follow the detailed procedure detailed here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\u00a9 Techniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft patches Windows Kernel zero-day exploited since 2023Microsoft March 2025 Patch Tuesday fixes 7 zero-days, 57 flawsCISA tags Windows, Cisco vulnerabilities as actively exploitedMicrosoft reminds admins to prepare for WSUS driver sync deprecationMicrosoft February 2025 Patch Tuesday fixes 4 zero-days, 55 flaws\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Execution\nDriver\nGPU\nNVIDIA\nPrivilege Escalation\nSecurity Update\nWindows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSergiu Gatlan   \n              Sergiu is a news reporter who has covered the latest cybersecurity and technology developments for over a decade.

The announcement comes just a couple of weeks after Nvidia first opened the service up to the general public.\nThose user numbers were no doubt helped by the presence of GeForce Now's free service tier, which limits rendering quality and restricts play sessions to a single hour. Subscribers for the paid version of the service are also currently inside a free 90-day \"introductory period\"\u2014it's unclear how many of those trial users will continue to pay $5 a month once it expires.\nThose caveats aside, the quick trip to a million users represents a strong start for Nvidia's entry into an increasingly crowded streaming gaming field. For context, Sony reported a million subscribers for its $60/year PlayStation Now streaming service as of last November, almost five years after it launched. Google hasn't discussed user numbers for Stadia, but there are some early signs that not many early adopters are even making use of the platform's free games (though the company did have trouble satisfying all its initial pre-orders late last year).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Now's wider launch comes after a lengthy closed beta period where the company says 300,000 users logged over 70 million streaming hours on the service. GeForce Now currently supports hundreds of games across Steam, Epic Games Store, EA's Origin, and Ubisoft's uPlay, all of which can be purchased individually and played via traditional download or remote streaming. Nvidia says there are already 1,500 additional games publishers have submitted to an \"onboarding queue\" for addition to the service in the future.\nActivision Blizzard abruptly removed its titles from GeForce Now last week. Nvidia later took the blame for that state of affairs, saying it was due to a \"misunderstanding\" over the length of a beta partnership agreement. \"Recognizing the misunderstanding, we removed [Activision Blizzard]'s games from our service, with hope we can work with them to re-enable these, and more, in the future,\" Nvidia said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            RIP Stadia?

In this follow-up review, I\u2019m going to take a look at a GPU I didn\u2019t include first time around: Nvidia\u2019s current top-of-the-range consumer card, the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti.\nAs well as seeing how the RTX 2080 Ti performs with a representative range of DCC applications, I will be testing how far Nvidia\u2019s RTX hardware can accelerate GPU rendering, and attempting to answer a couple of questions that readers posed in response to the previous review: how important is memory capacity when choosing a GPU for production work, and how important is it to use Nvidia\u2019s Studio GPU drivers?\nFor comparison, I will be re-testing the other consumer and prosumer cards from the original review: the current-generation Titan RTX and GeForce RTX 2080, and the previous-generation GeForce GTX 1080 and GeForce GTX 1070. I haven\u2019t included the Titan V this time around, since my original tests showed that the Titan RTX was both cheaper and better for DCC work; and I hope to return to Nvidia\u2019s workstation graphics cards, the Quadro RTX series, in a future review.\nUnfortunately, I haven\u2019t been able to test Nvidia\u2019s low-end or mid-range GeForce RTX cards, the GeForce RTX 2060 and 2070 and their Super variants. However, I have included a popular synthetic benchmark, 3DMark, as part of my tests, so you should be able to get some idea of how they would have performed by comparing my results to the other 3DMark scores available online.\n\nJump to another part of this review\nTechnology focus: GPU architectures and APIs\nSpecifications and prices\nTesting procedure\nBenchmark results\nAnalysis: GPU rendering and GPU memory\nAnalysis: Studio versus Game Ready drivers\nVerdict\n\n\nTechnology focus: GPU architectures and APIs\nBefore I discuss the cards on test, here\u2019s a quick recap of some of the technical terms I touched on in the previous review. If you\u2019re already familiar with them, you may want to skip ahead.\nNvidia\u2019s current-generation Turing GPU architecture features three types of processor cores: CUDA cores, designed for general GPU computing; Tensor cores, designed for machine learning operations; and RT cores, new in the RTX cards, and intended to accelerate ray tracing calculations.\nIn order to take advantage of the RT cores, software applications have to access them through a graphics API: in the case of the applications featured in this review, either DXR (DirectX Raytracing), used in Unreal Engine, or Nvidia\u2019s own OptiX API, used by the majority of the offline renderers.\nIn most of those renderers, the OptiX rendering backend is provided as an alternative to an older backend based on Nvidia\u2019s CUDA API. The CUDA backends work with a wider range of Nvidia GPUs, but OptiX enables ray tracing accelerated by the RTX cards\u2019 RT cores, often described simply as \u2018RTX acceleration\u2019.\n\n\n\n\nSpecifications and prices\nAlthough a number of manufacturers produce their own variants of the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, for the purposes of this review, I used one of Nvidia\u2019s own Founders Edition cards.\nIf you discount the Titan RTX, which occupies a halfway house between traditional gaming and workstation cards, it\u2019s Nvidia\u2019s current top-of-the-range consumer GPU.\nIn fact, the 2080 Ti and the Titan RTX have similar specs. Both use Nvidia\u2019s Tu102 GPU with the same base clock speed of 1,350 MHz, although the Titan has a higher boost clock speed: 1,770MHz, as opposed to 1,545MHz, or 1,635MHz overclocked. The Titan\u2019s Tu102 is also fully unlocked, with 4,608 CUDA cores, 576 Tensor cores and 72 RT cores, whereas the 2080 Ti\u2019s slightly nerfed version has 4,352 CUDA cores, 544 Tensor cores and 68 RT cores. \nThe biggest difference between the cards is the amount of onboard GDDR6 RAM they carry. The 2080 Ti has 11GB of RAM; at 24GB, the Titan has more than double that. Price varies by a similar margin: the 2080 Ti tested has a current street price of around $1,200; the Titan of around $2,500.\nYou can see the specs for the other cards tested here, the GeForce RTX 2080, GeForce GTX 1080 and GeForce GTX 1070, in the table below, and read more about their pros and cons in the original group test.\n\n\n\n\nTesting procedure\nAs with the previous group test, the test system for this review was a BOXX Technologies APEXX T3 workstation sporting an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX CPU, 128GB of 2666MHz DDR4 RAM, a 512GB Samsung 970 Pro M.2 NVMe SSD, and a 1000W power supply. \nTesting was done using a subset of the applications used in the group test, in some cases updated to the current versions of the software.  The benchmarks were run on Windows 10 Pro for Workstations, and were broken into four categories:\nViewport and editing performance\n3ds Max 2020, Blender 2.81, Maya 2020, Modo 13.0v1, SolidWorks 2020, Substance Painter 2019, Unreal Engine 4.24\nRendering\nBlender 2.81 (using Cycles), Cinema 4D R20 (using Radeon ProRender), KeyShot 9, Maverick Studio Build 410, OctaneRender 2019 (using OctaneBench), Redshift 3.0.13 (beta) for 3ds Max, SolidWorks 2020 Visualize, V-Ray Next (V-Ray 4.3 for 3ds Max, using V-Ray GPU)\nOther benchmarks\nMetashape 1.5.1, Premiere Pro CC 2019 (video encoding), Substance Alchemist 2019, Unreal Engine 4.24 (VR performance)\nSynthetic benchmarks\n3DMark\nIn the viewport and editing benchmarks, the frame rate scores represent the figures attained when manipulating the 3D assets shown, averaged over five testing sessions to eliminate inconsistencies. In all of the rendering benchmarks, the CPU was disabled, so only the GPU was used for computing.  Testing was performed on a single 32\u201d 4K display, running its native resolution of 3,840 x 2,160px at 60Hz.\n\n\nBenchmark results\nViewport and editing performance\nThe viewport benchmarks include many of the key DCC applications \u2013 both general-purpose 3D software like 3ds Max, Blender and Maya, and more specialist tools like Substance Painter \u2013 plus CAD package SolidWorks and game engine Unreal Engine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, the Titan RTX takes the first place in all of the tests with the RTX 2080 Ti coming in a very close second, except in the SolidWorks benchmark, where the Titan has a commanding lead. The RTX 2080 takes third place in all of the tests, followed by the GTX 1080 and the GTX 1070.\nRendering\nI\u2019ve divided the rendering benchmarks into two groups. The first set of applications either don\u2019t use OptiX for ray tracing, or don\u2019t make it possible to turn the OptiX backend on and off, so it isn\u2019t possible to assess the impact of RTX acceleration on performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the second set of applications, it is possible to render with OptiX enabled or using CUDA alone, making it possible to measure the increase in performance when RTX acceleration is enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU rendering performance follows a similar pattern to viewport performance: the Titan RTX takes first place in all of the tests, although the RTX 2080 Ti follows it pretty closely. The RTX 2080 takes third place in all of the tests, followed by the GTX 1080 and GTX 1070.\nWhat is interesting to see is how performance increases when OptiX is enabled, and the software can offload ray tracing calculations to the RT cores of the RTX cards. In Redshift, the impact is relatively small \u2013 although bear in mind that version 3.0 is still in early access \u2013 but in the V-Ray benchmark, performance increases by 33-35%, and in the Blender benchmark, by 85-105%.\nOther benchmarks\nThe next set of benchmarks are designed to test the use of the GPU for more specialist tasks. Photogrammetry application Metashape uses the GPU for image processing, Substance Alchemist uses the GPU for texture baking and to run certain filters, and Premiere Pro uses the GPU for video encoding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with the previous benchmarks, the Titan RTX takes first place in all of the tests, followed by the RTX 2080 Ti, RTX 2080, GTX 1080 and GTX 1070. The variation in performance is smallest with Premiere Pro, and largest with Substance Alchemist.\nSynthetic benchmarks\nFinally, we have the synthetic benchmark 3DMark. Synthetic benchmarks don\u2019t accurately predict how a GPU will perform in production, but they do provide a way to compare the cards on test with older models, since scores for a wide range of GPUs are available online. Unlike previous reviews, I haven\u2019t included Cinebench here, since the last version to feature a GPU benchmark is now over six years old.\n\n\n\n\nFurther analysis\nGPU rendering and GPU memory\nLooking at the GPU rendering benchmarks, you might wonder why anyone would spend $2,500 on a Titan RTX, when the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti performs almost as well, for less than half the price. The answer is its memory capacity. To illustrate why the Titan \u2013 or other GPUs with a lot of graphics memory \u2013 can be worth the cost for DCC professionals, I set up a few particularly complex scenes. To measure GPU memory usage during benchmarking, I used the hardware monitor in EVGA\u2019s Precision X1 utility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a GPU doesn\u2019t have enough graphics memory for a computational task, it has to send data out to system RAM. In GPU renderers, this is known as out-of-core rendering. As you can see from the results above, this is much slower than accessing on-board memory, and much less reliable. \nIn the V-Ray trolls scene, the Titan RTX \u2013 in which the entire scene fits into on-board memory \u2013 performs much better than the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, while the GeForce RTX 2080 won\u2019t render the scene at all. Neither the 2080 nor the 2080 Ti will render the other two scenes, crashing every time in the V-Ray architectural scene, and quitting with out-of-memory errors in the Arnold for Maya scene.\nPart of the problem for the GeForce RTX cards is that they have to use significant portions of their graphics memory to display content on screen, reducing the memory available for rendering. There is a solution to this: to put two GPUs into your workstation. Most GPU rendering applications allow you to specify manually which GPU will be used for compute tasks, so if you disable the GPU that is used for display purposes, the application will fall back to the compute GPU, which will have all of its memory available for rendering. \nTo test this, I ran the three high-memory usage benchmarks again in dual-GPU setups, using the Titan RTX for display purposes only, and the RTX 2080 or RTX 2080 Ti for rendering.\n\n\n\nThis time, things are a little different. Freed from their display duties, both the 2080 Ti and the 2080 can render the V-Ray trolls scene. The 2080 has to go out of core, which slows it down quite a bit, but the 2080 Ti comes quite close to the performance of the Titan. The results are similar in the Arnold for Maya scene, although the V-Ray architectural scene still won\u2019t render on either GeForce card.\nSo if the price tag of the Titan RTX makes you uneasy, one alternative would be to buy two RTX 2080 Ti cards. However, it isn\u2019t clear whether GeForce RTX GPUs can make use of Nvidia\u2019s NVLink technology to pool GPU memory in the same way as the Titan RTX and Quadro RTX cards (you can find a detailed analysis in this article). If not, even with some of its 24GB of graphics memory being used for display duties, a single Titan RTX would still be more versatile than a dual-2080 Ti setup, in which only the 11GB of graphics memory on the dedicated compute card would be available for GPU rendering.\n\nStudio versus Game Ready drivers\nAnother thing that I have been asked recently is whether Nvidia\u2019s Studio drivers provide any advantage over its Game Ready drivers for DCC work. To test this, I ran every benchmark in this review on the RTX 2080 Ti with version 441.66 of the Studio driver and version 441.66 of the Game Ready driver, using Wagnardsoft\u2019s Display Driver Uninstaller utility to make sure I had a clean install when switching from one to the other.\n\n\n\nAs you can see from selection of results above, choice of driver had no practical impact on performance. I did some more research and it seems that the intent of the Studio drivers is really to improve stability when using DCC applications, not performance. However, I\u2019ve been using GeForce GPUs with DCC software for a long time now, and have never had any real problems with stability, so if you are currently using the Game Ready drivers and everything is running fine for you, my advice would be to stick with them.\n\nVerdict\nSo what lessons can you take away from this review? First, that the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti is a very powerful GPU for DCC work. Unless the tasks you are throwing at it require more than 11GB of graphics memory, it comes very close to the performance of the Titan RTX, for less than half the cost. \nSecond, the Turing GPUs in general offer significant performance boosts for GPU renderers that can make use of their dedicated ray tracing hardware. And finally, Nvidia\u2019s Studio drivers have little impact on the performance of DCC applications. They don\u2019t hurt performance either, and they may improve stability, so there\u2019s no reason not to use them: just don\u2019t expect to see a major increase in speed.\nLastly, I just wanted to say thanks for taking the time to stop by here. I hope this information has been helpful and informative.

Starting out as GeForce GRID for the controller-shaped SHIELD Portable, the service has morphed over the years in scope and technology. The most recent iteration, GeForce NOW, a multi-platform service, was launched in beta back at the start of 2018. And now, a bit over two years later, NVIDIA is finally taking the service out of beta and is formally launching the commercial GeForce NOW service.\nTrying out a number of different strategies over the years in various retoolings, NVIDIA has ultimately settled on an interesting, and for the moment at least, quite unique service offering for their game streaming service. Rather than going with a hybrid subscription model where customers would subscribe to a service, get some games, and get the option of buying more games on that service (ala Google Stadia or Playstation Now), NVIDIA has instead focused purely on providing the infrastructure and streaming services, but not the games. The net result is that GeForce NOW runs on a bring-your-own-games model, where NVIDIA rents out what\u2019s essentially a virtual machine instance on their servers, and gamers can use their Steam/Uplay/Battle.Net/Epic accounts to play games they already own.\nNVIDIA has been offering this modern version of the service since early 2018 in the form of a free, waitlisted beta, slowly testing the platform while building up both the number of games and the number of platforms the client is available on. As of today that beta is finally coming to an end, and the service is rolling out in commercial form. Besides the obvious changes of removing the waitlists and charging for it, the shift from a beta to a paid offering won\u2019t radically change the service, but NVIDIA is using the launch to make a few tweaks\n\nFirst and foremost, of course, is pricing. Surprisingly, NVIDIA is actually keeping around a free tier of the service \u2013 albeit with some restrictions \u2013 so there will be two tiers of service. The paid \u201cFounders\u201d tier is the full package, and includes access to NVIDIA\u2019s new RTX servers. Notably there is a maximum session limit of 6 hours, but this seems to be focused more on preventing someone from leaving an instance running all day long with an unattended game than it is about discouraging heavy users.\nFor now, NVIDIA is seems a bit unsure about where to price the service at. The company is charging $4.99/month for the first 12 months, and to further sweeten the deal, the first three months are free. According to NVIDIA this is a limited time offer, implying that they\u2019re going to be charging more than $4.99/month for regular (Premium) pricing later on, but they don\u2019t seem to know what to charge for the service; so I imagine the subscription numbers they see over the next 12 months will help to decide that. At any rate, the company is launching with the capacity to support 600K simultaneous users, and depending on how the paid service goes, NVIDIA has a definite ambition to further expand that.\nMeanwhile, NVIDIA is also keeping a free tier, albeit with much greater restrictions. The free tier has a maximum session length of just 1 hour, and of course, it\u2019s first-come first-serve with free tier users sharing any leftover slots that aren\u2019t already occupied by paying users. Free tier users also won\u2019t have access to RTX features, though I\u2019m curious how much of this is going to be software segmentation (i.e. turning them off), and how much of this is using their older Pascal-based servers for the free tier. At any rate, it\u2019s a bit of a surprise to see the free tier offered even with these restrictions; because NVIDIA offers free-to-play games on GeForce NOW (including the uber popular Fortnite), it\u2019ll be possible to use GeForce NOW without paying a dime for the service or for a game.\nOtherwise, it\u2019s worth noting that NVIDIA is being much more conservative about resolutions here. 4K streaming isn\u2019t available for GeForce NOW, even on the paid tier. Instead the service tops out at 1080p60, with NVIDIA recommending a 50Mbps connection for best results. Some of this is going to be due to what the service is running under the hood (more on that in a second), and part of it is for pragmatic reasons: NVIDIA wants to put their best foot forward. And that means emphasizing image quality and things like ray tracing over a higher resolution.\n\nOverall, NVIDIA is promising GeForce RTX 2080-like performance, which would be potent, but would fall short of being able to drive 4K at 60fps in a number of games. So rather than delivering 4K at uneven framerates \u2013 an issue that has been widely noted with some games on Google\u2019s Stadia \u2013 NVIDIA is keeping things within the realm of what an RTX 2080 can do well.\nUnder the hood, NVIDIA is, as always, running GeForce NOW on top of Tesla video cards (Digital Foundry spotted both a P40 and a 16GB Tesla T10). For today\u2019s launch the company has upgraded a number of servers to use the newer Turing-based Tesla cards, so today also marks the launch of the first RTX-capable instances on the service. As for how that hardware is being allocated, depending on the game, NVIDIA is either giving a user a whole GPU, or time slicing between two or four users. The most demanding games \u2013 mainly those using RTX effects \u2013 will get a whole GPU, while other games will get shared instances.\n\nAs for the available platforms, NVIDIA is launching with the same platforms as in the previous beta. This means the GeForce NOW client is available for Windows, macOS, and Android (including of course, NVIDIA\u2019s own SHIELD). The company is also announcing that they\u2019ll be bringing the client to Chromebooks, but that client isn\u2019t ready quite yet.\n\nThe service availability is also largely unchanged from the beta. NVIDIA is running their own server clusters in North America and Western Europe, with nine sites in North America and six in Europe to try to keep latency down. Meanwhile NVIDIA has partnered with local service providers in Russia, Japan, and South Korea, who are offering their own services using the GeForce NOW technology.\n\nAll told, NVIDIA is launching the service with support for \u201c1000+\u201d games. Which is a lot of games, but admittedly a fraction of what\u2019s available via the various gaming stores out there. Besides testing and certifying games to work well on the service, the other limiting factor here appears to be licensing. NVIDIA of course is going to be quite mum on the latter, but even though they aren\u2019t operating a game store of their own, they still need to operate within the good graces of the publishers. Which for now, at least, doesn\u2019t include EA or Rockstar.\nOverall then, NVIDIA is launching their game streaming platform at an interesting time for the industry. While NVIDIA has been developing this platform for the better part of a decade, in many ways they find themselves in the unusual position of being the underdog. Google\u2019s Stadia may be the new kid on the block, but backed by Google enormous muscle, it\u2019s arguably the frontrunner by being the most visible. Meanwhile Sony already has their own service, and Microsoft is ramping up their service as well. Oh, and there\u2019s the small bit about convincing gamers that streaming games \u2013 with all of the inherent latency \u2013 is still going to be a good way to play games.\nFor NVIDIA then, GeForce NOW is a long time coming, but it\u2019s definitely also a bit of gamble. So expect to see NVIDIA try to capitalize on their strengths here, both with regards to their hardware and the PC gaming platform. Even though they\u2019re not the only PC game streaming service, NVIDIA is already the biggest and best invested, and their BYOG model is a very distinctive factor at a time when gamers are worried about game ownership. Coupled with their current GPU feature advantage, NVIDIA will certainly be able to put up a fight for the nascent game streaming market.\nGallery: GeForce NOW Launch Deck\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n33 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nliquidh20 - Tuesday, February 4, 2020 - link\nNot working, does not allow you join. Tried two different PC's and three browsers. Not a good sign for the service...\n\n\n\nAlistair - Tuesday, February 4, 2020 - link\nI def. like the bring your own games model. Stadia's idea was silly, buy $80 games that you can't use anywhere else.1080p won't fly though, I'm honestly not interested in game streaming until it hits 1440p.\n\n\n\nTEAMSWITCHER - Tuesday, February 4, 2020 - link\nSo... the resolution of a 2009 Apple iMac is where you draw the line?\n\n\n\nsurt - Tuesday, February 4, 2020 - link\nIn fairness, it's easily the most popular gaming resolution today.\n\n\n\nfrenchy_2001 - Friday, February 7, 2020 - link\nThe steam survey says \"hi\" and disagrees:https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hard...66%+ have a main monitor resolution of 1080p.\n\n\n\nreuthermonkey1 - Tuesday, February 4, 2020 - link\nGreat point about this free service. Definitely doomed.No doubt the signup database is pulling double-duty hosting the gaming servers as well./sIt definitely let me join btw. Standard day-1-signup-woes that affect just about everything in the gaming industry.\n\n\n\nPeachNCream - Tuesday, February 4, 2020 - link\nI'd like to see game streaming service get off the ground.  Latency IS an issue and will continue to make reflex-based games a challenge and reflex-based games involving competition with other players a likely non-starter where competitive people are concerned, but the potential to replace local, relatively expensive gaming systems is certainly a possibility.  I'm particularly happpyto see companies other than Google making an effort to compete because the idea of handing the Mothership even more of my personal data for them to store and mine is disturbing enough to move me toward inferior, more expensive competition just to keep Google's filthy grabby paws off my digital private bits. \n\n\n\nTEAMSWITCHER - Tuesday, February 4, 2020 - link\nI just logged into my free account and Tried Doom 2016, Overwatch, and Portal 2.  Playing on a 15\" 2014 MacBook Pro is not altogether bad - there is a slight mouse lag.  I like the fact that you do not have to install your games taking up precious disk space on a laptop.  But mobile gaming is likely going to be hampered by the internet connection you get ... which is never going to be great.  I don't think this is worth $60 to play all my games on the go.\n\n\n\nsurt - Tuesday, February 4, 2020 - link\nThis kind of service might make sense in 3rd world markets where the price of gaming hardware is prohibitive.  But in USA/Europe this makes no sense at all.  People are spending upwards of $1k on their phones in these markets.The latency and latency compensating techniques (e.g. predictive button pressing) will kill interest in this, particularly once the gaming companies start banning for cheating any service with predictives enabled.\n\n\n\nRetycint - Wednesday, February 5, 2020 - link\nI could see this being an attractive option for someone that only plays games with their desktop. So instead of spending $800 for mid range performance or $1600 for high end performance that is wasted outside of gaming, they could spend $60 per year for RTX2080 performance instead. Definitely not a bad option for single player gaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Two of the top contenders for the best graphics card right now are AMD's Radeon RX 5700 XT and Nvidia's GeForce RTX 2060 Super. They're not the fastest GPUs around\u2014or at least, Nvidia's GPU isn't the company's fastest option, as the RTX 2070 through RTX 2080 Ti are all faster\u2014but they're two of the best overall values. Both cards are available for around $400, representing the lower portion of the high-end GPU market, and we're here to declare a winner.Both the RTX 2060 Super and RX 5700 XT were introduced in the summer of 2019. AMD's card features a Navi 10 GPU with a new RDNA architecture, while Nvidia's card is effectively a refresh of 2018's RTX 2070\u2014the same TU106 GPU with slightly fewer CUDA cores enabled, but with a lower price that makes it the better bargain. $400 is an important price point as well, as going higher up the performance ladder typically brings diminishing returns. You can get great performance at 1440p with high settings, or 1080p ultra, without blowing up your build budget. Similar previous-generation cards like the GTX 970, GTX 1070, R9 390 and RX Vega 56 have all sold well.\u00a0You can also step down one rung and look at the Radeon RX 5700 and GeForce RTX 2060, or the Radeon RX 5600 XT if you\u2019re going to stick to 1080p ultra or 1440p medium settings. As for stepping up, the only faster card from AMD right now is the Radeon VII, which is expensive, power hungry and not actually much faster than the RX 5700 XT. If you want something more potent, you'll need to either wait for AMD to release its next-gen Navi 20/21 GPUs \u2014 which are supposed to include hardware ray tracing functionality as well \u2014 or look at Nvidia's more expensive RTX models. Right now AMD has nothing that can beat the RTX 2070 Super and above.But let's get back on topic. Which card is actually better, the RTX 2060 Super or the RX 5700 XT? We've put the reference models from both companies against each other in this head-to-heat battle. We'll look at features and specifications, drivers and software, performance in games, power and thermals, and finally overall value. Cue the high noon music as the rivals prepare to draw.Featured Technology\u00a0AMD's Radeon RX 5700 XT is the current halo product for the company, using the fully-enabled Navi 10 XT GPU and sporting 2560 processing cores. The reference model has a game clock of 1755 MHz, with a maximum boost clock of 1905 MHz, and factory overclocked cards typically increase the game clock to around 1815 MHz (give or take). Nvidia's GeForce RTX 2060 Super uses the TU106-410-A1 GPU, with 2176 CUDA cores and a conservative boost clock of 1650 MHz. It also includes 34 RT cores for ray tracing calculations and 272 Tensor cores for deep learning computations (ie, DLSS).\u00a01.

Still, on paper the RX 5700 XT has 9.0 TFLOPS and 448 GBps of bandwidth going up against the RTX 2060 Super's 7.2 TFLOPS and 448 GBps. That's a 25 percent advantage for AMD, but (spoiler!) it almost never shows up to that level in games.AMD's RX 5700 XT is also the first 'real' 7nm GPU\u2014we don't really count the Radeon VII, since it was late to the party, based around an old architecture, and overall couldn't match Nvidia's existing cards. TSMC's 7nm finFET process allows AMD to stuff approximately 10.3 billion transistors into the Navi 10 die that measures just 251 mm2.\u00a0Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.In contrast, the RTX 2060 Super uses TSMC's older 12nm finFET process. It only has a 'few' more transistors,10.8 billion (that\u2019s a half billion, but not a big difference percentage-wise), but the die size is 445 mm2. That's a 77% larger die, again for only 5% more transistors\u2014not that die size or process technology matter to the end user, but they can affect power use, cost and even performance.On the memory side of things, both GPUs feature 8GB of GDDR6 RAM clocked at 14 Gbps on a 256-bit bus, giving them the same bandwidth. That doesn't mean the memory subsystems of the GPUs are the same, however. Both companies use various forms of lossless delta color compression to extract more performance from the memory. Details are somewhat limited, though Nvidia's GPUs seem to either compress data better or simply extract more performance from the same memory bandwidth in other ways.The bigger difference between the GPUs is in support for rendering features, specifically DirectX Raytracing (DXR) and Vulkan-RT. How important is ray tracing in games? Right now, there are only a small number of supported titles, and the ray tracing effects are often relatively small.\u00a0Here's the complete list of ray tracing games that were available when we wrote this: Battlefield V, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Control, Deliver Us the Moon, Metro Exodus, Quake II RTX, Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Wolfenstein: Youngblood. That's eight games, and another eight should launch in 2020 (Cyberpunk 2077, Doom Eternal, Dying Light 2, MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries, Minecraft RTX, Synced: Off-Planet, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 and Watch Dogs: Legion). The problem is that so far, we'd only rate the ray tracing effects as truly desirable in Control and maybe Deliver Us the Moon\u2014and even then the performance hit can be large.That's why Nvidia also has deep learning super-sample (DLSS) technology, which uses machine learning and massive amounts of training on Nvidia's supercomputers to allow games to render at a lower resolution and then upscale with anti-aliasing detection and removal. DLSS works okay but it's not perfect. It's also very useful if you're not using the RTX 2080 Ti and playing titles with ray tracing at 1080p.The two competitors also offer adaptive refresh rate technology: AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync. Nvidia has an advantage now, as it has started to support select 'compatible' adaptive sync displays (aka, FreeSync but without the AMD branding), whereas AMD only works with FreeSync/Adaptive Sync monitors. Nvidia says it has tested hundreds of FreeSync displays, 90 of which are now 'G-Sync Compatible'\u2014including LG's latest OLED 120Hz TVs. Also, Nvidia has added HDMI 2.1 VRR (variable refresh rate) support to its RTX series cards.Ultimately, despite AMD having an advantage in manufacturing technology, Nvidia's hardware features win out. You may not love the way ray tracing effects look in every game, or the potential performance impact, but at least you have the option to turn them on and try them out. Plus you have the choice between G-Sync and FreeSync / G-Sync Compatible displays.Winner: NvidiaImage 1 of 3(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)2. Drivers and SoftwareBoth AMD and Nvidia offer full suites of drivers and software. To put things in perspective, the driver download size currently tips the scale at 529 MB for Nvidia and 482 MB for AMD. That's nearly as large as the entirety of Windows XP, just for your GPU drivers and associated software.AMD's latest Radeon Adrenalin 2020 drivers added a bunch of new features: integer scaling, Game Boost, and a completely revamped UI. AMD claims performance is \"up to 12% better\" relative to its Adrenalin 2019 drivers, though having tested both it's usually not that big of a jump. There are loads of pre-existing features as well, like Radeon Anti-Lag, Radeon Image Sharpening, Radeon Chill, Enhanced Sync, and the ability to record or stream your gaming sessions. It's almost too much to dig through, but AMD basically gives you everything you need in one package, including the ability to tweak and overclock your graphics card.The latest Nvidia 442.19 drivers don't have any major new highlights to discuss, but like AMD the company has been adding features and enhancements for years. Integer scaling is available (on Turing GPUs), and you can adjust 3D settings and video enhancements. But a lot of the extras are within GeForce Experience. That's where you'll find ShadowPlay for streaming and recording your gameplay, hear about driver updates, get recommended settings profiles for most major games, and there's the in-game overlay that allows you to apply filters\u2014including sharpening, select ReShade filters, and more.\u00a0There's also no overclocking support built into Nvidia's drivers, but it's not a major loss. Tools like MSI Afterburner and EVGA Precision X1 are readily available for those that want to tinker, and are arguably better than anything AMD or Nvidia are likely to build into their drivers.We prefer AMD's unified approach, but there's something else we like about AMD's drivers. Generally speaking, the software and drivers discussion ends up being nitpicky. However, there's one thing that I've come to despise about GeForce Experience: The required login and captcha to make things work. We upgrade GPU drivers more frequently than most users, and with a constant stream of new GPUs to test we're more aware of login requirements and captchas than most. Still, it's extremely annoying how frequently GeForce Experience seems to forget login credentials. Please, just make all of that go away, or at least make it optional. We've been data mined enough, thanks.Frequency and quality of driver updates is a bit harder to quantify. Both companies put out new drivers on a regular basis\u2014AMD had 33 releases in 2019 by our count, and Nvidia had 26 releases (not including non-public drivers). That's 2-3 driver updates per month on average, which some would argue is too many.

The only games that favored the Nvidia RTX 2060 Super are The Outer Worlds and Total War: Warhammer 2\u2014both of which are, oddly enough, AMD promotional titles. Both games also support the DirectX 11 API (we tested DX12 in Warhammer 2 on AMD GPUs, DX11 on Nvidia), where eight of the ten remaining games were tested with either the DX12 or Vulkan API. We also didn't test with ray tracing enabled in the two games that support it, since AMD has so far elected not to add driver support for DXR.This isn't an insurmountable lead, and factory overclocked cards could potentially narrow the gap, but both AMD and Nvidia partner cards are typically overclocked to similar levels so that shouldn't shake up the standings much. The good news is that either GPU should easily handle 1080p ultra gaming at 60 fps, and 60 fps is even doable at 1440p ultra on many of the games\u2014Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Borderlands 3 and Metro Exodus being three where one or both cards come up short.Winner: AMD4. Power Consumption and Heat OutputThese are high-end GPUs and depending on the specific model, PCI Express Graphics (PEG) power connector requirements will vary. Most cards will require both 8-pin and 6-pin PEG connectors. Some factory overclocked models might include dual 8-pin PEG connectors, though almost certainly not because it's strictly necessary. Only the RTX 2060 Super Founders Edition uses a single 8-pin PEG connector.AMD's RX 5700 XT has an official Typical Board Power (TBP) rating of 225W, while Nvidia's RTX 2060 Super is rated at 175W. Those are both for reference designs, however, and factory overclocked partner cards are very likely to be a bit higher. AMD recommends a minimum 600W power supply, and Nvidia recommends at least a 550W PSU.In actual use, power requirements with a Core i9-9900K test system are far lower than those PSU recommendations. We measured around 325W at the outlet with the RTX 2060 Super, and 370W with the RX 5700 XT. We'll be refining our power testing with specialized hardware in the near future, as reading power use via software utilities depends on the drivers, but AMD and Nvidia don't report the same metrics. AMD gives GPU-only power use, while Nvidia gives total board power use. GPU-Z as an example showed average power draws of 173.2W for the 2060 Super vs. 179.0W for the 5700 XT\u2014even though outlet power use was 48W higher on the AMD card.For most PCs, the 30-50W difference in power use isn't going to matter a lot\u2014if your PSU can handle the 2060 Super, it should be able to handle the 5700 XT as well. However, higher power use leads directly to more heat output, which potentially means more fan noise. It's possible for custom cards to use larger coolers and better fans to get around that, but in general the Nvidia RTX 2060 Super will use less power, generate less heat and keep noise levels down.The fact that Nvidia offers similar (though slightly lower) performance while using the older 12nm manufacturing node is impressive, and we can only look forward to seeing what Nvidia's 7nm Ampere GPUs do later this year.Winner: Nvidia5. Value PropositionDetermining which card is the better value is tricky, since all of the above elements are factors. Both cards have a recommended price of $400. Right now, the least expensive RTX 2060 Super cards cost $400, though there's an EVGA RTX 2060 Super SC Ultra Gaming at Newegg that drops to $380 after rebates if you're willing to deal with those. There are rebates on AMD's RX 5700 XT as well, but the least expensive model is the ASRock RX 5700 XT Challenger D 8G OC, which is currently on sale for $360 without any mail-in rebate hoops to jump through.Individual GPU sales may come and go, but for the past several months at least, the RX 5700 XT has been selling for less than the RTX 2060 Super. AMD also sweetens the deal by offering some free games with RX 5700 XT cards (you'll want to verify the deal is available from the reseller before buying, however). AMD's current Raise the Game bundle will get you Monster Hunter World: Iceborne, Resident Evil 3 and three months of Xbox Game Pass for PC with the RX 5700 XT. How much those games are worth is debatable, but it's obviously a much better deal than getting nothing extra.Winner: AMDSwipe to scroll horizontallyRoundNvidia GeForce RTX 2060 SuperAMD Radeon RX 5700 XTFeatured Technology\u2717Row 0 - Cell 2 Drivers and SoftwareRow 1 - Cell 1 \u2717Gaming PerformanceRow 2 - Cell 1 \u2717Power Consumption\u2717Row 3 - Cell 2 Value PropositionRow 4 - Cell 1 \u2717Total23 Bottom LineLower prices go a long way toward overcoming any potential feature and power advantages Nvidia might have. If ray tracing in games truly catches on\u2014we want more games that look like Control rather than Battlefield V or Shadow of the Tomb Raider, for example\u2014the RTX 2060 Super could be a better long-term purchase. Will it still be fast enough to handle all the extra effects, or will you need to upgrade to a 3060 or some other future card? We can't say for certain. Regardless, we've been hearing about all the 'amazing' ray tracing enabled games coming soon for more than a year now, and most have failed to live up to the hype.Our advice is to get a card that runs current games better, and save ray tracing for another day. AMD's RX 5700 XT costs less than the RTX 2060 Super, comes with a gaming bundle as an added bonus, has good driver and software support, and outperforms the competition in ten of the 12 games we tested. If you want the best GPU right now for $400 or less, AMD's RX 5700 XT, Navi 10 and the RDNA architecture are the winner.If you're willing to spend more money, AMD falls behind the RTX 2070 Super and beyond. Alternatively, you can still find a few RTX 2070 cards at clearance pricing, like this Gigabyte RTX 2070 Windforce 8G (also available at B&H and Newegg for the same $400 asking price). The RTX 2070 ends up being 5% faster than the RTX 2060 Super, making performance mostly a tie. It still costs more, but ray tracing use in games should pick up with both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X coming later this year and supporting the feature.Pricing can also change, and Nvidia dropped the RTX 2060 starting price to $300 when AMD launched the RX 5600 XT in January 2020. The RTX 2060 Super prices didn't drop, but if they do, Nvidia could reclaim the $350 crown. What\u2019s more likely is that Nvidia's next-gen Ampere GPUs will shake things up in the graphics card market when they launch later this year.Overall Winner: AMDToday's best AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT, Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super and  dealsAMD Radeon RX 5700 XT $529ViewSee all pricesWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nrtx\nRadeon\nRadeon RX \nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (26)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

The fact that they did not is why many will probably be migrating to the next gen console when it comes out. Whether AMD and Nvidia would keep prices sky high after the mining craze has been answered loud and clear. They could have gotten a couple hundred bucks out of me every year and a half or so. Now it looks like they'll get 150 of my bucks through Microsoft and that'll have to last them around 5 or 6 years... I think in the long run their greed will bite them in the butt.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarkbreeze\n\n\nIt doesn't matter that not everyone is having issues. If SOME are having issues, it makes \"good driver and software support\" a lot less, believable. And you apparently didn't read the article well because they also clearly said that this is not limited to Navi, neither the problems, nor the poll, nor the driver issues were limited to Navi, but primarily many of the core issues, especially the black screens etc., are. Seriously, we just had one member who updated his drivers and ALL FOUR of his working AMD cards instantly began having problems. FOUR. Just from a driver update. Two days ago. \n\nLast year we noticed that batches of RX 580 cards were dying off right after some driver updates. So yeah, the fact that not everybody is affected does not forgive the fact that there is a problem.\n\nAMD themselves SAY there IS a problem, and that they are working on it. So how do you refute what they've said themselves? Not everybody had coil whine or was bothered by the GTX 970 3.5GB memory issues either, but they are/were STILL problems, regardless. Nobody would have said \"The GTX 970 has terrific memory support\" in light of the issues surrounding the architecture despite the fact that for most people it was a non-issue.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmrface\n\n\ntravsb1984 said:...is why many will probably be migrating to the next gen console when it comes out....\nThis dead horse is touted out after each architecture release and propped up with a price point that never comes to fruition. While I agree that greed is the reason (xCOIN mining market is long been reduced to niche enthusiasts and most people who still worry about crypto rely on trading coins rather than mining coins) they havent dropped the price and is ridiculous, however, people will not be moving in droves away from PC gaming when the next gens come out. Its just as preposterous as someone saying \"PS5 will be $500+, PS gamers are going to be flocking to other consoles or PC.\" Neither is a good argument as humans are innately tribal when it comes to their wants and cost is rarely a factor if someone decides to make a change, mostly due to brand loyalty and change is due to a major event.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmrface\n\n\nDarkbreeze said:It doesn't matter that not everyone is having issues.

It\u2019s a game streaming service that\u2019s been stuck in Beta Purgatory for more than two years. In that time, Stadia released and Microsoft opened its own Project xCloud beta. Meanwhile, GeForce Now still hasn\u2019t claimed mindshare or word of mouth.But GeForce Now might not need mindshare to win out over its competitors. That\u2019s because it has a different tact \u2013 GeForce Now streams the PC games you already own. Because the games are cloud-based, there\u2019s no updating or maintenance required. But it also means only select games are supported. Still, that's a much better deal than Stadia, which asks you to pay a subscription and to buy a completely new (or replacement) library you want to own or may already own. Better yet, Nvidia is under cutting Google's game streaming service by offering a $4.99 per month plan when Stadia costs $9.99 per month.It\u2019s not aimed at tech enthusiasts and early adopters. It\u2019s explicitly aimed at people who own outdated gaming PCs or Macs and still want to play the hottest PC games.\n\nInterface and LibrarySetting up GeForce Now for the first time was a bit of a nightmare.When you log into GeForce Now, you\u2019re presented with a sort of junior varsity Steam client. There\u2019s a carousel of hot games, but at this point, it\u2019s filled with old titles like Cuphead and Tropico 6. I was thrilled to load up Halo: The Master Chief collection, but it wasn\u2019t available. Neither was Monster Hunter, Red Dead Redemption 2, or Temtem. Nvidia touts \u201cover 400 supported top games,\u201d but the latest games I wanted to play weren\u2019t available.\nWhen you finally find a game you want to play, you click a button to add it to your library. GeForce then asks you to confirm that you own the game. (Again, you can\u2019t play any games you don\u2019t own.) Then, a new dialogue box appears, establishing your connection to the GeForce servers.\nThe screen chugs along for a minute with a display that\u2019s a dead ringer for the AOL 56k modem dial-up connection. (Only 90s kids will understand!) It\u2019s a weird system that feels really outdated. Thankfully it doesn\u2019t seem to happen every time you start a game.\nOnce you\u2019ve connected with your \u201cRig,\u201d things get really weird. GeForce opens what looks like a virtualized desktop, complete with a virtualized Steam client. To play a game, you have to authenticate your \u201cnew\u201d PC from Steam. My Steam password was generated by a password manager \u2013 which means its a long, inscrutable string of letters, numbers, and symbols. But in GeForce Now, you can\u2019t copy and paste your password, so I had to hand-type the painfully obfuscated password. On the third try, I got it right.When I finally finished authenticating everything, I had to wait about 5 minutes for an available rig to play Destiny 2. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I was able to start a game.\n\nPerformanceSo far, performance on GeForce Now has been a tale of two rooms. In my office: a sleek, fully specced 5k iMac. In my living room, a crappy MacBook from 2013, barely hanging together.First, I played in my office \u2013 which is the furthest room from my modem and router, but connected via a mesh network. I wasn\u2019t surprised to find GeForce struggle there, despite having much faster speeds than required. When I checked, I was rocking 48.56 Mbps Down and 41.63 Mbps Up. But, for reasons beyond my comprehension, at one point my internet speeds dropped to 11 MBps Down, which is below the recommended 15 MBps.\nEven when speeds got sluggish, the quality of my experience depended on how resource-intensive the game was. I was able to make my way through Cuphead unimpeded, despite the game requiring lightning-fast reflexes. But when I tried more graphically intensive games, like Destiny 2, the game stuttered, I felt noticeable latency, and the visuals descended into a smudgy, cubist hellscape.\nDuring one mission, I died over and over again, unable to discern friends from enemies from random trees. For many rural Americans, without access to high-speed internet, this is the kind of experience you can expect from game-streaming services for years to come. Which is to say, it\u2019s not worth your time.But in my living room, on my 7-year-old MacBook, everything was different. Destiny 2 looked stunning and played perfectly. And you would hope so; my speeds held steady at about 200 Mbps down. I don\u2019t think many people will have this kind of Upload/Download luxury, but it completely changed my experience.\nNo matter how I tried to stress it, it worked perfectly. At one point, I was streaming music to my Sonos, watching YouTube TV, and loading a video on my smartphone, and I still couldn\u2019t get Destiny 2 to falter in the slightest. The game still looked pristine and I had no noticeable latency.If you have a gaming PC, you\u2019re probably within your rights to be incredulous. After all, what\u2019s the difference between being stuck in the room with the fastest internet and the room with your gaming rig?\nBut for that small contingency of gamers who 1) don\u2019t own a gaming PC, 2) want to play the best PC games, and 3) have blazing fast internet \u2013 GeForce Now seems like a winner. In some ways, it\u2019s almost perfectly suited for Mac enthusiasts. I still have plenty to test, and I\u2019m excited to test the exact latency, figure out just how much bandwidth GeForce Now is gobbling up, and, perhaps most exciting, try the service via the Nvidia Shield TV streaming box.What else do you want to see? Let us know in the comments, and I\u2019ll be sure to test it out.\nIGN LogoReviews\u2022Editor Columns\u2022News\u2022Guides\u2022How to Watch Guides\u2022Elden Ring DLC Interactive Map\u2022GTA 5 Cheats\u2022IGN Store\u2022HowLongToBeat\u2022Deals\u2022Contact Us\u2022IGN YouTube\u2022IGN TikTok\u2022IGN Twitter\u2022Map Genie"

India has the world\u2019s highest prevalence of the disease \u2014 accounting for over one-quarter of the 10 million new cases each year.\nIt\u2019s a fitting first project for the company, whose founders hope to greatly improve global access to medical imaging diagnostics with an AI-powered radiology platform. DeepTek\u2019s DxTB tool screens X-ray images for pulmonary TB, flagging cases for prioritized review by medical experts.\nIndia aims to eradicate TB by 2025, five years before the United Nations\u2019 global goal to end the epidemic by 2030. Chest X-ray imaging is the most sensitive screening tool for pulmonary TB, helping clinicians determine which patients should be referred for further lab testing. But two-thirds of people worldwide lack access to even basic radiology services, in part due to high costs and insufficient infrastructure.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge shortage of imaging experts available to read X-ray scans,\u201d said Amit Kharat, CEO of the startup and a clinical radiologist. \u201cSince radiologists\u2019 time is often sought for more demanding investigations like CT or MRI scans, this is an important gap where AI can add value.\u201d\nDeepTek is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a virtual accelerator program that enables early-stage companies with fundamental tools, expertise and go-to-market support. The startup uses NVIDIA GPUs through Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services for training and inference of its deep learning algorithms.\nIts DxTB tool has been used to analyze over 70,000 chest X-rays so far in partnership with the Greater Chennai Corporation\u2019s TB Free Chennai Initiative, a project supported by the Clinton Health Access Initiative. The system is deployed in mobile vans equipped with digital X-ray machines to conduct TB screening for high-risk population groups.\n\nAs patients are screened in the mobile clinics, scans of the chest X-ray images are securely transmitted to the cloud for inference. The accelerated turnaround time allows doctors to triage cases and conduct additional tests right away, minimizing the number of patients who don\u2019t follow up for further testing and treatment.\n\u201cDoing this job would have taken a month\u2019s time. With AI, it\u2019s now feasible to do it within hours,\u201d Kharat said. \u201cThe goal is to make sure not a single patient is lost.\u201d\n\u00a0DxTB can be deployed in the cloud or \u2014 where internet connections are weak or unavailable \u2014 as an edge service. Radiologists access the scans through a dashboard that enables them to review the studies and provide expert feedback and validation.\nPatients detected as potentially TB-positive provide a sputum, or lung fluid, sample that undergoes a molecular test before doctors confirm the diagnosis and prescribe a medication program.\nIn addition to the mobile clinics, around 50 imaging centers and hospitals in India use DeepTek\u2019s AI models. One hospital network will soon deploy the startup\u2019s ICU Chest tool, which can diagnose a score of conditions relevant to intensive care patients.\nDeepTek is also developing models to screen X-rays of the joints and spine; CT scans of the liver and brain; and brain MRI studies. The company\u2019s in-house radiologists annotate scans by hand for training, validation and testing.\nTo further improve its deep learning network, the startup uses data augmentation and data normalization \u2014 and incorporates users\u2019 radiology reports as feedback to refine and retrain the AI.\nDeepTek now processes nearly 25,000 imaging studies a month on its cloud platform.\n\u201cBuilding AI models is just one part of the story,\u201d Kharat said. \u201cThe whole technology pipeline needs to integrate smoothly with the radiology workflow at hospitals, imaging centers and mobile clinics.\u201d\nMain image shows a calcified nodule in the lung\u2019s right upper lobe, detected by DeepTek\u2019s AI model.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They are:\n\nAvengers: Endgame\nThe Irishman\nThe Lion King\n1917\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\n\nFor over a decade, Quadro has been behind award-winning graphics in films, bringing the latest advancements in visual effects to studios across the industry.\nAvengers: Endgame amazed audiences with over 2,500 stunning visual effects shots, breaking box office records along the way.\nThe visual effects development team at Digital Domain brought innovation to the film like never before, using custom machine learning technology running on NVIDIA Quadro GPUs to animate Josh Brolin\u2019s performance on Marvel\u2019s infamous villain, Thanos.\n\u201cFor Digital Domain\u2019s work on Avengers: Endgame, we built a machine learning system that understood Josh Brolin\u2019s facial movements, and we taught the system how to transfer Josh to Thanos\u2019 face,\u201d said Darren Hendler, head of Digital Humans at Digital Domain. \u201cKey to this process were immediate realistic rendered previews of the characters\u2019 emotional performances, which was made possible using NVIDIA GPU technology. We now use NVIDIA RTX technology to drive all of our real-time ray-traced digital human projects.\u201d\nThe innovators at Industrial Light & Magic also gave machine learning a starring role in Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman. The markerless de-aging of Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci enabled the film to tell a story that spanned decades while allowing the actors to perform without facial markers or helmet cams.\nWith the new NVIDIA Quadro RTX GPUs, artists and studios can take advantage of the latest AI-driven tools and techniques. Quadro RTX accelerates many custom AI-based tools and commercial creative applications from companies like Adobe, Autodesk, Blackmagic Design and more, so professionals can take visual effects to the next level with enhanced capabilities.\nDisney\u2019s visually stunning remake of The Lion King also broke new ground by transporting live-action crews to the CG environment in virtual reality. Through the use of Quadro GPUs, VFX supervisor Rob Legato and virtual production supervisor Ben Grossmann brought traditional filmmaking techniques in virtual worlds that gave us the most cinematic CG movie ever created.\n\u201cRendering is the killer of fast turnaround and iterative creativity. You really need global illumination and ray tracing for real-time feedback and micro adjustments, just like on a live action film stage, and that\u2019s what the NVIDIA Quadro graphics cards give you,\u201d said Robert Legato, VFX supervisor on The Lion King.\nPresenting a heart-pounding, up close and personal view of World War I, 1917 features a single-shot perspective that follows the mission of two soldiers delivering an important message to the front line. MPC used NVIDIA GPUs to create what looks like the longest single visual effects shot ever put on the big screen.\nBringing an epic saga to a close, Lucasfilm\u2019s Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker gave audiences iconic lightsaber duels, monumental starship battles, and a new era of heroes and villains. Industrial Light & Magic used NVIDIA GPUs to beautifully blend VFX with practical effects, creating some of the most incredible worlds and battles ever seen in film.\nWhile only one visual effects team will take to the podium to accept an Oscar, thousands of artists around the world are bringing new worlds and characters to life every day. From powering creative applications to enabling new AI techniques, NVIDIA RTX accelerates the workstations and servers the film industry is using to define the future of visual computing.\nNVIDIA engineering is also no stranger to Academy Awards \u2014 seven NVIDIANs are past recipients of Sci-Tech Awards.\nSee How Oscar-Nominated Visual Effects Are Created\nGet behind the scenes of the world\u2019s most advanced visual effects at the NVIDIA GPU Technology Conference in San Jose, March 23-26.\nCome see Ben Grossmann, CEO of Magnopus and virtual production supervisor of Disney\u2019s The Lion King, present the latest advancements in virtual production techniques.\nDoug Roble, senior director of Software R&D at Digital Domain, will take GTC attendees on a journey featuring the most photorealistic real-time digital human ever made.\nAnd learn from other media and entertainment industry luminaries at GTC, including Vicki Dobbs Beck from Lucasfilm\u2019s ILMxLAB, Max Liani from Pixar, David Crabtree from DNEG and David Morin from Epic Games.\nFeature image credit: \u00a9 2019 NETFLIX\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: NVIDIA RTX | RTX Mobile Workstations | Virtual Reality \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It\u2019s the power to play PC games anywhere, on any device \u2014 even the billion devices that aren\u2019t game ready. You\u2019re upgrading to a state-of-the-art gaming rig by virtually adding a GeForce graphics card to your PC, Mac, SHIELD or Android phone.\nJust like the PC, GeForce NOW is an open platform. It\u2019s powered by our world-class GPU architecture and uses our Game Ready Drivers for the best performance. And, because these are real PC games, GeForce NOW gives you the precision of keyboard and mouse gaming, as well as optimizations for game controllers.\nIt\u2019s an opportunity for you to connect to the millions of gamers online and join your friends in your favorite PC communities. Most importantly, it instantly connects you to the games you already own on the digital game stores you own them on, or the latest free-to-play game everyone is playing.\nYour games, your devices, GeForce power.\nGame ON\nFunny thing about gamers. They have games. Lots of them. Our GeForce NOW beta members have large libraries. Often 50 games or more. You shouldn\u2019t have to leave them behind.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re working with existing PC game stores and publishers. With GeForce NOW, you can keep playing the games you already own and continue building libraries from the same stores you already use every day. That\u2019s what it means to be an open platform.\nIf you buy it, you own it. If you already own it, play it. Your purchases are always yours.\n\nGeForce NOW is the only cloud gaming service with access to a wide range of free-to-play games, more than 30 and growing. In total, there are hundreds of games from more than 50 publishers that, once you own, are available for instant play. All these games are patched automatically in the cloud, so your library is always game ready.\nWhile we continue to grow the library of instantly accessible games, there are also more than 1,000 games that can be played through single-session installs.\nGames get added to the service weekly based on member requests, game popularity and publishers\u2019 input. If you don\u2019t see a game that you want to play, let us and the publisher know.\nPlay ON\nGeForce NOW takes PC gaming and 60+ FPS action where it\u2019s never been before. Underpowered? No problem. Incompatible? No problem.\n\nYour old laptop never gamed like this before. That Mac, which for years has seen fewer games published for it or lost compatibility, can now play the latest games. Your rig doesn\u2019t have to move from room to room to game on the largest screen in your house \u2014 your TV. And most recently, PC games go with you on the screen you take everywhere: your Android phone.\nAnd later this year we\u2019ll add Chromebooks, giving members yet another screen to play on.\nON for Everyone\nOver 300,000 beta testers have streamed more than 70 million hours of gameplay in 30 countries throughout North America and Europe. GeForce NOW is better because of every second that\u2019s been played. During the beta, over 80 percent of members instantly upgraded from systems without GeForce GPUs to the latest PC graphics.\nWe\u2019ve reached a point in our journey where we\u2019re ready to remove the waitlist, exit beta and open GeForce NOW up to even more gamers. Members will have the option of a free or premium experience.\n\nThe free membership provides one-hour sessions with standard access to GeForce NOW servers. There\u2019s no limit to the number of sessions you can play. All GeForce NOW beta members automatically have had their beta accounts converted to this free plan. Simply sign in and continue gaming.\nGamers can also upgrade to a no-wait, longer session-length premium experience. These members will enjoy priority access to GeForce NOW servers ahead of free members and extended session lengths of up to six hours. They\u2019ll also have exclusive access to RTX content on GeForce NOW.\nFor a limited time, we\u2019re offering the premium experience as a Founders membership. The first three months are free, followed by a discounted rate of $4.99 a month for all of 2020. This special offer is part of our commitment to working with the community that continues to help us improve GeForce NOW.\nBoth memberships will work across any supported device that you already own. No additional hardware needed.\nRTX ON\nWe\u2019ll continue to launch new features, including today\u2019s introduction of ray tracing. The holy grail of gaming graphics, ray tracing simulates the physical behavior of light to bring real-time, cinematic-quality rendering to even the most visually intense games. Founders members will have instant access to RTX games.\n\nGeForce NOW continues to evolve and we\u2019re working every day to improve your service.\nBecause of You, GeForce NOW is ON\nWe couldn\u2019t \u2014 and wouldn\u2019t \u2014 be here without the beta members who have helped guide us on our journey. From Mac to PC to SHIELD and then to mobile, every ounce of feedback has left an impression on GeForce NOW. Thank you.\nAnd to everyone who wants the power of PC gaming that 200 million GeForce gamers already know and love, welcome to GeForce NOW. More power, more people \u2014 game on.\n\n\nCategories: GamingTags: Cloud Gaming | GeForce NOW | NVIDIA RTX | SHIELD \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

For that, they need the clinical trial process.\u201d\nOver the past decade, the number of cancer clinical trials has grown 17 percent a year, on average. But nearly a fifth of these studies fail to recruit a sufficient number of participants that fit sometimes very specific trial criteria after three years of searching \u2014 and the problem isn\u2019t getting any simpler.\n\u201cIn the age of precision medicine, clinical trial criteria are getting more challenging,\u201d Brusselaers said. \u201cWhen developing a drug that is targeting patients with a rare genetic mutation, you have to be able to find those specific patients.\u201d\nBy analyzing medical records with AI, Deep 6 can identify a patient population for clinical trials within minutes, accelerating what\u2019s traditionally a months-long process. Major cancer centers and pharmaceutical companies, including Cedars Sinai Medical Center and Texas Medical Center, are using the AI tool. They\u2019ve matched more than 100,000 patients to clinical trials so far.\nThe startup\u2019s clinical trial acceleration software has specific tools to help hospitals recommend available trials to patients and to help pharmaceutical companies track and accelerate patient recruitment for their studies. Future versions of the software could also be made available for patients to browse trials.\nA Match Made in AI\nDeep 6 AI is a member of the NVIDIA Inception virtual accelerator program, which helps startups scale faster. The company uses an NVIDIA TITAN GPU to accelerate the development of its custom AI models that analyze patient data to identify and label clinical criteria relevant to trials.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more efficient and less expensive for us to develop our models on premises,\u201d Brusselaers said. \u201cWe could turn around models right away and iterate faster, without having to wait to rerun the code.\u201d\nWhile the tool can be used for any diagnostic area or medical condition, Brusselaers says over a quarter of trials on the platform are oncology studies, followed closely by cardiology.\nTrained on a combination of open-source databases and real-world data from Deep 6\u2019s partners, the AI models first identify specific mentions of clinical terminology and medical codes in patient records with natural language processing.\nAdditional neural networks analyze unstructured data like doctor\u2019s notes and pathology reports to gather additional information about a patient\u2019s symptoms, diagnoses and treatments \u2014 even detecting potential conditions not mentioned in the medical records.\nDeep 6\u2019s tool then creates a patient graph that represents the individual\u2019s clinical profile. These graphs can easily be matched by doctors and researchers to develop trial cohorts, upgrading a time-consuming, often unfruitful manual process.\n\nResearchers at Los Angeles\u2019 Cedars-Sinai Smidt Heart Institute \u2014 one of the startup\u2019s clients \u2014 had enrolled just two participants for a new clinical trial after six months of recruitment effort. Using Deep 6 AI software, they found 16 qualified candidates in an hour.\nTexas Medical Center, a collection of over 60 health institutions, is rolling out Deep 6 software across its network to replace the typical process of finding clinical trial candidates, which requires associates to manually flip through thick folders of medical records.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a long slog to find patients for clinical trials,\u201d said Bill McKeon, CEO of Texas Medical Center. Using Deep 6\u2019s software tool \u201cis just completely transforming.\u201d\nMcKeon says in one case, it took six months to find a dozen eligible patients for a trial with traditional recruitment efforts. The same matching process through Deep 6\u2019s software found 80 potential participants in minutes.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

App-based services like Uber and Lyft have made on-demand travel even faster and easier.\nWith the advent of autonomous vehicles, ride-hailing promises to raise the bar on safety and efficiency. Known as robotaxis, these shared vehicles are purpose-built for transporting groups of people along optimized routes, without a human driver at the wheel.\nThe potential for a shared autonomous mobility industry is enormous. Financial services company UBS estimates that robotaxis could create a $2 trillion market globally over the next decade, with each vehicle generating as much as $27,000 annually.\nIn dense urban environments, like New York City, experts project that a taxi fleet converted to entirely autonomous vehicles could cut down commutes in some areas from 40 minutes to 15.\nOn top of the economic and efficiency benefits, autonomous vehicles are never distracted or drowsy. And they can run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, expanding mobility access to more communities.\nTo transform everyday transportation, the NVIDIA DRIVE ecosystem is gearing up with a new wave of electric, autonomous vehicles.\nUp for Cabs\nBuilding a new kind of vehicle from square one requires a fresh perspective. That\u2019s why a crop of startups and technology companies have begun to invest in the idea of a shared car without a steering wheel or pedals.\nAlready transporting riders in Florida and San Jose, Calif. retirement communities, Voyage is deploying low-speed autonomous vehicles with the goal of widely expanding safe mobility. The company is using DRIVE AGX to operate its SafeStop supercharged automatic braking system in its current fleet of vehicles.\nOptimus Ride is a Boston-based self-driving technology company developing systems for geo-fenced environments \u2014 pre-defined areas of operation, like a city center or shipping yard.\nIts electric, autonomous vehicles run on the high-performance, energy-efficient NVIDIA DRIVE platform, and were the first such vehicles to run in NYC as part of a pilot launched in August.\nOptimus Ride\nLeveraging the performance of NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Pegasus, which can achieve up to 320 trillion operations per second, smart mobility startup WeRide is developing level 4 autonomous vehicles to provide accessible transportation to a wide range of passengers.\nStarting from scratch, self-driving startup and DRIVE ecosystem member Zoox is developing a purpose-built vehicle for on-demand, autonomous transportation. Its robotaxi encompasses a futuristic vision of everyday mobility, able to drive in both directions. Both Zoox and WeRide are members of the NVIDIA Inception program, which nurtures cutting-edge AI startups revolutionizing industries such as transportation.\nZoox says it plans to launch its zero-emissions vehicle for testing this year, followed by an autonomous taxi service.\nAt GTC China in December, ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing announced it was developing level 4 autonomous vehicles for its mobility services using NVIDIA DRIVE and AI technology. Delivering 10 billion passenger trips per year, DiDi is working toward the safe, large-scale application of autonomous driving technology.\nDiDi\nSharing Expertise for Shared Mobility\nWhen it comes to industry-changing innovations, sometimes two (or three) heads are better than one.\nGlobal automakers, suppliers and startups are also working to solve the question of shared autonomous mobility, collaborating on their own visions of the robotaxi of the future.\nIn December, Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler and global supplier Bosch launched the first phase of their autonomous ride-hailing pilot in San Jose. The app-based service shuttles customers in an automated Mercedes-Benz S-Class monitored by a safety driver.\nThe companies are collaborating with NVIDIA to eventually launch a robotaxi powered by NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Pegasus.\nDaimler\nAcross the pond, autonomous vehicle solution provider and Inception member AutoX and Swedish electric vehicle manufacturer NEVS are working to deploy robotaxis in Europe by the end of this year.\nThe companies, which came together through the NVIDIA DRIVE ecosystem, are developing an electric autonomous vehicle based on NEVS\u2019 mobility-focused concept and powered by NVIDIA DRIVE. The goal of this collaboration is to bring these safe and efficient technologies to everyday transportation around the world.\n\nStartup Pony.AI is also part of the Inception program and collaborating with global automakers such as Toyota and Hyundai, developing a robotaxi fleet with the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX platform at its core.\nAs the NVIDIA DRIVE ecosystem pushes into the next decade of autonomous transportation, safer, more convenient rides will soon just be a push of a button away. At GTC 2020, attendees will get a glimpse to just where this future is going \u2014 register today with code CMAUTO for a 20 percent discount.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: Inception | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Previous leaks have also indicated a March 2020 timeframe for launch and with Jensen claiming \"you won't be disappointed\" it looks like this is finally it. If the company is planning to launch Ampere at GTC 2020, we should start seeing leaks start to popup from the usual sources soon enough.\nNVIDIA Ampere GPUs launching at GTC 2020?\nNVIDIA's CEO Jensen has been keeping out of the public eye for quite a while and in the recent quarterly earnings conference, he personally invited everyone to attend GTC 2020 at San Jose. What is interesting is that he also concluded with a little teaser: \"You won't be disappointed\". Considering Jensen isn't one to make false promises, I am fairly certain we will be looking at a litany of launches (paper or otherwise) at the upcoming GTC conference. Before we go any further, here is the extract from the call:\n\nJensen Huang at NVIDIA Quarterly Earnings Q4 FY2020\n\nWe had an excellent quarter with strong demand for NVIDIA RTX graphics and NVIDIA AI platforms and record data center revenue. NVIDIA RTX is reinventing computer graphics and the market's response is excellent, driving a powerful upgrade cycle in both gaming and professional graphics, while opening whole new opportunities for us to serve the huge community of independent creative workers and social content creators and new markets in rendering and cloud gaming.\n..........We'll be talking a lot more about these key trends and much more at next month's GTC Conference in San Jose. Come join me. You won't be disappointed. Thanks everyone.\n\nNVIDIA also stated in the call that the company is finding more and more gamers shifting to its Turing GPUs as prices normalize (relatively). While the company has yet to hit its older crypto-currency fueled highs, Ampere might prove to be the architecture that just does that. The company has managed to stay on 16nm (12NFF node is a rebadged 16nm FF node) for quite some time now and with AMD already on 7nm, things are starting to heat up. If the company moves to 7nm with its Ampere GPUs\u00a0 then it will be able to leverage not only the economics of a lower process but increase the absolute performance of its cards as well.\nWhat we know so far\nWe have previously heard of NVIDIA's Ampere GPUs when they passed their EEC certification, but nothing more came up since then. Now, however, we have a tentative timeline: they will be launching in 2020. It is highly likely that NVIDIA will continue with their RTX philosophy and take that to the next level with Ampere. Right now, the Turing GPU is capable of raytracing at 1080p 30 fps for light to moderate path ray tracing workloads. The Ampere GPU will be able to go further.\n\nThe fact that it is based on Samsung's 7nm EUV process means we are looking at a performance advantage as well as a power efficiency advantage. Not only that, but believe it or not, 7nm EUV is actually supposed to be easier to fab than standard UV multi-patterning efforts. Think of EUV as sort of a reset of the difficulty curve as the company moves to a new light source. This will, however, require extensive retooling, but the economies of scale will almost certainly prove to be worth it. At a bare minimum, you are looking at a 50% increase all things considered and watt for watt.\nHere's the thing right, NVIDIA is one of the biggest customers of TSMC and has been their loyal patron since pretty much the dawn of modern gaming tech. If they are actually planning to shift to Samsung's 7nm technology, then that will have repercussions not only for the company but for TSMC as well. There are two possible things that are going on here, either Samsung is offering them a better deal financially, or NVIDIA has reason to believe Samsung's 7nm tech is better. We can guess one reason for why this might be the case. Right now, TSMC's 7nm process is not based on EUV, but they do have an EUV node planned. The process that NVIDIA is planning to shift to, at Samsung's, is EUV.\nThat would imply that they have reason to believe that Samsung's EUV process is better positioned to help them achieve their goals than the TSMC-based one. Another potential reason is that TSMC cannot offer them a large amount of volume and will never prioritize them over the likes of Apple Inc. At the same time, AMD is using up a lot of their capacity and things are getting too cramped in there for NVIDIA's liking. Samsung's foundries, on the other hand, have ample capacity and considering the giant that Samsung Electronics is, can simply throw money at yield problems to make them disappear.\nEverything considered Samsung is the logical partner for a company as ambitious as NVIDIA. With a big question mark on Intel foundries' capabilities right now and TSMC hogged down, Samsung remains the only leading-edge foundry for NVIDIA to tap into. GlobalFoundries dropped out of the leading edge race earlier this year - not that they would have been considered to begin with.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n66\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n22\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n21\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n21\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n21\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Fine wrinkles and freckles show up on faces. Footnotes in books and even street names on roadside signs become legible.\nUpscaling \u2014 converting lower resolution media to a higher resolution \u2014 offers a similar experience.\nBut with new AI upscaling techniques, the enhanced visuals look more crisp and realistic than ever.\nWhy Is Upscaling Necessary?\u00a0\nOne-third of television-owning households in the U.S. have a 4K TV, known as ultra-high definition. But much of the content people watch on popular streaming services like YouTube, HBO and Netflix is only available at lower resolutions.\n4K TVs can muddy visuals by having to stretch lower-resolution images to fit their screen. AI upscaling makes lower-resolution images fit with unrivaled crispness.\nStandard definition video, widely used in TVs until the 1990s, was just 480 pixels high. High-definition TVs bumped that up to 720 or 1080 pixels \u2014 and is still the most common resolution format for content on TV and the web.\nOwners of ultra-HD displays get the most out of their screens when watching 4K-mastered content. But when watching lower-resolution content, the video must be upscaled to fill out the entire display.\nFor example, 1080p images, known as full HD, have just a quarter of the pixels in 4K images. To display a 1080p shot from edge to edge on a 4K screen, the picture has to be stretched to match the TV\u2019s pixels.\nUpscaling is done by the streaming device being used \u2014 such as a smart TV or streaming media player. But typically, media players use basic upscaling algorithms that are unable to significantly improve high-definition content for 4K TVs.\nWhat Is Basic Upscaling?\u00a0\nBasic upscaling is the simplest way of stretching a lower resolution image onto a larger display. Pixels from the lower resolution image are copied and repeated to fill out all the pixels of the higher resolution display.\nFiltering is applied to smooth the image and round out unwanted jagged edges that may become visible due to the stretching. The result is an image that fits on a 4K display, but can often appear muted or blurry.\nWhat Is AI Upscaling?\u00a0\nTraditional upscaling starts with a low-resolution image and tries to improve its visual quality at higher resolutions. AI upscaling takes a different approach: Given a low-resolution image, a deep learning model predicts a high-resolution image that would downscale to look like the original, low-resolution image.\nTo predict the upscaled images with high accuracy, a neural network model must be trained on countless images. The deployed AI model can then take low-resolution video and produce incredible sharpness and enhanced details no traditional scaler can recreate. Edges look sharper, hair looks scruffier and landscapes pop with striking clarity.\n\nAI Upscaling on NVIDIA SHIELD TV\nThe NVIDIA SHIELD TV is the first streaming media player to feature AI upscaling. It can upscale 720p or 1080p HD content to 4K at up to 30 frames per second in real time.\nTrained offline on a dataset of popular TV shows and movies, the model uses SHIELD\u2019s NVIDIA Tegra X1+ processor for real-time inference. AI upscaling makes HD video content for top apps including HBO, Hulu, Netflix, Prime Video and YouTube appear sharper on 4K TVs, creating a more immersive viewing experience.\nTo see the difference between \u201cbasic upscaling\u201d and \u201cAI-enhanced upscaling\u201d on SHIELD, click the image below and move the slider left and right.\n\nNVIDIA SHIELD owners can toggle between basic and AI-enhanced modes in their device settings. A demo mode allows users to see a side-by-side comparison between regular content and AI-upscaled visuals.

That requires a couple of things, namely a very fast PC and a 120 - 144Hz or other high-refresh rate gaming monitor. Today, we'll look at the PC components end of that equation and identify graphics cards and GPUs  that will help you get the highest possible frame rate out of your rig. However, it goes without saying you'll also need a pretty speedy CPU to drive that card as hard as possible as well.\n\r\nThis article could be as simple as telling you to get a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti and be done with it. The reality is that not everyone has that level of budget, though. For that reason, we're looking at cards in a \"good, better, and best\" fashion, and we'll talk about a variety of graphics cards from both the AMD Radeon and NVIDIA GeForce camp that may fit your gaming needs. All of the cards in our list are capable, though some might be more capable than others. It's also heavily dependent on the game you want to play and its graphics workload. We'll look at some test runs later on in this piece, to prove that out as well. Finally, many eSports pros like to dial back graphical settings, because lower-fidelity graphics can actually provide a small edge (and higher frame rates), so you might not even want max fidelity anyway, in exchange for MOAR FPS.\n\r\nWithout further ado, let's check out the list...\n144Hz Midrange Graphics Cards: The Good List\r\nHitting a rendering target of 1080p isn't hard. Budget graphics cards like the GeForce 1650 SUPER or Radeon RX 5500 XT can do it at 60 frames per second. Hitting that target at 144 fps takes a little more effort, though. That's why we went with the Radeon RX 5700 XT for this segment. The AMD powered cards below will get you to that goal at affordable prices, though it might require dialing back the details slightly from their highest settings to get there. If you want to make no compromises, read on. \n\r\nAMD's Radeon RX 5700 XT is a pretty fast GPU for the money, with 40 compute units for a total of 2560 stream processors. Each of these models has 8 GB of 256-bit GDDR6 memory running at 14 gigatransfers per second (GT/s), which equates to 448 GB per second of bandwidth. While Navi-based graphics cards lack the real-time ray tracing effects of their GeForce RTX competition, the frame rates at this price point is second to none. The Radeon RX 5700 XT is both faster in traditional raster-rendered games than the GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER, and cheaper than the\u00a02070 SUPER\u00a0which is only slightly faster. This is the best middle ground if high frame rates are most important to you.\n\n\n\n\nGigabyte Radeon RX 5700 XT Gaming OC 8G - $409:\u00a0The Radeon RX 5700 XT is the fastest GPU AMD currently makes. When it comes to the Radeon RX 5700 XT, Gigabyte's triple-fan setup is about as affordable as they come. The maximum boost clock is all the way up to 1,905 MHz, and this big Gigabyte Radeon settles in at around 1,795 MHz during long gaming sessions. When we reviewed this model, we found Gigabyte's Navi-based card was just a hair faster than AMD's reference design and its beefy cooler with three fans was quieter, too.\u00a0\n\n\nSapphire Radeon Pulse RX 5700 XT 8 GB - $409: For the same price as the Gigabyte card above, Sapphire's Pulse RX 5700 XT has a slightly higher 1,925 maximum boost clock and a 1,815 MHz game clock. Both of those figures are just a touch faster than the Gigabyte model, which can add an extra couple of frames where necessary. Sapphire gave the Pulse a big three-slot cooler design with a pair of large fans to wick away heat from the cooler's fin array, keeping the GPU temperatures under control.\n\n\n\n\nPowerColor's Radeon RX 5700 XT Red Devil - $429: PowerColor's flagship Navi-based graphics card came through our offices\u00a0and we were quite impressed. The Red Devil is the fastest Radeon RX 5700 XT we've gotten our hands on. There was a good amount overclocking headroom in our review sample, too. Despite the extra speed, the fastest Radeon RX 5700 XT that PowerColor makes was about as quiet as the Gigabyte model, and produced far less noise than AMD's reference design.\n\n144Hz High-End Graphics Cards: The Better List\r\nWe very well could have used NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER\u00a0as a stepping stone between the Radeon RX 5700 XT and our next family of cards, but the 2070 SUPER's added performance isn't that much over the Radeon, while the price increase pushes up over 20% in some cases. Instead, to really get performance to separate from the mid-range pack, we think gamers would be better off stepping up to the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER. The 2080 SUPER has 3072 CUDA cores representing a big increase in performance over the RX 5700 XT. Each of these cards has a metal plate reinforcing the board to prevent drooping under its own weight, too.\u00a0\n\r\nNot only will these RTX 2080 SUPER cards drive competitive gaming titles at very high frame rates at 1080p, they also have RT cores for hardware-accelerated ray tracing effects in many recent and upcoming games like Control, Battlefield V, Cyberpunk 2077, and Quake II RTX. In short, the value provided by a 2080 SUPER is that it not only drives crazy-high frame rates, it can also produce some of the most beautifully-lit scenes in gaming at the same 1080p resolution at 60+ frames per second.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nZOTAC GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER AMP - $699: Zotac's AMP Edition GeForce RTX 2080 is a pretty stock example of the card with the same 1,815 maximum boost clock as NVIDIA's official spec sheet. It also happens to be the cheapest RTX 2080 SUPER on the list, and the only custom-card with a two-slot cooling solution. Still, this Zotac graphics card is no slouch in the gaming department, and it's got a relatively beefy 16+4 phase voltage regulation setup, which should provide ample power for overclocking.\n\n\n\n\nMSI GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER Gaming X Trio - $738: For right around 5% more than Zotac's entry, MSI's Gaming X Trio edition of the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER has a little higher boost clock at 1,845 MHz and a mammoth three-slot cooler with three large fans spinning to push heat off of the cooler. There's also some extra bling in the form of a large RGB LED array to give your system some more character. If your system already has an MSI motherboard with RGB lighting, the Mystic Light software is probably already there, so syncing up the graphics card to the motherboard or any RGB fans should be a cinch.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER Founder's Edition - $777: For those who want to get their GPUs straight from the source, NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER Founder's Edition has a really nice-looking cooler and great performance. This model adhere's to NVIDIA's stock specifications, and when we reviewed it this past summer, we found NVIDIA's refreshed Turing card to be the fastest solution around under $1000. That may not strictly be true now since so many partner cards are available, but it's still a really great option in its price range.\u00a0\n\n\n\nEVGA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER FTW3 - $799: The fastest card in this price class, EVGA's GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER FTW3 has an 1,845 maximum boost clock and a triple-fan, triple-slot cooler that should have no problem keeping this GPU's temperatures under control. The cooler is just as attractive as it is functional, and EVGA has strapped an RGB LED array to it here. Gamers who are used to using EVGA's Precision software for overclocking already have what they need to control not just the lights on this card, but the LEDs built into NVIDIA's NVLink Bridge, too.\n\n\r\n144Hz Ultimate Graphics Card: The Best List\r\nIf you still haven't found what you need in the GeForce RTX 2080, we've got your prescription right here. The GeForce RTX 2080 Ti is the very fastest consumer graphics card on the planet for now. Not only will it drive your 1080p, 144 fps cravings, it could even handle higher resolutions like ultra-wide 2560x1080 or even 2560x1440 displays at high refresh rates. If that's not enough performance, you can run a pair of these cards in tandem to try to reach even greater heights. This card can also drive monitors with higher refresh rates, since stepping up to 165 Hz and even 240 Hz is not all that uncommon these days.\u00a0\n\r\nThe GeForce RTX 2080 Ti has 4,352 CUDA cores for insanely high-performance computing needs with a maximum 1,545 MHz boost clock. NVIDIA backed the GPU with 11 GB of 14 GT/s GDDR6 memory, connected via a 352-bit interface, which works out to 616 GB per second of throughput. If that's not enough, it can also draw 10 giga-rays of ray tracing effects, producing the best and smoothest DXR effects possible today, with a consumer GPU. You're going to want a very fast CPU for this card, or else you'll probably be leaving a lot of performance on the table. Without further ado, here are some examples of the fastest consumer graphics card money can buy.\n\n\n\nASUS ROG Strix GeForce RTX 2080 Ti - $1,224: Right out of the gate, we're looking at a factory-overclocked model. ASUS bested the default boost clock by more than 100 MHz, all the way up to 1,665 MHz. To keep the GPU cool at those high speeds, ASUS gave it a three-slot cooler with three large fans to keep air moving under load. The shroud also serves as home to an RGB LED array controlled by ASUS's Aura Sync software. That'll keep the lights in sync with the manufacturer's Aura Sync-compatible motherboards.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGigabyte AORUS GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Xtreme - $1,299: For gamers with Gigabyte's AORUS motherboards, it might be easier to buy a card with an RGB LED array that uses the same software. AORUS's 2080 Ti Xtreme is the fastest model produced by Gigabyte's gaming label, with a stratospheric maximum boost clock of 1,770 MHz. This model also has a slight memory speed advantage thanks to GDDR6 memory clocked at 14.14 GT/s, too. Along with having a beefy triple-fan cooling setup, this could very well be the fastest card in this roundup.\u00a0\n\n\nEVGA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti FTW3 Ultra - $1,349: Just like with the RTX 2080 SUPER, EVGA's GeForce RTX 2080 Ti FTW3 Ultra is a factory-overclocked beast with a large cooler, three fans, and high clock speeds. This one is just a tad off the absolute maximum speed of the AORUS card, at 1,755 MHz, but it's still an incredibly fast card. The same benefits from the SUPER card apply here, as there's still an RGB LED array under the shroud and the LEDs still work with EVGA Precision X software.\u00a0\nSo Many Right GPU Options For High FPS Gaming\r\nOur little thought experiment here isn't just theoretical of course. Since we had AMD's reference Radeon RX 5700 XT card and the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER Founder's Edition on hand, we put the two cards through their paces with Battlefield V's Pacific War multiplayer and Fornite Season 2's Slurpy Swamp area. We measured frame rates for a period of five minutes each to get a representative chunk of multiplayer gameplay, which should help to eliminate the variance from run to run. Here's how the cards stacked up.\n\n\n\nFortnite is the lighter of these two tests, and for the most part the two slower cards in our setup could handle average frame rates pushing up over 144 Hz. The lone exception was the RX 5700 XT with Epic settings. The game's whimsical art direction means it still looks like a cartoony wonderland using High settings, and if you're willing to forego the last layer of effects, the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER will basically never dip below our 144 Hz target. The Radeon RX 5700 XT stayed pretty close at High, though.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nBattlefield V is a much tougher nut to crack, but both cards found settings low enough to hit our desired render targets. For the Radeon, that means the Low setting, which still looks pretty decent. The GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER could average 144 frames per second on the Medium setting. We've got no doubt that the RTX 2080 Ti can outpace both of these cards, but getting up to High settings might be tough. Still, we managed to pull it off, with some caveats.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor gamers with $400 or so to spend, the Radeon RX 5700 XT is a great option, but if you can spend more, you can certainly get more performance for your dollar. The $700-and-up GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER is an even better option for eliminating compromises. If your display is even faster than 144Hz, the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti may just be the ticket, but it's got an eye-watering price tag to match the tears of joy inspired by its performance.\u00a0If it's not already abundantly clear, there are lots of choices when it comes to 1080p gaming at at ultra-high refresh rates to match high speed displays. The only real limit is your budget.\r\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, AMD, Radeon, GeForce, (nasdaq:nvda), (nasdaq:amd), geforce rtx 2080 ti, radeon rx 5700 xt\n\n\n\nRelated content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEK Fluid Gaming 270 Conquest Review: Immaculate PC Gaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Review: BFGPU Benchmarks Unleashed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung SSD 980 Pro Review: Blazing Fast PCIe 4.0 Storage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalit GeForce RTX 3080 GamingPro OC Review: Big, Custom Ampere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Review: Ampere Is A Gaming Monster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT STUFF IN PC COMPONENTS\n\nEK Fluid Gaming 270 Conquest Review:...\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Review: BFGPU...\nSamsung SSD 980 Pro Review: Blazing Fast...\nPalit GeForce RTX 3080 GamingPro OC...\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Review: Ampere...\nTONOR Q9 USB Microphone Kit Review:...\nNVIDIA Reviewer Toolkit: Preparing For...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEEP INFORMED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSITE\n\nHome\n\n\nReviews\n\n\nNews\n\n\nBlogs\n\nFull Site\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nPC Components\n\n\nSystems\n\n\nMobile\n\n\nIT Infrastructure\n\n\nLeisure\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nCOMPANY\n\nAbout\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nNews Tips\n\n\nContact\n\n\nPrivacy And Terms\n\n\nHotTech\n\n\n\nMORE\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nShop\n\n\n\nSTAY CONNECTED\n\nTwitter\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            As an Amazon and Howl Technologies Associate, HotHardware earns a commission from qualifying purchases made on this site.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, you'll need one of these\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n\n\n\nWhen Nvidia unveiled its Turing architecture to the world at Gamescom 2018, there were two key technologies that it promised would set the best Nvidia graphics cards apart from the pack: ray tracing and deep learning super-sampling, or DLSS.When the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti launched, neither of these technologies were really available right out of the gate, making us wait until the release of Battlefield V to see ray tracing in an actual game \u2013 and even that was a bit underwhelming. Once we finally saw the feature in titles like Metro Exodus and Control, however, we were able to see why ray tracing really is the future of games.\u00a0But DLSS was never quite as exciting in practice as we thought it would be, at least when it first launched. The first few titles with the feature made game visuals a bit fuzzy with a bunch of aliasing and muddied textures. DLSS has definitely come a long way since then, and Nvidia told us that the latest AI network has brought significant improvements to the newest DLSS titles.\u00a0So, we decided to test it out ourselves.\u00a0Nvidia's Turing GPUs are just kind of cool (Image credit: Future)What is DLSS?In Nvidia Turing graphics cards like the GeForce RTX 2080 and RTX 2060, there are the Turing GPU cores, of course, but there are two other types of core that were added with this generation: RT and Tensor cores. RT cores are dedicated entirely to ray tracing operations, which means that the computationally expensive technology can be done outside of rasterization \u2013 the method by which lighting has been traditionally been rendered for the last couple of decades.\u00a0But, DLSS is all about those Tensor cores. These cores first showed up in Nvidia Volta GPUs, which were targeted at creative professionals and data centers and were focused entirely on AI workloads. While the Tensor cores found in consumer-facing Nvidia Turing cards aren't nearly as powerful as you'd see on a Tesla V100, they're still powerful enough to make a difference to average consumers.\u00a0A developer of a game that supports DLSS will upload thousands of images to a neural learning supercomputer on Nvidia's end. Then, when you play one of these games using a supported graphics card, the GPU will render the games in a lower resolution, then the Tensor cores will reference data compiled by the supercomputer to intelligently upscale the images to look as close to native resolution as possible.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The end result is upscaling that looks a lot better than the checkerboard upscaling found in the PS4 Pro or the Xbox One. The idea, after all, is to boost both visual fidelity and performance without breaking your hardware. A lot of folks, ourselves included, have traditionally set a game to 1800p when it doesn't quite run well at 4K, and DLSS is potentially the end of those days.\u00a0As a bonus, we were told by Nvidia that this isn't the full extent of what DLSS could offer in the future. When we were talking with them, we floated the idea that rather than upscaling the image from a lower res to a higher res, it would be nice to see a game that really leaned into the super-sampling, using AI to render at a higher resolution and scaling it back down, similarly to what we saw with Ubersampling in The Witcher 2.\u00a0Nvidia wouldn't confirm that any game would be coming out that did this, but they didn't deny that it was possible, so we hope we'll see DLSS used to create some truly jaw-dropping visuals in the future.\u00a0Metro Exodus supports DLSS and has for more than a year now (Image credit: Deep Silver)What games support DLSS though?Admittedly the lineup of games that actually support this technology is pretty small at the moment \u2013 even though it's grown substantially since it first launched. While by no means an exhaustive list of all the AAA and indie games that have utilized the tech, we went ahead and listed out the biggest DLSS games below.\u00a0AnthemBattlefield VControlDeliver Us the MoonFinal Fantasy XVMetro ExodusMonster Hunter WorldWolfenstein YoungbloodOver the next few months and years, we should see many more major PC games embracing the technology. We already know that upcoming heavy hitters like Cyberpunk 2077 and Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines 2 will be using Nvidia's RTX technology to some extent \u2013 we just don't know exactly what these games will do quite yet.\u00a0Image 1 of 5(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)Living in the real worldTest system specsThis is the desktop system we used for testing DLSS\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 3900X (12-core, up to 4.6GHz)\nCPU Cooler: NZXT Kraken M22\nRAM: 32GB Corsair Vengeance @ 3,200MHz\nGPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti\nMotherboard: ASRock X570 Phantom Gaming X\nSSD: Samsung 860 Evo 1TB x 2, ADATA XPG SX8200 480GB x 1\nPower Supply: EVGA SuperNOVA 1000 G+\nCase: CoolerMaster H500P MeshSo, DLSS sounds pretty freaking awesome, right? Well, it totally is - but the effectiveness of the technology kind of varies across titles. We could just leave it at that, but we have access to a bunch of sick computer hardware and a slew of games with DLSS compatibility \u2013 so we tested five of the best DLSS games ourselves to see how well the technology works and how far it's come since it first hit the streets.\u00a0We went ahead and tested DLSS in Control, Monster Hunter World, Metro Exodus, Wolfenstein Youngblood and Deliver us the Moon. Through this selection of titles we were able to see early implementations of the technology through the likes of Monster Hunter World, along with the latest versions in Deliver us the Moon and Wolfenstein.We tested all of this on our home PC with the specs listed to the right at a resolution of 3,440 x 1,440, and we took a bunch of screenshots (here's an imgur link so you can see the differences more clearly) and recorded the average framerates.\u00a0Image 1 of 2Monster Hutner World: DLSS Off(Image credit: Capcom)Monster Hutner World: DLSS On(Image credit: Capcom)Monster Hunter World wasn't the first game with DLSS compatibility, but it still represents the roughest iteration out of the bunch that we tested. Performance does see a massive uplift when it's enabled, but you'll notice that the image is far fuzzier and less detailed in the DLSS version.\u00a0On PC, this game doesn't exactly have the best reputation when it comes to optimization, however, and if you're having trouble hitting that golden 60 fps, this option might be worth it for you. The game feels so much better at this frame rate,\u00a0and is the entire reason Monster Hunter: World is so great on PC.Image 1 of 3Control No DLSS(Image credit: Remedy)Control DLSS with Render Resolution at 1,720 x 720(Image credit: Remedy)Control DLSS with Render Resolution at 2,293 x 960(Image credit: Remedy)When Control first launched, it was essentially the poster child for what Nvidia's RTX technology could do. And, while it came out far after Metro Exodus, the DLSS implementation was unfortunately not quite as good.\u00a0In this game, when you enable DLSS you choose between two rendering resolutions, and the lower one ends up making the game look extremely soft, even with the major uplift in performance. There's not much of a difference between the game rendered at 2,293 x 960 and the native resolution of 3,440 x 1,440, however, so we're getting closer to a point where it's a no brainer to recommend.\u00a0With Control, however, we'd recommend leaving DLSS off if you have the hardware to hit 60 fps at your desired resolution.\u00a0Image 1 of 2Metro Exodus No DLSS(Image credit: 4A Games)Metro Exodus DLSS(Image credit: 4A Games)Metro Exodus is technically the oldest DLSS implementation that we tested for this piece, but it's also one of the best \u2013 it shows just how talented the team over at 4A Games really is. The performance uplift isn't as big as some other titles, but the quality is very similar.\u00a0There are certainly some differences, of course. Aliasing (jagged edges) in the curtains in the back of the scene is much worse with DLSS enabled, and there is less detail, especially in smaller objects like the phone cable on the desk in front of us.\u00a0Still, when you're trying to sneak around and avoid getting murdered by a mutant, these small details probably won't be noticed.\u00a0Image 1 of 4Deliver us the Moon no DLSS(Image credit: Wired Productions)Deliver us the Moon DLSS in Performance mode(Image credit: Wired Productions)Deliver us the Moon DLSS in Balanced mode(Image credit: Wired Productions)Deliver us the Moon DLSS in Quality mode(Image credit: Wired Productions)It's a bit odd that the best DLSS implementation is found in an indie game that's been out for like a year, but that's what happened. Originally launched back in October 2019, Deliver us the Moon got a massive DLSS and ray tracing patch back at CES 2020, and it really took the game to the next level.\u00a0It also marked the first game that implemented the technology in three tiers: Performance, Balanced and Quality. And, we can tell you first hand that when it's in Quality mode, you will not be able to tell the difference between that and the game running at native resolution without DLSS \u2013 beyond the massive 38% boost to fps at least.With such a great DLSS implementation, this game simply looks phenomenal, and absolutely everyone should enable it in this game if they have the option.\u00a0Image 1 of 4Wolfenstein Youngblood No DLSS(Image credit: Bethesda Softworks)Wolfenstein Youngblood DLSS in Performance mode(Image credit: Bethesda Softworks)Wolfenstein Youngblood DLSS in Balanced mode(Image credit: Bethesda Softworks)Wolfenstein Youngblood DLSS in Quality mode(Image credit: Bethesda Softworks)Wolfenstein Youngblood got its DLSS update around the same time as Deliver us the Moon, and is another great example of how far the technology has come since its inception.\u00a0Aliasing gets bad in the Performance mode, but that's to be expected at this point. What's awesome, though, is that because this is such a fast paced game where framerate really does matter a lot, you can get upwards of 100 fps with ray tracing enabled by going with the Balanced DLSS setting at 3,440 x 1,440 (with a 2080 Ti, of course).\u00a0Where does all that leave us?It's clear that DLSS has come a long way over the last year or so, and it's certainly at a point where we here at TechRadar will be enabling it when gaming in our downtime. However, is it enough to sell potential customers on an Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics card on it's own?The answer is no, but that doesn't mean the tech isn't awesome and can't be a part of why you buy a new RTX graphics card. The tech still isn't in enough games for us to say it's absolutely essential for PC gamers to jump on to, but if you're into ray tracing and 4K gaming, it does genuinely make things better.\u00a0Coupled with hardware-accelerated ray tracing, DLSS provides something that AMD graphics cards just don't right now.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)If you\u2019ve been looking for a way to play demanding PC games without buying new hardware, Nvidia has your solution. After years in public beta, the company\u2019s GeForce Now cloud gaming service is officially launching today with both free and paid tiers. GeForce Now has a huge leg up on more well-known competitors such as Google Stadia and Microsoft Project xCloud, because it supports hundreds of popular titles, including free-to-play games such as Fortnite, Apex Legends and Destiny 2.GeForce Now has been in public beta since 2017, with more than 300,000 users allowed into the free program, which allows you to play games you already own (or buy for this purpose). As of today, any user on the Internet can register and take advantage of the free edition, which allows you to connect to the cloud service for up to an hour per session. If you sign up for the Founder\u2019s membership, which costs $4.99 per month, you can play for up to six hours in a row and you\u2019ll get priority access to the servers. The first three months of a Founder\u2019s plan are free so there\u2019s no reason right now to go with the free tier.(Image credit: Nvidia)How it Works\u00a0Having priority access to the GeForce Now servers really matters, because in my experience using the service in beta extensively in 2019, the cloud service often failed to connect or denied me entry because too many people were logged on at once.\u00a0Founder members also have the ability to play games with RTX ray tracing turned on. GeForce Now currently supports a number of ray tracing titles including Metro Exodus and Wolftenstein Youngblood, though Battlefield V and Control were not in the database of available titles at press time.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)Unlike Stadia, which only supports a handful of games, GeForce Now supports over 1,000 titles, with more being added all the time. The service doesn\u2019t come with any games, but will run those you buy (or have bought) on Steam, Epic, Uplay or Battle.net \u2014 note that Origin, GoG, Microsoft Store and other launchers are not presently supported. Compare that to Stadia which has only about three dozen games right now.Of the 1,000-plus titles, several hundred are \"instant access,\" which means that they are always available to launch (and are up-to-date) on Nvidia's servers. The rest are single-session installs, which means that you need to have the system reinstall them every time you start a new session.The minimum hardware requirements for GeForce Now are so low that you can run it on even the cheapest Windows computer. To run on a PC, you need any dual-core or better CPU, 4GB of RAM, and a GPU that can handle DirectX 11, which even low-end, integrated graphics processors support. You can also run the cloud gaming service on Macs that date back as far as 2009 or on Android devices. To play on your TV, you can use one of Nvidia\u2019s own Android-powered Shield set-top boxes.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The one catch (which applies to all cloud streaming services) is that you need a stable Internet connection that\u2019s at least 15 Mbps, which operates over either Wi-Fi 5 (aka 802.11ac) or higher wireless, or Ethernet. The service is unlikely to work well over 4G and you need to have really good Wi-Fi coverage.How it Plays\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)During 2019, I tested GeForce Now at my house over the course of several months in 2019, with a 75 Mbps Internet connection and an 802.11ac router. It often took a while to get a connection and often I would get messages saying I had a poor connection and the sharp images in games would blur. This weekend, I tested again briefly, using both a PC laptop and an Android tablet, and the image quality was solid, but some of my connection attempts failed and I had to re-try to get in.I tried again at my office this week, connecting via 802.11ac to a line that had more than 140 Mbps up and down, but each time I connected, I had to wait a long time for a connection test and I got a warning message telling me that my connection was spotty, the same warning I was getting at home. I chose the option to Continue despite the warnings and, though games were playable, they were often blurry and laggy.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)I fired up a game of Metro Exodus and the images kept blurring and sharpening. According to Fraps, frame rates ranged from 60 fps (when nothing was happening) down to a jerky 15 fps at times, but most often when I was walking around they were in the 30 to 40 fps range.\u00a0The experience felt both jerky and blurry, but didn't get noticeably \u00a0worse when I turned on RTX . However, with the general darkness and bluriness, there was no way to see if ray tracing was working. Eventually, the game stopped and I got a message saying \"The game stopped due to a spotty connection.\"(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Having used the service on two different Internet connections (home and work) that otherwise achieve high speeds, I am concerned that the connection problems were not on my end but Nvidia's. I tested primarily with my Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (6th Gen), a Samsung tablet and, over the summer, with Nvidia's Shield TV. However, now that the product is out of beta, I'm going to keep trying it and use it on more devices and networks to see if my experience is representative or not.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)With the new session length rules and prioritization system, hopefully it will be easier to get a good connection to GeForce Now. However, with just one hour of session time for free accounts, anyone who\u2019s even remotely serious about gaming will want to get the Founder membership with its 6-hour limit.\u00a0Nvidia says that there will be no waiting period for starting a new session so, if you\u2019ve gotten through 6 hours and want to start again, you can connect again right away. To help you remember to save before you get kicked off, there will be on-screen warnings that start 40 minutes before you reach your session time limit.Bottom Line(Image credit: Nvidia)If you can get a strong connection and maintain it, GeForce Now is really impressive. \u00a0It allowed my son and I to play games ranging from Lego D.C. Villains to Metro Exodus on devices that should have no business playing any kind of game. My ThinkPad X1 Carbon is an ultrabook with integrated Intel graphics, but with GeForce Now, it can be a gaming rig.\u00a0Lego Worlds doesn\u2019t exist for Android, but my son was able to run the PC version of it on his low-end Samsung Tab A tablet, without a hitch. When using GeForce Now on a mobile device, you can either use an on-screen controller, or pair your device with a real Bluetooth \u00a0controller. It almost goes without saying, but we found that using an XBox One controller was preferable to using the on-screen one.Of the current crop of cloud gaming services, GeForce Now seems like the most versatile, because of its broad device and software support. \u00a0Provided that Nvidia's Servers and your Internet connection get along, you can game on just about any device, allowing people who don\u2019t have the latest discrete graphics to get high frame rates and even ray tracing. Even if you have a good gaming PC at home, GeForce Now could let you play your favorite titles on your phone or non-gaming laptop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nMicrosoft\nSteam\nICloud\nInternet\nDirectX\nGeForce\nCloud Computing\nray tracing\nGaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (12)\n\n\n\nAvram PiltchSocial Links NavigationAvram Piltch is Tom's Hardware's editor-in-chief.

I think it is rather unfair to make a negative comment about NVidia's streaming service when it was only tested over WiFi. There are way too many variables to get into about a WiFi connection. I don't mean to say that I know everything, but from what I understand, most competitive gamers, especially in first person shooters, will have their gaming computer hooked up with a wired connection. And that is playing the game on the system locally, not streaming.\nTomsHardware is usually really thorough in testing a lot of their things. It just struck me as rather odd to say that it was tested on two different Internet connections, but only through WiFi. I have a gaming laptop myself, Alienware, and I can have it set up 12\" away from an AC Router and my ping will always be higher than a wired connection, and the transfer rate will always fluctuate.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKing_V\n\n\nUnless Nvidia is recommending it as good enough to deliver quality gameplay over WiFi.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiroro\n\n\nmac_angel said:True.

There's gamers who's gaming PCs used to be good but have gone obsolete, I can't help but think Nvidia could make more money than $60/year by getting them back into the cycle of buying $300+ GPUs.\nIs there even a point to using it around the house, like on a TV if you have a good PC in the other room that you don't want to sit at? I thought Nvidia has a thing where you can stream local games from your PC without buying into a service. I thought that was what the Shield was originally for.\nI'm not really sure about that, but I am sure that Nvidia is going to try to get this working for as many people as possible, as quickly as they can.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNP\n\n\nSounds like a perfectly nice steaming pile of crap. I would rather get punched in the face than get in the business of paying for \"playing\" laggy, patchy, blurred games topping at ~45fps. shudders\nDon't get me wrong. I will definitely look into cloud gaming in the future. Like in the 2030s or something.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nubercake\n\n\nThe benefit of this type of service is you don't need the expensive hardware.\n\nThe problem - aside from input lag, connection issues and other technical issues - is ISP data caps. If you don't have one yet, you will. My ISP offers a package for unlimited data usage for an additional $50/month (on top of the regular internet plan charge).\n\nThese streaming gaming services not only require the data for communicating your actions (as with a standard connection to the game server), but also data involved in with the hi-res video that a high-end PC would normally generate locally (not requiring transmission over your connection); hence the need for the recommend 15Mbps minimum. You would think these streaming gaming services would have struck a deal with the ISPs by now to share the wealth and increase subscribership out of the chute. Imagine... Xfinity Gaming Plus package for only $200/month.\n\nOnce streaming gaming is worth a darn (without regular performance drops), this whole discussion becomes a rent versus own situation. All vendors involved are going to get their money one way or another. Do you want to give it to them up front and save a little? Or have them take it from you monthly while seemingly saving in the short-term?\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnpombrio\n\n\nThis $5/month subscription price is VERY misleading. It is an introductory price for the Founders Edition ONLY and is good for up to a year. After that time, we will need to join the Premier memberships plan and NVidia has not yet published what that price will be.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 12 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsus' mini supercomputer taps Nvidia Grace Blackwell chip for 1,000 AI TOPS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHP's new Omen 16 Slim goes up to an RTX 5070 and is 16% slimmer than its predecessor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHP updates its OmniBook X line with a lattice-free keyboard, processors from AMD and Intel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Jensen Huang\u2019s Nvidia GTC 2025 keynote here \u2014 Blackwell 300 AI GPUs expected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU meets PCIe-based hard drives: Seagate and Nvidia demo NVMe HDDs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD's beastly Ryzen AI Max+ 395 comes to a new GMKTec mini-PC, and AMD's Lisa Su appears to approve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel finally releases the XeSS 2.0 SDK for developers \u2014 Technology still gated by closed-source barriers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070-series GPU supply to stabilize after April claims AIB partner Yeston\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew undersea cable tech listens for sabotage \u2014 can be retrofitted to existing fiber optic lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm debuts new Snapdragon G handheld gaming PC chips to compete with Intel and AMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

The company's next-generation SUPER graphics cards are (finally) making their way onto the laptop side of things and will be available starting May. The embargo for this information is currently scheduled to lift on 3/31 along with Intel's 10th generation mobility processors (although NVIDIA/Intel can easily move this date around as they have done in the past). It looks like NVIDIA is introducing at least 6 (there may be more) new graphics cards into its mobility space to replace existing lineups. From the timeline given in the documents I have with me, these parts should be available starting April.\nPowerful NVIDIA's SUPER mobility graphics cards landing soon, will be announced on 3/31 and be available for the same price\nAs you might have noticed, NVIDIA has teamed up with Intel and the NDA is scheduled to lift on the exact same date as the 10th generation CPU launch. According to the information I have NVIDIA is planning to introduce at least 6 new chips at the same price points as their older variants. This means that gamers will very soon have access to a higher tier of power in the same budget.\nGeForce GTX 1650 4GB GDDR6 mobility GPU (new)\nThe GeForce GTX 1650 4GB GDDR6 mobility GPU is going to be replacing the standard GTX 1050 3GB GDDR5 card found in most entry-level gaming notebooks. Not only is it a much more powerful chip than the GTX 1050 and has an additional Gigabyte of memory but this is a new 1650 chip that ships with GDDR6 instead of GDDR5.\nGeForce GTX 1650 Ti 4GB GDDR6 mobility GPU (new)\nThe GeForce GTX 1650 Ti 4GB GDDR6 mobility GPU is going to be replacing the standard GTX 1650 4GB GDDR5 card - which constitutes the company's slightly more expensive entry-level gaming lineup based on the Turing architecture. The GTX 1650 Ti is going to have a much higher core count and will be shipping with GDDR6 memory instead of GDDR5.\nGeForce RTX 2060 6GB GDDR6 mobility GPU (new)\nThis is a slightly odd entry. A new variant of the RTX 2060 appears to be replacing the older RTX 2060. I do see in the documentation that this is a brand new chip, but it appears to have the same name as its predecessor. This is likely a misspelled SUPER variant and/or a higher clocked/better-binned GPU. We are not yet sure how this compares to the older RTX 2060.\nGeForce RTX 2070 8GB GDDR6 mobility GPU (new)\nThe RTX 2070 is going to be replaced by two new chips. The first chip appears to be virtually identical to the older variant as far as nomenclature goes. This is likely a higher clocked/better-binned GPU. We are not yet sure how this compares to the older RTX 2070.\nGeForce RTX 2070 SUPER 8GB GDDR6 mobility GPU (new)\nThe RTX 2070 SUPER is the second chip that will be replacing the older RTX 2070 (likely at the higher end of the price point). It is going to be more powerful than the vanilla 2070 and will available in roughly the same price point as the older 2070.\nGeForce RTX 2080 SUPER 8GB GDDR6 mobility GPU (new)\nThe RTX 2080 SUPER 8GB GDDR6 is going to be replacing the vanilla RTX 2080 part. This is going to be a more powerful GPU available at roughly the same price point.\n\n\n\nExisting NVIDIA Mobility CardNew NVIDIA Mobility Card\n\n\n\n\nGeForce GTX 1050 3GB GDDR5GeForce GTX 1650 4GB GDDR6\n\n\nGeForce GTX 1650 4GB GDDR5GeForce GTX 1650 Ti 4GB GDDR6\n\n\nGeForce RTX 2060 6GB GDDR6GeForce RTX 2060 (SUPER?) 6GB GDDR6\n\n\nGeForce RTX 2070 8GB GDDR6GeForce RTX 2070 8GB GDDR6 and GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER 8GB GDDR6\n\n\nGeForce RTX 2080 8GB GDDR6GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER 8GB GDDR6\n\n\n\nIntel is going to be entering the dGPU mobility market this year as well and NVIDIA seems to be reacting in advance by lowering their performance per dollar asking price for GPUs (roughly $50-100 for the same performance). With these new replacements, gamers will have access to more affordable gaming laptops and even entry-level SKUs will ship with a powerful GTX 1650 graphics card with GDDR6 memory. This also fits into NVIDIA's overall masterplan to increase the TAM (total available market) for laptops and make them portable gaming powerhouses.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n133\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n91\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n87\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n44\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n37\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1144\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorFeb 28, 2020, 07:36am ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 5 years old.If you're a 1080p PC gamer and want to hit the highest high frame rates for $300 or less, then you currently have two options: Nvidia's GeForce RTX 2060 or AMD's Radeon RX 5600 XT. The latter might seem like an odd choice to compare against the Nvidia GPU seeing as only eight months ago we were comparing AMD's RX 5700 against it. Since then, though, Nvidia has lopped around $50 off the RTX 2060 depending on where you are, and this is mainly in response to the card I'm reviewing today - the RX 5600 XT.\nAMD Radeon RX 5600 XT vs Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060Antony Leather\n\nNow that prices have settled down and most of us have got our heads around the VBIOS update for the AMD GPU (all tests below were carried out with it in place), it's time to take a look in a smattering of games to see which card is worth your cash if you're looking to get maximum FPS at 1080p. If you're totally unaware of the VBIOS update, then the short story is that following Nvidia reducing the price of the RTX 2060, AMD decided to boost the specs of the RX 5600 XT to make it more attractive.\n\nBy increasing the power limit, core and memory speeds (the Sapphire RX 5600 XT Pulse I used here saw its boost clock rise from 1,620MHz to 1,750MHz and memory speed from 12Gbps to 14 Gbps) AMD added up to 20% more performance. The down side is that most reviewer samples lacked the VBIOS and more importantly, so do many retail samples. Thankfully, it's extremely easy to do, with Sapphire's update process well documented on its website and was accomplished in a few clicks.\n\nSapphire Radeon RX 5600 XT PulseAntony Leather\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nToday, I'll be mostly be talking about the RTX 2060 FE and RX 5600 XT, but I've included a few other cards in the graphs too for comparison and I'm glad I did as the two cards performed so similarly in most tests that you'd be right to suspect my system was CPU limited.\n\n\nTest systemMSI's MEG Z390 Ace motherboardAntony Leather\n\n\nMSI's Z390 Ace motherboard\u00a0\nCPU:\u00a0Intel Core i9-9900KS\nMotherboard: MSI MEG Z390 Ace (latest BIOS and CPU security microcode updates)\nMemory: Corsair 3466MHz Vengeance Pro RGB\nSSD: 1TB Intel 760p NVMe SSD\nPSU: Corsair RM850i\nCooler: EK Waterblocks EK-MLC Phoenix\nOS: Windows 10 (November 2019 update)\nNvidia driver: 442.19. AMD driver: 20.2.1\nBenchmarks\nI record 99th percentile frame times during a benchmark scene and than simply divide 1000 by this figure to get an equivalent frame rate. If you want to see the frame times for a particular result, divide 1000 by the frame rates below to get the 99th percentile frame times.Ghost Recon Breakpoint benchmarkAntony Leather\nThe Ghost Recon benchmark at these settings uses more VRAM than the RX 5600 XT has, tipping the scales at around 6.5GB according to the pre-benchmark settings page and is why the 4GB version of the RX 5500 XT performs so poorly compared to its 8GB sibling. The fact the RX 5600 XT only has 6GB has been a regularly-voiced concern when I've read comments elsewhere, but Nvidia is in a similar boat with the RTX 2060. The difference here is tiny - you wouldn't pick one card over the other for raw performance, but you'll also see significant gains over other 1080p-focussed cards such as the GTX 1660, especially on the average 99th percentile.Metro Exodus benchmarkAntony Leather\nMetro Exodus is a tough game to run smoothly but the extra cash spent over the likes of the GTX 1660 and RX 5500 XT are very evident here. However, once again, the two cards could barely be more similar, offering up results within a frame of each other.Far Cry New Dawn BenchmarkAntony Leather\nFinally, in Far Cry New Dawn, there was a bit of a lead for AMD, especially when it came to the average 99th percentile frame rate. If you spend most of your time here the it's one of just two games I've tested that offers a compelling reason to go with the RX 5600 XT.Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmarkAntony Leather\nShadow of the Tomb Raider saw some significant gains over the cheaper GPUs on test with far more of a difference than in any other game with near double-digit gains over the RX 5500 XT 4GB. Again, though, there was next to no difference between the RX 5600 XT and RTX 2060.The Division 2 benchmarkAntony Leather\nFinally, Division 2 was another title to give AMD a small lead, which approached 10 percent on the 99th percentile minimum, while both cards had averages approaching 100fps.\nConclusion\nAMD's VBIOS shenanigans aside, what we have here are two similarly-priced, near identical-performing graphics cards when the latest drivers are used. You can pick up RTX 2060's for around $300-320 now quite easily, but AMD does have a slight lead with several models retailing for as little as $280. Admittedly, the Sapphire RX 5600 XT Pulse I used here will set you back the full $300 though, but this is still a sizeable saving over the RX 5700 plus I used a Founders Edition Nvidia card - not a stock speed model.AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT and Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060Antony Leather\nLooking around at other benchmarks, it's clear that the Radeon RX 5700 doesn't offer significantly more performance elsewhere either, yet demands noticeably more cash, meaning that if you have around $300 to spend, the choice should be between these two cards if you're buying new.\nThere's little to choose between them in terms of noise - my RTX 2060 FE was supremely quiet, but thanks to its large heatsink and dual fans, so was the Sapphire Radeon RX 5600 XT. This leaves just Ray Tracing and DLSS as Nvidia's trump cards, but that will come down to personal preference. Indeed, so does the final choice - get the card that performs best in the games you play because overall there's very little between them.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

On one hand, the utopian vision of high-end gaming experiences being available to anyone, potentially on any device, is intriguing\u2014inspiring even. On the other hand, the intangibility of cloud-based gaming makes it a hard sell. Call me old-fashioned, but the idea of playing a game\u2014properly playing it, from start to finish\u2014via stream is fundamentally unappealing. There\u2019s too many unstable factors to rely on: it feels like crossing a rickety rope-bridge that could give way at any moment. It\u2019s why I paid no mind to Google Stadia: I was curious, sure, but not enough to buy into a service and then purchase games that would inevitably be inferior to their traditional counterparts. Now, though, NVIDIA has launched its competing service with an altogether more tempting (and reasonable) business model: GeForce Now. Instead of charging for each title separately, GeForce Now connects to existing game clients (like Steam or Uplay) and runs those clients\u2019 version of any given game. This means that there won\u2019t be any exclusive \u2018GeForce Now games\u2019, as they\u2019re all literally just PC titles being run remotely. On top of this, membership is only \u00a35 per month for \u2018founders\u2019\u2014essentially early adopters\u2014with a free tier of membership for players happy with restricted access to the service. With all of this in mind, and a free trial on offer for the \u2018founders\u2019 membership tier, I decided to challenge my prejudices against game streaming and finally give it a fair shake. Will my issues with the technology melt away in a humbling experience that teaches me the value of open-mindedness? Or will it fail to meet even my lowest of expectations, forever souring me on the phrase \u201ccloud-based gaming\u201d? I\u2019m in a funny situation with regards to PC gaming: I had a decent PC setup in the past with a hefty Steam account to match; sadly, I was forced to sell my machine several years ago. Since then, I\u2019ve made-do with a cheap-but-cheerful laptop for general Windows usage and have stuck to consoles for my gaming fix. This means that there are hundreds of games gathering virtual dust in my Steam account that stand no real chance of being played\u2026 until now. Thanks to GeForce Now, I should\u2014in theory\u2014be able to access large chunks of my precious Steam library on any compatible device (for me, it was to be an Android tablet). And so, with the thought of hundreds of unplayed Steam games in my mind, I eagerly downloaded the GeForce Now app and went through the somewhat laborious process of making an account, linking my long-neglected Steam account and individually \u2018adding\u2019 every officially supported game to my GeForce Now library. That last step felt needless, as if I were missing some handy \u2018add my entire library\u2019 tool; but, as far as I can tell, I was following GeForce Now procedure to a tee. Regardless, it wasn\u2019t long before I was all set up and ready to go, with a hankering to kill some no-good Nazi scum... Wolfenstein: Old Blood  The first game I booted up was Wolfenstein: Old Blood, for no particular reason other than the fact that it was reasonably demanding and I recalled enjoying it upon release. With my passable but not stellar internet speed (30-40Mbps download), I was initially impressed: there was some occasional fuzziness that gave things a \u20182008 low-res YouTube\u2019 vibe; for the most part however, the experience was playable\u2014enjoyable even. Sadly, issues arose when the action kicked into high gear: the slight amount of input lag that passed unnoticed in the slower sections had become an issue that noticeably affected my in-game performance. The fast pace of movement and first-person perspective didn\u2019t help matters. It wasn\u2019t impossible, but the game was definitely harder to play than Machine Games intended; a bump down to \u2018easy mode\u2019 would have been necessary if I was to continue playing. Luckily, I didn\u2019t, because this is where I called it quits and moved onto the next game: Red Faction Guerilla Re-Mars-tered (apologies on behalf of THQ Nordic for that name). Red Faction Guerilla Re-Mars-tered  Out of everything I tried out in this\u2014far from comprehensive\u2014GeForce Now experiment, Red Faction Guerilla was undoubtedly the best, at least performance-wise. Ironically, it\u2019s also the one game discussed here that isn\u2019t officially supported by the service\u2019s instant launch feature, requiring a full download of the game before it would start-up (at 400Mbps, however, that didn\u2019t take long). In my half an hour spent blowing up military structures, shooting folks in faces and driving cars through walls, I can genuinely claim that I noticed zero impactful signs of the game being streamed. Except for the aforementioned occasional \u2018YouTube\u2019 fuzziness, I would dare say that there were no signs of streaming at all. In all honesty, my pleasant experience here is tempting me into replaying the game entirely, and I very well might. My non-educated assumption is that the third-person perspective, combined with the game\u2019s slower pace, makes for a superior action gameplay experience than Wolfenstein offers. It goes without saying that point-and-click games and visual novels would work best with the technology; however, as far as action games go, you couldn\u2019t ask for more than this. Saints Row IV  Saints Row IV was third up on my afternoon with GeForce Now: another game from Volition and one of my favourite open world titles of all time. Many of my observations regarding Guerilla also apply here, with a few interesting things to note. As a faster game with superpowered movement mechanics, the input lag was just barely noticeable, but noticeable nonetheless: not as bad as Wolfenstein but worse than Guerilla. With a gun to my head, I\u2019d be happy to play through the title with this minute level of imperfection; but, unlike with Volition\u2019s Mars-based shooter, I\u2019m not actually tempted to do so. It seems that, regardless of any tangible effect on gameplay, the signs of streaming are enough to turn me off a gaming experience. Perhaps it\u2019s unfair, but I can\u2019t seem to break past how streaming games mentally \u2018cheapens\u2019 them for me.  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive  Finally, I thought it necessary to give some multiplayer a try with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). Honestly, I wish I hadn\u2019t: it was the only unplayable game I booted up with GeForce Now. Obviously, I didn\u2019t expect to keep up competitively (not that I ever could), but I struggled to land so much as a single shot over the course of two complete matches. It\u2019s always possible that I just got unlucky with dodgy connection at a bad time, but I doubt it. Streaming multiplayer games should not, I repeat NOT, be your first choice under any circumstances. Verdict NVIDIA hasn\u2019t blown me away with GeForce Now, but it has made me question my rash dismissal of game streaming. Right now, there are several factors in any given game that I feel determine its suitability for streaming: pace of gameplay, perspective, multiplayer components etc. And for a game with enough of these factors leaning in the right direction (Red Faction Guerilla, for example), I\u2019d have absolutely no issues spending an evening relying on NVIDIA\u2019s infrastructure. However, the quantity of games that fail to meet that requirement is significant, and for that reason I\u2019m still not ready to put my faith in the power of the cloud.

That\u2019s the vision that inspired our journey to develop GeForce NOW into an open platform that welcomed gamers, developers and publishers.\nFor gamers, we provide the power of a GeForce GPU to play the games you love from the cloud.\nFor developers, we used our beta phase to show how GeForce NOW could expand a game\u2019s audience to low-end PC laptops, Mac computers, Android devices and, soon, to Chromebooks, without any porting effort.\nFor publishers, we connected gamers directly to game stores, so they maintain control of their content and we stay out of their economics.\nMany in the games industry are riding the wave of excitement GeForce NOW has generated. And we\u2019re just getting started.\nA New Frontier\nEarlier this month, we passed a milestone on our cloud gaming journey by removing the waitlist and opening our doors to more gamers. Over 1 million new gamers have taken to the cloud by signing up for a free plan or upgrading to the Founders membership, which includes a 90-day free trial.\nThis trial is an important transitional period where gamers, developers and publishers can try the premium experience with minimal commitment while we continue to refine our offering.\nAs we approach a paid service, some publishers may choose to remove games before the trial period ends. Ultimately, they maintain control over their content and decide whether the game you purchase includes streaming on GeForce NOW. Meanwhile, others will bring games back as they continue to realize GeForce NOW\u2019s value (stay tuned for more on that).\nAs the transition period comes to completion, game removals should be few and far between, with new games added to GeForce NOW each week.\nA Fresh Horizon\nCountless developers and publishers are embracing the opportunity to expand the number of gamers who can play their games on GeForce NOW.\nLook no further than the recent news that the most anticipated game of 2020, CD PROJEKT RED\u2019s Cyberpunk 2077, will be available on GeForce NOW the day it\u2019s released. That adds to the hundreds of great games currently instantly available, among them: 30 of the biggest, most played free-to-play games \u2014 including Fortnite from Epic Games, League of Legends from Riot, Warframe from Digital Extremes and World of Tanks from Wargaming.\nAnd we have an additional 1,500 games in our onboarding queue, from publishers that share a vision of expanding PC gaming to more people.\nThe world\u2019s largest gaming platform \u2014 PC gaming \u2014 continues to evolve. We\u2019re looking forward to giving this power to even more players, and ushering in a new generation of PC gamers.\nAs gamers ourselves, nothing sounds better.\n\n\nCategories: GamingTags: Cloud Gaming | GeForce NOW \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Joanne Poh   18 February 2020             Cost of Living in Singapore (2020) \u2014 Is Your Salary Really Enough?   Singapore is always appearing at the top of those cost-of-living surveys. But how expensive is it really to live here? If you\u2019re a young working adult or potential expat thinking of accepting that job offer in Singapore, you must be wondering just how much is \u201creasonable\u201d for someone in your age group to spend each month.  Of course, the answer varies a lot with your lifestyle and values. Ask the guy who\u2019s happy to live with his parents at 40 and who rarely leaves the house for anything other than work, and you\u2019ll get a different answer than if you ask that social climber who feels you need the flashy car and condo to show you\u2019ve \u201cmade it\u201d in life. So in compiling this rundown of the cost of living in Singapore, we decided to cover a range of options (from budget to higher-end) for a middle-class lifestyle. All costs are in Singapore dollars. Housing costs If you\u2019re moving here from another country, or a local thinking of moving out of your parent\u2019s home, your biggest expense by far is going to be housing, whether you\u2019re renting or buying a home. You should budget at least $700 to $1,500 a month if you\u2019re renting, and $1,500 to $3,000 a month if you\u2019re a Singaporean/PR buying a home and eligible to purchase HDB property. Renting in Singapore Most expats rent a home in Singapore. Be warned \u2013 it\u2019s not cheap. If you\u2019re single and looking to rent just a room in a shared HDB flat (public housing) or a condo apartment (private) with shared bathroom, expect to pay about $700 to $2,000 each month. Don\u2019t like to share? It\u2019ll cost ya. It costs about $1,500 to $4,500 to rent a studio apartment or one-bedroom unit in an HDB flat or condo. The big difference in cost depends on property type \u2013 HDB flats are cheaper but basic, condo apartments are expensive but swankier and sometimes have gyms/pools.  Another factor is distance to the city centre \u2013 the more centrally located, the more expensive it is. The public transport system in Singapore isn\u2019t bad, though, so you can save some money by renting a place in the city fringe. As a plus, neighbourhoods away from the city centre have more character and cheaper dining options. As a renter, be aware that some landlords won\u2019t allow you to cook when they are living in the same unit as you, which means you\u2019ll be forced to eat out or order food every day. If you are allergic to rules but can\u2019t afford to live alone, look for an apartment that\u2019s occupied only by fellow tenants. Buying a home If you\u2019re a Singaporean or PR looking to buy a home, you\u2019ll be looking buying either an HDB flat (you must apply with your fianc\u00e9(e) and be prepared to get married by the time you collect your keys) or private property.   Story continues New HDB property is highly subsidised and you\u2019ll be eligible for grants calculated depending on your income level. For resale property, prices can get quite high in the more central areas.And if you\u2019re thinking about purchase private property, you\u2019ll need to be prepared to service a huge home loan unless you have a large income.In general, for resale property you can expect to pay anywhere from about $300,000 for a 3-room HDB flat to millions for private property, with the average condo unit costing about $1 million+.Assuming you pay a minimum 10% downpayment for an HDB lat or 20% downpayment for a private home, and take out a 25-year-loan, you can expect to pay anywhere from $1,500 to $4,500 per month in loan installments for homes within that price range.Transportation costsAs with everything else in life, your monthly transportation costs can vary wildly depending on how far you need to travel each day and what mode of transport you use. If you\u2019re lucky enough to be living close to your workplace and the city centre, you\u2019ll spend less on transport than someone who lives in Woodlands and has to commute to the CBD daily.Unless you have quite a bit of disposable income, buying a car in Singapore isn\u2019t a very good idea. They\u2019re famously expensive here and will set you back an extra $1,000 to $2,000 a month (car loan installments, petrol and parking).You are likely to rely on a combination of public transport (buses and MRT) and taxi (or Grab) rides. Public transport is pretty affordable, generally costing about $100 to $120 a month.But if you stay out past midnight, there are hardly any public transport options (well, there are weekend night buses, but they unceremoniously stop running at about 2am).Need to get to Changi Airport for a 6am flight? Or trying to get home after a drinks session at 1am on a Wednesday night? Grab or taxis are your only choices. Assuming you take a $15 Grab ride twice a week, you\u2019ll need to budget an additional $120 a month on transport. (Yes, those rides really add up.)Daily expensesAgain, this varies wildly depending on your lifestyle. But you can expect the following costs:Groceries \u2013 This might be more expensive than in many countries due to lots of products being imported. Milk, non-tropical fruits and non-Asian products like cheese tend to be rather expensive. If you cook at home every day, you\u2019ll probably spend at least $200 a month on groceries.Coffee \u2013 A kopi at a local hawker centre can cost you a little more than $1, while a coffee at a Western-style cafe or a chain like Starbucks can set you back $5 or $6.Food \u2013 On one end of the scale, a meal at a suburban hawker centre can cost as little as $3 to $4 (not including drinks). When it comes to dining, budget about $20 to $30 for a meal at a midrange restaurant.Mobile data \u2013 $20 a month for a basic SIM-only plan. If you need unlimited data, talktime, etc, you\u2019ll pay about $25 to $30.Exercise \u2013 Gym and other sports/exercise classes tend to be quite expensive in Singapore, and what is considered a reasonable price-range for a gym membership or weekly class might be about $100 a month.Recreation \u2013 Movie tickets cost about $9 on weekdays and $13 on weekends. Alcohol is horribly expensive, with a pint of beer at a bar in the city centre going for about $10 to $15. And a karaoke session (sans alcohol) in a private room will set you back about $25 to $35 per person.If you\u2019re on a budget, make friends who don\u2019t always need to be seen in fancy places, so you can BYOB and enjoy cheaper activities like picnics, cycling, hiking or Netflix ($10.98 a month for basic subscription).Nice-to-haves that can really inflate your costsThe thing about Singapore is that you can save lots of money living a monk\u2019s lifestyle (eg. never drinking, always taking public transport). But once you take a few liberties, your cost of living skyrockets.Here are some little luxuries that can really inflate your monthly costs.Expensive gym memberships \u2013 These are typically $100 to $150 a month, but can get even more expensive if they specialise in MMA or something. Don\u2019t sign up for one of these unless you\u2019re already a gym rat, because you are usually forced to register for one or two years at a time.Dining at nice restaurants \u2013 Singapore is filled with fancy restaurants, and a meal at one of these can easily set you back $50 or more per person if you order wine.Dating \u2013 Easy tiger, you might want to swipe a little more slowly on Tinder. If you\u2019re into the dinner-and-drinks date night combo, you can easily spend $50 or more per person in a single night, depending on how expensive your/their tastes are.Travelling \u2013 Singapore is just a budget flight away from some of Southeast Asia\u2019s most popular travel destinations. But bearing in mind that a single weekend trip to Phuket or Bangkok can cost you at least $200, indulge in moderation.So, how much can you expect to spend?Depending on your lifestyle, here are your potential costs per month.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

The two properties have a balance lease term of around 32 years and 34 years respectively. According to URA Master Plan 2019, they are zoned for \u2018Business 1\u2019 use with a plot ratio of 2.5. Both properties will be sold with vacant possession.  Situated within an established industrial park area that is surrounded by housing estates, the Yishun industrial properties have prominent dual road frontage along Yishun Industrial Park A and Yishun Avenue 8. The Yishun industrial properties are within a short drive to Canberra and Yishun MRT stations and have convenient access to amenities and services at nearby markets, food centres and shopping malls. Major roads and expressways, including Yishun Avenue 2, Seletar Expressway (SLE) and Tampines Expressway (TPE), provide connectivity to other parts of Singapore. Executive director of investment advisory, Tan Chun Ming, commented, \u201cSites with a remaining lease tenure of more than 30 years are rarely available for sale. Given its attributes, the subject properties might be ideal for companies looking to expand or consolidate their operations within the Yishun area. The sites\u2019 existing gross floor areas are low and have the potential to be refurbished or redeveloped to a maximum total gross floor area of approximately 358,605 sq ft.\u201d  The indicative guide prices for No. 539 and No. 543 are $9.8 million and $19.2 million respectively. Parties are welcome to submit offers for either one or both Yishun industrial properties. The EOI exercise for the Yishun industrial properties will close on Wednesday, 18 March 2020 at 3pm. The latest JTC industrial property market statistics showed that overall rents across Singapore\u2019s industrial sector remained unchanged quarter-on-quarter (QOQ) in Q4 2019, the second straight quarter of no-change. For the full year 2019, industrial sector rents were up 0.1% year-on-year (YOY), mainly due to the improvement in business parks. Commenting on the industrial market performance in the last quarter of 2019, Mr Desmond Sim, CBRE\u2019s Head of Research for Southeast Asia, said, \u201cthe factory submarket displayed mixed performances this quarter. The JTC Single-User Factory Rental Index inched up by 0.1% q-o-q, whereas occupancy rate fell by 0.3 percentage points q-o-q to 90.8%, partly because of excess supply from previous quarters which is still in the midst of being absorbed by the market.\u201d   Story continues The JTC Multiple-User Factory Rental Index on the other hand eased by 0.1% q-o-q, which can be mainly attributed to the West region where a large pool of existing vacant stock remains; this is despite that the islandwide occupancy rate increased by 0.4 percentage points q-o-q to 87.5%.Mr Sim added, \u201cThe warehouse sector saw an improvement from its slowdown from preceding quarters, with the JTC Warehouse Rental Index edging up by 0.1% q-o-q. However, it was also noted that warehouse occupancy dipped marginally by 0.1 percentage points q-o-q to 88.0%. Nonetheless, it is likely that the tight upcoming warehouse supply will lend support to occupancy.\u201dCBRE said that moving forward, with overall industrial rents remaining unchanged this quarter, there is some optimism that rents may have bottomed out in the industrial market.CBRE Research is of the view that warehouse rents are poised to be more resilient, supported by a limited supply pipeline. Meanwhile, factory rents are expected to stay flat in 2020, suppressed by a prevailing vacancy volume of 40.1 million sq ft and a substantial amount of upcoming multiple-user factory stock.Dominic Peters, Senior Director of Industrial Services at Colliers International, commenting on industrial market said:\u201cThe Singapore manufacturing sector is expected to improve slowly in the coming quarters on the back of a gradual recovery of the global electronics cycle, driven by the normalisation of inventory in the global electronics supply chains, and the adoption of 5G technologies in telecommunication equipment and smartphones. However, with new supply of factory space in 2020 remaining sizable at around 15.6 million sq ft (net) \u2013 equivalent to about 4% of current factory stock \u2013 we anticipate that overall factory rent will likely remain subdued as supply outstrips demand in 2020.Warehouse supply is set to increase to 3.6 million sq ft in 2020 (net) \u2013 equivalent to about 3% of current warehouse stock. Given the challenging global trade outlook and the elevated vacancy rate of 12.0% at the end of 2019, we expect warehouse rent to remain soft, stabilising in 2020-2021 before recovering from 2022 as supply diminishes.Meanwhile, we forecast the flight to quality in business park and high-specs segments to continue due to limited supply amid higher demand for premium space. Centrally-located business parks and high-spec buildings with good amenities should attract healthy demand while those older and further away from MRT stations in the suburbs could face more difficulty in finding tenants, despite lower rents. Overall, we expect business park and high-specs rents to see slight upticks in the coming quarters, increasing by 1-2% YOY by the end of 2020.\u201dBrenda Ong, Cushman & Wakefield\u2019s executive director and head of logistics and industrial, said she expects industrial rents for multi-user factories and single-user factories to moderate against an increase in supply in 2020.Ms Ong added, \u201cThe single-user factory segment recorded some negative absorption as industrialists gave up or reduced their footprints in the space required for their business. Warehouse rents are also expected to stabilise and increase marginally because of healthy take-up in the past year, which we envisage will continue in 2020.\u201dBut Tay Huey Ying, head of research and consultancy at JLL Singapore, says: \u201cThe industrial property market remains exposed to downside risks in 2020. While there are nascent signs of a turnaround in the manufacturing sector and economic growth is expected to pick up in 2020, this could be derailed by unexpected external events such as the Wuhan virus.\u201dShe added: \u201cBarring any unforeseen external shocks, we expect demand prospects to remain uneven across the various industrial property segments. Industrial developments with higher building specifications catering to the needs of new-economy firms (e.g. technology companies) and firms from higher value-added industries are likely to outperform the broader market.\u201dMs Tay expects a surge in new business park completions this year. She noted that \u201cfive of the seven upcoming projects are purpose-built facilities with pre-commitments from major occupiers like Grab, Wilmar International and T\u00dcV S\u00dcD. Moreover, efforts by landlords to spruce up their older assets should enhance their marketability and ability to command higher rents on completion of upgrading works.\u201dMr Paul Ho, chief mortgage officer at iCompareLoan, said, \u201ccommercial properties obviously command more rents than real estate like the Yishun industrial properties.\u201dHe added, \u201cany newer industrial properties sitting on Business 1 (B1) zones are increasingly sophisticated and looking like Commercial buildings. In fact you might not even tell them apart unless you refer to the URA Zoning Master Plan. Since industrial B1 zones are better located nearer to housing estates or regional centres and no longer mainly in Jurong, there is substantial advantage to break the zoning rules.\u201dMr Ho noted that with the rolling out of the 5G wireless network and with Singapore\u2019s being at the forefront of smart nation initiatives, the industrial market as a whole will remain optimistic.The post Yishun industrial properties up for sale at $29 million appeared first on iCompareLoan Resources.

In a nutshell, the Twitter exchange hints that CDPR and Nvidia could be teaming up to produce a limited special edition Cyberpunk 2077 GPU.\n\nIn its initial response to CDPR's (likely scripted) query about a potential GeForce RTX Cyberpunk 2077 Edition, Nvidia replied with the 'thinking face' emoji. CDPR pressed on, asking \"Oh c'mon! Don't tell us you never thought about it...\" Nvidia countered with the 'smirking face' emoji, and teased that we \"stay tuned\". Last but not least the blurry image below was posted alongside the tease.\n\nThe above image looks like an RTX20 series reference graphics card from Nvidia floating in a Cyberpunk-style neon fog environment.\nIt is no secret that Nvidia and CDPR are working closely on Cyberpunk 2077. Last summer it was announced that Nvidia had been chosen as the \"official technology partner to bring real-time ray tracing to the game\". Thus, when the game arrives in September, it is expected to be delivered with RTX On real-time raytracing frills, as well as other Nvidia graphical tech.\nThis isn't the first time Nvidia has released a special edition graphics card in partnership with a big name game / movie franchise. Back in November 2017 it announced the Titan Xp Star Wars Collectors Editions - one styled for the Jedi Order, another for the Galactic Empire. As a reminder I've included images of these extravagant products below.\n\nAn Nvidia GeForce RTX Cyberpunk 2077 Edition would be a particularly symmetrically confected product if the graphics card sat somewhere between the RTX 2070 and 2080 in stature and was called the RTX 2077. However, that is pushing the bounds of possibility quite far - based upon these insubstantial tongue-in-cheek Tweets.\nCyberpunk 2077 will be released on 17th September this year, if there are no further delays. It isn't certain whether Nvidia will have consumer-ready Ampere GPUs available by that time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\nMicrosoft imagines Xbox 2042 with 1 exaFLOP processor\n\n                    Meanwhile, EA/DICE have revealed three big new maps for Battlefield 2042. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n7\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\n\n                    And Nvidia's GeForce Now service becomes Xbox friendly (via updated Microsoft Edge). \n                \n\n\n\nRockstar outlines Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy PC specs\nAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT Halo Infinite graphics card revealed\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 6 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

The 1,916 sq ft unit on the 10th floor was bought for $1.6 million ($835 psf) in December 2005 and sold for $3.07 million ($1,600 psf) on Feb 5. The seller therefore made a 92% profit, or an annualised profit of 5% over 14 years. Located in District 9, Watermark Robertson Quay was completed in 2008 and comprises 206 freehold units. It is a 14-minute walk to the upcoming Havelock MRT Station on the Thomson East-Coast Line, which is slated for completion in 2021.    The second top gain made over the week \u2013 a 129% profit of $1.21 million \u2013 was at Varsity Park Condominium, along West Coast Road (Credit: Samuel Isaac Chua/ The Edge Singapore) The second top gain made over the week \u2013 a 129% profit of $1.21 million \u2013 was at Varsity Park Condominium, along West Coast Road. The 2,325 sq ft unit on the fifth floor was purchased for $944,905 ($406 psf) in January 2006 and sold for $2.16 million ($929 psf) on Feb 10. This means that the seller made an annualised profit of 6% over 14 years.  Varsity Park Condominium, in District 5, comprises 530 units on a 99-year leasehold. It was completed in 2008 and is a six-minute drive to Kent Ridge MRT Station on the Circle Line. A unit sold at Spring Grove, along Grange Road in District 10, made the third largest gain over the week, netting a 125% profit of $1.14 million for the seller. The 1,389 sq ft unit on the 18th floor was bought for $910,000 ($655 psf) in June 1998, and sold for $2.05 million ($1,476 psf) on Feb 6. The seller therefore made an annualised profit of 4% over almost 22 years. Spring Grove, completed in 1996, comprises 325 units on a 99-year leasehold. It is a 10-minute walk to the upcoming Orchard Boulevard MRT Station on the Thomson-East Coast Line. On the other hand, the greatest loss incurred over the week was from the resale of a 2,551 sq ft unit at NEWest in District 5. Having sold the property for $1.95 million ($764 psf) on Feb 7, the seller suffered a 21% loss of $524,500. The unit was purchased in June 2013 for $2.47 million ($970 psf). Over a holding period of almost seven years, this translates into an annualised loss of 4%. NEWest is a 136-unit project on a 999-year leasehold along West Coast Drive. Completed in 2016, it is 16 minutes by foot to Clementi MRT Station on the East-West Line.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

These results cover the fourth quarter of the 2020 fiscal year and they have been warmly welcomed by investors, with Nvidia's share price up by over six per cent in afterhours trading. The headlining positive comes from strong data centre segment performance. However, not everything is rosy, with Nvidia having to cut its Q1 FY2021 revenue guidance by $100m due to the Covid-19 outbreak, for example.\n\nIn the above table you can see Nvidia's strong progress in most of its target markets over recent quarters. First of all you will see that revenue for the fourth quarter was $3.11 billion, up 41 per cent from a year earlier and up 3 per cent sequentially. However this table view doesn't tally the quarters into years, which would show that full-year revenue was $10.92 billion, down 7 per cent YoY. Analysts had been expecting $2.96 billion in revenue, but Nvidia surprised with its $3.11 billion figure.\n\nIn the official press release accompanying the results Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang commented \"adoption of NVIDIA accelerated computing drove excellent results, with record data centre revenue\". Gaming is still the by far the largest segment for Nvidia, and Huang talked about how his company is growing stronger driven by RTX. \"Nvidia RTX ray tracing is reinventing computer graphics, driving powerful adoption across gaming, VR and design markets, while opening new opportunities in rendering and cloud gaming,\" boasted the CEO. Huang still sees promise for Nvidia in powering the AI that is being adopted by connected services, as well as applications in 5G, genomics, robotics and autonomous vehicles.\nGaming highlights\nIn the most recent quarter Nvidia says that momentum gathered in RTX gaming, with the release of titles such as Deliver Us The Moon, Wolfenstein: Youngblood and Bright Memory. Nvidia is a key component maker for 125 gaming laptop models, including the new Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. That laptop was a crowd pleaser at CES 2020 alongside the release of more G-Sync monitors and LG adopting S-Sync in its latest OLED TV lineup. Further positive impacts to Nvidia's revenue came from the new 'Super' series mid-range graphics cards becoming widely available and the RTX series of cards edging below US$300.\n\nNvidia also boasted of bringing its GeForce NOW cloud gaming service out of beta - but some big name publishers have put a bit of a dampener on this news. As reported earlier this week, many AAA games which were playable in the beta have now been withdrawn by the likes of Activision Blizzard, Capcom, EA, Konami, Remedy, Rockstar, and Square Enix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nAMD sales up 54 per cent, beats analyst expectations\n\n                    Server and semi-custom chips are selling particularly well.

If you fancy building an SFF PC with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060, Asus now has a pair of new graphics cards which might appeal; the Asus Dual GeForce RTX 2060 Mini edition, and Mini OC editions. Asus says these SKUs have been \"specifically designed for the new Intel NUC 9 Extreme Kit and Intel NUC 9 Pro Kit.\" \n\nAs compact versions of a well known GPU, let us look closely at their defining characteristic first - the physical size of these graphics cards. Both of them measure 19.7 x 12.1 x 3.9cm (or 7.8 x 4.8 x 1.5-inches). Asus describes them as 2-slot designs, and these 1x 8-pin powered GPUs feature twin-fan coolers.\nOn the topic of physical characteristics, on the bracket these cards feature a trio of ports; a DVI-D connector, a DP 1.4 connector, and an HDMI 2.0b (with HDCP 2.2) port. The cooler is a new design for sub-20cm 2-slot cards said to be compact without sacrificing thermal performance. Key to the cooler's functionality are; twin axial fans designed by the ROG team, 0dB technology (when the GPU is cooler than 55 degrees Celsius), a redsigned shroud, new heatsink and heatpipe layout, and IPX5 dust resistance to maintain cooling performance.\nAs mentioned in the intro, Asus has one 'standard' Dual GeForce RTX 2060 Mini edition and an OC version in its roster. The GPU clock speeds can be compared below:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNvidia RTX 2060 reference\n\n\nDual RTX 2060 Mini\n\n\nDual RTX 2060 Mini OC\n\n\n\n\nBase\n\n\n1,365MHz\n\n\n1,365MHz\n\n\n1,365MHz\n\n\n\n\nBoost\n\n\n1,680MHz\n\n\n1,680MHz\n\n\n1,725MHz\n\n\n\n\nOC mode\n\n\nNA\n\n\n1,710MHz\n\n\n1,755MHz\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nLastly, both these new mini graphics cards offer a lighting strip across the top of the shroud. Since Asus doesn't mention this is RGB or configurable in any way we must assume it\u2019s a fixed colour LED.\n\nFor reference, you can check out the HEXUS review of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Founders Edition, and the Palit GeForce RTX 2060 GamingPro OC. If shopping for full sized GPUs you can get samples with boost clocks as high as 1,830MHz out of the box. If it must be a compact RTX 2060 design, other brands like Gigabyte and Zotac offer Mini ITX friendly RTX 2060 GPUs too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\nAsus shares its Intel Z690 motherboard guide\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nHEXUS Week In Review: Asus ROG Strix Arion and Seagate Storage Expansion Card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 2 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

Now Nvidia has made these parts official and the thoughts and conclusions we reached last month seem to have been proved correct.\nNvidia has published product pages for the new GeForce MX330 and MX350 laptop GPUs. However, if you go and visit these official links the specs pages are rather barren. All we really get is a GeForce Performance score - comparing the new GPUs against the Iris Plus Graphics on Intel i7-1065G7 (Ice Lake). These scores are 2x and 2.5x respectively. Furthermore, Nvidia says the GPUs use GDDR5 memory and lists support for a number of APIs, OSes and interfaces.\n\nThankfully laptop specialists at NotebookCheck have shared some exclusive info on the new Nvidia GeForce MX330 and MX350 laptop GPUs that is rather more illuminating. In brief (more specs later) the GeForce MX330 and MX350 are akin to the \"MX150 v3,\" and a \"nerfed GTX 1050 on par with a GTX 960M,\" it says.\nSo, yes the Nvidia GeForce MX330 is just another rebrand / tweak of the MX150. Its 25W incarnation has a 0.8 per cent faster clock than the MX250 (which was very similar to the MX150). At least it has brought this level of performance to the MXX30 tier.\nAs speculated previously the new GeForce MX350 appears to represent a good spec jump for the MX series by using the same GP107 Pascal chip as the GTX 1050. However, Nvidia hobbles this lower end GPU by restricting it to a 64-bit memory interface and TGP of 25W. NotebookCheck says that these alterations make the MX350 closer in performance to the old GTYX 960M than any GTX 1050 you might have experienced.\n\n\n\n\nSpecs\n\n\nNvidia MX330\u00a0\n\n\nNvidia MX350\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGPU\n\n\nN17S-G3-A1\u00a0\n\n\nN17S-G5\n\n\n\n\nInternal Part Number\n\n\nGP108-655-A1\u00a0\n\n\nGP107-670-A1\n\n\n\n\nProcess\u00a0\n\n\n16nm\u00a0\n\n\n16nm\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPCI Express\u00a0\n\n\nGen3 x4\u00a0\n\n\nGen3 x4\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGPU Base Clock\u00a0\n\n\n1531MHz\u00a0\n\n\n1354MHz\n\n\n\n\nGPU Boost Clock\u00a0\n\n\n1594MHz\u00a0\n\n\n1468MHz\n\n\n\n\nCUDA Cores\u00a0\n\n\n384\u00a0\n\n\n640\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTDP\u00a0\n\n\n25W\u00a0\n\n\n25W\n\n\n\n\nMemory Type\u00a0\n\n\n64-bit GDDR5\n256Mx32 / 512Mx16\u00a0\n\n\n64-bit GDDR5\n256Mx32 / 512Mx16\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nP0 Memory Clock\u00a0\n\n\n3.5 / 3.0GHz\u00a0\n\n\n3.5GHz\n\n\n\n\nLaunch Date\u00a0\n\n\nFeb 10, 2020\u00a0\n\n\nFeb 10, 2020\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNotebookCheck has some preliminary benchmarks to share, which will help illustrate the potential (or lack thereof) of the new MX300 series of GPUs. I've shared a screen grab of the 1920x1080 Fire Strike Graphics benchmarks below, with the MX350 set as the baseline (end column).\n\nYou can see the laptop GeForce GTX 1050 is about 38 per cent faster than the MX350. In another test the MX330 was about 11 per cent slower than the MX350. It is expected that this will be the last Pascal-based refresh of Nvidia's GeForce MX series for ultra-mobile laptops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 1 Comment\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

(AP Photo/Morry Gash)    IVAN MORENO  Updated 3 February 2020 5 min read          PICKETT, Wis. (AP) \u2014 At Rosendale Dairy, each of the 9,000 cows has a microchip implanted in an ear that workers can scan with smartphones for up-to-the-minute information on how the animal is doing \u2014 everything from their nutrition to their health history to their productivity. Feed is calibrated to deliver a precise diet and machines handle the milking. In the fields, drones gather data that helps bump up yields for the row crops grown to feed the animals.  Technology has played an important role in agriculture for years but it's become a life and death matter at dairy farms these days, as low milk prices have ratcheted up pressure on farmers to seek every possible efficiency to avoid joining the thousands of operations that have failed. \u201cIf I use 100 bags of seed on a field and I change the way I distribute the seed, I can yield more without a single extra dollar of input,\u201d said Matt Wichman, Rosendale\u2019s director of agronomy. Such tools \u201care becoming so economically viable that anybody that\u2019s of a decent scale is adopting these,\u201d Wichman said. Technology can mean survival, but it involves a perilous gamble: Will the machines produce savings fast enough to cover the debt they incur? \u201cThe last five years have really been treacherous,\u201d said Randy Hallett, who has 85 cows in Casco, Wisconsin, and has spent $33,000 on new milking equipment. He would invest more if his operation could afford it. \u201cI broke even, mostly.\u201d The dairy industry is caught in a vise between consumer trends and competition. Americans are buying less milk as changing tastes steer them to milk substitutes from soy and almonds, or to entirely different drinks like flavored water. Two big milk processors, Dean Foods and Borden Dairy Co., filed for bankruptcy protection in the past three months, undone by declining demand and also pressured by big competitors like Walmart, which opened its own milk processing plant in 2018.  And then there are milk prices. After hitting a historic high in 2014 of more than $26 per 100 pounds on the strength of massive buying from China, the bottom fell out. When China stopped its milk-buying spree, there was already oversupply from both American and European Union producers, said Mark Stephenson, director of dairy policy analysis at the University of Wisconsin. Prices fell to $17.30 by the following year, and for producers, it's been mostly misery ever since. Nationwide, the number of dairy farms dropped from 40,199 in 2017 to 37,468 in 2018. In Wisconsin, a state that takes pride in its image as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Dairyland,\u201d the toll has been particular severe. Though California produces more milk, Wisconsin has more dairy farms than any other state. And more than 1,600 of those have gone under in the past three years.   Story continues But there are reasons to believe the worst might be over, said Jim Ostrom, a partner at Milk Source, the company that owns Rosendale. In November, milk prices in Wisconsin rose to $22.40. Nationwide, they reached $21, finally above the $18 price point that Stephenson cited as a general benchmark for producers turning a profit.With dairy prices outside farmers' control, they have to focus on controlling costs. That's where technology comes in. A rotary milking parlor can handle 10 cows a minute and can sense when an udder is empty so cows aren't overmilked, which can harm their health. But a robotic milking system can run more than $200,000.\u201cIt can be very difficult for a smaller farm to afford this technology because you need, you know, a larger operation to spread those expenses across,\u201d said Liz Binversie, an agriculture educator in Brown County for the University of Wisconsin extension office. She said she knows of one farm that went out of business because it couldn't find enough workers and could not afford a robotic milking system.Wisconsin leads the nation in farm bankruptcies with 45 Chapter 12 filings from July 2018 through June 2019, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. Minnesota was not far behind with 31 during that time.Because of debt, the cost of producing milk varies among farms. While some farmers can break even at a price of $18 per hundred pounds, others need $21 because of their debt load.Sometimes the way to survive is to join forces with neighbors.Hallett shares some advanced machinery with a neighboring farmer, like a combine and planting equipment. And, fortunately, some technology isn't expensive. Hallett's cows carry the same microchips as Rosendale uses, so he can know from the comfort of his office the milk weight for each cow and whether a particular cow had less milk that day. The chips cost about 12 cents per month per cow.Hallett said he wishes he could afford to update his cow stalls, but that getting credit from banks is difficult because they consider bigger operations less risky.\u201cWho do you think they're going to work with to keep them afloat?\u201d Hallett said.The University of Wisconsin hopes to help with a project that would integrate all the data farms collect each day on cows' production, feed and health, among other things.Integrating the data and using artificial intelligence and machine learning \u201cwould be very helpful to farmers making the best decisions every single time\u201d in real time, said Victor Cabrera, the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who is leading the project. He\u2019s collecting data from five farms now and expects to have the project completed in three years.Farmers could tell whether to keep breeding an animal or let it go.\u201cI\u2019d use it yesterday if I had it,\u201d said Mitch Breunig, who is contributing data from his farm, Mystic Valley Dairy, where he has 460 cows.He said sometimes it\u2019s weeks before he can pinpoint how much milk a cow produced on a particular day and how much it ate.\u201cI think it doesn\u2019t matter what size your farm is, it\u2019s information you need to know,\" he said.

Nvidia also teased plans to bring even more games to the service, including Cyberpunk 2077, one of the hottest games of 2020.\nGoogle Stadia versus GeForce Now is a bit of an apples-to-oranges comparison. While both are cloud gaming services, Google Stadia feels like a console in the cloud, requiring you to buy games through its service, with only a few dozen currently available. Several promised features are still missing. GeForce Now, on the other hand, rents you a powerful gaming PC on Nvidia\u2019s servers, and you bring your own games from existing PC storefronts like Steam, the Epic Games Store, and Uplay. It supports nearly 400 games, with another 1,000 available for single-session installations.\n\nThe more important difference is in price. To use Google\u2019s service, you currently need to pay $129 for a Stadia Premiere Edition, then you\u2019ll probably want to pay $10 per month for a Stadia Pro subscription. GeForce Now, by contrast, offers a totally free tier, while the premium Founders subscription that unlocks longer play sessions and real-time ray tracing is currently in a 90-day free introductory period. You don\u2019t need to pay anything to play GeForce Now at the moment, and it remains to be seen how many people will pay the $5 per month for a Founders subscription once the trial runs out.\n CD Projekt Red\n\nKeanu Reeves stars as Jonny Silverhand in\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077.\n\n\nIn any case, Nvidia\u2019s play-anywhere service is off to a blazing-hot start despite the high-profile withdrawal of Activision Blizzard\u2019s games, and it wants to keep the ball rolling. This week, Nvidia announced that CD Projekt Red\u2019s hotly anticipated\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077 will be supported on GeForce Now on day one if you buy the game on Steam, complete with real-time ray tracing if you spring for a Founders subscription. Yes, you\u2019ll be able to see Keanu Reeves in cutting-edge ray traced glory on your Android phone if you want.\n\n\n\nIn the post trumpeting the one-million-user count Nvidia\u2019s Phil Eisler also said, \u201cwe have an additional 1,500 games in our onboarding queue, from publishers that share a vision of expanding PC gaming to more people.\u201d\nIf you want to give Nvidia\u2019s service a whirl, you can sign up on the GeForce Now page. Even if you don\u2019t have a gaming PC, Nvidia\u2019s cloud-based service can stream your games to pretty much any laptop or desktop, Macs, Android phones, and select smart TVs, with plans to expand to Chromebooks later this year.

Tweets between the official Cyberpunk 2077 Twitter account and Nvidia account have all but outright confirmed a collaboration between the pair.\u00a0Yesterday, the Cyberpunk 2077 account tweeted at Nvidia about making a limited edition GPU and, after some clearly scripted back and forth, the Nvidia account tweeted a smokey, blurry photo of a GPU, confirming that a collaboration is in the works. Although the photo is blurred, the GPU's yellowy-green highlights match the colour scheme of the upcoming Cyberpunk RPG.\ud83d\ude0fStay tuned\u2026 pic.twitter.com/wahUtfw3f6February 16, 2020Many of the comments underneath the tweet are speculating that the GPU could be titled the GeFore RTX 2077 which is a neat twist on the names of Nvidia's previous graphics cards.\u00a0There's been no other announcements with further information about the GPU but, with Cyberpunk 2077 releasing on September 17, it will hopefully release before or around the same time so fans can play the RPG on a matching PC component.\u00a0We're still waiting on the PC requirements, but that doesn't mean you can't prepare by finding out how to build a gaming PC for Cyberpunk 2077.

After seven years of tweaking its delivery systems and gathering beta feedback, NVIDIA has finally unveiled the consumer version of its game-streaming ecosystem. GeForce Now streams games of all sizes to PC, Mac, Android and the NVIDIA Shield, and it works with players' existing libraries on Steam, the Epic Games Store and all other digital platforms. Games are capped at 1080p and 60 FPS.In its final form, GeForce Now is a subscription service with a free and a paid tier. The free option allows folks to connect to NVIDIA's servers and play for one hour at a time. After an hour, these players will need to reconnect, and potentially wait for a spot to open up on the servers. In the paid tier, players will be pushed to the front of the line when logging on, they'll stay online for up to six hours and they'll have exclusive access to NVIDIA's RTX platform. At launch, the upgraded option is called a Founders membership, and it costs $5 a month for the year, with three free months to kick things off.NVIDIA is clear that the $5-per-month rate is a discount on the full subscription price, but it hasn't said what the GeForce Now premium tier will cost post-sale.\"It will be higher than that,\" an NVIDIA spokesperson told Engadget at CES in January. \"We haven't decided what number it's going to be yet. But this is kind of the next level for GeForce Now. So this, we're going to be focused on for the next probably three to six months, and then we'll worry about what comes after that.\"One of NVIDIA's big promises with GeForce Now is that players will actually own the games they buy, rather than paying to access a library that disappears if they end their subscription. If a player leaves the service for good, all the games they purchased will still be accessible through Steam, the Epic Games Store or other existing platforms. DRM-free, baby.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementDRM-free, baby.This is in contrast to Google Stadia, which hosts players' games entirely in the cloud. With Stadia, players have to purchase (and repurchase) every game they want to play via Google's storefront, and this library isn't downloadable. If you lose access to Stadia, you lose those games. Microsoft xCloud employs a similar system, though the service is still in preview.\"I think our strategy of the games is quite different,\" an NVIDIA representative said. \"It's connecting to your existing accounts in the cloud, so PC games in the cloud. We're not creating a new game store where you have to re-buy your content and it's locked to our platform. This is your existing PC games on your Steam that you already own. So if you have a large Steam account, this seems like a natural choice for you really.\"GeForce Now is supported in 30 countries, with nine data centers in North America and six in Western Europe, which NVIDIA says are all capable of delivering 20-millisecond latency. In Korea, Japan, Russia and other locations, NVIDIA has partnered with telecommunications companies to deliver a claimed latency of 10 milliseconds to these players.Even in the paid tier, NVIDIA limits gaming sessions to six hours, and this feature serves a few purposes. For one, it ensures that the people connected to the cloud are actually using it to play games.\"We just found 99 percent of people aren't playing longer than that,\" a spokesperson said. \"One of the things that we try to control is non-gaming use, like people mining and things like that that really aren't gaming. ...And we found that at that point, at four hours, most people need a bio-break or something. So it's not really interrupting their gameplay.\"ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementNVIDIA developers expect free-tier players will have to wait longer during primetime gaming hours, like at eight or nine o'clock at night, though they hope even then it won't be a huge delay. However, if this wait time pushes more players to upgrade to the paid tier, all the better for NVIDIA and the service overall.\"Ideally it wouldn't be a long wait and we're going to try to manage it that way,\" a representative said. \"But you know, this revenue stream will help us grow the capacity of the servers. Right? We need the revenue stream to grow the capacity so people don't have to wait. So it sort of depends on a certain percentage of people becoming new paid members.\"More than 300,000 people have tested GeForce Now over the years, and these existing accounts will automatically be transitioned to the free tier, with the option to upgrade at the discounted rate. GeForce Now offers hundreds of games from more than 50 publishers, with a lineup of more than 30 free-to-play titles -- yes, including Fortnite.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

According to NVIDIA, the GeForce MX350 offers up to 2.5X faster performance while the GeForce MX330 is up to 2X faster compared to the \"latest and best integrated graphics for photo editing, video editing, and gaming.\" Are they really, though? It's too early to tell, but some leaked benchmarks give us an early look at performance.\n\n\nWhile the benchmark runs are unofficial, these GPUs do exist\u2014NVIDIA has put up separate product pages for each GPU. The product pages only reveal a few basic details, such as GDDR5 memory support and checkmarks for technologies such as Optimus and PCI Express 3.0. Clockspeeds and everything else is still under lock and key. Well, officially.\n\n\nAccording to Notebookcheck, both GPUs are actually based on NVIDIA's previous generation Pascal architecture, and not Turing. However, in a separate article, the site also says it heard from its sources that NVIDIA plans to launch a Turing-based MX GPU sometime later this year, to duke it out with Intel's discrete Xe DG1.\n\n\nLet's start with the leaked specifications...\n\n\nGeForce MX350 (N17S-G5): 16nm, 640 CUDA cores, 1,354MHz base clock, 1,468MHz boost clock, GDDR5 memory, 64-bit memory bus, 25W TDP\nGeForce MX330 (N17S-G3-A1): 16nm, 384 CUDA cores, 1,531MHz base clock, 1,594MHz boost clock, GDDR5 memory, 64-bit memory bus, 25W TDP\n\nThere has also been chatter of a 15W version of the GeForce MX350 with slower 746MHz base and 937MHz boost clocks.\n\n\nCompared to the MX200 series, the lower end GeForce MX330 essentially looks like a rebranded GeForce MX250 (25W version). It has the same number of CUDA cores and memory configuration, and both are built around Pascal. The GeForce MX330 just sports slighter higher clocks\u20141,531MHz (base) and 1,594MHz (boost), versus 1,518MHz (base) and 1,582MHz (boost).\n\n\nThe GeForce MX350, meanwhile, is based on the same GP107 GPU found in NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 1050. However, it has a narrower memory bus (64-bit versus 128-bit) and a lower TDP (25W versus 75W).\nLeaked NVIDIA GeForce MX350 And GeForce MX550 Performance Benchmarks\nWhat does this all boil down to in terms of actual performance? In the 3DMark (Time Spy and Fire Strike), the higher end GeForce MX350 settles in somewhere between a GeForce GTX 960M and a GeForce GTX 1050. Have a look...\n\n\n\n\nSource: Notebookcheck\n\n\n\nCompared to the previous generation GeForce MX250, the upcoming GeForce MX350 is quite a bit faster, as we would expect when looking at the specifications. At the same time, these are lower end discrete GPUs that, for gaming, will be best served at lower settings and with less demanding games.\n\n\n\nIn a separate benchmark leak, Twitter user _rogame posted a chart plucked from a Chinese-language website that has already reviewed the GeForce MX350.\n\n\n\nSource: Zhuanian\n\n\n\nIt's more of the same, really, but with a wider assortment of benchmarks (Heaven 4.0, Valley 1.0, and a few others thrown into the mix).\n\n\nWe find it interesting that these parts exist (and presumably will soon be on the market), if a Turing-based MX GPU is right around the corner. This could be a case of NVIDIA finding ways to sell off older inventories, with new product names and slightly altered specifications. Whatever the case might be, the entry-level graphics market is going to get even more crowded this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, pascal, (nasdaq:nvda), geforce mx350, geforce mx330\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

They power the graphics that drive our most fond gaming experiences, and they're only getting better (and more expensive) as time goes on. \nRELATED:\u00a010 Ridiculously Expensive Custom Video Game Consoles (And What They\u2019re Worth)\nLet's dive back in time and analyze the most groundbreaking video cards ever made, and the impact they had not just on gaming, but graphics applications as a whole. Without these babies, there'd be no 3D modeling, animation, or big-budget Hollywood films. Pay your respects to these icons! \n10 \n\n                            THE IBM\u00a0CGA\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1981, computer giant IBM released the CGA (Color Graphics Adapter). These days, it wants to make us puke, but back then it was the start of something truly big! It would kick off color graphics in a big way with a total of 16 (count 'em!) colors to play with.\nCGA was a staple of early IBM-based PC games, powering a plethora of titles until such time as full-fledged GPUs became a thing. Along with IBM's MDA (Monochrome Display Adapter), CGA would serve as the beginning of the graphics card craze. \n9 \n\n                            THE IBM EGA\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot to be outdone by its rivals, Hercules and Intel, IBM would once again up the ante on its own formula with the introduction of the EGA (Enhanced Graphics Adapter) in 1984. Those who owned a PCjr or Tandy 1000 back in the day knew what a major step up this was from traditional CGA color.\nThe biggest changes came in the form of a bigger color palette and an increase in maximum resolution, both of which would power a ton of video games between 1984 and 1987. \n8 \n\n                            ATI VGA WONDER\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATI's VGA Wonder would release in 1988, and it was the first stepping stone towards more conventional video cards. This PCI-based card was designed to integrate with the rest of the system, and had no display connectivity options of any kind. Instead, its purpose was to amp up graphics capabilities through the traditional display connection.\nWith 1 pixel shader and a clock speed of 10Mhz, the VGA Wonder is definitely a dinosaur, but it was a major evolution in graphics technology at the time. \n7 \n\n                            3DFX VOODOO 1\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1996 saw the GPU craze kick into sudden high gear as PC technology began leapfrogging itself year over year. 3DFX was one of the first on the scene with 3D accelerated graphics technologies, courtesy of the Voodoo1 card.\nRELATED:\u00a010 Classic Games You Can Play For Free On Your Computer Right Now\nThe Voodoo1 ran games through the Glide graphics API, which was a direct competitor to OpenGL. Although the latter would end up winning the graphics wars and putting 3DFX out to pasture, there's no denying the huge impact the Voodoo1 had on power-packed GPUs. \n6 \n\n                            NVIDIA GEFORCE 256\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia flirted with GPU technology in 1997 with the RIVA 128, but it wasn't until 1999's GeForce 256 that they ended up with a solid hit on their hands. Not only did it make Nvidia a worthy market competitor, but it also put the GeForce moniker in lights, which has continued to this day.\nThe GeForce 256 is widely considered to be the first tried-and-true GPU. It featured full DirectX 7 support with a 32MB of DDR RAM and a 480 Pixels/s fillrate. \n5 \n\n                            ATI RADEON R100 DDR\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot to be outdone, ATI would return to the fray a year later with the Radeon R100 DDR, the first in the Radeon line of graphics cards from the company. Like the GeForce 256, the Radeon R100 DDR also featured full DirectX 7 compatibility, with ATI's own HyperZ technology built in, which was said to provide a 20% improvement in rendering efficiency.\nIt was available in 32 or 64MB configurations with a core speed of 183Mhz. A total of 21 variants of the R100 were released before it was eventually shelved in favor of the next big thing. \n4 \n\n                            NVIDIA GEFORCE 3\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia would send another volley against ATI in 2001 with the GeForce 3 series of cards. It was the first card to utilize programmable pixel shaders, while offering multisample AA and increased rendering efficiency.\nThe GeForce 3 was also compatible with Direct3D 8.0, sported 4 pixel shaders with a GPU clock of 200Mhz and a max memory size of 64MB. It was most notable for powering tech demos from Pixar and ID's Doom 3 demo. \n3 \n\n                            ATI RADEON 9700\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe early 2000s was a battleground between ATI and Nvidia, and with both companies churning out updates to their lines, ATI fought tooth and nail to stay competitive. It succeeded with the release of the Radeon 9700 card, the first Direct3D 9.0 GPU on the market.\nThe most popular of these cards was undoubtedly the excellent Radeon 9700 Pro, a behemoth with 8 pixel shaders, a 325Mhz GPU clock, and 128MB of memory. At the time, this was one of the most popular high end video cards on the market, setting quite a few standards that are still in use by GPU manufacturers today. \n2 \n\n                            NVIDIA GEFORCE 900 SERIES\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2014, Nvidia would propel itself to the forefront of the graphics card market with the introduction of the enormously powerful GeForce 900 series of cards. If you were lucky to fit one of these bad boys in your case, you'd get to experience games at peak levels, the highest framerates and best resolutions.\nRELATED:\u00a0The 10 Best Controllers For First-Person Shooters\nThe most notable card in the lineup was the monstrously powerful, bank-breaking, guaranteed-your-wife-is-going-to-divorce-you GTX 980ti. It boasted a 1000Mhz base clock, 6GB of GDDR5 memory and a memory bandwidth of 384 bits. It was also great for creatives whose rendering and video editing programs were able to take advantage of its 2816 CUDA processing cores, making it a truly high-end multi-purpose GPU. \n1 \n\n                            NVIDIA RTX2080ti\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough not perfect, Nvidia's RTX2080ti is the newest and greatest standard in video game graphics cards. It was the first to ditch the GTX moniker in favor of RTX, signaling a major paradigm shift into ray-traced gaming.\nThough the trend has started slow, it's still an important step in the evolution of graphics card technologies, and one that will be felt for many years to come. Ray-traced games look spectacular in every way, with realistic lighting that can fool many people into thinking that the visuals are real. Although the 2080ti is so expensive that you'll probably need to eat Kraft Dinner for the next 7 years, Nvidia has promised that the next iteration of the RTX line will be more affordable.\nNEXT:\u00a010 Relaxing Games To Play On Your Computer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tA Baldur's Gate 3 Fan Has Made Raphael Romanceable\n\t\t\n\n\nBaldur's Gate 3\n\nWant another romance option in Baldur's Gate 3?

GeForce Now has previously been available in a closed beta capacity, but it's now opening up to everyone, with the previous waiting list removed. \nWhere Xbox's Project XCloud is of course based on Xbox games and hardware and Stadia is acting as though it's a whole new platform, Nvidia's GeForce NOW is a PC-based game streaming service - which makes sense, considering Nvidia is using its own hardware to deliver PC cloud-based game streaming. This brings with it a few potential benefits over Stadia in particular - as it's a cloud streaming service for games that can hook into the ecosystems, store fronts and game libraries you already own.\n \n \n\nAt this launch, you'll be able to play GeForce NOW on Windows PCs, Mac OS, mobile devices and TVs via the Nvidia Shield. Later on this year, Nvidia also plans to add support for play via Chromebook devices. \nThe service boasts hundreds of games you can instantly boot including fully-fledged retail games and free-to-play favourites like Fortnite and World of Tanks. Games will be automatically updated and patched to the latest versions with the latest drivers, and the local install required to get playing is less than 100 megabytes. The aim, essentially, is to have the lowest barrier to entry possible. The service will obviously support keyboard and mouse controls, but also controllers where it makes sense for a given game.\nDespite that low barrier of entry, Nvidia's placement in the game streaming space is especially interesting as in theory this will offer some of the highest quality possible, also. Since it comes from Nvidia the service will obviously use the GeForce graphics hardware in the cloud server stacks - which means that you might be able to run games with the level of high-end performance you might expect on the high-end, super-expensive RTX 2080 Ti graphics card, or at the very least performance to match an RTX 2080 - but on pretty much any device. \nThat includes ray tracing, too - so if you're on an older rig or even don't own a gaming PC but are dreaming of a ray-tracing enabled trip through Night City in Cyberpunk 2077, GeForce NOW might be your ticket to that - assuming the game ends up being supported by the service. \n \n \n\nSpeaking of support, games will need to be vetted, adjusted and added to the service by Nvidia, so while it will be compatible with many existing store fronts you won't be able to stream games via GeForce Now unless they're expressly part of the service. Nvidia already has hundreds of games on the service - and if a game is supported and you already own it on a major storefront, you'll be able to stream it on GeForce Now without buying it again. \nAfter seeing 300,000 beta users play over 70 million hours of games during its 2019 beta, GeForce Now is finally ready for a wider release. It launches with two tiers; a free tier that allows you 'standard access' with a 1 hour limit on your gaming sessions - not enough for serious, hardcore stuff but certainly enough for a lunch hour game of something via your phone. Those willing to pay can get in on the Founders tier, which comes with 'extended session length', though how long or limited that might be isn't clear, and priority access to the servers. A big extra bonus is that this tier also gets access to ray tracing in the games that support it. The Founders Tier has an introductory price of $4.99 / \u00a34.99 / \u20ac5,49 per month for the first year. \nGeForce now exiting beta is potentially extremely exciting. All the elements appear to be there, and the price and compatibility with existing stores and libraries immediately makes it a more attractive cloud game streaming platform than Stadia. As always, exactly how good a deal this is will be determined by its performance and utility in real-world conditions. We plan to test that extensively - so check back soon for our full verdict. \n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            Lego Pokemon is officially gonna be a thing in 2026, so prepare to seriously consider gluing the credit cards of the biggest nerds you know to the ceiling\n          \n\n\n\n            Monster Hunter Wilds players are using cheats to create hunts with absurd rewards\n          \n\n\n\n            Wahey, Helldivers 2's latest update, Patch 01.002.200, buffs a bunch of weapons and stratagems, but some enemy changes should mean you're still in for a fair fight\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAlex Donaldson: Alex has been writing about video games for decades, first getting his start as an enthusiast blogger before 'going pro' in the mid-2000s.

This much seemingly everyone can agree on. Finding the resources to implement these technologies, on the other hand, is a different question entirely. Resource-strapped startups and even established companies with sufficient know-how may find it difficult to adapt to changing technologies. \nNvidia\u2019s VP of Engineering Claire Delaunay will be returning to TC Sessions: Robotics + AI at UC Berkeley on March 3 to discuss the component giant\u2019s work in AI and robotics. After showing off Nvidia\u2019s Isaac platform at last year\u2019s event, the former Google robotics lead will discuss how the company is working to create a platform to help accelerate robotics development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelaunay will be joined by Scott Phoenix, the co-founder and CEO of Vicarious, which works to develop AI and general intelligence for robotics, and Joshua Wilson, co-founder and CEO of Freedom Robotics, which works to help companies launch and scale robotics systems.\nTickets are on sale now for $345; you\u2019ll save $50 when you book now as prices go up at the door.\nWe have two Startup Demo Packages left for $2,200. Each package comes with a demo space and four tickets to the show. Grab yours here.\nStudent tickets are still available at the super-discounted $50 rate when you book here.\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nAI, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Claire Delaunay, events, freedom robotics, Google, nvidia, robot, TC Sessions: Robotics + AI 2020, technology, Vicarious \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBrian Heater\t\n\n\n\nHardware Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrian Heater is the Hardware Editor at TechCrunch.

Were it to launch today, it would be among the top 25 supercomputers in the world, according to the ranking site, Top500. The system is expected to be online by early 2021.Rear Admiral John Okon, the head of Navy Meteorology and Oceanography Command, said: \u201cThe investment and increase in supercomputing power at the Navy DSRC at Stennis Space Center is absolutely critical to Naval Oceanography.\u201cDelivering future capability upgrades to global and regional ocean and atmospheric prediction systems, to include later this year the Navy\u2019s first Earth Systems Prediction Capability.\u201cNaval Oceanography\u2019s ability to be the Department of Defense\u2019s authoritative source for characterizing and applying data of the physical battlespace into a decisive advantage for naval, joint and allied forces hinges on the continual upgrade and advancements in high-performance computing from the HPCMP.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCray's Shasta system\n\u2013 Cray\n\n\n\nBattle/Hurricane computerThe Cray Shasta supercomputer will feature 290,304 AMD Epyc 7002-series processor cores and 112 Nvidia Volta V100 GPUs, interconnected by a 200 gigabit per second Cray Slingshot network.The system will also feature 590 total terabytes (TB) of memory and 14 petabytes (PB) of usable storage.The HPC will support the DoD\u2019s various scientific and engineering divisions to look at aircraft, ships, and environmental modeling.The new Cray computer will also be used on weather forecastings such as tracking hurricanes and their intensity.Navy workhorseChristine Cuicchi, director of the Navy's DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (Navy DSRC), said: \u201cWhile the new supercomputer itself will be quite the workhorse, it is complemented by a host of additional tools and services that the Navy DSRC offers in support of DoD users\u2019 research activities.\u201cMost people wouldn\u2019t expect Mississippi to be one of the premier locations for large-scale supercomputing, but we are, and this new system will solidify our presence in the HPC community.\u201dThe Navy DSRC currently provides almost 12 petaflops of aggregate supercomputing capability to the DoD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17 May 2019\n\n\n\n\nHPE to acquire Cray for $1.3 billion\n\n\nSupercomputer consolidation\n\n\n\n\nHomeland SecurityLast month, the US Department of Homeland Security awarded General Dynamics a contract to maintain one of its data centers, DC1, at the same location as the US Navy's HPC.DC1 is located at the National Center for Critical Information Processing and Storage at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi, and public documents from 2011 state that it has \"approximately 63,000 square feet of raised floor space\" and the \"complex consists of three large attached buildings.\"\nSupercomputer roll-outBack in August, Cray signed three high-performance computing contracts with the US military worth more than $71m. The US Air Force acquired a Cray Shasta supercomputer, while the Army Research Lab (ARL) and the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) will each deploy a Cray CS500.The Air Force's $25m system will be acquired by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center in partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Named HPC11, it will be used for operational weather forecasting and meteorology, providing higher fidelity weather forecasts for US Air Force and Army operations worldwide, under the purview of the Air Force's 557th Weather Wing.The other Cray CS500 supercomputer will be deployed by the US Army's Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC).Under ERDC is the DoD Supercomputing Resource Center (DSRC) at Vicksburg, Mississippi, which in 2016 acquired a Cray XC40 for $26.5m. Set inside the ERDC Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), DSRC typically operates two or more supercomputers on an average four-year life cycleThe Vicksburg facility is also home to the Joint Computing Facility, which features some 10,000 square feet of raised floor space.\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 Feb 2020\n\n\n\n\nGerman university begins building new HPC shell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31 Jan 2020\n\n\n\n\nBelgian university refitting data center to host new supercomputer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 Feb 2020\n\n\n\n\nAmazon wants to depose Trump in JEDI cloud challenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nStennis Space Center\n\n\nHigh Performance Computing Modernization Program\n\n\nUS Navy\n\n\nHPCMP\n\n\nDoD Supercomputing Resource Centers\n\n\nDSRC\n\n\nChristine Cuicchi\n\n\nDoD\n\n\nJohn Okon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

As you can probably see from the front of Nvidia's new Cyberpunk-ified GPU (provided its intense yellow hasn't blinded you), this is just a special edition of their regular RTX 2080 Ti graphics card rather than a whole new launch or RTX Super reveal. The good news, though, is that it won't cost you a single penny. Instead, you'll have to enter Nvidia's Twitter competition if you want to be in with a chance of getting your hands on one, as there are only 77 of things monstrosities being made available 'to the community' (which is probably just as well, given how fugly it is). To be honest, Nvidia missed a trick with this - surely the RTX 2077 should have an absolute shoe-in?\n\nOriginal story: Nvidia could be on the verge of releasing yet another graphics card if a conversation on Twitter last night is anything to go by, and it could be a lurid shade of Cyberpunk 2077 yellow to boot. In an act probably best described as \"pure japes\" and \"classic bants\", the official Cyberpunk 2077 Twitter account asked, \"Hey @NvidiaGeForce, what do you think about making a limited edition #Cyberpunk2077 GPU?\" To which the official Nvidia GeForce account replied, \"Stay tuned,\" along with a blurred image of rather yellow looking graphics card. \nIn truth, there was a little more bants and accompanying japery to the reveal, with Nvidia first replying with a scratchy head emoji. Cyberpunk 2077 then goaded them further with, \"Oh c'mon! Don't tell us you never thought about it...\" before Nvidia finally gave up their blurry goods with a smug-looking raised eyebrows emoji - because, let's be honest, you can't tease something on the internet without a bit of titilating emoji winking and flirtatious ego stroking. \nEither way, the end result was the blurry image you see up the top there of a rather yellow-looking graphics card. Judging from the design, it would appear to be an RTX card, and the silvery middle section between its two large fans would suggest it's going to be an RTX Super card of some description, too. However, whether this supposed limited edition Cyberpunk 2077 GPU will be a brand-new card, such as Nvidia's hotly-rumoured RTX 2080 Ti Super (a new and improved version of their current best graphics card, the RTX 2080 Ti), or just a limited edition of one of their existing RTX Super cards is currently up for debate. \nCyberpunk 2077 is one of the few ray tracing games due out this year, so it would make sense for Nvidia to use this opportunity to launch a brand-new card so that Cyberpunk fanatics could a) run the game looking its absolute best and b) having a Cyberpunk trim to match. \nIt would certainly add a bit more spice to a new GPU launch, although if it does end up being the RTX 2080 Ti Super, then you can probably guarantee it will cost an absolute fortune. After all, even the cheapest RTX 2080 Ti cards still go for \u00a3950 / $1000 these days (if not significantly more depending on the model), so I'd imagine any potential special editions of a potential RTX 2080 Ti Super card will probably go for another couple of hundred quid more. \nStill, with Cyberpunk 2077's release date pushed back until September, there's still plenty of time to save up for it, whatever it ends up being. As for when Nvidia will finally bring their teaser image into focus and tell us more about it, next month's GDC conference seems like a likely candidate, which starts on March 16th, or maybe they'll wait until their own GTC conference the week after on March 23rd.

It's ...\u00a0something less than that. NVIDIA's entry in the streaming game market isn't quite so bold, but it has a lot more in its favor at launch than Google's offering. Or, anyone else, for that matter. \nThe greatest boon to GeForce NOW is its library. By using existing PC games and connecting to established marketplaces like Steam and Epic, this service leverages the huge collection of digital titles PC gamers have been building for years. It's also wonderfully cheap: free for a lot of capability, but not without restrictions even on its $5 paid tier.\nIs this the streaming service we've been waiting for, the one that can unshackle us from gaming PCs and consoles alike? Frankly, no, but it's certainly the closest thing we have at the moment. \n                        Giant Library\n               \nThe biggest problem with Stadia is a limited selection---just a few dozen games, even months after its much-ballyhooed launch. In comparison, I counted 553 individual games available to play on GeForce NOW, going by the master list in the SHIELD app. That probably isn't a final tally---a few games are available via multiple PC-based game stores, and NVIDIA claims that \"thousands\" of older PC games can be played via limited installation sessions. But suffice it to say, it's a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, for most of that lot, you don't need to buy them again if you already own them on PC. GeForce NOW lets you log into Steam, Epic, Blizzard Battle.net, EA's Origin, and Ubisoft's Uplay stores, streaming the purchases you've already made. If you don't own a game, you can buy it through GeForce NOW, after which the title will still be available on the PC store where you made the purchase.\nSounds great, right? It's definitely an improvement. But it isn't unlimited: A game needs to be supported by GeForce NOW in order to be accessed on the service. If it isn't in that list of 553 (or possibly quite a bit more, if you're playing on the PC), you can't play it.\nThe GeForce NOW selection is mostly focused on games that are new, popular, or both. Most games falling into those categories are supported, and if you've been building a Steam library for a decade or so, odds are good that you'll have a very wide selection from which to choose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat said, selection may seem haphazard, based on your tastes. Search for Fallout and you'll find the latest title in the series, Fallout 76. You'll also find the much older but still popular Fallout 3 and New Vegas. But Fallout 4, the smash hit from 2015, is nowhere to be found. You can play Epic exclusives Fortnite and Borderlands 3, but not indie darlings like the\u00a0Untitled Goose Game or The Outer Worlds. You can play Apex Legends from Origin, but not any of the recent Battlefield or Madden games.\nDon't get me wrong, the selection is extremely impressive. But if you've been reading about how GeForce NOW is better than Stadia because it has \"your whole PC game library,\" that's a long way from true. I think NVIDIA will be working to expand its already-impressive selection as soon as it can. \n                        How Does It Work?\n               \nWhen you start the game via GeForce NOW for the first time, it installs into NVIDIA's remote virtual machine with a basically instant download from the data center. From that point on, you can launch it at any time via the GeForce NOW app on Windows, Mac, Android, or the NVIDIA SHIELD. Controller, mouse, and keyboard inputs are available on all systems. Chrome OS support is coming later this year, but oddly, there's no mention of an iOS app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual fidelity is using the latest in graphical oomph from NVIDIA. The Windows-based virtual systems in GeForce NOW are equipped with the latest GPUs, though only those who pay for the Founders tier get access to RTX lighting effects (in the few games that support them thus far). Unless you have a cutting-edge gaming PC, or you're playing at higher resolutions and frame rates than usual, GeForce NOW can probably give you better graphics than you have on your own computer.\nYou need a minimum of 15Mbps of up and down bandwidth to run GeForce NOW, though NVIDIA recommends 25. While the service will let you try to play at lower speeds, it lets you know you're gonna have a bad time. Should you choose to ignore the rather extensive warnings, you'll find out that it's right.\nNow, if you happen to have a solid connection, you'll find GeForce NOW a pleasant experience. For single-player games, I was able to enjoy a rock-steady 60 frames per second at 1080p (the only resolution supported at the time of writing), with barely a hiccup as I scaled over Skyrim and double-jumped through Doom.\nMultiplayer is another matter entirely, of course. Latency issues, which are barely a consideration in a single-player game, can suddenly become a headache when you're streaming. GeForce NOW handles them surprisingly well, however, I was able to play Overwatch, Fortnite, and Brawlhalla (a free-to-play take on platform fighters, a la Super Smash Bros.) with only occasional dips in my reaction time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there's a torture test I've developed for streaming games, both local and in the cloud, and it's called Rocket League. I've found that the irreverent three-on-three soccer driving game relies on split-second timing and reaction far more than any shooter or fighter, and so far, no streaming platform has been up to the challenge of giving me the same experience as my desktop. This proved to be true for GeForce NOW as well.\nLatency was just a hair above tolerable for competition. (I'm sorry, random teammates, it was for science.) Using an Ethernet connection on my desktop, I could aaaaaalmost get the game to where I was used to the input lag. Even 5GHz Wi-Fi wasn't up to that challenge.\nIn addition, NVIDIA's system seemed to chug mightily whenever more than two cars were in the same area. At times, the framerate dropped down to under 10 per second. Keep in mind that this is a game that can run on almost any hardware, including the Nintendo Switch, and NVIDIA's supposed to have all of these GeForce NOW games preoptimized.\nTo be fair, I only saw this terrible performance in a stretch of a few hours---after that, I wasn't able to replicate it, and neither was a friend I asked to test on his own GeForce NOW account. But it does demonstrate that the platform isn't quite as smooth and ready for action as NVIDIA likes you to think. \n                        Stacked Platforms\n               \nSpeaking of platforms, it's worth noting what NVIDIA is based on. Unlike Stadia and Sony's PlayStation Now, both built from the ground up for streaming, GeForce NOW is based very firmly on Windows. When managing games in Steam and other stores, especially on your own desktop, you can see the bones of Windows underneath GeForce NOW as if you were looking at an X-ray.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's not necessarily a bad thing. After all, Windows has the greatest selection of games on the planet, which is one of the chief advantages NVIDIA is banking on. But it does mean that things are a little rough around the edges. Especially when launching and closing games, you can see NVIDIA's virtualized Windows system barely hiding its applications. It's not bad, per se, it's just kind of like getting a glimpse into the kitchen at a greasy spoon diner. Things would be generally more pleasant if you couldn't.\nIt's a little less jarring to use GeForce NOW on the SHIELD set-top box or an Android phone.The interface there defaults to Steam's controller-friendly Big Picture Mode when it's visible at all. However, it's still less than ideal, especially if you have to input text for logging into games or services. (I found myself getting tripped up on the keyboards for Android, Android TV, Steam Big Picture Mode, and the game itself more than once.) Stadia has a lot of problems, but its buttery-smooth presentation is a lot more appealing in this case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of platforms, there's a definite preference for Steam over almost anything else in GeForce NOW. While the system works with the likes of Epic and Origin, the vast majority of games are available in their Steam flavors, which might be a headache if you've dabbled in multiple PC storefronts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, I picked up Subnautica, Celeste, and FTL: Faster Than Light on Epic when they were offered for free. And, I can play all three on GeForce NOW ... but only in their Steam versions. To stream these games from the cloud, I'd need to pay Steam for the privilege. A few games are available from multiple storefronts---Ubisoft games like The Division and the latter\u00a0Assassin's Creeds are available on both Uplay and Steam. But this is very much the exception, not the rule. \n                        What's the Catch?\n               \nGeForce NOW is free---you can download it right now on its supported platforms, and play any PC game you own that's in its library. If you don't own any PC games, you can still use it to play freebies, even technically demanding games like Apex Legends, Paladins, or Dauntless. You'll be using NVIDIA's high-powered cloud hardware, not to mention some pricey bandwidth, on the dole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what's the catch? While both free and paid tiers are limited to 1080p and 60 frames-per-second performance, you'll have to pay a fairly reasonable $5 a month to get fancy RTX graphics. That's not such a bitter pill, of course---only a few dozen games even support RTX graphics, many of which aren't even released yet.\nNo, the bigger advantage is the time limit. Free users are limited to one-hour sessions, after which GeForce NOW kicks you off. That's an absolute killer for gamers used to long play sessions, doubly so if they're in multiplayer. You're also in something of a slow lane: If the GeForce NOW system is overburdened, you won't be getting in immediately. Paid users get priority access, and their sessions can be four hours long, repeated indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose are some pretty hefty restrictions, even on top of the necessary bandwidth. But GeForce NOW also has a bit of a conceptual issue. You see, while services like Stadia try to appeal to users who don't have the high-powered hardware necessary to play the latest games, leveraging users' huge existing libraries means that the primary audience will be people who already own gaming PCs. And, aside from the novelty of accessing their library somewhere else (provided that somewhere has the bandwidth), those people ... well, already own gaming PCs.\nIt is undeniably cool to be able to play games anywhere, and it's even cooler to get more and more of them. But here the current limitations of the system are evident, and users who rely on iOS or ChromeOS for mobile computing will feel unaccountably left out. \n                        A Competitive Offering\n               \nEven so, NVIDIA's made an excellent initial offering. Having a free tier alone puts GeForce NOW ahead of Stadia (still planning on launching free options later this year) and PlayStation Now ($10 a month), and $5 for not-quite-unlimited access is undeniably competitive. That's to say nothing of a built-in library for users who already have a huge backlog of PC games.\nSony and Microsoft may be able to put up a better fight. PlayStation Now includes a library of games for its monthly price with unlimited play time, many of which are tempting PlayStation exclusives. Microsoft is only beginning to test its streaming system in advance of the Xbox Series X launch later this year, but presumably it will include something similar, as Microsoft already offers the Xbox Game Pass. PlayStation Now is limited to 720p playback---a paucity of pixels in the age of 4K---and Xbox cloud streaming is months away at best.\nThe best comparison on the market might be Shadow, an independent service that rents you a remote virtual Windows machine for $35 a month. It's definitely made with gaming in mind, thanks to powerful GPU hardware, but it's also meant for people who are pretty technical. Unlike GeForce NOW, the Windows 10 machine is fully unlocked, so you can use Shadow to stream something like Photoshop or Blender, something your typical low-power machine can't handle. And yes, it can play more or less any PC game. Check out our review of Shadow here. While it's technically much more capable than GeForce NOW, it's also much less accessible, with no free (or even cheap) options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA \n\nGeForce NOW is, in a word, cool. In two words, it's really cool---and refreshingly accessible to boot. But don't take my word for it. If you live in the United States or one of its other supported areas, give it a try and make your smartphone jealous as you play Fortnite on full settings at 1080p. If you don't live in one of the supported areas (the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, western Europe, Japan, Russia, and South Korea at the time of this writing), you can still give it a try ... but you'll probably lose a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGeForce NOW Game Streaming Service\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n8\n\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros & Cons\n\n\n\nMassive library of existing PC games\n...that you don't have to buy again\nHigh quality, low latency\nFree or cheap service\n\n\n\n\nNot quite fast enough for the fastest multiplayer\nWindows virtualization peeks through the UI\nSupport for non-Steam stores is limited\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee at Nvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nGame Streaming\n\n\n\n\nPC Gaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

Being a big fan of Stadia and the way it works, I expected NVIDIA\u2019s service to perhaps work well on certain devices and fall flat on others.  I realized almost immediately that those expectations were flat-out wrong and GeForce NOW has quickly become a daily go-to for gaming on a handful of devices I own.\nWe talked in another post about the inability to run the Android app on a Chromebook, so we won\u2019t go into that for now.  Just know that it isn\u2019t worth getting and installing, but the upcoming web player \u2013 provided it works as expected \u2013 will grant Chromebook users access to the solid gaming experience that is GeForce NOW.  For the purposes of this post and video,  however, we basically left Chromebooks out.\nXremove ads\n\n\nWhat we did include is a sampling of GeForce NOW running on everything from a mid-range phone to a $2000 Macbook Pro.  Specifically, we tested the Pixel 3a XL, the Lenovo Tab 4 10+ (an older tablet running Android 7), the Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e (a mid-range, $400 tablet), the Surface Go, and a 2016 Macbook Pro.  When you talk about a range of devices, I think this covers the spectrum.\n\n\n\nGet Started With GeForce NOW\nFeatured Videos\n \n\nXremove ads\n\n\nFor reference, the Lenovo tablet we\u2019re using is three versions of Android behind the curve, can\u2019t run PUBG Mobile at a playable rate, and struggles with most general tasks.  The Pixel 3a XL and Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e are both decent performers, but not top-tier powerhouses by any stretch of the imagination.  The Surface Go is running a Pentium Gold processor, so though the outer hardware is nice, the internals match up with an entry-level PC.  And finally, the Macbook Pro is a high-spec device with a discrete GPU.\nAs you can clearly see in the video, GeForce NOW is silky smooth on all of these devices.  It seems to matter very little where your starting point is: this service just works.  While I\u2019m still a bit curious about the reasons NVIDIA left Apple\u2019s iOS and iPadOS out of the party, I\u2019m insanely impressed by the fact that users can really leverage any existing hardware to get up and running.  While I expected Windows and Mac OS to have very little issue with keyboard/mouse input, I was astonished by how well these same inputs functioned in the Android app.  Whether on a phone or tablet, GeForce NOW understood and interpreted the mouse cursor and whatever connected keyboard I chose with ease.\nThe same was true with controllers.  I hooked up a generic Logitech USB controller and my Stadia controller with the same level of acceptance across all devices.  As a matter of fact, I could switch from keyboard/mouse over to controller input mid-game and run into no issues at all.  From an input point of view, GeForce NOW is simply killing it.\nXremove ads\n\n\nAdd to all this functionality the fact that users can pull up tons of games they already own from Steam, UPlay, Epic Games, and Battle.net and you now have a service that presents cloud gaming in some of the best possible light.  No, every game you own won\u2019t work and I\u2019m sure there will be bumps in the road along the way, but game streaming is in a better overall place with the arrival of NVIDIA\u2019s new service.  I\u2019m sure XBOX, Steam, Playstation and even Amazon are readying their counter attacks, but GeForce NOW is here now, ready to play, and impressive in all it offers.  Grab whatever hardware you have laying around and give it a try for free.  I promise you\u2019ll come away impressed.\n\nJoin Chrome Unboxed Plus\nIntroducing Chrome Unboxed Plus \u2013 our revamped membership community.

At 25mm (front) and 29.95mm (rear), it\u2019s not exactly thin and with a large bezel surrounding the 15.6-inch display, it\u2019s also wide and deep (337.6mm x 251.3mm).\nHowever, starting at 2.53kg, it still feels relatively portable, and is significantly smaller and lighter than the 17-inch Precision 7740, which starts at 3.08kg.\nA larger chassis does have its benefits. Unlike the slender Precision 5540, there\u2019s a full-sized keyboard, complete with number pad for punching in dimensions.\nThere\u2019s a little bit of flex in the middle of the deck when typing, but it generally feels nice to use.\nThe trackpad is of a decent size with a good amount of resistance and three clickable buttons.\nThere\u2019s also a trackpoint with its own set of buttons below the space bar. But for precise design work in general, we\u2019d always recommend an external mouse.\nThere\u2019s a choice of four displays: three are FHD (1,920 x 1,080) and one is 4K (3,840 x 2,160).\nWe\u2019re used to seeing nice displays on Dell mobile workstations and the 4K IGZO panel that came with our review unit is no different.\nLinework in CAD is super-sharp and colours are notably vivid.\nThe panel supports 100% of the Adobe RGB colour space, so you should pick up nice subtleties in your renders.\n4K on a 15.6-inch display means a very high-pixel density.\nTo avoid tiny icons and text that\u2019s unreadable to ageing eyes, Windows ramps things up to 250%, but we found the best balance to be at 200%.\nIf you\u2019re on a tight budget and don\u2019t need 4K, you can save yourself around \u00a3300 by choosing a more basic FHD panel. In terms of connectivity, the machine is relatively well-equipped.\nThere are 2 x USB 3.1 Type A ports w/PowerShare on the right, 2 x Thunderbolt 3 Type C ports on the left, and a mini DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.0 and Ethernet at the rear.\nThose with multiple USB Type A peripherals can always plug in a hub or use a USB Type C to A adapter, as we did when setting up an Oculus Rift VR headset with two sensors.\nKey repairs and upgrades are relatively simple. After loosening five Philips screws, the back panel pops off, giving access to the battery, storage and two of the four memory slots.\nCore specs\nThe machine comes with a big choice of CPUs, from the quad-core Intel Core i5-9400H (2.50GHz, 4.3GHz Turbo), right up to the eight-core Intel Xeon E2286M (2.40GHz, 5.00GHz Turbo), which was in our review unit.\nIf your workflows aren\u2019t particularly multi-threaded, you could save yourself between \u00a3120 and \u00a3180 by going down to six cores, but you will lose a little bit of single-threaded performance as well: the six-core Xeon E-2276M and Core i7-9850H, for example, peak at 4.7GHz and 4.6GHz respectively.\nFor GPUs, there\u2019s an equally big choice.\nThis includes the entry-level AMD Radeon Pro WX 3200 (4GB), Nvidia Quadro T1000 (4GB) and T2000 (4GB), the mid-range Nvidia Quadro RTX 3000 (6GB) and RTX 4000 (8GB) and, of course, the high-end Nvidia Quadro RTX 5000 (16GB).\nIf you simply work with 3D CAD and therefore don\u2019t need anything more than the Quadro T2000, you\u2019re probably better served by the smaller and lighter Dell Precision 5540.\nThe machine can be fitted with up to 128GB of RAM, spread across four DIMMs. Our test unit came with 64GB (2 x 32GB) of DDR4 2666MHz Non- ECC memory, fitted behind the keyboard.\nThis should be plenty for most users, but should your needs change, there are two slots free for upgrades.\nThere\u2019s lots of scope for storage with support for up to three drives: either three M.2 PCIe SSDs or two M.2 PCIe SSDs and one 2.5\u201d HDD.\nThere is a caveat to this, however: you can\u2019t have a 2.5-inch drive with a Quadro RTX 3000, 4000 or 5000, as these power-hungry GPUs need the larger 6-cell 97Wh Lithium Ion battery, which blocks off the 2.5-inch bay.\nWith the larger Precision 7740, you can have both.\nFor those who work with very large datasets this an important consideration, as the price per GB of SSDs is still significantly higher than it is for HDDs.\nOur test unit came with single 512GB \u2018Class 50\u2019 SSD, an SK Hynix PC601.\nWe found very little information about this particular SSD, which may or not be used in other Dell Precision 7540s (Dell uses a range of suppliers).\nHowever, in Dell speak \u2018Class 50\u2019 means better performance than \u2018Class 40\u2019, where an equivalent capacity SSD is \u00a3200 cheaper.\nFor many professional users, a more important metric is endurance, but we couldn\u2019t find any data on this.\nThe Precision 7540 comes with a full sized keyboard and number pad\nPerformance\nThe Dell Precision 7540 is built for performance and we were largely impressed with the results from our realworld tests.\nExporting an IGES model from 3D CAD software Solidworks took 82 secs and for this single-threaded process, the Xeon E2286M CPU maintained a clock speed of 4.7GHz.\nThis is on par with most desktop workstations.\nUsing all eight CPU cores, a 4K render in Luxion KeyShot took 381 seconds.\nThis is slower than you\u2019d expect from a top-end eight-core desktop CPU but considering the Xeon E2286M has a TDP of 45W and a base clock speed of 2.4GHz, we were very impressed that it hit 3.2GHz for the duration of the test.\nIn fact, it even maintained this frequency when rendering for over an hour, with fan noise at quite acceptable levels.\nPutting the Quadro RTX 5000 through its paces in Autodesk VRED Professional, an application used extensively in automotive design, 3D performance was good at 4K resolution.\nWe got a smooth 42 frames per second (FPS) with anti-aliasing (AA) off and 26 FPS with AA set to medium.\nThis is slightly faster than we\u2019d expect from a desktop Quadro RTX 4000, but slower than a desktop Quadro RTX 5000.\nIn Enscape, a popular real-time viz tool for architecture, we got an adequate 17 FPS at 4K with our large architectural scene.\nHere, performance was almost identical to a desktop Quadro RTX 4000. Of course, the Quadro RTX 5000 is also VR ready and we had a very good flicker-free experience with an Oculus Rift in both Autodesk VRED Professional and Enscape.\nWith newer, higher resolution VR headsets, you\u2019d likely see a bit of drop in performance here.\nThe machine was a fair bit off the pace in GPU rendering.\nThe Quadro RTX 5000 took about 40% longer to render a scene than a desktop Quadro RTX 4000.\nThis was in both the V-Ray NEXT benchmark and Solidworks Visualize.\nThis could be down to sustained demands on the GPU.\nWith interactive graphics, the GPU is taxed on and off as and when you move the model, whereas with GPU rendering, it is hammered for extended periods.\nIn one eight-minute render, for example, as the GPU heated up, we saw the clock speed drop from around 1,500MHz to 1,200MHz.\nWhat these results show is that while the mobile Quadro RTX 5000 might have the same name as its desktop counterpart and be built from the same silicon, you can\u2019t expect the same performance.\nThis is down to the available power and the challenges of keeping a hot GPU running cool in a small space.\nTo put this in perspective, the Quadro RTX 5000 runs up to 80W in the Dell Precision 7540, up to 110W in the larger Precision 7740 and up to 265W in a desktop workstation.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that the relationship between power and performance is nonlinear and the performance curve will flatten off above 80W.\nTo really push the machine to its limits, we started a CPU render and GPU render at the same time.\nThe CPU clocked down to 1.95GHz and GPU utilisation went down from 95% to around 70-80% but the machine remained stable.\nWe could even launch Solidworks and spin a model without it locking up.\nMost impressively, fan noise never became too loud and the palm rest stayed cool, although the keyboard did get a little warm, but certainly not hot.\nThe battery drop\nWe also tested performance when running off battery and were quite surprised, if not completely shocked, at how much the GPU and CPU clocked down.\nIn KeyShot, the CPU dropped to 2.2GHz, taking 45% longer to complete the test render.\nIn Solidworks Visualize the difference was even more dramatic, with the GPU instantly dropping from 1,500MHz to 300MHz.\nIt was so slow, in fact, that we didn\u2019t even wait for our render to finish.\nIn short, when running off battery, you can get away with rendering on the CPU, but for GPU rendering, you really need to be plugged in.\nAnd, of course, any compute intensive operation will drain your battery much more quickly.\nConclusion\nDell has given its mainstream 15-inch mobile workstation a new lease of life with the powerful Nvidia Quadro RTX 5000 GPU.\nIt might not reach the heights of a desktop RTX 5000, and there are questions about performance when GPU rendering, but the Dell Precision 7540\u00a0gives those with GPU-hungry workflows a strong alternative to the bulkier 17-inch mobile workstation.\nWhen shoehorning powerful components into a small chassis, there\u2019s always a danger that thermals will get out of control.\nBut Dell\u2019s engineering team looks to have done an excellent job here and in our real-world tests, the machine maintained relatively high clock speeds without too much fan noise or heat.\nConsidering the high-end spec, it will come as little surprise that our review unit costs \u00a34,690 + VAT.\nMoving down to a Quadro RTX 4000 would save a substantial \u00a3812.\nWe\u2019d be interested to learn how this impacts 3D performance, although the drop from 16GB to 8GB of GPU memory should also be considered.\nWith our largest models in Enscape VR and Solidworks Visualize, for example, we were pushing 10 \u2013 11GB.\nIn summary, those who value performance above anything else would likely be best served by the Precision 7740, or even a desktop workstation, but for a blend of speed, portability and stability in a very well-engineered chassis, the Precision 7540 is hard to beat.\n\nDell Precision 7540 \u2013 Specifications\n\u00bb Intel Xeon E2286M CPU (8 Cores) (2.40GHz, 5.00GHz Turbo)\n\u00bb Nvidia Quadro RTX 5000 GPU (16GB GDDR6

Beyond that, the NVIDIA CEO noted how the company's gaming business was transformed to be more 'seasonal' with the success of the Nintendo Switch console (powered by NVIDIA's Tegra X1 SoC) and the Max-Q gaming notebooks.\nRelated Story NVIDIA\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang Says He\u2019d Love To Visit Trump To Congratulate On Election Victory; Hasn\u2019t Been Invited To Mar-a-Lago Yet\nOur gaming business the end market demand is really terrific. It's really healthy. It's been healthy throughout the whole year. And it's pretty clear that RTX is doing fantastic, it's super clear now that ray tracing is the most important new feature of next-generation graphics. We have over 30 games that have been announced, 11 games or so that have been shipped. The pipeline of ray tracing games that are going to be coming out is just really, really exciting.\nAnd one more thing about RTX, we finally have taken RTX down to $299. So it's now at the sweet spot of gaming. And so RTX is doing fantastic. The sell-through is fantastic all over the world.\nThe second part of our business that is changing in gaming is the amount of notebook sales and the success of Nintendo Switch, it has really changed the profile of our overall gaming business. Our notebook business has seen double-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters and this is unquestionably a new gaming category. Like it's a new game console. This is going to be the largest game console in the world I believe. And the reason for that is because there are more people with laptops than there are of any other device.\nAnd so the fact that we've been able to get RTX into a thin and light notebook is really a breakthrough. And it's one of the reasons why we're seeing such great success in notebook.\nBetween the notebook business and our Nintendo Switch business the profile of gaming overall has changed and has become more seasonal. It's more seasonal, because devices systems like notebooks and Switch are built largely in two quarters Q2 and Q3. And they build largely in Q2 and Q3, because it takes a while to build them and ship them and put them into the hubs around the world. And they tend to build it ahead of the holiday season.\nAnd so that's one of the reasons why Q3 will tend to be larger and Q4 will tend to be more seasonal and Q1 will tend to be more seasonal than the past. But the end demand is fantastic. RTX is doing great. And part of it is just a result of the success of our notebooks.\n\nDuring the earnings call, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang also briefly discussed the recent launch of GeForce NOW and the partnership with Tencent on the START cloud gaming service for China.\n\n[...] here in the West, we've had a lot more opportunity to refine the connections around the world and working through the beta centers, the local hubs as well as people's WiFi routers at home. And so, we've been in data for quite some time as you know. And here at West our platform is open. And we have several hundred games now, and we're in the process of onboarding another 1,500 games. We're the only cloud platform that's based on Windows, and allows us to be able to bring PC games to the cloud.\nWe've had more experience here in the West with reach and we obviously have a lot more games that we can onboard. But I'm super enthusiastic about the partnership we have with Tencent. Overall, our GeForce NOW, you guys saw the launch, the reception has been fantastic. The reviews have been fantastic.\nOur strategy has three components. There's the GeForce NOW service that we provide ourselves. We also have GeForce NOW alliances with telcos around the world to reach the regions around the world that we don't have a presence in. And that is going super well, and I'm excited about that. And then lastly, partnerships with large publishers, for example like Tencent. And we offer them our platform of course and a great deal of software and just a lot of engineering that has to be done in collaboration to refine the service.\n\nDid you try GeForce NOW since its release earlier this month? If so, what's your opinion of it?\n[excerpts via Seeking Alpha]\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Is Giving Away Five \u2018Classic\u2019 Graphics Cards Signed By CEO Jensen, GeForce 256 Is The First One\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang, To Deliver CES 2025 Keynote on 6th January: Next-Gen GPU Announcements Imminent\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang Is Now Worth More Than \u201cAll Of Intel\u201d Combined\n\nMuhammad Zuhair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s CEO Expected To Pay A Visit To Taiwan, Likely Attending The \u201cIntelligent Asia 2024\u201d Robotic Event\n\nMuhammad Zuhair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit By 2034\n\n\n\n215\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n128\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n78\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Reportedly Taps Palantir To Improve The Yield And Overall Quality Of Its Chips\n\n\n\n51\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n46\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Instead, Intel has updated it with one of the most useful features that both Nvidia GeForce Experience and AMD Adrenalin offer: gameplay recording.\u00a0Intel has announced that video recording and broadcasting will be coming to IGCC (Intel Graphics Command Center) through a Twitter post, bringing its gaming-focused UI more in line with what's offered by competitors AMD and Nvidia, notably before Intel Xe. And, luckily if you want to try it out yourself, you can download the beta version of the software through the Microsoft Store.\u00a0The game broadcasting feature is in testing and needs your feedback! Download the beta Intel Graphics Command Center to test game streaming and recording, then let us know what you think! What parts did you like?

However, because right now Intel graphics are limited to integrated GPUs, performance will likely take a dive \u2013 but this is about the future \u2013 the far future if rumors are to be believed.\u00a0That's right, it looks like Intel wants to make sure its software game is up to snuff when Intel Xe graphics cards eventually make it to market. That will likely be a while, since the Intel Xe DG1 GPU we played with at CES 2020 is still in its early stages, and will likely not be in the hands of consumers for quite a while.\u00a0However long we have to wait for Intel's graphics cards in the mainstream, we hope to see many more software features like this make their way into its software. Who knows, maybe by the time we actually get our hands on an Intel Xe graphics card, Intel Graphics Command Center will be as fully featured as Nvidia GeForce Experience or AMD Adrenalin.\u00a0Check out the best processorsGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nIntel\n\n\nBill ThomasSocial Links NavigationBill Thomas (Twitter) is TechRadar's computing editor.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Dave Altavilla is a Tech Analyst covering chips, compute and AI.Follow AuthorFeb 04, 2020, 01:33pm ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 5 years old.NVIDIA GeForce NOW Game Streaming PlatformsNVIDIA\nThe Cloud Gaming services battle is shaping-up to be big business across the globe in 2020, with primary competitors like Google Stadia, Microsoft xCloud, and NVIDIA with GeForce NOW ramping up their respective services and technologies. In October of last year, NVIDIA and its partners rolled out live, open services for Russia and the platform has been up and running in Korea for a while as well. Only closed beta access was available in the U.S. and Europe, however, as NVIDIA continued to build-up and optimize its infrastructure to improve the experience until it was ready for prime time.\n\n\nThat time is now, as the gaming and graphics powerhouse is making GeForce NOW available to everyone. NVIDIA itself will be hosting services in its commissioned data centers for the Western Europe and North America regions, with GFNA (GeForce NOW Alliance) infrastructure partners supporting Eastern Europe and Asia.\nDeliver Us The Moon Screen Shot With NVIDIA RTX Ray TracingKeokeN Interactive\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s GeForce NOW service has some key advantages over most other Cloud Gaming solutions. For one, NVIDIA being so tightly coupled to the hardware and software development throughout the years has allowed them to tweak and tune the service for optimal performance and a quality user experience. Graphics and gaming are among NVIDIA\u2019s core competencies, and it has significant experience in HPC and the Data Center as well. Marry of that experience together and GeForce NOW feels like a polished and mature product right out of the gate.\n\nOf course, NVIDIA has kept the service in the beta phase for an extended period to ensure a quality user experience. NVIDIA claims that 300,000 beta testers have streamed more than 70 million hours of gameplay in 30 countries throughout North America and Europe already. That level of commitment and qualification is paramount and should help mitigate any potential growing pains as participation in GeForce NOW increases. Competitors in the space, even large ones like Google, haven\u2019t had the experience of such a long ramp, with feedback from hardcore gamers throughout.\n\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nAnother key advantage to GeForce NOW is its library and the relationships NVIDIA has cultivated with game developers. NVIDIA makes it clear in a blog post that just went live on the company website where it says, \u201cWith GeForce NOW, you can keep playing the games you already own and continue building libraries from the same stores you already use every day. That\u2019s what it means to be an open platform. If you buy it, you own it. If you already own it, play it. Your purchases are always yours.\u201d Some gamers have voiced displeasure with the pricing and fees associated with other services to play games they may already own \u2013 this shouldn\u2019t be an issue for NVIDIA. At the moment, there are more than 30 free-to-play games on the service, though in total there are hundreds of games available from more than 50 publishers that are available for instant play (if already own them). All the games are patched automatically in the cloud as well, so there\u2019s no need for gamers to maintain the library moving forward. There are also more than 1,000 games that can be played through single-session installs according to NVIDIA.\nGeForce NOW Membership OptionsNVIDIA\n\n\nThere are currently two service tiers available for GeForce NOW, a free tier and a paid tier. Anyone already in the beta program has automatically been enrolled in the free tier, which provides one-hour sessions with standard access to GeForce NOW servers. Gamers aren\u2019t limited to the number of sessions they can play, but the session length is limited to one hour per instance, at which point they\u2019ll have to re-enter the queue to pick up where they left off. A paid \u201cFounders\u201d tier is currently available for $4.99 per month (for the remainder of 2020), which offers no wait times and a longer session-length (up to 6 hours). Paid Founders Tier users get priority access to GeForce NOW servers ahead of free members and will have exclusive access to RTX-enabled content on the service as well.\nNVIDIA is currently offering the first three months of Founders tier memberships for free (for a limited time), followed by the discounted rate for the remainder of the year. The non-discounted rate, which will presumably kick-in at some point in 2021, hasn\u2019t been disclosed just yet.\nNVIDIA\u2019s GeForce NOW is available on a variety of platforms, including the PC and Mac, NVIDIA\u2019s own SHIELD TV devices, and Android-based mobile devices.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Now the company has refreshed the Shield TV unit with a cylindrical shape, faster processor, AI upscaling, Dolby Vision support, redesigned remote, and lower price. While the odd, cigar-like shape of the Shield TV itself and the strangely triangular remote control will get your attention, the biggest change to the Shield TV is its newfound ability to harness AI to convincingly upscale HD video to 4K. And true to Nvidia\u2019s primary calling, the Shield TV provides a number of gaming outlets, from the usual fare of mobile games in the Google Play Store to streaming AAA titles from its GeForce Now service or your own PC.8Nvidia Shield Android TV0The Nvidia Shield TV is one of the best media streamers you can buy$149.99 save 0%$149.99 at AmazonIt\u2019s also less expensive than the previous model ($150 MSRP, down from $200), no longer holding the crown of most expensive streaming box, a title the $179 Apple TV 4K now inherits. Does its faster performance, AI upscaling and lower price make the Nvidia Shield TV the streaming box (or, in its case, cylinder) to own? Let\u2019s dig in and find out.Design and FeaturesStreaming boxes are usually cube-like in shape, but the new Nvidia Shield TV arrives in a drastically different form factor: the humble cylinder. With an HDMI port on one end and the power connector on the other, it\u2019s meant to be stashed behind your TV among your tangle of cables. Next to the HDMI port is a microSD slot for expanding the Shield TV\u2019s internal storage, and an Ethernet jack sits next to the power port if you\u2019d rather use a wired connection to your network rather than Wi-Fi. There\u2019s also a button that makes the remote emit a series of beeps if you ever need help locating it.The remote control is less likely to slip between your couch cushions than the previous Shield TV remote or the skinny remotes for Apple TV or Fire TV. Unlike those thin slivers, the Shield TV remote is triangular in shape and noticeably more substantial, like a Toblerone chocolate bar. And it has some heft to it \u2013 in large part because it\u2019s powered by two AAA batteries instead of a smaller, rechargeable battery.The remote makes it easy to navigate the Android TV interface. It has a navigational ring that surrounds a Select button. Below are Home and Back buttons, media control buttons, volume buttons, and a voice search button via Google Assistant. Above the navigation ring are two buttons \u2013 the power button and a programmable button you can set to perform one of a variety of tasks, including opening the settings menu, muting the volume, or toggling AI upscaling on and off. After testing the AI upscaling, I ended up setting the button to act as a mute button. The bottom-most button is a Netflix button that I wish wasn\u2019t so wide because I constantly hit it by accident. I also still haven\u2019t gotten used to the layout of the media control buttons \u2013 fast forward, play/pause, and rewind are lined up vertically. It helps, however, that the buttons light up when you pick up the remote.To get the remote\u2019s volume buttons working, you\u2019ll need to head into the settings of Android TV and connect it with your TV, speakers, or soundbar. You can do the same thing in order to have the remote\u2019s power button turn your TV on and off with the Shield TV. Both volume and power buttons were easy to set up and seamless to use.Like the previous model, the newest Shield TV supports HDR10 and Dolby Atmos. Unlike the last model, it also supports Dolby Vision, which is good news for watching 4K content on Prime Video, Apple, Netflix and Vudu. It lacks the HDR10+ format, which provides an even more realistic, dynamic picture \u2013 a feature you get with the Amazon Fire TV Cube. The Shield TV can also act as a Chromecast for streaming content from your phone, tablet or laptop.Powering the Shield TV is Nvidia\u2019s own Tegra X1+ processor and 8GB of flash storage. The new Tegra chip is up to 25% faster than the Tegra X1 chip in the previous Shield TV, according to Nvidia, but the storage capacity is half that of the previous model. You can, however, expand the Shield TV\u2019s storage via the microSD card slot. (The previous model had a USB port for expanded storage.) Then again, given the sheer amount of streaming content available, you may not even fill the 8GB of internal storage.Unlike the previous Shield TV, the current model does not ship with a game controller. This helps bring the price down by $50 from the previous model, and isn\u2019t a terrible omission if you have an Xbox One or PlayStation 4 controller, either of which work just fine. I quickly and easily paired at Xbox One controller with the Shield TV, although it wasn\u2019t always smooth sailing \u2013 more on that in the next section.Setting up Shield TV is a snap, requiring only a power cable and HDMI connection to your TV. You will, however, need to supply your own HDMI cable; Nvidia curiously doesn\u2019t include one in the box. With the Shield TV connected to your TV and powered on, you simply need to connect to your home network, either wired or wirelessly. The entire process took me less than 10 minutes, and that included running a system update for Android TV and pairing the Shield TV remote with my Vizio soundbar and Insignia TV.Running Android TV 8.1, the Shield TV is easy to navigate. A row small icons sits at the top of your favorite apps; you can add and remove apps to this list and drag and drop to reorder the list. Below that sits a row of Nvidia games you can play or stream; most of the titles listed are streamable via Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now service, but any games you purchase from the Google Play Store also show up here. Below these top two rows of apps and games are rows of your \u201cchannels.\u201d That is, the streaming services you use, from the Google Play Store and YouTube to Netflix and Hulu. For each channel row, you can scroll sideways to see thumbnails of recommendations.You can customize your rows of channels, but some services, including YouTube TV and Amazon Prime Video, don\u2019t get their own channel in this column. I accessed these two streaming services from the row of favorites at the top, which isn\u2019t terribly inconvenient, but doesn\u2019t show recommendations that would let me jump directly into a show.On the whole, the Android TV interface is well organized and easily customizable \u2013 with some limitations in terms of which services can be added as a channel. And since Nvidia doesn\u2019t offer its own streaming service outside of GeForce Now for games, it isn\u2019t tipped toward one service. The Fire TV Cube, for instance, heavily favors Prime Video content. With Shield TV, it is a more equitable layout among the services, although it is disappointing that not every service is available to add as its own channel, including Amazon\u2019s.I cut the cord last year, moving from cable TV to YouTube TV, and my only complaint has been the slow speed with which my Roku TV switches channels. That lag all but disappeared with Shield TV. Flipping through channels on YouTube TV via Shield TV is much faster than with my Roku-enabled Insignia TV and on par with the speed of the Apple TV 4K.One major Shield TV feature that you won\u2019t find on other streaming boxes is the ability to play AAA games. In addition to downloading casual games from the Google Play Store and playing them, you can stream games via Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now service and from your own PC \u2013 as long as it has an Nvidia GeForce GPU. With the Nvidia Experience app open on my PC, I was able to stream games to my TV, but navigating menus of some games with a controller on my TV proved challenging, to the point that on more than one occasion I had to retreat to my PC and press enter or use a mouse to move the cursor. For the most part, games played smoothly, but I did encounter a problem with CS:GO I couldn\u2019t solve. Although my Xbox One controller worked perfectly for the game on my PC, the controls weren\u2019t right when playing on my TV \u2013 I couldn\u2019t move forward without also panning up, which made the game unplayable.While only gamers with GeForce-based PCs are able to use GameStream, any and all Shield TV owners with a 4K HDTV will enjoy its AI upscaling, which takes 720p and 1080p video and upscales it to 4K. I am generally skeptical of such upscaling, but it\u2019s very effective and convincing on the Shield TV. It\u2019s easy to toggle on and off, and the Shield TV even includes a demo mode that lets you move a vertical line across your screen to compare the upscaled and original image side-by-side. I found the differences between the two images to be slight but appreciated \u2013 surfaces appeared more textured and edges were crisper with AI upscaling, and it didn\u2019t introduce any artifacts. I ended up leaving it enabled on its Medium setting (there\u2019s also Low and High settings for Detail Enhancement), but I was disappointed to find it didn\u2019t work with YouTube with Live TV or games. I wish I could watch live sports with AI upscaling, but I was more than happy to stream content on Netflix and Hulu with it.Purchasing GuideThe Nvidia Shield TV is available at its MSRP of $149.99 direct from Nvidia\u2019s site as well as online retailers, including Amazon and Best Buy. It was briefly discounted to $129 in late January, but is back to full price as of this writing.Originally posted: Feb 5, 2020 8:09 pmVerdictFor its speedy performance, AI upscaling, well-designed remote, and lower price, the Nvidia Shield TV is one of the best media streamers you can buy.

Posed as part of the future of gaming alongside the likes of Microsoft\u2019s xCloud and Google Stadia, GeForce Now allows you to stream games to multiple devices, no install required.\nThat sounds very rosy, but how do you actually play games on GeForce Now? Don\u2019t sweat: we\u2019ll walk you through it.\n[Read:\u00a0Half-Life: Alyx comes out on March 23. Here are all the compatible headsets.]\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need an Nvidia account \u2014 which is about as easy to create as these things usually are. Go to the GeForce Now page and you can sign up when you\u2019re getting a membership. You can try a free account, or shell out for the premiere tier. At the moment, there\u2019s still a 90-day free trial available for the latter, which I\u2019m using for the purposes of this article.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen your membership, you can download GeForce Now for Windows, Mac, or Nvidia Shield (an app for Android is also available in the Play Store). Log into that aforementioned Nvidia account on the client.\n\nThe ubiquitous gear icon at the top will let you adjust your GeForce settings, including your streaming quality. If you would prefer to use as much of your bandwidth as possible, you can choose \u201cBalanced,\u201d while \u201cData Saver\u201d will give you a comparatively lean experience. You can also manage your membership from this page.\n\nNow you\u2019ll have to do the work of adding compatible games to your GeForce client. To do this, search for the game\u2019s titles in the GeForce Now client, and select the supported games when you find them. Unless the game is free-to-play \u2014 such as\u00a0Fortnite \u2014 you\u2019ll need to purchase it from a supported game store to be able to play it on GeForce Now. To demonstrate, I\u2019m playing\u00a0Greedfall (which, if you haven\u2019t, you should), which I purchased on Steam.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve logged in to Steam on the GeForce client and located the game in question, you\u2019ll see that the in-GeForce Steam might say to \u201cinstall\u201d the game, even if it\u2019s already installed on your machine. Don\u2019t panic \u2014 this won\u2019t be what you think it is. When I hit install on\u00a0Greedfall, the Steam overlay instantly told me the game had installed, and I was able to boot it up right away.\n\nYou may have to play with your settings to get the best quality game, even with streaming quality set to \u201cBalanced.\u201d For some reason,\u00a0Greedfall was set to a sub-1080p resolution, but that was easily fixed on my part. I was also able to access my Steam cloud autosave, though I started a new character just to test this out.\n\nFinding which games you can play can be a bit touch-and-go, as Nvidia basically forces you to search for every game you want to play rather than offering a definitive list \u2014 and it\u2019s not entirely clear if every game store out there is supported. So far, it doesn\u2019t seem any games from the Epic Store or GOG will load via the GeForce Now client, but Origin works. Still, if you\u2019ve bought most of your games on Steam (which I\u2019ll presume is most of you reading this article), then this is a great way to play without having to install the games in question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        Story by\n                                    \n\n\n                                            Rachel Kaser\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                        Internet Culture Writer\n                                    \n\n\n\n                                            Rachel is a writer and former game critic from Central Texas.

The phrase alone, or just its abbreviation, DRM, once had the power to spark scathing editorials and spawn furious debates in online forums worldwide. In the 2000s, major PC video game publishers began adding software to their discs that limited the number of times these games could be installed, tracking and verifying players in new, conspicuous ways. Variations of this system persisted throughout the early 2010s, when Microsoft attempted to release the Xbox One with built-in DRM checks. The response from fans was so vicious that Microsoft abandoned its strategy and rebuilt the Xbox One without DRM just months before its launch date.Fast forward to February 2020. NVIDIA launched GeForce Now, the first and only cloud gaming platform to operate on a \"DRM-free\" basis. When you buy a game via GeForce Now, you get to keep it, regardless of whether the service itself remains live -- a promise that its competitors, Google Stadia and Microsoft's xCloud, can't make.Yet, no one seems to care.In heated Twitter threads and editorials about the newest and most controversial gaming platforms around, the DRM-free bit of NVIDIA's news seemed to barely register with fans. A feature that would've made headlines in 2010 is often relegated to a single sentence at the base of the inverted pyramid, or not mentioned at all.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementThat's because, over time, we got used to DRM. Every major gaming platform today relies on DRM, with companies like Valve, Epic Games, Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo owning players' libraries in some form. In a digital-first ecosystem, it's just easier this way.Players weren't so agreeable when it came to SecuROM, the granddaddy of DRM. Publishers started using the anti-piracy software in earnest around 2007, when physical discs and midnight GameStop release parties were all the rage. SecuROM was a flashpoint of controversy particularly in the launches of BioShock, Mass Effect and Spore, limiting the number of times these titles could be installed and forcing players to routinely connect to the internet for authentication. By 2010, Ubisoft was pushing always-on DRM for games including Assassin's Creed 2 and Splinter-Cell: Conviction, requiring players to maintain a constant internet connection, even for offline play. Ubisoft's approach to DRM routinely broke the games it was built to protect and the response from players was unanimously negative.Players called SecuROM punitive and hostile, and wondered why they needed an internet connection to play these games offline. EA, 2K, Ubisoft and other publishers tweaked their anti-piracy systems in response to mobs of criticism. Spore publisher EA faced a class-action lawsuit over the game's SecuROM features.Meanwhile, Valve was building out Steam. The storefront was initially designed to streamline the patch process for games like Counter-Strike, and also make it easier for Valve to implement anti-piracy and anti-cheat measures. Steam was built to be a DRM machine.Valve made Steam a requirement in 2004 with the launch of Half-Life 2 -- anyone who wanted to play the game, even those with physical copies, had to launch the client first. Players balked at the move, but Half-Life 2 had enough hype to sustain this plan, and Steam continued to grow. As Valve added dozens and then thousands of third-party games to its store over the years, the company implemented features like offline play and Family Sharing to assuage fans that had been burned by bad DRM practices.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementValve is too big to fail.More importantly, Steam made buying games easy. Instead of picking up discs and typing out long CD keys, Steam offered one-click access to a massive lineup of new releases and old classics. Players bought into this online-first system entirely, and today, Steam has 1 billion registered users and 90 million monthly active players. Despite determined competitors like GOG (a longstanding DRM-free gaming hub) and the Epic Games Store, it's the undisputed leader in digital distribution.Steam still runs on DRM. Even in offline mode, players still need to connect with the Steam client to launch any of their games. As it stands, if Steam shut down today, everyone's libraries would become instantly unplayable.Generally, users are OK with this threat -- after all, it's Valve. It's the company that made DRM palatable in the 2000s. It's the multibillion-dollar corporation led by benevolent nerd king Gabe Newell. It's the studio behind Half-Life, Portal, Dota 2, Left 4 Dead, Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike. Valve is too big to fail.As someone who entered college at the height of the Great Recession, that phrase still sends shivers down my spine.Steam offers the clearest example of how DRM quietly infiltrated modern gaming systems, though it's not the only storefront to operate in this way. Microsoft and Sony each offer subscription packages -- Xbox Game Pass and PS Now -- that allow users to purchase and play games, though these titles are only available as long as the subscription is active. The Epic Games Store doesn't have an overarching DRM policy, but many of its games, including Fortnite, require the client to launch. In cloud gaming, Google Stadia allows players to purchase any titles they want, but they're only accessible through the app, with a valid subscription and internet connection.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementAnd then there's NVIDIA. GeForce Now is not only a game-streaming service, but it allows players to actually download games and play them locally. The store itself is DRM-free, though there is one caveat: Downloaded games end up in players' existing accounts on Steam, the Epic Games Store and other platforms. Maybe we should call this DRM-once-removed, rather than DRM-free.Today, it's difficult to escape DRM in the gaming industry. Rising internet saturation provided the backbone for these verification systems, and players gradually accepted the terms because the trade-off was worth it. In a digital-first environment, it's much easier to click a \"Buy\" button than it is to haul your butt to the store. It's just that nowadays, \"buy\" doesn't mean what it used to.The system is working, for now. Millions of players log into PS Now, Xbox Game Pass, Stadia, GeForce Now, Steam and the Epic Games Store every day, and their games are still there.Well, most of their games.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisement$60 poorer and SOL.Just today, Activision Blizzard unceremoniously pulled all of its titles from GeForce Now, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Overwatch and World of Warcraft. Players are clearly displeased with the move, though most of the ire has been directed at Activision, rather than NVIDIA. Under NVIDIA's DRM-adjacent rules, anyone who downloaded an Activision Blizzard game before the removal should still own it, though there's no guarantee they'll have a PC capable of running it. After all, GeForce Now is a streaming service designed to make large, high-density games playable on any device. The people seeing the most benefit from GeForce Now specifically don't own a gaming rig. Anyone in this category who bought, say, Modern Warfare on NVIDIA's streaming service has suddenly found themselves $60 poorer and SOL, regardless of whether the game shows up in their personal library.The conversation about the restrictive power of digital storefronts and DRM is on the rise again, though it's unlikely to result in industry-wide change. These discussions pop up when DRM features end up breaking a game or when a new store tries to take on Steam, but the fervor of the early 2000s has dissipated. Players rely on DRM in ways they never have before. As long as Valve, Microsoft, Sony, Epic, Google, NVIDIA and other platform holders keep their promises and manage to stay afloat, players won't have a reason to rebel against DRM in the same way again.In other words, just give it time.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

And, while it's got a bulky library, GeForce Now is missing some huge titles.\u00a0This first came to our attention when both Ars Technica and The Verge put out some brief impressions pieces noting that some games were missing, apparently due to licensing issues with some major publishers.\u00a0We'll show you how to build a PCGeForce Now will let you play most of the best PC gamesCheck out the best gaming PCs so you don't have to streamChief among these publishers are behemoth companies like Rockstar Games and Square Enix, who are behind some of the biggest games around like Red Dead Redemption 2 and, well, the entirety of Final Fantasy. That's right, the entire Final Fantasy series is missing from a platform that advertises itself based on the ability to play your PC library wherever you go.\u00a0Either way, even if Nvidia GeForce Now is missing all of these games, the fact that you can use your existing Steam, Origin or Epic Games Store accounts means that there are thousands more titles than Google Stadia offers - a service that's currently stuck at 27 available games.\u00a0We're not sure when or if the missing games will make their way onto Nvidia's nascent-but-still-somehow-ancient game streaming service, but we reached out to Team Green for comment, and we'll update this article as soon as we hear anything.\u00a0What happened to all the RTX games?Even though they've been out for awhile, there are three games that serve as an excellent showcase of what ray tracing powered by Nvidia Turing technology could be capable of: Metro Exodus, Control and Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Right now, the only one of those games that are available on GeForce Now is Metro Exodus.\u00a0And, we don't mean to knock Metro Exodus - it's a fantastic game and an even better showcase of technology - but the lack of Control and Shadow of the Tomb Raider isn't a great look. Back when we tested ray tracing in Control with a bunch of Nvidia RTX cards, we were blown away by what this technology could do.\u00a0Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Before Control, in fact, we thought that ray tracing was a neat little gimmick that looked cool, but wasn't absolutely necessary. If any game out there makes the case that ray tracing is, like Nvidia wants us to believe, the future - it's Remedy's Control.\u00a0Nvidia GeForce Now could have easily been an excellent way to give folks that couldn't afford an expensive Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 a way to actually live in Nvidia's ray traced future without breaking open the piggy bank. It's entirely possible that this early lack of ray tracing heavy hitters is only temporary while Nvidia works out licensing agreements, but it's still an odd way to launch the service.\u00a0If you do subscribe to GeForce Now and want to experience ray tracing, you can still do it through games like Metro Exodus, Wolfenstein: Youngblood and Deliver Us the Moon. And that's definitely more than the zero ray-traced games that Google Stadia has.\u00a0Look, as time goes on and more PC games adopt ray tracing, this will likely be much less of an issue. But as it stands right now, some of the best ray traced games aren't on the platform, and we hope they find their way onto GeForce Now as soon as possible. \u00a0Here are the best gaming laptops\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nBill ThomasSocial Links NavigationBill Thomas (Twitter) is TechRadar's computing editor.

We also wanted to ask Nvidia as many questions as we could to really dig into the current state of DLSS.\nToday's article is going to cover everything. We'll be looking at the latest titles to use DLSS, focusing primarily on Control and Wolfenstein: Youngblood, to see how Nvidia's DLSS 2.0 (as we're calling it) stacks up. This will include our usual suite of visual comparisons looking at DLSS compared to native image quality, resolution scaling, and various other post processing techniques. Then, of course, there will be a look at performance across all of Nvidia's RTX GPUs.\nWe'll also be briefly reviewing the original launch games that used DLSS to see what's changed here, and there will be plenty of discussion on the RTX ecosystem, Nvidia's marketing, expectations, disappointments, and so on. Strap yourselves in because this is going to be a comprehensive look at where DLSS stands today.\n\nFirst, having covered the topic in detail before, here's a recap of where we're up to with DLSS...\nNvidia advertised DLSS as a key feature of GeForce RTX 20 series GPUs when they launched in September 2018. The idea was to improve gaming performance for those wanting to play at high resolutions with high quality settings, such as ray tracing. It did this by rendering the game at a lower than native resolution, for example, 1440p if your target resolution was 4K, and then upscaling it back to the native res using the power of AI and deep learning. The goal was for this upscaling algorithm to provide native-level image quality with higher performance, giving RTX GPUs more value than they otherwise had at the time.\nThis AI algorithm also leveraged a new feature on RTX Turing GPUs: the tensor cores. While these cores are most likely included on the GPU to make it also suitable for data center and workstation use cases, Nvidia found a way to use this hardware feature for gaming. Later, Nvidia decided to ditch the tensor cores for their cheaper Turing GPUs in their GTX 16 series products, so DLSS ended up only being supported on 20 series RTX products.\n\nWhile all this sounded promising, the execution within the first 9 months was far from perfect. Early DLSS implementations looked bad, producing a blurry image with artifacts. Battlefield V was a particularly egregious case, but even Metro Exodus failed to impress.\n\nOne of the major issues with the initial version of DLSS is that it did not provide an experience better than existing resolution scaling techniques. The implementation in Battlefield V, for example, looked worse and performed worse than a simple resolution upscale. In Metro Exodus it was more on par with these techniques, but it wasn't impressive either. As DLSS was locked down to certain quality settings and resolutions on certain GPUs, and was only supported in a very limited selection of games, it didn't make sense to use DLSS instead of resolution scaling.\nFollowing the disappointing result, Nvidia decided to throw the original version of DLSS in the bin, at least that's what it sounded like based on our discussions with the company. Instead, for the short term they released a better sharpening filter for their FreeStyle tools that would enhance the resolution scaling experience, while they worked on a new version of DLSS in-house.\n\nThe first step towards DLSS 2.0 was the release of Control. This game doesn't use the \"final\" version of the new DLSS, but what Nvidia calls an \"approximation\" of the work-in-progress AI network. This approximation was worked into an image processing algorithm that ran on the standard shader cores, rather than Nvidia's special tensor cores, but attempted to provide a DLSS-like experience. For the sake of simplicity, we're going to call this DLSS 1.9, and we'll talk about this more when we look at DLSS in Control.\nLate in 2019 though, Nvidia got around to finalizing the new DLSS \u2013 we feel the upgrade is significant enough to warrant it being called DLSS 2.0. There are fundamental changes to the way DLSS works with this version, including the removal of all restrictions, so DLSS now works at any resolution and quality settings on all RTX GPUs. It also no longer requires per-game training, instead using a generalized training system, and it runs at higher performance. These changes required a significant update to the DLSS SDK, so it's not backwards compatible with original DLSS titles.\n\nSo far, we've seen two titles that use DLSS 2.0: Wolfenstein: Youngblood and indie title 'Deliver us the Moon'. We'll be focusing primarily on Youngblood as it's a major release.\nNvidia tells us that DLSS 2.0 is the version that will be used in all DLSS-enabled games going forward; the shader core version, DLSS 1.9, was a one-off and will only be used for Control. But we think it's still important to talk about what Nvidia has done in Control, both to see how DLSS has evolved and also to see what is possible with a shader core image processing algorithm, so let's dive into it.\nSome visual details and comparisons are better noticed in motion.\r\nWatch the HUB video below for more.\n\nControl + DLSS\nWith a target resolution of 4K, DLSS 1.9 in Control is impressive. More so when you consider this is an approximation of the full technology running on the shader cores. The game allows you to select two render resolutions, which at 4K gives you the choice of 1080p or 1440p, depending on the level of performance and image quality you desire.\nDLSS with a 1440p render resolution is the better of the two options. It doesn't provide the same level of sharpness or clarity as native 4K, but it gets pretty close. It's also close overall to a scaled 1800p image. In some areas DLSS is better, in others it's worse, but the slightly softer image DLSS provides is quite similar to a small resolution scale. Unlike previous versions of DLSS, though, it doesn't suffer from any oil painting artifacts or weird reconstructions when the upscale from 1440p to 4K is applied. The output quality is very good.\n\n\n\nWe can also see that DLSS rendering at 1440p is better than simply playing the game at 1440p. Some of the differences are subtle and require us zooming in to see better edge handling and cleaner lines, but the differences are there: we'd much rather play at 1440p DLSS than native.\n\nThat's not to say DLSS 1.9 is perfect, because it does seem to be using a temporal reconstruction technique, taking multiple frames and combining them into one for higher detail images. This is evident when viewing some of the fine details around the Control game world, particularly grated air vents, which trouble the image processing algorithm and produce flickering that isn't present with either the native or 1800p scaled images. These super fine wires or lines throughout the environment seem to consistently give DLSS the most trouble, although image quality for larger objects is decent.\n\n\n\nPreviously we found that DLSS targeting 4K was able to produce image quality similar to an 1800p resolution scale, and with Control's implementation that hasn't changed much, although as we've just been talking about we do think the quality is better overall and basically equivalent (or occasionally better) than the scaled version. But the key difference between older versions of DLSS and this new version, is the performance.\n... the key difference between older versions of DLSS and this new version, is the performance.\nPreviously, running DLSS came with a performance hit relative to whatever resolution it was rendering at. So 4K DLSS, which used a 1440p render resolution, was slower than running the game at native 1440p as the upscaling algorithm used a substantial amount of processing time. This ended up delivering around 1800p-like performance, with 1800p like image quality, hence our original lack of enthusiasm.\n\n\n\nHowever, this shader processed version is significantly less performance intensive. 4K DLSS with a 1440p render target performed on par with native 1440p, so there is a significant performance improvement over the 1800p-like performance we got previously. This also clearly makes DLSS 1.9 the best upscaling technique we have, because it offers superior image quality to 1440p with performance on par with 1440p; essentially there's next to no performance hit here.\nAnother way to look at it is we get an 1800p-like image, with the performance of 1440p, which is simply better than we can achieve with any resolution scaling option.\n\n\n\nYou'll notice that we haven't mentioned image sharpening and how that factors in. With previous DLSS iterations, scaled 1800p provided better non-sharpened image quality with fewer artifacts at the same performance level, which made 1800p a better base rendering option to then sharpen from. With sharpening, you want to use the best native image you can and go from there, which is why we preferred using 1800p + sharpening to match 4K rather than using either native DLSS or sharpened DLSS. The results were better.\nBut with \"DLSS 1.9/2.0,\" the tables have turned and now it makes more sense to sharpen the DLSS image if you want to try and further match native image quality. That's because unlike with previous versions, at equivalent performance levels we do get better image quality with DLSS this time. Sharpening DLSS rendering at 1440p to try and emulate 4K gives you much better results than trying to sharpen a simple 1440p upscaling job.\nWhile DLSS in Control is nice for anyone targeting 4K and using a 1440p render resolution, the results outside of this specific combination are lackluster. When targeting 4K and using the lower 1080p render resolution, temporal artifacts become more obvious and at times jarring. The image is also softer than with a 1440p resolution, which is to be expected, although performance is solid.\n\n\n\nUsing DLSS with a target resolution below 4K is also not a good idea. When targeting 1440p we're presented with either 960p or 720p as the render resolutions, and when rendering at either of these resolutions there's simply not enough detail to reconstruct a great looking image. Even the higher quality option, 960p, delivered far from a native 1440p image. This algorithmic approximation of DLSS is just not suited to these lower resolutions.\nWith this in mind, let's explore the performance benefit we get from Control's optimal configuration: a target resolution of 4K while rendering at 1440p. We're comparing to Control running at 1800p, which is the equivalent visual quality option, to see the pure performance benefit. The benchmarks were ran on our Core i9-9900K test rig with 16GB of RAM, and we used Ultra settings with 2x MSAA when DLSS was disabled.\n\nThe performance gains we see with each RTX GPU are fairly consistent across the board. When visual quality is made roughly equal, DLSS is providing between 33 and 41 percent more performance, which is a very respectable uplift.\n\nThis first batch of results playing Control with the shader version of DLSS are impressive. This begs the question, why did Nvidia feel the need to go back to an AI model running on tensor cores for the latest version of DLSS? Couldn't they just keep working on the shader version and open it up to everyone, such as GTX 16 series owners? We asked Nvidia the question, and the answer was pretty straightforward: Nvidia's engineers felt that they had reached the limits with the shader version.\n\nConcretely, switching back to tensor cores and using an AI model allows Nvidia to achieve better image quality, better handling of some pain points like motion, better low resolution support and a more flexible approach. Apparently this implementation for Control required a lot of hand tuning and was found to not work well with other types of games, whereas DLSS 2.0 back on the tensor cores is more generalized and more easily applicable to a wide range of games without per-game training.\nNot needing per-game training for DLSS 2.0 is huge...\nNot needing per-game training for DLSS 2.0 is huge. This allows the new model to take all of the knowledge and data it's learned across a wide variety of games and apply it all at once, rather than relying on specific set of training data from a single game. This has provided better image quality, but it also gives Nvidia another advantage: generalized DLSS updates.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the first version of DLSS required individual updates to DLSS on a per-game basis to improve quality - and this rarely happened - DLSS 2.0 should improve over time as Nvidia trains the AI model as a whole. Nvidia told us that starting with this new version, they'll be able to update DLSS via Game Ready drivers without the need for game patches. We'll see whether that materializes, but it's an improvement over what was previously possible.\nAnother benefit from not needing per-game training is that it makes DLSS faster and easier to integrate. This should mean more DLSS games, but we'll wait and see to see if that materializes first.\nWolfenstein: Youngblood + DLSS\nTime to take an in-depth look at DLSS 2.0 in Wolfenstein: Youngblood. Compared to previous DLSS implementations, now there are three quality options to choose from: Quality, Balanced and Performance. All continue to upscale the game from a lower target resolution, so the 'Quality' mode isn't a substitute for the still absent DLSS 2X mode that was announced at launch.\n\nThe big question is whether DLSS 2.0 is any good, and we're pleased to say that it is.\nIn fact, DLSS 2.0 is extremely impressive, far exceeding our expectations for this sort of upscaling technology. When targeting a native 4K resolution, DLSS 2.0 delivers image quality equivalent to the native presentation. Despite DLSS rendering at an actual resolution below 4K, the final results are as good as or in some circumstances better than the native 4K image.\nWe're hesitant to say that the image quality DLSS provides is better than native, because Youngblood's existing anti-aliasing techniques like SMAA T1x and TSSAA T8X aren't great, and produce a bit of blur across what should be a very sharp native 4K image. When comparing DLSS directly to, say, TSSAA T8X, the DLSS image is sharper, and we should note here the results we're showing now are with the game's built in sharpening setting turned off.\n\nHowever, when putting DLSS up against SMAA without a temporal component, so just regular SMAA, the level of clarity and sharpness DLSS provides is quite similar to the SMAA image. Again, there are advantages here - SMAA does have a fair few remaining jagged edges and some shimmering, which is generally cleaned up with DLSS - but when comparing detail levels we'd say both native 4K and DLSS are similar. We suspect with a really good post-process anti-aliasing like we've seen in some other games (e.g. Shadow of the Tomb Raider), we'd see DLSS and native 4K looking almost identical.\nAnd while it may not be always superior to native 4K, being at worst equivalent to 4K, is a huge step forward for DLSS. As we talked about extensively in previous features, older DLSS implementations were only good enough to produce an 1800p-like image, often with weird artifacts like thin wires and tree branches getting 'thickened', along with a general oil painting effect that we didn't like. None of those issues are present here, this just straight up looks like a native image.\n\n\nWe should stress that native 4K and DLSS 4K don't look identical. This isn't a black box algorithm that can magically pull true native 4K out of the hat. 4K DLSS does look slightly different to native 4K, some areas may have a small increase to detail, others may have a small decrease. But it's no longer a situation where the DLSS image is noticeably worse, the two images are to our eyes equivalent, with neither being clearly better than the other in all situations.\n\n\nThere are some areas where you may notice DLSS actually improves the image quality, such as with some fine patterned areas and other elements with thin lines. This is because Nvidia trains the AI using super sampled images with the clearest possible forms of these details. On the other hand, there are still some areas where the algorithm struggles, one being with how DLSS handles the fire elements towards the end of the game's built-in benchmark tool. But these are minor issues and a far cry from the problems with DLSS 1.0.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there are three quality modes on this latest revision of DLSS, and at 4K the differences are very subtle between them. Quality is slightly sharper than Balanced, which is slightly sharper than Performance. We think Balanced is a great place to be with the 4K image, and realistically all are a negligible amount away from the native image.\n\n\n\nThe other really impressive aspect to DLSS 2.0 is that it's also fully functional at lower resolutions.\nTake 1440p for example. The Quality DLSS mode, like at 4K, provides essentially a native 1440p image while rendering at a lower resolution. Everything we've just been talking about with 4K also applies here, which is unlike any previous version of DLSS, where quality quickly fell away at lower resolutions. Even with Control's shader implementation this was a significant issue, but it's not with DLSS 2.0.\n\n\n\n\nAt 1440p the limitations of the lower quality DLSS modes does become a bit more apparent. While the Performance mode is fine at 4K, we think the quality does suffer more here and we wouldn't recommend it over either Balanced or Quality which are both fine. Quality is the mode we would opt to use at 1440p given it delivers the closest presentation to native.\n\nDLSS 2.0 is also effective at 1080p in the same way it is at 1440p and 4K, with DLSS providing essentially native image quality, especially when using the Quality Mode. Similar to 1440p, we don't think the performance mode is particularly effective, so we'd stick to using Balanced or Quality, the latter of which is the most impressive and delivers image quality equivalent to native.\nDLSS 2.0 performance\nLet's take a look at performance once more using our Core i9-9900K test rig, uber settings, ray tracing disabled (because it doesn't make much sense in a fast paced game like this) and TSSAA T8X anti-aliasing when DLSS is disabled.\n\nHere we're looking at the average performance gain we saw when playing with a 4K target resolution across the six RTX GPUs that support 4K gaming, from the RTX 2060 Super to the RTX 2080 Ti. Using the Quality mode, on average we saw a 24% improvement to average FPS over native 4K, and a 27% improvement in 1% lows, with equivalent to native 4K image quality. Using Balanced, the numbers increased to around a 35% improvement, and then with the Performance mode, a 47% improvement. All of these modes we'd say deliver image quality essentially identical to native 4K, if not better.\nDLSS Modes vs. RTX GPU @ 4K\n\nThe reason why we're using an average across the six GPUs is performance is very consistent regardless of what RTX GPU you have. This chart shows the actual results from all six GPUs, and you'll see the lines match up. There is a slight tendency for lower performance GPUs to gain more out of using DLSS, we saw up to a 25% gain for the RTX 2060 Super compared to 22% for the RTX 2080 Ti using the quality mode, but it's for the most part equivalent.\n\nWhat about at 1440p? Clearly we aren't getting as good performance gains here. The Quality mode provided a 16% gain on average, and the Balanced mode a 23% gain. The Performance mode did deliver a 30% gain, below what Balanced achieves at 4K, however we don't feel the Performance mode delivers image quality equivalent to native, so we're not getting a pure 30% performance gain as image quality does decrease somewhat.\nDLSS Modes vs. RTX GPU @ 1440p\n\n\nThere is a slight tendency for lower performance GPUs to gain more from DLSS at 1440p. We saw up to a 26% gain using the Balanced mode with an RTX 2060, compared to just 17% with the RTX 2080 Ti.\n\nAt 1080p, gains drop further again, now just 10% on average across 7 GPUs using the Quality mode, with the same tendency for lower power GPUs to see higher gains. We believe something that could be going on is that frame rates become so high that DLSS struggles to scale well.\nDLSS Modes vs. RTX GPU @ 1080p\n\nFor example, the RTX 2060 at native 1080p hit 150 FPS, and saw around a 15% improvement to that performance when using the DLSS Quality mode. This is similar to what we saw with the RTX 2080 at native 1440p: again around 150 FPS, and again around a 15% improvement using the Quality mode. So this does make me think that the lower your baseline performance is, the more you can benefit from DLSS, but we'll have to test more games in the future to confirm that finding.\n\nOn the other hand, we saw larger gains when ray tracing was enabled. We didn't do extensive testing with this feature, but with the RTX 2060 we saw up to a 2X improvement at 4K using the Performance mode.\n\nRegardless of the configuration though, we were able to achieve performance gains, with DLSS effectively giving you a free performance boost at the same level of image quality. That's very impressive and will be especially useful either in situations where you want to gain at high resolutions, or when you want to really crank up the visual effects, like using ray tracing.\nDLSS ecosystem, closing thoughts\nThere are lots of genuine positives to take away from how DLSS performs in its latest iteration. After analyzing DLSS in Youngblood, there's no doubt that the technology works. The first version of DLSS was unimpressive, but it's almost the opposite with DLSS 2.0: the upscaling power of this new AI-driven algorithm is remarkable and gives Nvidia a real weapon for improving performance with virtually no impact to visuals.\nDLSS now works with all RTX GPUs, at all resolutions and quality settings, and delivers effectively native image quality when upscaling, while actually rendering at a lower resolution. It's mind blowing. It's also exactly what Nvidia promised at launch. We're just glad we're finally getting to see that now.\n\nProvided we get the same excellent image quality in future DLSS titles, the situation could be that Nvidia is able to provide an additional 30 to 40 percent extra performance when leveraging those tensor cores. We'd have no problem recommending gamers to use DLSS 2.0 in all enabled titles because with this version it's basically a free performance button.\nThe visual quality is impressive enough that we'd have to start benchmarking games with DLSS enabled \u2013 provided the image quality we're seeing today holds up in other DLSS games \u2013 similar to how we have benchmarked some games with different DirectX modes based on which API performs better on AMD or Nvidia GPUs It's also apparent from the Youngblood results that the AI network tensor core version is superior to the shader core version in Control. In a perfect world, we would get the shader version enabled for non-RTX GeForce GPUs, but Nvidia told us that's not in their plans and the shader version hasn't worked well in other games.\nClearly, a year and a half after DLSS launched, even Nvidia would admit this hasn't gone to plan. This is almost an identical situation to Nvidia's RTX ray tracing. The feature has been heavily advertised as a 'must have' for PC gamers, but the first few games to support the tech didn't impress, and it's taken nearly a year to get half-decent game implementations that as of today can be counted on one hand.\nDLSS overpromised at launch over a year ago...\n\n\nJust like with ray tracing, it's nice to eventually get DLSS support in games, but doing so weeks or months after the games' launch is almost worthless. We can't imagine too many people going back to play Youngblood months after release specifically for DLSS, even less so having received mediocre reviews.\nWe have no doubt that DLSS will become a fantastic inclusion in games beyond today, but we've got to say that looking back Nvidia went too far on promising what they were unable to deliver. It was common to see promotion slides like the above, showing off the magical free performance DLSS would provide.\nThe huge slate of DLSS games is almost laughable in 2020 with most of these never getting DLSS. Those are some major releases that Nvidia advertised would support DLSS but never came to fruition. We asked them about this and their response was that initial DLSS implementations were \"more difficult than we expected, and the quality was not where we wanted it to be\" so they decided to focus on improving DLSS instead of adding it to more games.\n\nNvidia also told us that older titles supporting DLSS will require game-side updates to get 2.0 level benefits due to the new SDK and that's in the hands of developers, but we doubt those will get support. Battlefield V and Metro Exodus appear to have the same DLSS implementations as when we first tested these titles, flaws and all.\nSome readers criticized our original features, claiming that we didn't understand DLSS because the magic of AI would see these titles improve with more deep learning and training. Well, a year later and it hasn't improved in these games at all.\nOn the positive side, Nvidia claims DLSS is much easier to integrate now and getting DLSS in games on launch day with quality equivalent to Youngblood's implementtion should be very achievable.\n\nDLSS is at a tipping point. The recently released DLSS 2.0 is clearly an excellent technology and a superb revision that fixes many of its initial issues. It will be a genuine selling point for RTX GPUs moving forward, especially if they can get DLSS in a significant number of games. By the time Nvidia's next generation of GPUs comes around, DLSS should be ready for prime time and AMD might need to respond in a big way.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nGeForce RTX 2070 Super on Amazon\n\nGeForce RTX 2080 Super on Amazon\n\nGeForce RTX 2060 Super on Amazon\n\nGeForce RTX 2080 Ti on Amazon\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 3900X on Amazon\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 3600 on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 79\n\n\n Got something to say?

The founders edition costs $4.99 per month, and offers priority access to servers, play sessions up to six hours long, and access to games with ray tracing supported. Free users may have to wait in queues to access servers and will be capped at sessions one hour long, though there's no limit to how many times a user can queue in any period. Both plans support streaming at 1080p and 60fps. As it's a streaming service, all games are intended to function at these levels regardless of the power of the user's device.\nRather than offering its own library, GeForce Now allows users to add games from their existing libraries across multiple storefronts including Steam. At launch, it supports over 30 free-to-play games as well as 1,000 more titles available through single-session installs on Steam.\nGeForce Now use requires a 15 Mbps internet connection, and recommends 25 Mbps, and functions on Windows PCs, Mac, TVs with Nvidia Shield, and Android phones.\nNvidia's answer to cloud gaming comes at a time when Google's offering of late last year, Stadia, is experiencing a bout of low confidence due to its high price-point, few games, and (seemingly) fewer updates. It does still stand to be challenged by other services on the horizon, particularly Microsoft's coming xCloud service paired with Game Pass.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            Sumo Group sells publishing business Secret Mode for undisclosed sum\n          \n\n\n\n            India's first dedicated PC and console game publishing house closes pre-seed founding round\n          \n\n\n\n            Aptoide fully launches to iOS consumers across EU\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRebekah Valentine: Rebekah arrived at GamesIndustry in 2018 after four years of freelance writing and editing across multiple gaming and tech sites.

Some feel it is the service Google Stadia could and should have been. They're somewhat different animals, but interestingly enough, it appears publishers are having a tough time figuring out where they stand in the cloud gaming movement.\n\n\nThat's putting it nicely. While we don't know for sure, it seems like publishers are trying to figure out how best to grab their piece of the cloud gaming pie. GeForce NOW is a interesting concept because it's not anything like Netflix. That's to say, it's not serving up a bunch of games for a monthly subscription rate. Instead, you still have to purchase games you want to play, so dollars stay squarely with publishers.\n\n\nSo, what's the point? GeForce NOW allows you to stream games to most devices. Leveraging hardware in the cloud, GeForce NOW can be played on low powered systems, including ones with relatively weak integrated graphics. The biggest thing is your Internet connection, and you're off and running.\n\n\nNVIDIA's vision is that gamers can purchase titles wherever they see fit\u2014Steam, Epic Games Store, and so forth\u2014and stream them through GeForce NOW to any compatible device. Unfortunately, there is uncertainty over how the catalog of supported games will look, once publishers flex their muscles. Or that's how it seems to us, anyway.\n\n\nYou may recall that Activision-Blizzard already yanked its titles from GeForce NOW after it launched to the public. It came as a surprise to gamers, and if NVIDIA is to believed, it was just as shocked as us. NVIDIA chalked it up to a \"misunderstanding.\"\n\n\n\r\n\"Activision-Blizzard has been a fantastic partner during the GeForce NOW beta, which we took to include the free trial period for our founders membership,\" Nvidia said in a statement. \"Recognizing the misunderstanding, we removed their games from our service, with hope we can work with them to re-enable these, and more, in the future...\" noted NVIDIA.\n\n\nIt seems like a stretch that NVIDIA is telling the whole story\u2014surely it must have known ahead of time that this could or would be an issue with some publishers. In that sense, NVIDIA is culpable to an extent. However, let's not pile the blame entirely on NVIDIA.\n\n\n\n\n\r\nFrom the outside looking in, it sure seems like publishers are playing hardball. According to Bloomberg, which reported the above statement, Activision wanted a commercial agreement with NVIDIA before making its titles available to the public. NVIDIA has been trying to avoid commercial agreements, but it may not be able to. If that is the case, then it seems like publishers are trying to double dip, in a sense\u2014they receive revenue from their game being purchased, and also want a cut from NVIDIA to host them for streaming.\n\n\n\nIn a blog post that went live today, NVIDIA simultaneously celebrated surpassing 1 million GeForce NOW gamers during the free trial period, but also warned that more games could disappear from the service.\n\n\n\r\n\"This trial is an important transitional period where gamers, developers and publishers can try the premium experience with minimal commitment while we continue to refine our offering.\r\nAs we approach a paid service, some publishers may choose to remove games before the trial period ends. Ultimately, they maintain control over their content and decide whether the game you purchase includes streaming on GeForce NOW. Meanwhile, others will bring games back as they continue to realize GeForce NOW\u2019s value (stay tuned for more on that),\" NVIDIA said.\n\n\nNVIDIA added that \"game removals should be few and far between\" as the transition period wraps up, and that new games will be added to GeForce NOW each week. So hopefully we are not looking at a substantial loss of game content.\n\n\nIt's hard to believe that NVIDIA didn't see this coming, but maybe it really didn't. Either way, the end result is that GeForce NOW could look a little different when the free trial ends, than it does right now. That's a bummer for gamers.\n\n\nFortunately, NVIDIA has been around a long time, and it has deep relationships with various publishers and game devs. Hopefully this is something NVIDIA and partnering publishers can get sorted out. NVIDIA built a great service for gamers, and if publishers get too greedy, it could ruin the fun. It probably won't get to that point, though. After all, NVIDIA was able to get CD Projekt RED to make Cyberpunk 2077 available on GeForce NOW the day it gets released. In addition, NVIDIA says it has 1,500 additional games queued up.\n\nUpdate 2/21: It looks like Bethesda will be pulling most of its titles from GeForce NOW as well. A post on the NVIDIA website says, \"Please be advised most Bethesda Softworks titles will be removed from the GeForce NOW service today. Wolfenstein Youngblood will remain for all members. Founders members can continue to experience the game with RTX On.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, Gaming, (nasdaq:nvda), geforce now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES IN IT/ENTERPRISE\n\nNUVIA Secures $240M In Funding To Battle...\nQualcomm Cloud AI 100 Accelerators...\nDell Latitude 7410 Chromebook Enterprise...\nNVIDIA Pursues Arm For A Disruptive...\nLenovo ThinkStation P620 Launches With...\nGoogle And Parallels Partner To Bring...\nNVIDIA's 7nm Ampere A100 Beast Machine...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEEP INFORMED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSITE\n\nHome\n\n\nReviews\n\n\nNews\n\n\nBlogs\n\nFull Site\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nPC Components\n\n\nSystems\n\n\nMobile\n\n\nIT Infrastructure\n\n\nLeisure\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nCOMPANY\n\nAbout\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nNews Tips\n\n\nContact\n\n\nPrivacy And Terms\n\n\nHotTech\n\n\n\nMORE\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nShop\n\n\n\nSTAY CONNECTED\n\nTwitter\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            As an Amazon and Howl Technologies Associate, HotHardware earns a commission from qualifying purchases made on this site.

[+] get one is to win it in a sweepstakes.Credit: Nvidia\nNvidia and CD Projekt RED are running a contest with a pretty sweet prize: A very limited edition Nvidia GeForce 2080 Ti Cyberpunk 2077 special edition graphics card that isn\u2019t even going up for sale (until winners hawk it on eBay, that is).\n\n\nIt\u2019s a sweet looking card, canary yellow with the Cyberpunk 2077 logo on it. A 2080 Ti is a beast, as well, so you\u2019ll be able to run just about anything out there flawlessly assuming you have a good enough system that doesn\u2019t bottleneck your GPU.\n\n\nIn a blog post Nvidia jokingly renames this the RTX 2077 Ti.\n\nOnly 200 of these babies were produced so this is going to be an ultra-rare graphics card. Fans of the upcoming game from The Witcher 3 developer can win one by hopping on Twitter and following the steps in this tweet:\n\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\n\nWant one? Here's how:\n1. RT this video.\n\n\n2. Tag a gamer who is as excited as you about Cyberpunk 2077 in the replies with #RTXOn\n3. If selected, you BOTH win these limited edition GPUs!\nYou can also enter the contest on Nvidia\u2019s\u00a0Instagram\u00a0or\u00a0Facebook pages so you\u2019re not locked to Twitter here.\nThe full terms and conditions for the contest can be found here.\nNo review units are being sent out for this card either so this is truly a very limited, very exclusive prize. I want one. I want to play Cyberpunk 2077 using this card in my gaming rig. But I never win anything and I probably can\u2019t enter anyways since I\u2019m writing about it. I will happily accept your winnings, however.\nHere\u2019s one more look at the GPU:Cyberpunk 2077 RTX 2080 TiCredit: Nvidia\nBest of luck out there, young cyberpunks.

More info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2019 NVIDIA SHIELD TV units are receiving an update to software version 8.1.1 today. We were initially confused about the update, because it looked identical to the 8.0.2 update from last month that brought support for the new SHIELD Remote to older SHIELD TV models, and there\u2019s a reason for that.\nNVIDIA tells us that this 8.1.1 update is catching up the 2019 TVs to the 2017 and 2015 year models that picked up 8.0.2. So, there could be upgraded Plex apps, new games, and support for the XBOX Elite 2 controller, but we\u2019re mostly just making sure that all units are on the same level of software.\nAlso, going forward, we should see all SHIELD TV units have similar build numbers, which should ease some of the confusion.\nEither way, SHIELD TV units from 2019 (our review), be on the lookout for the 8.1.1 update.\n// NVIDIA\n\n\nShare FacebookTwitterReddit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\n\nNews\n\n\n\nTags\n\nNVIDIA\nSHIELD TV\nSHIELD TV Pro\nUpdate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Post\nThoughts on Dual Screen Phone Setups?\n\n\nNext Post\nMicrosoft has an Interesting \"Peek\" Idea for the Surface Duo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollapse\nShow\nComments\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nBe nice to each other.\r\n\r\n\nPrivacy Manager\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\nContact\nAdvertise\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n Sign-up for the Droid Life Newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        2025 \u00a9 Droid Life\r\n      \n\r\n        Website | Murmur Creative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n"

If completely unverified leaks aren't your piece of cake - it would be best to stop reading now. For the rest of us, however, here is an article full of rumors galore - most of which come courtesy of KittyCorgi over at twitter. The reason why this is tagged a rumor is because this particular account has no history of leaks and has only posted a couple of tweets so far - all of which haven't had the chance to be verified. While all this could turn out to be utter tosh, we did think this was worth covering for the connoisseurs among us. At this point, it might be best to treat this article as an exercise in wish-fulfillment rather than an actual leak.\nNVIDIA Ampere GPU 'GA100' flagship will have massive 826mm\u00b2 die\nNVIDIA's upcoming Ampere GPUs have been the subject of their fair share of hype and anticipation. If this particular rumor is to be believed, however, NVIDIA's flagship GPU will have a massive 826mm\u00b2 die. While the process node was not mentioned, a die this large does slightly increase the probability of it being an older, more mature node like the 12NFF. Depending on how mature TSMC 7nm is, an 826mm\u00b2 large die isn't totally out of the question for limited quantity runs as well. Previous leaks have pointed out that the company is going to shift to 7nm with Ampere so I would assume that this entire architecture is based on 7nm for the duration of the article.\nAn 826mm\u00b2 die on 7nm would be absolutely enormous and insanely dense. This wouldn't be entirely uncharacteristic of NVIDIA considering the company has pushed the power and thermal envelopes before with their high-end parts (that usually end up in workstations and rarely the TITAN series). A GPU of this magnitude would easily decimate anything AMD has planned for the remainder of 2020 considering we haven't heard of anything that could match this.\nNVIDIA Ampere GPUs will have 2x faster RTX and a re-engineered Tensor core\nHere is where things get interesting, however, the rumor includes a block diagram (made by KittyCorgi I assume) which indicates improvements in the architecture and NVIDIA doubling down on their RTX strategy. The last part isn't particularly surprising as the RTX portion on Turing was relatively tiny and limited the scale of application for RTX games.\n\nHere is the list of improvements suggested by the rumor:\n\nINT32 Unit remains unchanged. \nDouble the FP32 Unit for shader proportion. \nThe performance of the new Tensor Core is doubled. \nEnhanced L1 Data Cache for more comprehensive functions. \nTrue architecture for RTX GAMING with all-new design RT CORE ADVANCED.\n\n\nThe last bit is something that sounds straight out of NVIDIA marketing material and is something that makes me think that this just might turn out to be true. RT Core Advanced is also a very plausible naming scheme coming from what appears to be a non-native English speaker. Consider me intrigued at the very least although I would still advise copious amounts of salt to go with this.\nNVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti 'GA103' GPU will have 60 SMs and 320-bit 10GB/20GB Graphics Memory\n\nThe rumor doesn't end there, the tweeter has also made block diagrams of the GA103 and GA104 GPUs - which would be the graphics processors that the mainstream client will actually get after launch. These are the parts that a gamer will be able to buy without going completely bankrupt. For the higher end GA103 part, which will end up being the RTX 3080 Ti or whatever NV decides to call it, you are looking at 60 SMs for a total of 3840 CUDA cores assuming the old proportion or 7680 CUDA cores assuming a new 128 cores per SM ratio (thanks for the flag, Boro and PCMasterRace!) For reference, the RTX 2080 Ti has 72 SMs with 4608 CUDA Cores.\nCoupled with the doubled RTX core performance (and the resulting increase in DLSS throughput) you are easily looking at real-world performance increase in the range of 50% over Turing. If NVIDIA shifts to a 7nm process, they would be able to manage all this while staying well within acceptable power thresholds. The GA103 Ampere GPU will be coupled with 10GB/20GB vRAM.\nNVIDIA RTX 3080 'GA104' GPU will have 48 SMs and 256-bit 8GB/16GB Graphics Memory\n\nUp next, you have the GA104 GPU which should end up in the RTX 2080 replacement (the RTX 3080?) with 48 SMs (3072 CUDA cores based on old proportion, 6144 new). This is very slightly more than the RTX 2080 at 46 SMs. Coupled with higher performance throughput and the doubled RTX cores you are once again looking at significant performance increases if this turns out to be true. According to the rumor, the RTX 3080 GPU will be coupled with 8GB/16GB of vRAM and a 256-bit bus width.\nWhile I don't know if this rumor has any truth to it (as a gamer, I wish it does), it does make for a very interesting read with a cup of tea. One thing is for sure, the hype for NVIDIA's Ampere GPU is at an all-time high and everything points to the company getting ready to launch those at GTC 2020 this year with Jensen personally inviting the press to attend.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of this rumor?\n\n\n Utter tosh!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Looks plausible, a lot of this could be true.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Meh, who cares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n This is legit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\n\n\n95\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\n\n\n35\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nM3 Ultra Runs DeepSeek R1 With 671 Billion Parameters Using 448GB Of Unified Memory, Delivering High Bandwidth Performance At Under 200W Power Consumption, With No Need For A Multi-GPU Setup\n\n\n\n33\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n30\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s RTX 50 Series Shortage Extends To System Integrators As Well, Claiming That They Are Forced To Buy At Scalper Prices\n\n\n\n27\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\n12V-2\u00d76 Power Connector Cooks At Over 150\u00b0C With A \u201cWater-Cooled\u201d NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090\n\n\n\n1360\nComments\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Releases Another Hotfix Driver to Resolve Black Screen Issues, Marking the Firm\u2019s Fifth Attempt to Address The Problem\n\n\n\n1300\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The new Corsair One Pro i200 machine packs a 14-core Intel Core X-series processor as well as NVIDIA\u2019s top-of-the-range GeForce RTX 2080 Ti graphics card. Interestingly, Corsair\u2019s new flagship desktop PC costs $500 less than the company\u2019s previous HEDT machine at launch.\nThe Corsair One Pro i200 high-end desktop comes in the same 12-liter grey chassis with two RGB stripes as the Corsair One Pro i180. The new system continues to use ASRock\u2019s X299E-ITX/ac\u00a0motherboard, which now houses the 14-core Core i9-10940X processor (Cascade Lake) as well as the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. The CPU and the GPU are cooled down using individual closed-loop liquid cooling systems, dissipating a total of ~400 W of thermal power.\nBeing based on standard PC parts, the system is fully upgradeable, including the CPU, GPU, and other parts. That said, the i200 lives up to the 'compact' name, so maneuvering room as well as overall TDPs need to be taken into consideration before any significant alterations.\n\nDesigned for the performance-hungry users, the Corsair One Pro i200 comes with 64 GB of DDR4-2666 memory, and a 2 TB M.2/NVMe SSD (the manufacturer no longer uses a 2.5-inch SATA HDD). Connectivity wise, the system is equipped Intel\u2019s Wireless-AC 8265 802.11ac + Bluetooth 4.2 controller, two GbE ports (driven by Intel\u2019s I219-V and I211-AT), six USB 3.0 Type-A connectors, one USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C port, a TRRS audio jack, and four display outputs (three DisplayPort 1.4 and one HDMI 2.0b).\n\n\n\nSpecifications of the Corsair One Pro i200 HEDT PC\n\n\nModel\nCorsair One\r\n\t\t\tPro i200\n\n\nProduct ID\nCS-9040004\n\n\nCPU\nCore i9-10940X\r\n\t\t\t14C/28T\r\n\t\t\t3.30 GHz Base\r\n\t\t\t4.60 GHz Turbo\r\n\t\t\t165 W\n\n\nGPU\nGeForce RTX 2080 Ti\r\n\t\t\t1350-1545 MHz\r\n\t\t\t11 GB GDDR6\r\n\t\t\t14 Gbps\r\n\t\t\t250 W\n\n\nCooling\nCustom closed-loop air+liquid cooling systems\n\n\nDRAM\n64 GB DDR4-2667\n\n\nMotherboard\nmini-ITX, X299 chipset\n\n\nStorage\nSSD\n2 TB NVMe\n\n\nHDD\n-\n\n\nI/O\nIntel\u2019s Wireless-AC 8265 802.11ac + Bluetooth 4.2 adapter\r\n\t\t\t2 \u00d7 GbE ports (driven by Intel\u2019s I219-V and I211-AT)\r\n\t\t\t6 \u00d7 USB 3.0 Type-A connectors\r\n\t\t\t1 \u00d7 USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C port\r\n\t\t\t1\u00a0\u00d7 TRRS audio jack\r\n\t\t\t1\u00a0\u00d7 DisplayPort 1.4\r\n\t\t\t3\u00a0\u00d7 HDMI 2.0b\n\n\nPSU\n750W SFX\n\n\nWarranty\n2 years\n\n\nMSRP\n$4,499\n\n\n\nThe Corsair One Pro i200 with Intel\u2019s 14-core Core i9-10940X CPU and NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU is available immediately for $4,499.

For a home gamer or user who has time to do their IT work, the savings of building and maintaining your own are worth it.  For a business it's more about deploying something that works out of the box and has as little downtime as possible.\n\n\n\nEliteRetard - Friday, February 28, 2020 - link\nMy bad, somehow missed the SSD, I'll add ~$350 (varies from $200-450)That reduces the case/cooling/construction to $1200 or so.Unless I missed something else.\n\n\n\nstephenbrooks - Friday, February 28, 2020 - link\nThis markup is nothing compared to what they do with laptops.At least this thing has some VERY capable hardware inside, this is like a dream workstation (would prefer AMD but wouldn't say no to this).\n\n\n\nnandnandnand - Friday, February 28, 2020 - link\nCore i9-10940X for compact HEDT?

The futuristic RPG is sure to be a demanding title if the gameplay we've seen so far is anything to go by, and Nvidia now wants to make sure you have the right hardware for the job. \nUpdate 2/17/2020: Nvidia has officially revealed its Cyberpunk 2077-themed graphics card, and our readers probably won't be surprised to learn that it's essentially an RTX 2080 Ti with cool-looking Cyberpunk branding. The card does not appear to be available for purchase; the only way to obtain one is to participate in an ongoing social media contest.\n\nTo have a chance at snagging one, you need to retweet Nvidia's official reveal video (see that below) and, separately, tag a fellow Cyberpunk 2077 enthusiast in the announcement tweet's replies \u2013 just be sure to include the #RTXOn hashtag in your comment. If you are selected to win, both you and the person you tagged will get one of these special-edition cards.\n\nIntroducing the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Cyberpunk 2077 Edition.\n\nWe made 77 for our community.\n\nWant one? Here's how:\n1. RT this video.\n2. Tag a gamer who is as excited as you about Cyberpunk 2077 in the replies with #RTXOn\n3. If selected, you BOTH win these limited edition GPUs! pic.twitter.com/IG2BZZCZ6H\n--- NVIDIA GeForce (@NVIDIAGeForce) February 17, 2020\n\nAlternatively, you can head over to the GeForce Instagram or Facebook pages and like, retweet, or comment on any #RTXOn sweepstakes post. Like with the Twitter contest, you need to tag a fellow gamer and include #RTXOn in your reply.\nThere are 77 cards available for this sweepstakes (200 in total \u2013 the rest will be given away later), but nearly 30,000 contest entries (based on retweets), so your chances of winning aren't particularly high. Still, it only takes a few minutes to throw your hat in the ring, so why not give it a shot? \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\n Early DLSS 4 test showcases cleaner images and multiplied framerates \n\n\n\nThe original article follows below...\nIn a brief (and undoubtedly staged) Twitter exchange that took place today, the accounts for both Nvidia and Cyberpunk 2077 jointly teased a mysterious new Cyberpunk 2077-themed limited-edition GPU. The tease came in the form of a cryptic message saying \"Stay tuned...\" and a blurry image of an upright video card.\n\nThe GPU appears to have two fans, and its overall design is very similar to what you'd see from a GeForce RTX 20-series reference card. It has the same fan placement, and the same angular look on the sides (albeit with yellow trim). Unfortunately, any further details are nearly impossible to discern from this image. If you're particularly eagle-eyed and spotted something we didn't, feel free to let us know in the comments.\nDepending on when this card gets an official reveal, it could be one of the first entries in Nvidia's upcoming Ampere GPU line-up, or simply a fancy RTX 20-series card. We wouldn't feel comfortable betting on either option, as both seem equally likely at this point. We hope it's the former, so more gamers have an excuse to upgrade (Ampere will hopefully bring a sizable performance jump), but we'll have to wait and see for sure.\n\n?\n\nStay tuned... pic.twitter.com/wahUtfw3f6\n--- NVIDIA GeForce (@NVIDIAGeForce) February 16, 2020\n\nIf you're eager to get your hands on anything Cyberpunk 2077-related, it might be best to temper your expectations here. Unknown technical specifications aside, the limited edition card is certain to be pricey \u2013 perhaps even more so than the already-expensive 20-series GPUs. On top of that, since this will be a limited run, they'll probably sell out to wealthier individuals (or those with some extra space on their credit cards) pretty quickly.\nNonetheless, we'll be sure to update you when Nvidia and/or the folks over at CD Projekt Red reveal more details about this GPU.\nMasthead credit: Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\n 22 comments\n \n534 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 GPUs \"unprecedented\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 specs and official performance benchmarks leaked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

The GeForce GTX 1650 released back in 2019 and its SUPER variant released by the end of 2019. The GTX 1650 SUPER is no doubt a much better card with pricing close to the GTX 1650 itself, making it obsolete but it looks like AIBs are planning to clear away GTX 1650 inventory by offering a memory upgrade.\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Might Be Getting A Silent Update To GDDR6 Memory By AIBs\nAccording to the EEC listing which has been spotted by Videocardz, there's a full list of cards that utilize the custom NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 design. The brand in specific is MSI and there are at least 8 custom variants listed which feature the updated design. Following is the list of all the models that have been listed:\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\nMSI GTX 1650 D6 GAMING X\nMSI GTX 1650 D6 GAMING\nMSI GTX 1650 D6 VENTUS XS OC\nMSI GTX 1650 D6 VENTUS XS\nMSI GTX 1650 D6 AERO ITX OC\nMSI GTX 1650 D6 AERO ITX\nMSI GTX 1650 D6T LP OC\nMSI GTX 1650 D6T LP\n\nNow the first impression would be that this is a second and less interesting SUPER variant for the GTX 1650 but that's not the case here. In fact, these GeForce GTX 1650 graphics cards should carry the same GPU specifications which include an NVIDIA Turing TU117 GPU and up to 4 GB of memory. There's a slight possibility that we might get a core bump as the gap between the GTX 1650 and the SUPER variant is quite significant so while the GTX 1650 features 896 cores, the updated GTX 1650 might end up with 896 or 1024 cores which should be pretty interesting.\n\nThe real update would be the memory and in the case of the updated variant, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 would feature GDDR6 memory which would replace the GDDR5 memory on the existing G5 variants. Just for comparison, the GDDR5 variants feature 8 Gbps pin speeds for a total bandwidth of 128 GB/s while the GTX 1650 SUPER features 12 Gbps pin speeds for a total bandwidth of 192 GB/s. If AIBs are to use the 12 Gbps dies, then that would deliver a nice boost in performance that might help it close the gap with the Radeon RX 5500 XT 4 GB graphics cards.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX/GTX \"Turing\" Family:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 D6NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 SUPERNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti\n\n\n\n\nGPU ArchitectureTuring GPU (TU117)Turing GPU (TU117)Turing GPU (TU116)Turing GPU (TU116)Turing GPU (TU116)Turing GPU (TU116)Turing GPU (TU106)Turing GPU (TU106)Turing GPU (TU104)Turing GPU (TU102)\n\n\nProcess12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN\n\n\nDie Size200mm2200mm2284mm2284mm2284mm2284mm2445mm2445mm2545mm2754mm2\n\n\nTransistors4.7 Billion4.7 Billion6.6 Billion6.6 Billion6.6 Billion6.6 Billion10.6 Billion10.6 Billion13.6 Billion18.6 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores896 Cores896 Cores1280 Cores1408 Cores1408 Cores1536 Cores1920 Cores2304 Cores2944 Cores4352 Cores\n\n\nTMUs/ROPs56/3256/3280/3288/4888/4896/48120/48144/64192/64288/96\n\n\nGigaRaysN/AN/AN/AN/AN/AN/A5 Giga Rays/s6 Giga Rays/s8 Giga Rays/s10 Giga Rays/s\n\n\nCache1.5 MB L2 Cache1.5 MB L2 Cache1.5 MB L2 Cache1.5 MB L2 Cache1.5 MB L2 Cache1.5 MB L2 Cache4 MB L2 Cache4 MB L2 Cache4 MB L2 Cache6 MB L2 Cache\n\n\nBase Clock1485 MHz1410 MHz1530 MHz1530 MHz1530 MHz1500 MHz1365 MHz1410 MHz1515 MHz1350 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock1665 MHz1590 MHz1725 MHz1785 MHz1785 MHz1770 MHz1680 MHz1620 MHz\n1710 MHz OC1710 MHz\n1800 MHz OC1545 MHz\n1635 MHz OC\n\n\nCompute3.0 TFLOPs3.0 TFLOPs4.4 TFLOPs5.0 TFLOPs5.0 TFLOPs5.5 TFLOPs6.5 TFLOPs7.5 TFLOPs10.1 TFLOPs13.4 TFLOPs\n\n\nMemoryUp To 4 GB GDDR5Up To 4 GB GDDR6Up To 4 GB GDDR6Up To 6 GB GDDR5Up To 6 GB GDDR6Up To 6 GB GDDR6Up To 6 GB GDDR6Up To 8 GB GDDR6Up To 8 GB GDDR6Up To 11 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Speed8.00 Gbps12.00 Gbps12.00 Gbps8.00 Gbps14.00 Gbps12.00 Gbps14.00 Gbps14.00 Gbps14.00 Gbps14.00 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Interface128-bit128-bit128-bit192-bit192-bit192-bit192-bit256-bit256-bit352-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth128 GB/s192 GB/s192 GB/s192 GB/s336 GB/s288 GB/s336 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s616 GB/s\n\n\nPower ConnectorsN/AN/A6 Pin8 Pin8 Pin8 Pin8 Pin8 Pin8+8 Pin8+8 Pin\n\n\nTDP75W75W100W120W125W120W160W185W (Founders)\n175W (Reference)225W (Founders)\n215W (Reference)260W (Founders)\n250W (Reference)\n\n\nStarting Price$149 US$149 US$159 US$219 US$229 US$279 US$349 US$499 US$699 US$999 US\n\n\nPrice (Founders Edition)$149 US$149 US$159 US$219 US$229 US$279 US$349 US$599 US$799 US$1,199 US\n\n\nLaunchApril 2019April 2020November 2019March 2019October 2019February 2019January 2019October 2018September 2018September 2018\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, this feels more like NVIDIA's AIBs clearing out their stock of GTX 1650 GPUs rather than a new SKU launch but it would be interesting nevertheless. There's no word on the launch date but the pricing would be kept similar to the GTX 1650 around $149 US.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n112\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n103\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n53\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n42\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n39\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1479\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1156\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Whether those pros\u00a0are\u00a0creeping down a hallway in CS:GO\u2019s Dust II map with a nervous finger\u00a0on the trigger or coordinating complex middle lane maneuvers in a League of Legends matchup, milliseconds can mean the difference between success and failure. And with millions of dollars in esports prize money, endorsement deals and betting revenue up for grabs, the stakes are high.\u00a0\nBut when we talk about reaction intervals in gaming, we\u2019re really talking about two different pieces of a complex system. The first component is human reaction, which plays a key role in a gamer\u2019s success. The second is the latency in a gaming system \u2014\u00a0the time interval between keystroke command and on-screen action.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEsportsearning.com's Top 5 Esports Pros by Prize EarningsJohan \u201cN0tail\u201d Sundstein, Denmark, $6,890,591Jesse \u201cJerAx\u201d Vainikka, Finland, $6,470,000Anathan \u201cana\u201d Pham, Australia, $6,000,411S\u00e9bastien \u201cCeb\u201d Debs, France, $5,489,233Topias Miikka \u201cTopson\u201d Taavitsainen, Finland, $5,414,446\n\n\u00a0\nAs part of an ongoing quest to reduce the latter and give its users a competitive edge, Silicon Valley firm NVIDIA unveiled a new range of super-fast esports monitors at January\u2019s CES in Las Vegas. The company developed the monitors using its G-SYNC processors alongside display manufacturer ASUS and LCD panel designer AU Optronics. The project produced the fastest refresh rate in gaming: 360 hertz.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\nLatency is the Enemy\nNVIDIA first began producing G-SYNC processors in 2013 with the goal of eliminating screen tearing, stutters and other visual interferences that plagued recreational and professional gamers alike. Screen tearing in particular was a major concern for esports competitors. It\u2019s\u00a0caused by a mismatch between a screen\u2019s video feed and refresh rate.\n\u201cWe addressed that problem by matching the display\u2019s refresh rate to the frames-per-second output from the GPU,\u201d said Vijay Sharma, NVIDIA\u2019s director of product management. \u201cYou had this perfect synchronization of refresh rate to FPS, and that eliminated tearing and display-related stutter and minimized input lag.\u201d\nG-SYNC\u2019s main competitor in the fight against screen tearing is AMD\u2019s FreeSync. The main differences in performance boil down to the fact that FreeSync is compatible with any variable refresh rate monitor, while G-SYNC requires manufacturers to install extra hardware modules.\nAccording to Sharma, NVIDIA goes to great lengths to test monitors bearing the G-SYNC logo. Each model, he said, must pass some 300 internal tests and certifications before it can go to market. Those tests measure variables like color, luminance, latency and even the uniformity of pixels across an entire display.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nVia Linus Tech Tips\nWhat difference does it make to play on such a fast monitor? At 360 hertz, the screen updates every 2.77 milliseconds. That\u2019s six times faster than your average 60 hertz screen, which, Sharma said, refreshes at the comparatively lethargic rate of once every 16.7 milliseconds.\n\u201cImagine an object moving from left to right at a constant speed,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cIf you open your eyes once every 16.7 milliseconds (the refresh interval at 60 hertz), you\u2019ll get 60 discrete snapshots of the objects \u2014\u00a0and 60 opportunities to shoot at it.\u201d\nAt 360 hertz, the refresh interval drops to 2.77 milliseconds, giving gamers 360 snapshots of the same image per second \u2014\u00a0and a gameplay experience where actions flow in an uncanny imitation of the real world.\n\u201cWhen I switched between 240 and 360 hertz, I could immediately tell that there was a difference,\u201d said five-time CS:GO champion Jordan \u201cn0thing\u201d Gilbert in a press release at the time of the announcement.\u00a0\nOf course, display only accounts for part of the latency within a gaming system. But at the height of competition, every fraction of a millisecond counts.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if we built a driver for Tiger Woods,\u201d said Sharma, \u201cand by using this new driver, Tiger can hit the ball an extra hundred yards. Now, if I use that same driver, my shots won\u2019t go an extra hundred yards \u2014 but my game will still improve.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\nMonitors as A System\nThe images projected onto a PC monitor are the end result of an intricate system that operates at lightning speed. To achieve a refresh rate of 360 hertz, NVIDIA and its partners needed to optimize every step of that system, from the GPU interpreting keystrokes and clicks to the display itself.\u00a0\n\u201cTo start with, you need a GeForce RTX series to be able to render at high frameworks,\u201d Sharma said, referring to NVIDIA\u2019s own range of high-performance GPUs.\u00a0\nThe next step in the system is the G-SYNC processor, which accepts input over a display port from the GPU and drives the timing controllers in the LCD panel to deliver the picture. NVIDIA uses a variation of a long-standing industry trick known as overdrive to eliminate ghost images trailing behind moving objects and speed up refresh rates. G-SYNC overshoots the target color for each color transition pixel by pixel, shortening the time it takes to transition to the desired color. To perform these tasks at the required speed, Sharma said his team had to design the latest generation of G-SYNC processors from scratch.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEveryone invariably got a higher score on the faster monitor.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou need a processor and a monitor that can operate very quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cAt 360 hertz you have very little time to determine what your overdrive settings would be. And if you\u2019re building a high-speed HDR display, you need to be able to set the backlight very quickly.\u201d\nThe last element in any display system is the LCD panel, which NVIDIA built in partnership with AU Optronics.\u00a0\n\u201cPanels use transistors and silicon, so you can\u2019t always just turn the hertz up,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cSo we had to work with them to design a cell structure that can achieve the speeds we require.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Road to 1,000\nBuilding super-fast monitors takes a tremendous amount of time and energy; Sharma said the project to build technology capable of producing a 360 hertz refresh rate took around 18 months. That\u2019s down from previous monitor projects at the company, which he said have taken\u00a0up to 30 months from start to finish.\u00a0\nHowever, Sharma said faster speeds translate to higher performance for all gamers, pointing to an experiment the company conducted at this year\u2019s CES. In it, attendees performed flick shots at targets in CS:GO on a 60 hertz and 360 hertz monitor.\n\u201cEveryone invariably got a higher score on the faster monitor,\u201d Sharma said.\u00a0\nFor NVIDIA and its partners, that increased performance is good evidence to support their\u00a0continued focus on developing gaming monitor technology in the\u00a0future. ASUS, which will release the first super-fast monitors later this year, reportedly sees such developments as a stepping stone to a much\u00a0loftier goal: a 1,000\u00a0hertz monitor.\n\u00a0\nInside the Cheat CodesMeet the Tech Behind Your Favorite Games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent Gaming Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n                            20 Top Sports Companies to Know\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            38 Gaming Companies You Need to Know\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            How to Empower Your People to Unleash Their Creativity\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Explore Job Matches.\n\n\n\n\n\nJob Title or Keyword\n\nClear search\n\n\n\n\nLocation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJob Type\n\nClear\nApply\n\n\n\nSee Jobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs\n\nCompanies\n\nArticles\nMy Items\nMore\n\n\n                                    Join\n                                \n\n                                    Log In\n                                \nTech Jobs\n\nCompanies\n\nArticles\n\nRemote\nBest Places To Work\nTech Hubs\n\n                        Post Job\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n            Built In is the online community for startups and tech companies.

Log in.\n\n\n\n\nNvidia announced on Tuesday the full release of its GeForce Now game streaming service, which has been in beta for several years.\nGeForce Now will compete against other streaming services like Google Stadia. With that said, GeForce Now is geared towards PC gamers rather than console gamers, as GeForce Now supports PC games stores like Steam, Uplay, Epic, and Battle.net.\nCompared to Stadia, GeForce Now seems to have some major benefits, like a significantly larger games library. GeForce Now also won't require users to buy a game that they already own in one of the supported games stores.\nAlso important, GeForce Now allows cross-play with players who aren't using GeForce, too.\nBut unlike Google Stadia, GeForce Now has one glaring drawback: No 4K streaming.\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n\n\nNvidia announced on Tuesday that its GeForce Now game streaming service is out of beta and is available on full release for everyone.\nThe main gist of GeForce Now is that it lets you play PC games on a wide variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, mobile devices, Nvidia Shield streaming devices, and even Macs and low-power Chromebooks. The games themselves run on computers in Nvidia's cloud, and a game's video is streamed over the internet, much like a Netflix video.\u00a0\n\n\nIt can easily be its own standalone service, or it can complement a PC gaming setup by bringing games to any device wherever there's a good internet connection. All-in-all, GeForce now is geared for those entrenched in PC gaming platform rather than console gaming, but many gamers play on both platforms.\u00a0\nIf this idea sounds familiar, that's because numerous cloud game streaming services are beginning to emerge, like Google Stadia and Microsoft's Project Xcloud, and these nascent services have the potential to make a big impact on the gaming industry and how people play video games.\u00a0\nCheck out all the relevant details you need to know about GeForce Now, and the main ways it's already better than Google's Stadia:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nGeForce Now is available in two tiers at launch, a free version and a paid version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Nvidia\n                                           \n\nGeForce Now will be available with a free membership, and a paid membership called \"Founders\" at\u00a0 launch for $5 per month for 12 months. For both GeForce Now memberships, users need to buy \u2014 or already own \u2014 the games they want to play.\nHere are the details for both memberships:\nThe free version of GeForce Now:\n\nAccess to gameplay may be limited during prime times and periods of heavy network congestion.\nGame sessions are limited to one hour per session, but there's no limit to how many sessions you can play. You'd just need to save your game when one session ends and start a new session \u2014 which basically means an interruption during your gameplay.\u00a0\nTo compare, Stadia doesn't limit access during peak times or how long you can play. It only limits games to 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second.\n\nThe paid $5/month Founders membership:\n\nA free 90-day trial, priority access over free members\nSix-hour uninterrupted gaming sessions\nRTX graphics (more on that later).\nTo compare, Stadia's $10/month paid service, you get 4K resolution gaming (mostly upscaled to from 1080p) and access to games as long as you keep your subscription.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nNvidia's GeForce Now has way more games than Google's Stadia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Nvidia\n                                           \n\nRight off the bat, GeForce Now has a huge benefit over Stadia.\nNvidia's GeForce Now has a significantly larger games library than Google's Stadia. With that said, it's not difficult to achieve this. Microsoft's Project Xcloud game streaming app can also make the same claim.\u00a0\nNvidia touts that it's an open platform, which is to say that you can access a wide variety of games stores, including Steam, Uplay, Epic Games Store, and Battle.net. By default, that means GeForce Now has hundreds more games than Stadia, which is its own ecosystem and has its own game store. Google truly has an uphill battle to fight as it creates an entirely new game store, whereas Nvidia works with established stores that already have millions of users.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIf you already own a game that works with GeForce Now, you don't have to buy it again.\n\nIf you own a game in any of GeForce Now supported game stores like Steam, Uplay, or Epic, you don't have to buy the game again to play it on GeForce Now. This is a key differentiator from Google's Stadia, where you have to buy a game separately to play on Stadia, even if you own it on a different platform.\u00a0\nAnd because Stadia is its own ecosystem, your progression in a game is only saved within Stadia. Your game's progression in Stadia won't transfer to the same game on a different platform.\nStill, GeForce Now doesn't fix the issue of owning both a gaming PC and a console, where you often have to buy games twice if you want to play them on each platform. And each game's progress is also exclusive to each platform.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nGeForce now supports cross-play with PC, Mac, Chromebooks, Android smartphones, and Nvidia shield.\n\nLike Stadia, you'll be able to play games on a wide variety of devices, including PCs, Macs, mobile devices, and the Nvidia Shield media streaming device for TVs.\u00a0\nUnlike Stadia, GeForce Now gamers aren't limited to other gamers who are also playing games on GeForce Now. You could be playing a game on GeForce Now while playing against someone running a game locally on their PC, for example.\u00a0\nOne thing to note, Nvidia hasn't mentioned whether GeForce Now will work with Apple iPhones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nGeForce Now will have Nvidia's fancy \"ray tracing\" graphics effects for games that support it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Nvidia\n                                           \n\nCertain games support a graphics effect called \"ray tracing,\" which is enabled by Nvidia's ray tracing technology in its graphics cards.\u00a0\nRay tracing basically makes for more realistic lighting, shadows, and reflections in games. It's a power-hungry effect that's only usually viable if you're running the most powerful gaming PCs that run on Nvidia's most expensive \"RTX\" graphics cards, which start around $400 and go all the way up to $1,500.\nNvidia is offering ray tracing in games that support it for $5 per month in its Founders service on any device, even Chromebooks that would have no chance whatsoever of running ray traced graphics.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nNvidia says its GeForce Now will feel lag-free, which must be a given for any game streaming service.\n\nSince a video game's video is streamed over the internet in a similar way that a Netflix video is streamed, there's going to be some kind of lag, or latency, compared to the experience of playing a game directly on a device itself. After all, the video stream has to travel however-many miles from the cloud to a device.\nAmong other things, low latency is one of the most important things that game streaming services have to get right. If there's too much lag, the experience will be bad, and gamers will stick to running games directly from devices like consoles and PCs rather than streaming them.\u00a0\nNvidia expects that GeForce Now will have 20-millisecond latency, which is to say that gamers shouldn't feel much of a lag, if any at all.\u00a0\nSome reviewers of Google's Stadia reported poor latency while gaming, while others reported little latency. We haven't tried GeForce Now now that it's out of beta, but I was impressed with my experience during the beta several years ago. We'll have to see for ourselves how GeForce Now performs in the wild.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nNvidia's GeForce isn't perfect, and it does have a glaring gap \u2014 no 4K streaming.\n\nFor one, Nvidia doesn't offer a 4K game streaming option like Stadia does. Although, the quality of Stadia's 4K game streams have been questioned by reviewers, where many say that it doesn't look like true 4K, but rather an upscaled version of a standard 1080p video stream.\u00a0\nStill, whether it's upscaled or not, 4K gaming is quickly becoming more standard, and it's a glaring gap in Nvidia's offering.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech\n\n\nGoogle\n\n\nVideo Games\n \nMore \n\n\n\n\nGaming\n\n\nMicrosoft\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n      subscribers.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I write about disruptive companies, technologies and usage models.Follow AuthorFeb 17, 2020, 05:17pm ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 5 years old.NVIDIANVIDIA\nNVIDIA is an undisputed powerhouse in the PC gaming industry, thanks to its pioneering of the gaming GPU and efforts in accelerated gaming graphics. It\u2019s long been the company to beat in the highest-performance arena, and is one who I follow very, very closely. In 1999, the company launched the first of its GeForce line of consumer-level PC graphics chips, the GeForce 256. Since then, the GeForce line has come a long way\u2014the most GeForce 16 series launched this past year. One thing that has been fascinating to watch is the transformation from GeForce as merely a graphics chip into a full-blown gaming platform, incorporating hardware, software and services. Back in 2017, NVIDIA announced its foray into the game streaming market with GeForce NOW (I wrote on this development at the time, which you can find here and here if interested). This week NVIDIA announced the service is finally out of the Beta phase and generally available. Let\u2019s take a look at what consumers can expect from NVIDIA GeForce NOW.\n\n\nPlay next-gen games on yesterday\u2019s hardware\n\nAny serious PC gamer will attest that it is an expensive hobby. In order to play the latest games, you have to continually be upgrading and souping up your system to meet the titles\u2019 system requirements. Still the PC is the most popular gaming platform worldwide, with over 1.2 billion players. The premise of GeForce NOW is that gamers can now take advantage of NVIDIA\u2019s latest GPU architectures from afar, via the cloud, to play the latest titles on their perhaps less-than-modern device. Sign up for a membership, and wham\u2014your PC, Mac, NVIDIA SHIELD device, or even your Android phone now essentially has a GeForce graphics card (with Chromebook support coming later this year).\n\nOne of my favorite things about GeForce NOW is that it is BYOL\u2014bring your own license\u2014from any game and any store (e.g. Steam). This means gamers can utilize this open platform to play all the titles they already own and continue to build out their libraries from their favorite PC game stores. Additionally, GeForce NOW comes with a library of over 30 free-to-play games (with more to come) already patched to the cloud, and over 1,000 titles that can be accessed through single-session installs. The service utilizes NVIDIA\u2019s Game Ready Drivers to optimize performance, and NVIDIA promises users \u201cthe precision of keyboard and mouse gaming.\u201d Additionally, the company says the service comes optimized for game controllers.\n\n\nAll of this will now be available to the general public, via either a free option or a still very affordable $4.99 monthly (for the first 12 months) \u201cFounders\u201d membership. The free option gives gamers standard access to the service, with a limited 1-hour session length. Those who were already using GeForce NOW in beta are, as of today, automatically enrolled in this free option. The Founders tier, on the other hand, gives gamers priority access, extended session length, and the ability to play cutting edge RTX titles with ray tracing. As if all of this isn\u2019t good enough, the Founders membership comes with a free 90-day introductory period so gamers can try it out to make sure it\u2019s something they can\u2019t live without (my bet is that many of them will decide that it is).\nWrapping up\nAll things considered, I really like NVIDIA\u2019s approach with GeForce NOW. The BYOL strategy is a game changer\u2014no gamer should have to jettison the ability to play their already purchased games for a new service. I like to think of the service as renting a high-performance game PC in the cloud. \u00a0I see the free subscription option as the ultimate try-before-you-buy experience\u2014did I mention that gamers can play as many of these 1-hour sessions as they want? And while this is a great deal, I\u2019m sure many serious gamers will want the ability to play ray tracing titles and not be limited to 1-hour sessions. For those gamers, $4.99 a month is an incredibly cheap price to pay for a high-end PC gaming cloud \u201crental.\u201d Microsoft xCloud won\u2019t have to worry, but Google Stadia needs to watch out\u2014GeForce NOW represents a direct competitor to it. GeForce NOW looks like a serious offering\u2014I\u2019d expect nothing less from the likes of NVIDIA. I\u2019ll be watching eagerly for the reveal of the first subscription numbers to see just how good of a thing the company has on its hands.\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\n\nNote: Moor Insights & Strategy writers and editors may have contributed to this article.\u00a0\n\nDisclosure: Moor Insights & Strategy, like all research and analyst firms, provides or has provided paid research, analysis, advising, or consulting to many high-tech companies in the industry, including Amazon.com, Advanced Micro Devices,\u00a0Apstra,\u202fARM Holdings, Aruba Networks, AWS, A-10 Strategies,\u00a0Bitfusion,\u202fCisco Systems, Dell, Dell\u202fEMC, Dell Technologies, Diablo Technologies, Digital Optics,\u00a0Dreamchain, Echelon, Ericsson, Foxconn, Frame, Fujitsu, Gen Z Consortium, Glue Networks, GlobalFoundries,\u202fGoogle,\u202fHP\u202fInc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Huawei\u202fTechnologies,\u202fIBM, Intel, Interdigital, Jabil Circuit, Konica Minolta, Lattice Semiconductor, Lenovo, Linux Foundation, MACOM (Applied Micro),\u00a0MapBox,\u00a0Mavenir, Mesosphere,\u202fMicrosoft,\u202fNational Instruments, NetApp, NOKIA, Nortek,\u202fNVIDIA, ON Semiconductor, ONUG, OpenStack Foundation, Panasas,\u00a0Peraso, Pixelworks, Plume Design,\u00a0Portworx, Pure Storage,\u202fQualcomm, Rackspace, Rambus,\u00a0Rayvolt\u00a0E-Bikes, Red Hat, Samsung Electronics, Silver Peak, SONY,\u00a0Springpath, Sprint, Stratus Technologies, Symantec, Synaptics, Syniverse,\u00a0TensTorrent,\u00a0Tobii\u00a0Technology, Twitter, Unity Technologies, Verizon Communications,\u202fVidyo, Wave Computing,\u00a0Wellsmith, Xilinx, Zebra, which may be cited in this article\n\n\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Photo: Killian Bell/Cult of Mac\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce Now is ready to stream the latest PC games to your Mac. It sells us a dream that sounds too good to be true, a future that macOS fans gave up wishing for a long time ago. And most importantly, it actually delivers it.\nI\u2019ve been playing games on GeForce Now for several days (I love my job!) so that I can tell you whether it\u2019s worth your hard-earned cash. And although I\u2019ve run into a few teething troubles that I can\u2019t ignore, I\u2019ve been blown away by what it can do.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce Now review\nWhen I first bagged my 2019 MacBook Pro (13-inch) some months ago, curiosity got the better of me and I decided to try playing some Fortnite on it just to see how it would run. Obviously, it was a disaster, so I gave up very quickly. And that mostly sums up how gaming on a Mac has been for a long time. But not anymore.\nGeForce Now uses the magic of streaming to make the latest games playable on machines that would otherwise have no business running run. It uses incredibly powerful hardware that the average gamer can only dream of to do all the processing, then beams it to whatever device you\u2019re using at home.\nOthers have tried a similar approach in the past, but they didn\u2019t stick around long. Now some of the biggest names in the technology industry \u2014\u00a0Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia \u2014\u00a0are taking a stab. At least one of them is getting it right.\nHere\u2019s what we think of GeForce Now so far.\nInstant access to your games\nAfter you\u2019ve installed GeForce Now on your machine, you get instant access to some (but not all) of the games you\u2019ve already purchased through platforms like the Epic Games Store, Steam, Uplay, and others at no extra cost. Simply find the titles you want to play, add them to your library, and you\u2019re good to go.\nThe Now launcher makes it easy to find games and add them to your library.Screenshot: Cult of Mac\nOne of the many advantages of a game streaming service is that there\u2019s no need to wait for installs and updates. After you\u2019ve added a game to your library, hitting the play button launches it immediately. It took me just two clicks to get into Fortnite after finding the game inside the Now launcher. It\u2019s insanely fast.\nGame updates are installed automatically on Nvidia\u2019s end \u2014\u00a0as are system and driver updates \u2014\u00a0so there\u2019s no need to worry about any of that. Cloud saves are supported too, so you can start a game on your PC at home, then continue playing where you left off using Now on your notebook.\nAround 400 titles are supported right now, including some big names like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Destiny 2, and the BioShock collection. You will also find a number of popular free-to-play titles like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Paladins, League of Legends, Apex Legends, and the aforementioned Fortnite are available.\nSome of your favorite games will be missing for now. There is no Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, FIFA, or Fallout. But the launch lineup is still impressive \u2014\u00a0substantially bigger than Google Stadia\u2019s \u2014\u00a0and it\u2019s only going to grow over time. You can also ask Nvidia to add a game you\u2019re itching to play.\nOne interesting thing I discovered is that when playing a game from your Steam library, Now first provides you with access to the Steam interface. But if you attempt to install and play a game that isn\u2019t supported yet \u2014 or is just different from the game you chose in the Now launcher \u2014 you\u2019ll be greeted by an error message that says \u201cyou can\u2019t play this game right now.\u201d\nUnbelievable performance\nAnother big advantage to game streaming is that all the heavy lifting is taken care of on Nvidia\u2019s end. What you see on your screen is essentially a video feed of your game, which is being beamed from a beefy rig somewhere else. Very little work is done by your Mac itself \u2014\u00a0and that\u2019s the big selling point of a service like Now.\nIt means you can enjoy the latest games, with high-quality graphics and super-speedy frame rates, on a machine that would typically struggle to play Minesweeper without any hiccups. Nvidia says Now supports a long list of Macs dating back to 2008, including the MacBook and MacBook Air.\nIt\u2019s been a while since I tried a game streaming service, so it blew my mind when I first loaded up BioShock: Infinite on my 13-inch MacBook Pro. It was bizarre but spectacular to see a demanding game running so well on a computer that struggles to play Fortnite on even the lowest settings when it\u2019s running natively.\nA MacBook Pro wasn\u2019t supposed to play games like this.Screenshot: Cult of Mac\nIt\u2019s also strange that my Mac doesn\u2019t even break a sweat while playing through Now, even after several hours of play. The fans don\u2019t need to kick in because, again, the brunt work isn\u2019t done on the Mac, so it\u2019s not getting hot. And Now doesn\u2019t guzzle battery life like playing a native game built for macOS would.\nThe visuals are outstanding, and as long as your connection allows it, you\u2019ll enjoy 60 frames-per-second (FPS) at all times. The systems behind Now are capable of delivering a lot more than that, of course. In Fortnite, the FPS counter reads at least 240 most of the time on high settings. But 60 FPS is the most Now will deliver.\nHaving said all this, yes, there is a catch.\nSpeedy internet a must\nYou might not need high-end hardware to enjoy GeForce Now, but there is one thing you must have \u2014 a fast and stable internet connection. If yours isn\u2019t up to par, it\u2019s going to make your gaming sessions a frustrating nightmare. That\u2019s the biggest downside to game streaming today.\nNow requires a 15 Mbps connection to deliver 720p video or a 25 Mbps connection to deliver 1080p video at 60 frames-per-second, Nvidia says. But even if yours meets those requirements, you may find that you run into some stuttering and other annoying glitches while you play. It can be a real headache at times.\nI have a 40 Mbps connection to my home and typically have my game resolution set to just 1280 x 800. There are times when my stream quality drops or freezes to the point where the game is completely unplayable for a second or two. It doesn\u2019t happen too frequently, but it\u2019s certainly not a rare occurrence for me, even when using a wired connection to my router.\nNow doesn\u2019t seem to like my connection, even though it\u2019s fast enough.Screenshot: Cult of Mac\nAccording to the network test baked into the Now launcher, I don\u2019t have any ping or packet loss issues, and my speed measures 37 Mbps even over Wi-Fi. I also don\u2019t run into issues when playing online games on other devices. But Now warns that I may experience lag or stutter. It\u2019s hard to tell what causes this, or if it might fade away as Nvidia continues to make improvements.\nIt should be noted that Now makes automatic adjustments to your stream quality in real-time, based on your connection. Even if you specify that you want to see 1080p gameplay, then, there may be times when the resolution is reduced if your bandwidth dips. This helps ensure your stream keeps going, even if it does get a little blurry at times.\nAnother thing you should be aware of is input lag. Whether you\u2019re using a mouse and keyboard or a game controller, it always takes a little bit of time for your game to respond to your actions. This might be just a few milliseconds, but if you\u2019re an experienced gamer, it\u2019s noticeable.\nInput lag is still a problem\nSadly, input lag is unavoidable when you\u2019re streaming a game from a different system via the cloud. It\u2019s never (maybe one day?) going to be as responsive as playing on a local system that\u2019s processing everything itself no more than a few feet away from you. How much input lag you encounter depends on a few different things.\nA faster connection will obviously result in less input lag, while enabling direct mouse input and using wired peripherals (keyboards, mice, and controllers) where possible can help. It\u2019s also a good idea to have your Mac connected to your router via an Ethernet cable (as opposed to using Wi-Fi) if you can. This provides the best possible connection.\nNow won\u2019t let you load Steam games that aren\u2019t supported yet.Screenshot: Cult of Mac\nYou can also try adjusting your stream quality settings. Nvidia sets this to \u201cbalanced\u201d by default, but there are also \u201cdata saver\u201d and \u201ccompetitve\u201d options inside the Now launcher\u2019s settings. The latter \u201coptimizes your streaming settings to deliver the lowest possible latency during gameplay.\u201d\nInput lag may not be as noticeable to you if you\u2019re new to gaming; it\u2019s more obvious to those who regularly play on other systems that don\u2019t have this issue. It\u2019s also less of a problem in single-player games. But if you\u2019re playing a fast-paced online multiplayer like Fortnite, it can be the difference between winning and losing a fight.\nThe best way to game on a Mac?\nDespite the teething troubles that game streaming services are likely to face for some time, GeForce Now is a great way to get your game on if you use a Mac.\nApple computers are notoriously bad at gaming. Even higher-powered machines struggle to compete with Windows systems that cost a lot less. But with Now, you can enjoy the latest titles \u2014\u00a0with excellent visuals and plenty of frames \u2014\u00a0on almost any Mac. It\u2019s really quite remarkable when you first try it out.\nAnd it\u2019s no wonder that streaming is being pegged as the future of gaming. It breaks down the barrier so many people are blocked by when they first get into gaming \u2014\u00a0the cost of a decent gaming PC or console.\u00a0And it takes away the hassle of maintaining your own hardware. It makes gaming so accessible.\nSome of the many games available on GeForce Now.Screenshot: Cult of Mac\nI certainly don\u2019t think streaming will replace PC gaming in the foreseeable future. But Now is a terrific option for those who can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to dole out the bucks for their own desktop \u2014\u00a0and those who also want to enjoy their games away from their PC. It also is likely to be the closest we will ever get to true PC gaming on a Mac.\nNow isn\u2019t just for your Mac, either. You can also enjoy it on Windows, the Nvidia Shield TV, and even Android devices. (Nvidia tells us there is nothing to announce for iOS at this time.) That means you can play your PC games almost anywhere and have a darn good time.\nJust $4.99 a month\nYou can enjoy Now for free if you don\u2019t mind being limited to hour-long play sessions. But a subscription to the Founder\u2019s Edition plan is well worth it. That\u2019s also free for the first 90 days, then $4.99 a month for 12 months. It gives you unlimited play time, priority access to Nvidia\u2019s streaming servers, and the best graphics.\nThat\u2019s the same price you\u2019ll pay for Apple Arcade, which obviously isn\u2019t an option if you want to play PC games, and half the price you\u2019ll pay for Google Stadia, which offers significantly fewer titles.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear how much Nvidia will charge for a premium Now subscription after the first 12 months. But assuming the service only gets better, and the catalog of games keeps on growing, I\u2019ll have no problem coughing up my cash in the future.\n \n\n\n\nNumber of comments on this postLeave a comment \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletters\nDaily round-ups or a weekly refresher, straight from Cult of Mac to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\nCult of Mac Today\nOur daily roundup of Apple news, reviews and how-tos.

Nvidia's Xavier AI car supercomputer at CES 2017 at The Venetian Las Vegas in January 2017.Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesIan King\u00a0(Bloomberg) --\u00a0Nvidia Corp. gave a strong revenue forecast for the current period, spurred by increasing demand for data center and gaming chips.Revenue will be $3 billion, plus or minus 2%, in the fiscal first quarter, the Santa Clara, California-based company said Thursday in a statement. That compares with an average analyst estimate of $2.84 billion. Gross margin, or the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production, will be 65%, plus or minus 50 basis points.After slowing investment in their infrastructure last year, owners of the giant data centers that power internet services are spending again, including increasing their deployments of graphics chips used to boost artificial intelligence calculations. Nvidia, the biggest maker of graphics chips used in gaming personal computers, has adapted its technology for the AI market, creating a new multibillion-dollar business. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said the use of such computing is spreading, making growth less reliant on the spending plans of a handful of companies.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about hyperscalers any more, it\u2019s about startups and industry,\u201d Huang said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m very confident that the future of computing will involve accelerated computing.\u201dRelated:Nvidia and Microsoft Azure Pitch Rentable Cloud SupercomputersNvidia shares rose about 8% in extended trading following the report. Earlier, they closed at $270.78 in New York. The stock has jumped 77% in the past 12 months.Huang has built Nvidia into one of the most valuable tech companies by finding new customers for gaming chips. The ability of these components to do calculations in parallel makes them useful for AI workloads and, potentially, self-driving vehicles.The majority of the company\u2019s sales still comes from PC gaming, where Nvidia\u2019s graphics chips create the most realistic experiences. Top-of-the-line GeForce parts cost more than many consumers spend on a whole PC.Profit in the fiscal fourth-quarter was $950 million, or $1.53 a share, compared with $567 million, or 92 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue surged 41% to $3.1 billion and profit excluding certain costs was $1.89 a share in the period ending Jan. 26, the company said. Analysts, on average, had predicted earnings of $1.66 a share on sales of $2.96 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Gaming sales in the quarter jumped 56% from the same period a year earlier to $1.49 billion. Nvidia\u2019s Data Center unit contributed $968 million, a gain of 43%, according to a presentation posted on its\u00a0website. Automotive-related sales were flat.Related:ScaleMatrix and Nvidia's New AI and HPC Appliance Doesn't Need a Data CenterThe company said it is likely to close the acquisition of\u00a0Mellanox Technologies Ltd.\u00a0in the \u201cearly part of calendar 2020.\u201d Discussions with Chinese regulators about the transaction are progressing, it added. Share buybacks will resume after the completion of the deal, Nvidia also said.About the AuthorBloombergSee more from BloombergSubscribe to the Data Center Knowledge NewsletterGet analysis and expert insight on the latest in data center business and technology delivered to your inbox daily.Newsletter Sign-UpYou May Also LikeEditor's ChoiceData center hybrid energy systems illustrationEnergy & Power SupplyCan Hybrid Energy Systems Solve the Data Center Power Problem?Can Hybrid Energy Systems Solve the Data Center Power Problem?Mar 14, 2025Data center in space illustrationNext-Gen Data CentersData Centers in Space: Separating Fact from Science FictionData Centers in Space: Separating Fact from Science FictionMar 12, 2025Verne Helsinki data center campusData Center ConstructionNew Data Center Developments: March 2025New Data Center Developments: March 2025Mar 6, 2025Exclusive DCK ResourcesDecoding Data Center Efficiency Metrics: A Guide to Energy and SustainabilityJan 29, 2025|1 Min ReadData Center Knowledge\u2019s 2024 Salary ReportAug 26, 2024|1 Min ReadDeep Dive: Optimizing AI Data Storage ManagementJul 12, 2024|8 Min ReadStrategies for Sustainable Water Consumption in Data CentersJun 27, 2024|1 Min ReadSee all DCK ResourcesIndustry VoicesData center transformerData Center HardwareData Center Transformers: Functions, Importance, and How to Choose the Right OneData Center Transformers: Functions, Importance, and How to Choose the Right OneMar 18, 2025Data Center ConstructionAI Rush Has TPG-Backed Intersect in Talks on Texas Data CentersAI Rush Has TPG-Backed Intersect in Talks on Texas Data CentersMar 18, 2025Subscribe to the Data Center Knowledge NewsletterGet analysis and expert insight on the latest in data center business and technology delivered to your inbox daily.Newsletter Sign-UpFeatured Technical ExplainersAI chipCloudCloud vs. On-Prem AI Accelerators: Choosing the Best Fit for Your AI WorkloadsCloud vs. On-Prem AI Accelerators: Choosing the Best Fit for Your AI WorkloadsData center server configuration command lines on a computer monitor.Open Source SoftwareOptimize Text Search: Master the grep Command in LinuxOptimize Text Search: Master the grep Command in LinuxData center ETF stock chart illustrationInvestingData Center ETFs: An Introductory Guide to Boosting Your PortfolioData Center ETFs: An Introductory Guide to Boosting Your PortfolioDiscover MoreData Center WorldAFCOMITPro TodayInformationWeekNetwork ComputingWorking With UsAbout UsReprintsAdvertiseContact UsJoin UsNewsletter Sign-UpFollow UsCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon Pro W5500 (Image credit: AMD)AMD has announced its latest workstation graphics cards, the Radeon Pro W5500 for desktop workstations and the Radeon Pro W5500M for mobile ones. The new graphics solutions target professionals, such as designers and engineers, that require both performance and efficiency.AMD Radeon Pro W5500The Radeon Pro W5500 will be available in mid-February 2020 with a suggested e-tail price of $399. It comes in the form of a single-slot, PCIe add-in-card that's only 241mm long. The Radeon Pro W5500 carries the latest PCIe 4.0 x16 interface; however, the graphics card is only wired x8 electrically.\u00a0Specification-wise, the Radeon Pro W5500 is based on AMD's Navi die built with TSMC's 7nm FinFET process node. The chipmaker hasn't specified which die, but we suspect it's Navi 14. The graphics card has 22 Compute Units (CUs) for a total of 1,408 Stream Processors (SPs). A single fan provides active coolingAMD didn't disclose the Radeon Pro W5500's clock speeds either, but its announcement reassured consumers that the graphics card delivers up to 5.35 TFLOPS and 330 GFLOPS of peak single-precision (FP32) and double-precision (FP64) performance, respectively.There's also 8GB of onboard GDDR6 memory clocked at 14 Gbps across a 128-bit memory interface. This configuration allows the Radeon Pro W5500 to pump out a memory bandwidth of 224 GBps.AMD Radeon Pro W5500 vs. Nvidia Quadro P2200Swipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 AMD Radeon Pro W5500Nvidia Quadro P2200GPU ArchitectureRDNA (Navi 14)Pascal (GP106)Shading Units1,4081,280Double-Precision Performance330 GFLOPS119 GFLOPSSingle-Precision Performance5.35 TFLOPS3.8 TFLOPSTexture Units8880ROPs3240Base Clock Rate?1,000 MHzBoost Clock Rate?1,493 MHzMemory Clock14 Gbps10 GbpsMemory Capacity8GB GDDR65GB GDDR5XMemory Bus128-bit160-bitMemory Bandwidth224 GBps200 GBpsL2 Cache2MB1MBTDP125W75WTransistor Count6.4 billion4.4 billionDie Size158 mm\u00b2200 mm\u00b2Nvidia's Pascal-powered Quadro P2200 is the Radeon Pro W5500's natural foe. According to AMD's provided numbers, the Radeon Pro W5500 deliver up to 50%, 19% and 4% higher performance in Enscape, Unity and Twinmotion, respectively. The Radeon Pro W5500 reportedly consumes one-third less power than the Quadro P2200 under load.The Radeon Pro W5500 is rated with a 125W TDP and only requires a single six-pin PCIe power connector for external power. AMD equipped the graphics card with four DisplayPort 1.4 outputs, so you have the option of connecting up to four 4K displays or a single 8K display at a 60 Hz refresh rate.\u00a0Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.AMD Radeon Pro W5500MIdentical to the desktop variant, the Radeon Pro W5500M also features 1,408 SPs, but since this is geared toward laptops, it's clocked slightly lower. Based on AMD's numbers, the Radeon Pro W5500M offers up to 4.79 TFLOPS of single-precision (FP32) performance. The chipmaker rates the mobile graphics card with a 85W TDP, only 40W lower than the desktop model.The Radeon Pro W5500M has half the memory of the Radeon Pro W5500. Fortunately, the memory speed and interface remain the same, so the graphics card is still good for a maximum memory bandwidth up to 224 GBps.The Radeon Pro W5500M will be available in spring 2020, but we don't know which devices will carry it yet.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nRadeon\nWorkstation\nHardware\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (3)\n\n\n\nZhiye LiuSocial Links NavigationNews Editor and Memory ReviewerZhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

[+] Santa Clara, California. Nvidia Corporation will report first quarter earnings today after the closing bell.  (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Getty Images\nNvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) total revenue has grown from $9.71 billion in 2018 to $10.92 billion in 2020, and is expected to further grow to $13.10 billion in 2021. Nvidia\u2019s GPU segment is expected to make 87% of the $13.10 billion in Nvidia\u2019s expected 2021 revenues, while also being key to Nvidia\u2019s revenue growth. GPU segment is expected to be the single-biggest revenue driver with $11.36 billion in revenues (87% of Total Revenue), which is expected to be 6.5x the size of its Tegra Processors revenue in 2021.\n\n\nGPU segment, which includes GPUs sold for consumer and professional PCs, and data centers, will be the fastest-growing segment \u2013 adding $3.18 billion over 2018-2021 (94% of the $3.39 billion in incremental revenues).\n\nFurthermore, total revenue should rise to around $15.07 billion by 2022, driven by the company\u2019s new Turing products, and a revival in data center demand.\n\nIn our interactive dashboard Nvidia Revenue: How Does Nvidia Make Money?, we discuss Nvidia\u2019s business model, followed by sections that review past performance and 2022 expectations for Nvidia\u2019s revenue, including comparisons with close competitors, Intel and AMD.\n\nTrefis\nA look at Nvidia\u2019s segments and their contribution to total revenue\n GPU revenue to grow by $3.6 billion over the next 2 years, to make up 87% of total revenue in 2022\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\n\n\nGPU revenue grew from $8.18 billion in 2018 to $10.18 billion in 2019, and was the primary driver of Nvidia\u2019s revenue growth.\nHowever, GPU revenue dropped to $9.46 billion in 2020, under pressure from low PC and notebook sales, and a slowdown in data center demand.\nHowever, things should get better by 2021, and we expect revenue in 2021 to come in at $11.36 billion.\n\n\n\n Revenue from the Tegra Processors segment to grow by $550 million over the next 2 years, to make up 13% of the total revenue estimate\n\n\nRevenue from this segment has dropped from $1.53 billion in 2018 to $1.45 billion in 2020.\nRevenue from Tegra Processors came under pressure in 2020, due to a slowdown in the Chinese economy (around 25% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue comes from China).\nHowever, by 2022 this metric could grow to $2 billion on the back of growing demand for gaming consoles.\n\n\n\n\nSee all\u00a0Trefis Price Estimates\u00a0and\u00a0Download\u00a0Trefis Data\u00a0here\nWhat\u2019s behind Trefis?

It takes place in San Jose from March 22 to 26.\nIf you\u2019re already familiar with NVIDIA\u2019s GPU offerings, then it will come as no surprise that GTC is heavy on real-time, AI, and deep learning.\nThere\u2019s a whole lot of other stuff on offer too in many other fields, but I wanted to get a preview of the event for those in the VFX and animation space. So I asked NVIDIA GM of Media & Entertainment Richard Kerris to run down what he thought some of the GTC program must-sees would be. Here\u2019s his three highlights.\nFrom StoryTELLING to StoryLIVING: My Journey to a Galaxy Far, Far Away\n\u2013 Vicki Beck, Executive in Charge, ILMxLAB\nVicki and I worked together for years when I was there at Lucasfilm, so I\u2019m a bit partial, but what they\u2019re doing in immersive storytelling is pretty amazing. The idea of VR and AR emerging as a viable medium for entertainment \u2013 we\u2019re there and we\u2019re seeing a lot of stuff happen in the Oculus and in other headsets. I think that they understand the medium better than most so that they play to the medium and they create to the medium, meaning that they don\u2019t try to make it all photoreal, but instead they take you in an environment with familiar characters.\nThe Future of GPU Rendering: Real-Time Raytracing, Holographic Displays, and Light Field Media\n\u2013 Jules Urbach, CEO, OTOY Inc\nJules Urbach is going to be talking about GPU rendering and real-time ray tracing using holographic displays and what\u2019s happening with the idea of creating a holodeck. That\u2019s been an ongoing project that OTOY has been working on, including with Light Field Labs, which has a working prototype of a true holographic display. You really should see it. It\u2019s an incredible thing. They\u2019ll show you things that you swear are right there and you\u2019ll reach to try to grab them and they\u2019re not.\nPhotorealistic, Real-Time, Digital Humans: From Our TED Talk to Now\n\u2013 Doug Roble, Senior Director of Software R&D, Digital Domain\nDoug Roble will be giving an update on DigiDoug [which he originally presented as a TED Talk involving him in an Xsens suit and a real-time avatar projected on stage]. It\u2019s always fun to see. I keep wondering when are we going to go there and everybody\u2019s just going to be digitally presented!\nThose are just some of the highlights specifically mentioned by Kerris. There are more sessions to be announced. Other talks that look like do-not-miss sessions include:\nCreating In-Camera VFX with Real-Time Workflows\n\u2013 David Morin, Head of Los Angeles Lab, Epic Games\nFacial Scanning for Virtual Avatars On the Fly\n\u2013 Kalle Bladin, Research Programmer, USC Institute for Creative Technologies\n\u2013 Yajie Zhao, Research Associate, USC Institute For Creative Technologies\nStudio Workflows with Omniverse: From Virtual Production to Shipping Titles\n\u2013 Kevin Margo, Creative Director, NVIDIA, NVIDIA\n\u2013 Omer Shapira, Engineer, Artist, NVIDIA\n\u2013 Damien Fagnou, Senior Director, Software, NVIDIA\nKerris also hinted to me that ILM visual effects supervisor Pablo Helman will delve into the VFX of The Irishman, where a new camera rig and software were developed to make the characters look younger, without facial tracking markers. Here, Quadro RTX cards were used to do real-time manipulation of the digital puppetry that ILM created, and GPU rendering relied upon for preview scenes. Plus, a machine learning approach to building a library of target images of the actors \u2013 called Face Finder \u2013 was employed.\nI\u2019m looking forward to heading over for GTC, and hope I can say hi to any readers who are also considering attending.

From the top to bottom, unless it\u2019s a MacBook the odds are it\u2019s powered by a GeForce. This is the case even at the very bottom of the discrete market, where next to the grues and the 4200 RPM hard drives, you\u2019ll find NVIDIA\u2019s series of discrete adapters for entry-level laptops. Designed to be the first step up above Intel\u2019s integrated graphics, these parts do fill an important role in the market, but they don\u2019t get much attention \u2013 even from NVIDIA.\nAt any rate, this week the company has updated those adapters for 2020 with the release of the Pascal-based GeForce MX350 and MX330.\nAs has become an annoying tradition for NVIDIA, they\u2019re officially saying very little about the new parts. The official specifications don\u2019t include anything about clockspeeds, CUDA core counts, ROPs, etc. Instead, NVIDIA only confirms a basic set of features: both parts use GDDR5 memory, both feature GPU boost functionality, and both support DirectX12 up to feature level 12_1. Past that you won\u2019t get much else from NVIDIA; even the architecture isn\u2019t officially published in their spec sheets, though in this case we can make a very reasonable assumption that it\u2019s once again Pascal.\nMeanwhile, NVIDIA has once again moved up their Intel reference point; for the MX300 series, it\u2019s now Intel\u2019s 64EU Gen11 Iris Plus iGPU found in the Core i7-1065G7. This is Intel\u2019s fastest iGPU for their 15W U-series parts, and is reasonably potent on its own, so it helps to inform what kind of performance NVIDIA needs to hit to offer something that\u2019s a meaningful step up.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Laptop Video Adapter Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nTypical MX350\nTypical MX330\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n640\n384\n\n\nROPs\n16?\n16?\n\n\nMemory Type\nGDDR5\nGDDR5\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n64-bit\n64-bit\n\n\nVRAM\n<=4GB\n<=2GB\n\n\nGPU\nGP107\nGP108\n\n\nManufacturing Process\nSamsung 14nm\nSamsung 14nm\n\n\nLaunch Date\n02/12/2020\n02/12/2020\n\n\n\nAt any rate, while NVIDIA doesn\u2019t publish much in the way of specifications, this year NotebookCheck claims to have the specifications for the parts. We haven\u2019t been able to independently validate these figures, but they are quite reasonable, and very close to what I was expecting anyhow based on NVIDIA\u2019s loose performance claims. In particular, these are both low-end Pascal-based parts, which remain NVIDIA\u2019s smallest (and thus cheapest to produce) GPUs among their current Pascal and Turing product stacks.\nComing from last year\u2019s MX200 series parts, the big change here is at the top. With Intel\u2019s baseline going up, so does NVIDIA\u2019s performance; and as a result NVIDIA has tapped a more powerful GPU than in past years. For the MX350 then, we\u2019re looking at a GP107 GPU, a notably more powerful part than NVIDIA\u2019s normal entry-level parts. Essentially a further cut-down GTX 1050, according to NotebookCheck this part has 640 CUDA cores enabled, as well as half of its usual ROP/memory controller partitions, leaving 16 ROPs and a 64-bit memory bus.\nMeanwhile the MX330 is the more traditional GP108 showing. At a high level, take last year\u2019s MX250, tweak the clockspeeds a bit, and you have an MX330. Which means 384 CUDA cores paired with 16 ROPs and a 64-bit memory bus.\n\nLike past MX-series parts, NotebookCheck notes that both the MX350 and MX330 are informally rated for TDPs of 25W. However laptop manufacturers can and will adjust TDPs and clockspeeds to meet the specific power/cooling limitations of their notebooks, so like other laptop discrete graphics implementations, expect to see performance vary from design to design.\nBased on NVIDIA's previous release cadences for their low-end laptop parts, expect to see these new processors show up in laptops in the very near future. Traditionally these parts are paired with Intel U-series processors, and I expect to see the same here.\nSource: NVIDIA & NotebookCheck\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n16 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\njimjamjamie - Friday, February 14, 2020 - link\nShame we are not getting Turing but still good enough to fight off Intel I suppose.P.s.- First.\n\n\n\nPeachNCream - Friday, February 14, 2020 - link\n\"...Intel\u2019s 64EU Gen11 Iris Plus iGPU...\"Not even sure the bar is actually that high given how uncommon Intel's faster GPUs have been in the past.\n\n\n\nksec - Friday, February 14, 2020 - link\nIs this the first Samsung 14nm from Nvidia? \n\n\n\nFullmetalTitan - Friday, February 14, 2020 - link\nFirst and only so far\n\n\n\nRyan Smith - Friday, February 14, 2020 - link\nNote that GP107 and GP108 were released back in 2016. So this isn't new by any means.\n\n\n\nksec - Saturday, February 15, 2020 - link\nWell then this is big news. At least we know Nvidia is seriously testing Samsung Foundry with a shipping product. It also has the volume that Samsung Foundry desperately need. \n\n\n\ns.yu - Monday, February 17, 2020 - link\nI was wondering if they were saving all the GP107 that didn't pass QC all these years to shut down defective cores and rebrand them now as MX350, at least this answers me that they're newly manufactured :)\n\n\n\nSpunjji - Thursday, February 20, 2020 - link\nI think there's some confusion here. The MX350 is the same GP107 that has been around since 2016 - so this rebrand is likely either using accumulated defective dies, or unsold 1050 stock with parts fused off. Given the small size of the die and the maturity of the manufacturing process, I'd guess it's more of the latter.\n\n\n\nSpunjji - Thursday, February 20, 2020 - link\nIt's not really news though - or rather, it was 2016's news.\n\n\n\nqlum - Friday, February 14, 2020 - link\nI really wish the low end desktop cards get a refresh sometime.

Unlike Google\u2019s Stadia, GeForce Now isn\u2019t trying to build a console-like experience with its own lineup of games. Nvidia connects with your Steam, Epic or Battle.net account so you can play games you purchased on those third-party platforms. It works a bit more like Shadow, for instance.\nBut GeForce Now isn\u2019t a free service. Customers basically rent a gaming PC in a data center near them. Right now, it costs $5 per month to access the Founders edition, which lets you play whenever you want and for as long as you want. But the company says that it plans to raise the subscription fee at some point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can try the service by creating a free account, as well. If there are too many people connected to the service, you may have to wait to launch a game. You\u2019re also limited to one-hour sessions and less powerful hardware.\nYou\u2019ll have to download an app that works on macOS, Windows and Android devices, including the Nvidia Shield TV. GeForce Now isn\u2019t available from anywhere in the world, as you have to be near a data center to reduce latency. The company currently has nine data centers in the U.S., five in Europe, one in Korea and two in Japan.\nNvidia is optimizing games for the platform one at a time. So it\u2019s possible that you own a game but that it doesn\u2019t appear in the list of compatible games. Yes, that\u2019s a long list of restrictions. But it could be the future of gaming, maybe.\nBehind the scene, the company uses Nvidia graphics cards (duh) that support ray tracing. Nvidia doesn\u2019t share more details beyond that. I\u2019d recommend testing the service with a free account first to see if your connection is stable enough to support game streaming.\n\n\nTopics\n\nCloud Computing, GeForce, GeForce Now, Media & Entertainment, nvidia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRomain Dillet\t\n\n\n\nSenior Reporter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tRomain Dillet is a Senior Reporter at TechCrunch.\r\n\r\nHe has written over 3,000 articles on technology and tech startups and has established himself as an influential voice on the European tech scene.

The company's net earnings were $1.89 cents per share, beating analyst estimates by 22 cents.\n\"Adoption of Nvidia accelerated computing drove excellent results, with record data center revenue,\" Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in a statement. \"Our initiatives are achieving great success.\"\nCoronavirus, now known as Covid-19, has infected more than 60,000 people, according to CNN, while the death toll in China has reached 1,367. And it has already disrupted the tech industry in multiple ways, from the cancellation of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona to iPhone production constraints.\nMarc Fertik, vice president of technology solutions at Elk Grove Village, Ill.-based Ace Computers, an Nvidia system builder partner, said with many hardware systems relying on subcomponents made in China, the impact of coronavirus will be felt across the industry.\n\"It's going to hit everybody next quarter. It's going to slow down deliveries,\" he said. \"There are certainly some items I know that are going to lag.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Good thing Nvidia has delivered a game streaming model that actually looks attractive.\t\t\t\n\n \n\n By Leif Johnson  \n\n Contributor, Macworld   FEB 4, 2020 12:30 am PST \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nImage: Leif Johnson/IDG \n\n\n\n\n\n Here\u2019s something I never thought I\u2019d say: I\u2019m playing Blizzard\u2019s Overwatch on macOS Catalina on a 13-inch MacBook Air from 2012. I\u2019ve got the graphics cranked up as high as they can go, and I\u2019m still getting 60 frames per second. And even though I\u2019m playing on a relic from the halcyon days when you could find USB-A ports on a Mac, my team is winning\u2014and I think it\u2019s safe to say it\u2019s largely because of me.All of this isn\u2019t happening because Mac gaming suddenly went from \u201csucky\u201d to \u201csuper\u201d overnight, and it sure as heck isn\u2019t because Blizzard finally released a Mac port of its popular team shooter. Instead, I\u2019m playing with a new Founder\u2019s Edition account of Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now game streaming service, which has at last made its way to the public after a couple of years in beta.\nWith only a few reservations, I love it. You\u2019re never going to catch me saying it\u2019s good enough to replace a gaming PC, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s about as close to that experience as you can get on a Mac, especially on one as old as this one. And I think it\u2019s time to face the music: This is probably what the future of Mac gaming looks like. This is as good as it\u2019s going to get. (Our sister site, PCWorld, has a news article on GeForce Now you can also check out.) Up in the cloudBefore I get too far ahead of myself, here\u2019s an explainer. Nvidia GeForce Now is a cloud game streaming service like Google\u2019s Stadia, but one that\u2019s infinitely friendlier to consumers. (Sadly, Stadia didn\u2019t live up to the promise.) You don\u2019t have to rebuy some games you probably already own on a PC, and it works with a number of storefronts you may already have accounts with, such as Steam, the Epic Games Store, and Blizzard\u2019s Battle.net. You don\u2019t even have to worry about your Mac being able to run these games, as Nvidia itself keeps them updated and powers all of them with its own celebrated graphics cards\u2014which, as a reminder, haven\u2019t been supported on Macs for years.\n\n\nThe only things you really need are an Nvidia account and an internet connection that\u2019s capable of reaching at least 15Mbps. Unfortunately, in the Appleverse, GeForce Now is only available on the Mac. It may seem perfect for iOS and the Apple TV, but when I asked, an Nvidia representative said the company had \u201cnothing to announce.\u201d It\u2019s not hard to believe that Apple itself may cause trouble in that regard, especially after the fiasco surrounding Valve\u2019s Steam Link app\u00a0in 2018 and 2019.You don\u2019t even have to pay for GeForce Now if you don\u2019t want to, as the free version lets you use the service to play your games for up to an hour at a time, though you can hop right back into another session if you\u2019re booted off. If you want to bump up to six hours with \u201cpriority\u201d access to Nvidia\u2019s servers (as well as Nvidia\u2019s RTX ON technology for ray tracing), you\u2019ll have to pay just $4.99 a month for the Founder\u2019s Edition account. That\u2019s the same price as an Apple Arcade subscription, less than Google Stadia\u2019s $10 per month, and the kind of thing many of us might forget about. In this case, though, you\u2019ll also get a 90-day free trial (which leads me to believe the subscription price might go up later). NvidiaRay tracing in Metro Exodus, which is supported in GeForce Now.\u00a0It\u2019ll be hard for some players to forget about that six-hour session limit. Most normal people probably aren\u2019t going to hit that. But I, er, admit I occasionally go over six hours without logging out when I\u2019m playing Final Fantasy XIV on the weekends, so it could happen. Like with the free service, however, you can sign back in if you bump into the six-hour session limit, so you aren\u2019t barred from playing more once you hit that mark.Also a minor bummer: GeForce Now doesn\u2019t support all games on Steam, Epic, and similar storefronts, but it does support quite a few. They\u2019re the games that are popular enough to warrant maintaining with such a setup. Aside from around 30 popular free-to-play games like Fortnite, many of the remaining 1,000 or so tend to be on the old side. I wasn\u2019t able to find brand-new popular hits like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Control, or the PC port of Red Dead Redemption 2, but I was able to find many of my favorites like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds, and, of course, Overwatch. Considering that none of those games have come to the Mac, I call that a big win.\nSay \u2018bye\u2019 to Wi-FiFor the best performance, though, I highly suggest playing on a wired connection. If Google\u2019s Stadia has any real advantage over GeForce Now, it\u2019s that it runs well on something as simple as my browser, even on my garbage home Wi-Fi connection. GeForce Now always seems to struggle on Wi-Fi\u2014and Nvidia itself suggests that you play with at least a 5GHz network.Our office Wi-Fi at Macworld isn\u2019t bad: We get 181Mbps for downloads and 201Mbps for uploads, which is far more than the 30Mbps Nvidia recommends for 1080p60 streaming. But when I tried to play The Witcher 3 in the middle of office hours, the textures sometimes got so muddy that screenshots could pass for discarded canvases from the impressionist artist Monet.On an ethernet connection, though? Zero problems. In fact, the Overwatch clip at the top of this story was captured while I was hooked up to ethernet. I didn\u2019t get to try it out, but Nvidia suggests this kind of performance is possible even on a 2008 MacBook running at least macOS Yosemite.Rotten ApplesEven considering those potential stumbling blocks, it\u2019s not a stretch to say Nvidia has changed the game. Heck, it lets us play the game, which Apple itself isn\u2019t showing much interest in doing. With this one service, Nvidia manages to knock out many of the usual frustrations.\nNow, for instance, there\u2019s no need to buy a ridiculously expensive 16-inch MacBook Pro in the hopes that maybe\u2014maybe \u2014you can play a modern blockbuster game on macOS at 30 fps on middling settings. Provided your internet connection is strong enough, there\u2019s no question you can run it with GeForce Now. For that matter, you don\u2019t have to sacrifice a huge chunk of the often small MacBook hard drives so you can partition them for Boot Camp.Nor is there any reason to pour around $1,000 into an external GPU and graphics card\u00a0just so you can play something as graphically uncomplicated as World of Warcraft on your MacBook with the settings at maximum.And it\u2019s about time. If you haven\u2019t heard, Mac gaming has been in a particularly sorry spot as of late. Most developers seem to have stopped caring, and it\u2019s hard to blame them. Blizzard, which famously used to simultaneously release PC and Mac games at once, has yet to release a Mac port of Overwatch five years after its release. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has been ported so much that it\u2019s a game industry joke, but it still hasn\u2019t made its way to Mac.You can get an idea of why developer might not care from last week\u2019s report that developer Psyonix was dropping Mac and Linux support\u00a0for its popular Rocket League. As Ars Technica reported, non-Windows players make up a measly 0.3 percent of players. With a player count that low, it\u2019s no wonder that Psyonix is offering refunds for players on those systems.\nHere at Macworld, I stopped writing our monthly roundup of the top Mac games because finding good games every month became as hard as finding a Steve Jobs wallpaper on a Google Pixel. An embarrassing number of the games on my list of the best Mac games still haven\u2019t been upgraded to support the transition from 32-bit to 64-bit in macOS Catalina, even in the case of simple games like Undertale.And Macs always struggle to run games anyway, despite Apple\u2019s efforts to woo developers into using its Metal API. As YouTuber Quinn Nelson of Snazzy Labs showed last month, even the $6,000 starting model of the new Mac Pro struggled to run some games at 30 fps. (Performance did get better when Nelson dropped in an AMD 5700XT.) Even my own 13-inch MacBook Pro struggles to run some Apple Arcade games. Nobody buys a Mac expecting it to be a monster gaming rig, but this state of affairs is ridiculous.New problemsGeForce Now doesn\u2019t eliminate all of the problems of Mac gaming. In fact, it introduces some new ones. You might finally be able to run The Witcher 3, but you\u2019re still in danger of eating your data plan. (Fortunately, GeForce Now has a \u201cData Saver\u201d mode that will only eat through 4GB of data per hour rather than the 10GB you can expect with the \u201cBalanced\u201d setting.) And I\u2019m not entirely convinced GeForce Now will stay stable once the floodgates open today. Leif Johnson/IDGA look at some of the available options.But let\u2019s repeat some things worth repeating. You can now play graphically demanding PC games you already own on your old glowy-logo MacBook without having to partition your drive or do something ridiculous like buying an eGPU. And you can do this for $4.99 a month!\nYou can win a Shot Caller commendation in Overwatch and then Command-Tab over to try to find some AirPods Pro in stock in Safari. It\u2019s the best Mac gaming has looked in ages, and unless Microsoft really manages to wow us with its own Project xCloud, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to look much better than this for a while.Sure, we\u2019ve heard some sketchy rumors about a \u201cGaming Mac\u201d, but I believe those about as much as I\u2019d believe reports that Steve Jobs is still alive and teaching yoga in Fresno. The fact remains that the Mac gaming library is pitifully small, especially for blockbuster games. Who\u2019s going to crank out a mountain of cash just so they can play Rise of the Tomb Raider\u00a0the way Feral Interactive intended us to? I doubt it\u2019ll be affordable, and I doubt it\u2019ll be worth the wait.Speaking of waiting, I\u2019d get used to it. Right now, one of the big drawbacks of relying on GeForce Now as your main gaming service on the Mac is that you\u2019ll probably have to wait a while for games to become available. It might be years before we see them, especially in this age of long exclusivity agreements on storefronts like the Epic Game Store.Think of it this way: We Mac gamers are used to waiting. It took years for\u00a0Rise of the Tomb Raider to come to Mac. Games like Overwatch never came, and we came to expect that it wouldn\u2019t, as we did with so many other titles.\nBut now, at least, we can be confident that there\u2019s a real chance.\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Leif Johnson, Contributor, Macworld\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nLeif is a San Francisco-based tech journalist.
