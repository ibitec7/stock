Thailand's benchmark 5% broken rice prices rose to $475-$485 on Thursday from $470-$480 last week, traders said.  \"New supply hasn't yet arrived, resulting in higher prices,\" a Bangkok-based trader said. Prices for top exporter India's 5 percent broken parboiled variety were unchanged at $366-$370 per tonne, its lowest since the week of March 26. \"Demand is weak as buyers have taken a pause. Since container freight rates are going up, exporters can't reduce the prices,\" said an exporter based at Kakinada in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. An appreciation in the rupee is also reducing traders' margins from overseas sales, which makes securing exports deals difficult, the exporter added. Meanwhile, Bangladesh's state grains agency issued an international tender to purchase 50,000 tonnes of rice this week, its first tender in three years amid dwindling supplies and a surge in prices of the staple grain. But market participants said the move would hardly have any impact on prices, which have gone up around 50% since March, as the COVID-19 pandemic pushed local prices to record highs due to panic buying. Vietnam's 5% broken rice prices were unchanged from a week earlier at $495-$500 per tonne on Thursday. \"Demand from the Philippines is on the rise, but rice shipments from Cambodia to Vietnam help offset domestic thin supplies,\" said a trader based in Ho Chi Minh City. Vietnamese export rates are likely to remain around current levels until the end of the year, traders said. Government data showed Vietnam's rice exports in October fell 5.8% from September to 362,930 tonnes.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

And like many index funds, there are index funds to fit every investing style. If you\u2019re an investor whose personal convictions allow you to invest in sin stocks, then there are some vice ETFs that you may want to consider.\nSin stocks are companies that allow us to indulge our vices. These include gambling, alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis companies. However, they also now capture the gaming community in all its forms.\nMost of the sin stocks were hit hard at the onset of the pandemic. But many of these categories are coming back. One reason for that is mounting evidence that our nation is moving on from the pandemic.\nAs it relates to sin stocks, casinos have reopened in many states. The return of live sports has provided a catalyst for online and in-person sports books. Several states just passed ballot initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana. And while the bar and restaurant industry is still providing a drag on alcohol sales, it appears that consumers are still stocking their home bars.\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t7 High-Yield Dividend Companies to Invest in During the Pandemic\t\t\t\t\n\nHere are 5 vice ETFs for safe investment in sin stocks:\nAdvisorShares Vice ETF (NYSEARCA:VICE)\nVanEck Vectors Gaming ETF (NYSEARCA:BJK)\nVanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF (NYSEARCA:ESPO)\nETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSEARCA:MJ)\nInvesco Dynamic Leisure & Entertainment ETF (NYSEARCA:PEJ)\nSin stocks remain volatile, and as I mentioned above, not all vice stocks are performing equally well. That\u2019s a good reason to look at vice ETFs for portfolio exposure.\nVice ETFs for Safe Investment: AdvisorShares Vice ETF (VICE)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n \nThe AdvisorShares Vice ETF focuses on growth stocks through direct exposure to industry leaders in the alcohol and tobacco sectors. According to the fund\u2019s website, this benefits investors in two distinct ways.\nFirst, the alcohol and tobacco sectors are heavily regulated, which give established companies a moat. These sectors also tend to provide higher profit margins than other sectors. And many of the top names in these sectors also pay a secure dividend which can help the fund\u2019s total return.\n\t\t\n\n\nIn addition to alcohol and tobacco, the fund allocates some of its resources to emerging cannabis-related companies. While the short-term narrative for cannabis is still being written, the long-term outlook for the sector remains strong.\nThe ACT ETF is lagging behind the broader market, with a gain of just 8.5% at the time of this writing. But looking at the stock through a wider lens, you will see that the stock is up more than 68% since bottoming out back in March.\nVanEck Vectors Gaming ETF (BJK)\n\nSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com\n \nThe next of our vice ETFs to look at comes from the VanEck family of ETFs. The Vectors Gaming ETF has 50% of its allocation in the global gaming industry. This is a small ETF when compared to some of the other ETFs in the VanEck portfolio. But that isn\u2019t uncommon when it comes to targeted ETFs such as this.\nDraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) is the fund\u2019s fifth-largest holding in the BJK ETF, and DKNG stock is up nearly 300% for the year. And with digital betting only continuing to grow, that seems likely to increase.\n\t\t\n\n\nI also think it\u2019s interesting to note that the fund\u2019s top holding is Flutter Entertainment (OTCMKTS:PDYPY). This is a stock that is making issues like sustainability a marketing message. The company\u2019s web site shows that they have are in the process of renovating their offices in Dublin and London to reduce its carbon footprint.\nWill this matter to gamblers? It just might. The millennial generation is much likely to invest based on its values. And few causes are closer to their heart than the issue of climate change.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t7 High-Yield Dividend Companies to Invest in During the Pandemic\t\t\t\t\n\nThe fund is down 5% for the year. And that may be due to the fact that the fund has heavy exposure to the global casino market. Those markets still need time to rebound.\nVanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF (ESPO)\n\nSource: Roman Kosolapov/ Shutterstock\n \nAnother way to play vice ETFs is by looking to the burgeoning video gaming and eSports sectors. Even prior to live sports being cancelled by the pandemic, eSports was red-hot. With many Americans spending a lot of time at home, it\u2019s no surprise that the ESPO ETF is up over 65% this year.\n\t\t\n\n\nOf course it doesn\u2019t hurt that one of the fund\u2019s largest holdings is Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI). And since gamers require the latest and greatest hardware and software to ensure they get maximum performance. That\u2019s why this fund also provides investors exposure to companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) .\nNo matter what age you are, you know that video games (even an app like Candy Crush you play on your phone) are undeniably addicting; hence their inclusion among vice stocks. But when you look at the millennial generation and particularly Generation Z, the allure of playing the games online against another competitor is particularly attractive.\nAnd while watching other people play video games has no allure for me, it\u2019s different for gaming enthusiasts. Far be it from me to miss out on profits.\nETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n \nCannabis investing is one of the riskiest areas of investing. And for the better part of the last two years, it\u2019s been a losing proposition for investors. And the MJ ETF is no exception.\u00a0 The fund is down 35% for the year.\n\t\t\n\n\nBut cannabis is a long game. And that\u2019s the reason that InvestorPlace contributor Tim Biggam picked this ETF as his best ETF for 2020. Says Biggam, \u201c\u2026The ability to buy into an industry at the formative stages makes MJ a solid addition to the portfolio.\u201d\nHowever, cannabis stocks may be moving out of the formative stage. Four additional states approved legislation to legalize recreational marijuana. That brings the list to 15 states. And two states passed ballot initiatives to legalize medical marijuana. This now means 36 states have legalized medical marijuana.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t7 High-Yield Dividend Companies to Invest in During the Pandemic\t\t\t\t\n\nBoth of these trends are only going to intensify in the coming years, particularly as it appears the White House will have an occupant that is friendlier to the idea of legalizing marijuana on a federal level.\nInvesco Dynamic Leisure & Entertainment ETF (PEJ)\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n \nThe last of our vice ETFs to look at today is the PEJ ETF from Invesco. This may not be a fund that investors immediately associate with sin stocks. However, as the virus continues to limit entertainment options, more consumers are spending time viewing content and eating carryout food.\n\t\t\n\n\nThese are the two segments that dominate the holdings of the PEJ ETF. But these segments have been traveling in opposite directions this year. And even though two of the top six stocks held by the fund include Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and Domino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ), the fund is still down nearly 30% for the year.\nHowever since the onset of the pandemic, the fund is up 63%, which may be a more accurate view of the fund\u2019s performance. The truth is probably somewhere in between. From January 2015 until January 2020, the fund rose about 28% suggesting that the overall performance in 2020 may be an anomaly.\nOn the date of publication Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. \nChris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over six years.

Some more weighty evidence of Nvidia AIBs preparing to flood the market with RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards has recently emerged thanks to documentation published by the EEC (an electronics registration database for manufacturers wishing to export to the Eurasian Economic Union).\n\nAsus, Inno3D, and Palit EEC submissions have been spotted by PC Gamer this week. Asus is one of the biggest computer components makers in the world and it looks to have registered all the names you would expect to fit in with its existing product lines. Thus its EEC listing features codenames like ROG-STRIX-RTX3060TI-O8G-GAMING, DUAL-RTX3060TI-O8G-MINI, and TURBO-RTX3060TI-8G-EVO. In all there are 12 cards listed by Asus fitting into its ROG Strix, TUF, Dual, Phoenix, and Turbo stables. They were added to the EEC database on 27th October.\nInno3D has registered just a single RTX 3060 and single RTX 3060 Ti in its latest filing with the EEC. No more specific edition codenames are revealed in this rather Spartan listing which was added on 4th Nov.\nIn contrast, Palit has notified the EEC of 64 RTX 3060/Ti graphics cards model trademarks that it may intend to sell within the trade block. Its codenames are quite opaque \u2013 what sets the NE63060T19J9-190BB -190BF apart from the NE63060T19J9-190BE, for example? We shall have to wait and see. Its listing, dated 4th Nov, also includes a selection of RTX 3090, 3080, and 3070 models. Whether these include Ti variants isn't clear.\n\nThe rumoured specs of the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti include; 4,864 CUDA cores and a 1.67GHz boost clock, with 8GB of GDDR6 memory on board. The latest info points towards a 2nd Dec launch date and suggested retail price of $399.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\nAsus shares its Intel Z690 motherboard guide\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nHEXUS Week In Review: Asus ROG Strix Arion and Seagate Storage Expansion Card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 14 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

Barely launched 6 months ago, NVIDIA is preparing to release an updated version of the GPU-based accelerator with 80 gigabytes of HBM2e memory, doubling the capacity of the initial version of the accelerator. And as an added kick, NVIDIA is dialing up the memory clockspeeds as well, bringing the 80GB version of the A100 to 3.2Gbps/pin, or just over 2TB/second of memory bandwidth in total.\nThe 80GB version of the A100 will continue to be sold alongside the 40GB version \u2013 which NVIDIA is now calling the A100 40GB \u2013 and it is being primarily aimed at customers with supersized AI data sets. Which at face value may sound a bit obvious, but with deep learning workloads in particular, memory capacity can be a strongly bounding factor when working with particularly large datasets. So an accelerator that\u2019s large enough to keep an entire model in local memory can potentially be significantly faster than one that has to frequently go off-chip to swap data.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Accelerator Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nA100 (80GB)\nA100 (40GB)\nV100\n\n\nFP32 CUDA Cores\n6912\n6912\n5120\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1.41GHz\n1.41GHz\n1530MHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n3.2Gbps HBM2e\n2.4Gbps HBM2\n1.75Gbps HBM2\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n5120-bit\n5120-bit\n4096-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n2.0TB/sec\n1.6TB/sec\n900GB/sec\n\n\nVRAM\n80GB\n40GB\n16GB/32GB\n\n\nSingle Precision\n19.5 TFLOPs\n19.5 TFLOPs\n15.7 TFLOPs\n\n\nDouble Precision\n9.7 TFLOPs\r\n\t\t\t(1/2 FP32 rate)\n9.7 TFLOPs\r\n\t\t\t(1/2 FP32 rate)\n7.8 TFLOPs\r\n\t\t\t(1/2 FP32 rate)\n\n\nINT8 Tensor\n624 TOPs\n624 TOPs\nN/A\n\n\nFP16 Tensor\n312 TFLOPs\n312 TFLOPs\n125 TFLOPs\n\n\nTF32 Tensor\n156 TFLOPs\n156 TFLOPs\nN/A\n\n\nInterconnect\nNVLink 3\r\n\t\t\t12 Links (600GB/sec)\nNVLink 3\r\n\t\t\t12 Links (600GB/sec)\nNVLink 2\r\n\t\t\t6 Links (300GB/sec)\n\n\nGPU\nGA100\r\n\t\t\t(826mm2)\nGA100\r\n\t\t\t(826mm2)\nGV100\r\n\t\t\t(815mm2)\n\n\nTransistor Count\n54.2B\n54.2B\n21.1B\n\n\nTDP\n400W\n400W\n300W/350W\n\n\nManufacturing Process\nTSMC 7N\nTSMC 7N\nTSMC 12nm FFN\n\n\nInterface\nSXM4\nSXM4\nSXM2/SXM3\n\n\nArchitecture\nAmpere\nAmpere\nVolta\n\n\n\nDiving right into the specs, the only difference between the 40GB and 80GB versions of the A100 will be memory capacity and memory bandwidth. Both models are shipping using a mostly-enabled GA100 GPU with 108 active SMs and a boost clock of 1.41GHz. Similarly, the TDPs between the two models remain unchanged as well. So for pure, on-paper compute throughput, there\u2019s no difference between the accelerators.\nInstead, the improvements for the A100 come down to its memory capacity and its greater memory bandwidth. When the original A100 back in May, NVIDIA equipped it with six 8GB stacks of HBM2 memory, with one of those stacks disabled for yield reasons. This left the original A100 with 40GB of memory and just shy of 1.6TB/second of memory bandwidth.\nFor the newer A100 80GB, NVIDIA is keeping the same configuration of 5-out-of-6 memory stacks enabled, however the memory itself has been replaced with newer HBM2E memory. HBM2E is the informal name given to the most recent update to the HBM2 memory standard, which back in February of this year defined a new maximum memory speed of 3.2Gbps/pin. Coupled with that frequency improvement, manufacturing improvements have also allowed memory manufacturers to double the capacity of the memory, going from 1GB/die to 2GB/die. The net result being that HBM2E offers both greater capacities as well as greater bandwidths, two things which NVIDIA is taking advantage of here.\n\nWith 5 active stacks of 16GB, 8-Hi memory, the updated A100 gets a total of 80GB of memory. Which, running at 3.2Gbps/pin, works out to just over 2TB/sec of memory bandwidth for the accelerator, a 25% increase over the 40GB version. This means that not only does the 80GB accelerator offer more local storage, but rare for a larger capacity model, it also offers some extra memory bandwidth to go with it. That means that in memory bandwidth-bound workloads the 80GB version should be faster than the 40GB version even without using its extra memory capacity.\nBeing able to offer a version of the A100 with more memory bandwidth seems to largely be an artifact of manufacturing rather than something planned by NVIDIA \u2013 Samsung and SK Hynix only finally started mass production of HBM2E a bit earlier this year \u2013 but none the less it\u2019s sure to be a welcome one.\nOtherwise, as mentioned earlier, the additional memory won\u2019t be changing the TDP parameters of the A100. So the A100 remains a 400 Watt part, and nominally, the 80GB version should be a bit more power efficient since it offers more performance inside the same TDP.\nMeanwhile, NVIDIA has also confirmed that the greater memory capacity of the 80GB model will also be available to Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) users. The A100 still has a hardware limitation of 7 instances, so equal-sized instances can now have up to 10GB of dedicated memory each.\nAs far as performance is concerned, NVIDIA is throwing out a few numbers comparing the two versions of the A100. It\u2019s actually a bit surprising that they\u2019re talking up the 80GB version quite so much, as NVIDIA is going to continue selling the 40GB version. But with the A100 80GB likely to cost a leg (NVIDIA already bought the Arm), no doubt there\u2019s still a market for both.\n\nFinally, as with the launch of the original A100 earlier this year, NVIDIA\u2019s immediate focus with the A100 80GB is on HGX and DGX configurations. The mezzanine form factor accelerator is designed to be installed in multi-GPU systems, so that is how NVIDIA is selling it: as part of an HGX carrier board with either 4 or 8 of the GPUs installed. For customers that need individual A100s, NVIDIA is continuing to offer the PCIe A100, though not in an 80GB configuration (at least, not yet).\nAlong with making the A100 80GB available to HGX customers, NVIDIA is also launching some new DGX hardware today as well. At the high-end, they\u2019re offering a version of the DGX A100 with the new accelerators, which they\u2019ll be calling the DGX A100 640GB. This new DGX A100 also features twice as much DRAM and storage as its predecessor, doubling the original in more than one way.\n\nMeanwhile NVIDIA is launching a smaller, workstation version of the DGX A100, which they are calling the DGX Station A100. The successor to the original, Volta-based DGX Station, the DGX Station A100 is essentially half of a DGX A100, with 4 A100 accelerators and a single AMD EPYC processor. NVIDIA\u2019s press pre-briefing didn\u2019t mention total power consumption, but I\u2019ve been told that it runs off of a standard wall socket, far less than the 6.5kW of the DGX A100.\n\nNVIDIA is also noting that the DGX Station uses a refrigerant cooling system, meaning that they are using sub-ambient cooling (unlike the original DGX Station, which was simply water cooled). NVIDIA is promising that despite this, the DGX Station A100 is whisper quiet, so it will be interesting to see how much of that is true given the usual noise issues involved in attaching a compressor to a computer cooling loop.\nBoth of the new DGX systems as in production now. According to NVIDIA, the systems are already being used for some of their previously-announced supercomputing installations, such as the Cambridge-1 system. Otherwise commercial availability will start in January, with wider availability in February.\nGallery: NVIDIA SC20 Press Deck\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n29 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\ndrexnx - Monday, November 16, 2020 - link\nI wonder how they did that refrigerant cooling system - even with refrigerant, you still need a big air to air condenser and fan.\n\n\n\nedzieba - Monday, November 16, 2020 - link\nThe radiator doesn't need to be all that much larger than the equivalent watercooled variant, if it's sized to fit the load. What you lose in the extra thermal input from the compressor input energy, you gain from the increased efficiency per unit area of your radiator from operating the radiator at a higher temperature.As they don't specify their sub-ambient technology they should even be using a CoTS peltier cooling system, like the ones Intel is shipping out and supporting under the 'cryo cooler' branding. Those are peltier TEC 'hot ends' attached to AIO loops. Not sure who the OEM is for the TEC heads though.TEC sub-ambient cooling has obviously much worse thermal efficiency than compressor loop cooling (at a minimum double the power to be dissipated) though, so only the 'maintenance free' claim would point in that direction. \n\n\n\nFloridaMan - Friday, November 20, 2020 - link\nSo who gets to suck the charge out each year? Guess all interns are going to have an HVAC compliance power seminar.\n\n\n\nFloridaMan - Friday, November 20, 2020 - link\nAnd a way to keep condensation from leaking onto the board..\n\n\n\npsyclist80 - Monday, November 16, 2020 - link\nLooking forward to MI100 vs A100 reviews!\n\n\n\nrsandru - Monday, November 16, 2020 - link\nMeanwhile, on the more common computers we all use, software (aka games) support for multiple GPUs is still nearly non-existent.I'm surprised that the common 'smart' commenters who are quick to criticize multi-accelerator support in games with the \"just buy a faster card\" comment don't say the same about this nVidia workstation.Give me a modular multi-GPU capability (HW+SW) that I can expand as needed/desired/financially can afford with let's say 1-4 GPUs and I'll sign up tomorrow.\n\n\n\nedzieba - Monday, November 16, 2020 - link\n\"I'm surprised that the common 'smart' commenters who are quick to criticize multi-accelerator support in games with the \"just buy a faster card\" comment don't say the same about this nVidia workstation.\"Why would they? Gaming and HPC (and ML) are VERY different workloads. It's like complaining \"Mammoet can just add more SPMTs under a load to move it, why can't I just add more engines to my truck?\".\n\n\n\nwaterdog - Monday, November 16, 2020 - link\nI went looked up Mammoet SPMT.

It showcased how complex physics can be simulated in a real-time, ray-traced world.\nDuring the GeForce RTX 30 Series launch event in September, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang unveiled a more challenging take on the NVIDIA Marbles RTX project: staging the scene to take place at night and illustrate the effect of hundreds of dynamic, animated lights.\nMarbles at Night is a physics-based demo created with dynamic, ray-traced lights and over 100 million polygons. Built in NVIDIA Omniverse and running on a single GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, the final result showed hundreds of different light sources at night, with each marble reflecting lights differently and all happening in real time.\nBeyond demonstrating the latest technologies for content creation, Marbles at Night showed how creative professionals can now seamlessly collaborate and design simulations with incredible lighting, accurate reflections and real-time ray tracing with path tracing.\n\nPushing the Limits of Creativity\n\nA team of artists from NVIDIA collaborated and built the project in NVIDIA Omniverse, the real-time graphics and simulation platform based on NVIDIA RTX GPUs and Pixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description.\nWorking in Omniverse, the artists were able to upload, store and access all the assets in the cloud, allowing them to easily share files across teams. They could send a link, open the file and work on the assets at the same time.\nEvery single asset in Marbles at Night was hand-made, modeled and textured from scratch. Marbles RTX Creative Director Gavriil Klimov bought over 200 art supplies and took reference photos of each to capture realistic details, from paint splatter to wear and tear. Texturing \u2014 a process that allows artists to transfer details from one model to another \u2014 was done entirely in Substance Painter, with multiple variations for each asset.\n\nIn Omniverse, the artists manually crafted everything in the Marbles project using RTX Renderer and a variety of creative applications like 3ds Max, Maya, Cinema 4D, ZBrush and Blender. The simulation platform enabled the creative team to view all content at the highest possible quality in real time, resulting in shorter cycles and more iterations.\nNearly a dozen people were working on the project remotely from locations as far afield as California, New York, Australia and Russia. Although the team members were located around the world, Omniverse allowed them to work on scenes simultaneously thanks to Omniverse Nucleus. Running on premises or in the cloud, the module enabled the teams to collaborate in real time across vast distances.\nThe collaboration-based workflow, combined with the fact the project\u2019s assets were stored in the cloud, made it easier for everyone to access the files and edit in real time.\nThe final technology demo completed in Omniverse resulted in over 500GB worth of texture data, over 100 unique objects, more than 5,000 meshes and about 100 million polygons.\n\nThe Research Behind the Project \n\nNVIDIA Research recently released a paper on the reservoir-based spatiotemporal importance resampling (ReSTIR) technique, which details how to render dynamic direct lighting and shadows from millions of area lights in real time. Inspired by this technique, the NVIDIA rendering team, led by distinguished engineer Ignacio Llamas, implemented an algorithm that allowed Klimov and team to place as many lights as they wanted for the Marbles demo, without being constrained by lighting limits.\n\u201cBefore, we were limited to using less than 10 lights. But today with Omniverse capabilities using RTX, we were able to place as many lights as we wanted,\u201d said Klimov. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it \u2014 you can creatively decide what the limit is that works for you.\u201d\nTraditionally, artists and developers achieved complex lighting using baked solutions. NVIDIA Research, in collaboration with the Visual Computing Lab at Dartmouth College, produced the research paper that dives into how artists can enable direct lighting from millions of moving lights.\nThe approach requires no complex light structure, no baking and no global scene parameterization. All the lights can cast shadows, everything can move arbitrarily and new emitters can be added dynamically. This technique is implemented using DirectX Ray Tracing accelerated by NVIDIA RTX and NVIDIA RT Cores.\nGet more insights into the NVIDIA Research that\u2019s helping professionals simplify complex design workflows, and learn about the latest announcement of Omniverse, now in open beta.\n\nAdditional Resources:\u00a0\n\nRegister for the Omniverse open beta\nLearn about Universal Scene Description at NVIDIA\nGet the latest news on NVIDIA Omniverse\nDive deeper into Pixar USD\n\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: NVIDIA RTX | Omniverse | Simulation and Design | Universal Scene Description \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Nvidia stock forecast 2021: will the share price continue to set new highs?    \n By\n Nicole Willing\n  16:09, 20 November 2020              \nShares in US chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) have soared by 124 per cent since the start of the year as changes in the technology industry are driving computing demand.After such strong gains, is Nvidia stock a buy now or has the rally run its course? What do the latest reports from analysts indicate?This Nvidia stock analysis looks at the latest performance of the share price and its outlook heading into the next year.\u00a0The semiconductor industry today: changing demand trends boost share pricesThe chip manufacturing industry is on the verge of a step up in demand from new technology trends. The adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, advanced gaming services and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities increased requirements for data centre capacity to handle internet traffic, and new automotive features all require advanced semiconductor chips.Semiconductor stocks have risen in line with the massive gains across the technology sector in 2020, with the Nasdaq US Smart Semiconductor Index trading up by 31 per cent year to date and 114 per cent since the start of 2019. The Index includes companies such as AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM), as well as Nvidia. The overall US Tech 100 (US 100) technology index has similarly risen by 35 per cent so far this year.\u00a0So, what impact are the industry trends having on the latest Nvidia stock projection?

The stock reached an intra-day record of $589 per share in early September.\u00a0Nvidia earnings showed that the Covid-19 pandemic has affected the company\u2019s various business units in different ways, with new video gaming chips and a rise in internet data processors required during lockdowns more than offsetting lower demand for office applications and automotive technologies.\u00a0\u00a0The third-quarter Nvidia earnings report boasted a 57 per cent year-on-year rise in revenue to a record $4.73 billion, with gaming revenue up by 37 per cent to $2.27 billion and data centre revenue jumping by 162 per cent to $1.90 billion. The company issued revenue guidance for the fourth quarter of $4.8 billion, which would be up 54 per cent from $3.11 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of last year.\u00a0Revenue in the company\u2019s Professional Visualisation business fell by 27 per cent year on year to $236 million, as Covid-19 reduced demand for desktop workstations, although it was up by 16 per cent from the second quarter on a \u201csharp rebound in mobile workstations due to work from home trends,\u201d the company said.\u00a0Automotive revenue was down by 23 per cent from a year earlier to $125 million and up by 13 per cent from the previous quarter, as a decline in revenue from legacy infotainment modules and autonomous driving development agreements offset higher sales of AI solutions.

In Professional Visualisation, stronger demand for mobile workstations due to work-from-home trends was partially offset by lower demand for desktop workstations. In Automotive, customers\u2019 production volumes have largely returned to pre-Covid levels. In our supply chain, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components.\u201dDuring the third quarter, Nvidia agreed to acquire UK-based chip designer Arm from Japan\u2019s SoftBank Capital for $40 billion to strengthen its AI computing platform. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. The company also announced plans to build an AI lab in Cambridge, UK where Arm is based \u2013 including an AI supercomputer based on Nvidia and Arm technology. And it plans to build a separate AI supercomputer in the UK for research in healthcare and drug discovery.During the second quarter, Nvidia completed the $6.9 billion acquisition of Mellanox, which makes interconnect chips, to optimise its data centre offering. Mellanox revenue declined in the third quarter because of a US government ban on selling chips to Chinese telecom equipment producer Huawei Technologies and supply shortages.What impact has the company\u2019s recent performance had on the Nvidia share price forecast from analysts? And what should you do next with Nvidia shares: buy or sell?\u00a0We explain how you can profit from the stock regardless of the direction of the share price.Nvidia stock forecast 2021: earnings outlook lifts analyst price targets\u00a0At least 11 equities analysts boosted their price targets for the stock on November 19 in response to the strong earnings report. The Nvidia share forecast range shifted from $500-650 per share to $520-665 per share with the likes of Citigroup, Bank of America, UBS and Barclays raising their price targets.Analysts at Raymond James lifted their Nvidia stock forecast to $600 from $550 and reiterated their outperform rating in response to the company\u2019s quarterly results. The analysts stated: \u201cNVDA posted a strong quarter and guidance, beating guidance for 3Q meaningfully, mainly on the back of very strong gaming revenue associated with their new product ramp. 4Q guidance is also well above expectations, though it will be a 14-week quarter. The benefit of that extra week is however debatable, since the company remains supply-constrained on both gaming and data centre products.\u201d\u00a0They added: \u201cWe\u2019ve also heard some investor concern that Mellanox revenue is expected to decline Q/Q in 4Q due to Huawei, but we consider that to be simply noise.\u201d\u201cMost important to us is that NVDA continues to post revenue at a 50 per cent Y/Y growth rate, they still can\u2019t get enough product to satisfy all demand, and the reception of these new products \u2013 from gaming to training to inference \u2013 appears to be extremely strong. While the stock is not inexpensive at 50x our revised FY22 EPS, there\u2019s also no other company in our space growing at 50 per cent. With numbers going up meaningfully, we continue to be positive.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Analysts at Bernstein raised their Nvidia stock price forecast to $575 from $545, with an outperform rating. \u201cThe company continues to over-deliver on both key segments even in the midst of a pandemic, continued supply constraints, and potential data centre digestion environment.\u201dWhat is your view now, is NVDA stock a buy or sell?

However, with traditional trading you enter a contract to exchange the legal ownership of the individual shares or the commodities for money, and you own this until you sell it again.CFDs are leveraged products, which means that you only need to deposit a percentage of the full value of the CFD trade in order to open a position. But with traditional trading, you buy the assets for the full amount. In the UK, there is no stamp duty on CFD trading, but there is when you buy stocks, for example.CFDs attract overnight costs to hold the trades (unless you use 1-1 leverage), which makes them more suited to short-term trading opportunities. Stocks and commodities are more normally bought and held for longer. You might also pay a broker commission or fees when buying and selling assets direct and you\u2019d need somewhere to store them safely.\r\n \n Capital Com is an execution-only service provider.

NVIDIA promises a card that goes up against last-gen\u2019s $1,199 RTX 2080 Ti, and overall, it delivers on that. \n\n\nPage 4 \u2013 Power, Temperatures & Final Thoughts\n\n\nTo take a look at the RTX 3070 from a power and temperatures perspective, we rely on both rendering and gaming workloads to push the GPU. For rendering, we use the Classroom 2.8 project in Blender, and for gaming, we use UL\u2019s Fire Strike Ultra. Both tests are run for ten minutes, with their maximum wattage and temperatures reported. The power test is total system power pulled from the wall, using a Kill-a-Watt meter.\n\n\nAs we saw with both the RTX 3080 and 3090, both our render and gaming stress-tests draws about the same amount of power out of the RTX 3070 \u2013 which is to say, about 300W total platform. For a card that can deliver 4K/60 pretty easily in modern games, that\u2019s pretty admirable. While the 3070 doesn\u2019t definitively beat out the 2080 Ti in all cases, it does manage to come extremely close for about 50W less.\nWith regards to temperatures, all of these GPUs are keeping well within their top-end limits, but it\u2019s still nice to see powerful GPUs run cool. The RTX 3070 does well with that in gaming, when compared to the RTX 2080 Ti, shaving 9\u00b0C off. We don\u2019t intimately test noise because the environment doesn\u2019t allow for it, but at max load, we can easily say that the RTX 3070 is much quieter than the RTX 2080 Ti Founder Edition \u2013 mostly because the Ti can sometimes burst its fan to a noticeable degree at random times.\nFinal Thoughts\nThere are many angles to look at the RTX 3070 from, but ultimately, what NVIDIA has delivered here is undoubtedly impressive. We\u2019ve seen some folks in the community express their discontent due to the fact that the 3070 doesn\u2019t definitively topple the 2080 Ti, but the fact is, we\u2019re seeing a new $499 GPU that wages a successful battle for close to parity with last-gen\u2019s $1,199 offering.\nAn even more important comparison might be between the RTX 2070 SUPER and RTX 3070 \u2013 the battle of last-gen $499 GPU vs. current-gen $499 GPU. In that match-up, NVIDIA\u2019s latest proved to deliver anywhere between 30~45% better FPS, and we\u2019re not talking about synthetic tests, but real gaming tests. Add to that the fact that the Ampere generation brings even better ray tracing performance, we\u2019re happy to see what NVIDIA\u2019s brought to the table here.\n\nAs it stands today, NVIDIA is offering a ton of horsepower for the current-gen $499 price, and if you care at all about ray tracing, it seems likely that RTX GPUs are going to be the go-to for the next little while from either a performance or support standpoint. While AMD is going to be offering full DXR ray tracing support with its new Radeons, most of the games released so far have been developed with RTX in mind, so we\u2019d expect it to take a while before games are updated for better AMD support. And better support should definitely come, considering the new consoles exclusively use Radeon.\nIf you\u2019re not glued to one vendor or another, it may be worth waiting to see what AMD has in store with its launch in a few weeks, since its Radeon RX 6800 is set to do fierce battle with the RTX 3070. That assumes you\u2019ll even be able to find the 3070 in stock before then, because as you probably expected, those that hit the shelves fly right off of them again moments later. It\u2019s unfortunate, especially since we\u2019re in the midst of an exciting gaming season. Speaking of, if you\u2019re interested in Watch Dogs: Legion performance, we included the RTX 3070 in our performance article from last week.\nWhen the new Radeons get here, we\u2019ll be able to form much better impressions of the current stack from both vendors, but as it stands today, NVIDIA is offering a compelling option with the 3070. It\u2019s great for high-FPS 1440p and can deliver smooth 4K performance if you\u2019re willing to sacrifice the occasional high graphics setting.\n\n\n\n\nPage List:\nTop\n\n\r\n\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future)If Nvidia has things it's way, AMD's latest new performance-boosting technology for RX 6000 \"Big Navi\" graphics cards might not be a huge one-sided advantage, after all. \u00a0\u00a0According to a statement Nvidia gave to Gamer's Nexus, the company says it will soon enable a feature similar to AMD's Smart Access Memory (SAM) tech, which boosts data transfer efficiency between the GPU and CPU. In fact, Nvidia already has the feature working on its Ampere graphics cards in its labs.Additionally, Nvidia claims its feature will work equally well with Intel and AMD processors and can use the PCIe 3.0 bus, while AMD has already said that its solution requires an AMD Ryzen 5000 series processor, X570 motherboard, and Radeon RX 6000 GPU to work.\u00a0Nivida also suggests that AMD's feature, which it hasn't fully detailed yet, consists of adjusting PCIe's resizeable bar feature, which can be done on almost any modern motherboard if the manufacturer supports the option.\u00a0From NVIDIA, re:SAM: \u201cThe capability for resizable BAR is part of the PCI Express spec. NVIDIA hardware supports this functionality and will enable it on Ampere GPUs through future software updates. We have it working internally and are seeing similar performance results.\"November 12, 2020AMD says that Smart Access Memory allows the CPU and GPU to share information across a broader PCIe pipe, but the company hasn't divulged the details of the tech fully yet. AMD merely says that the CPU and GPU are usually constrained to a 256MB \u2018aperture\u2019 for data transfers. That limits game developers and requires frequent trips between the CPU and main memory if the data set exceeds that size, causing inefficiencies and capping performance. Smart Access Memory removes that limitation, thus boosting performance due to more efficient data transfer between the CPU and GPU.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: AMD)(Image credit: AMD)(Image credit: AMD)However, the feature looks akin to the PCIe resizable bar feature, a standard feature of the PCIe spec. Nvidia's statement surely suggests that the company feels likewise. If the GPU supports it, adjusting this setting in the motherboard BIOS essentially allows mapping of the full frame buffer, thus improving performance. \u00a0Image 1 of 6(Image credit: AMD)(Image credit: AMD)(Image credit: AMD)(Image credit: AMD)(Image credit: AMD)(Image credit: AMD)Nvidia says its hardware already supports the feature, though it will need to be enabled. Any PCIe-compliant CPU, be it\u00a0either Intel or AMD, should also be able to use the tech with Nvidia's graphics cards.\u00a0Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.That seemingly takes the shine off of AMD's requirement of an AMD GPU, CPU, and high-end X570 motherboard, especially given that Nvidia plans to enable its competing (yet similar) functionality on all platforms - Intel, AMD, and PCIe 3.0 motherboards included.\u00a0Nvidia says that its early testing shows similar performance gains to AMD's SAM and that it will enable the feature through future firmware updates. However, the company hasn't announced a timeline for the updates.\u00a0It certainly feels like Nvidia is trying to steal AMD's thunder. If Nvidia's Ampere silicon experiences similar gains from the Smart Access Memory-like tech, it will definitely complicate matters for AMD's push to create a walled all-AMD gaming PC garden.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more CPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nRadeon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (67)\n\n\n\nPaul AlcornSocial Links NavigationManaging Editor: News and Emerging TechPaul Alcorn is the Managing Editor: News and Emerging Tech for Tom's Hardware US.

Logically, the BAR should support enough address bits to let memory-mapped IO sit outside the maximum physical RAM address space at a bare minimum so memory-mapped IO don't carve usable space out of it. If the system allows a device to use up to half of the memory-mapped IO space, then the maximum BAR size might be 64GB on CPUs with 128GB max RAM.\n\nThere was a time where CPUs only decoded the lower 36bits of memory addresses and OSes used the MSBs to encode flags for internal use, which required kernel rewrites when address decoding got expanded to 40+bits. Chances are that all of the hardware necessary to support larger BAR sizes has been around since then.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncryoburner\n\n\nMurissokah said:If NVidia had this capability all along I feel this begs the question of why they had to wait for AMD to implement it.

Are there any drawbacks to doing so?\n\nIt's also possible that AMD's solution might cover more than just adjusting the PCIe BAR size though, and that might only be a part of it that affects existing games. I think it was suggested that games would have to be optimized for Smart Access Memory to get the most from it, so perhaps it also enables something like direct control over the contents of the \"infinity cache\" for example. Nvidia's performance gains from adjusting the BAR size alone might not be as large, though we just have speculation to work with for now.\n\nAs for Ryzen and RAM speed, that's not how it works. Ryzen's fabric matches the speed of system RAM, but isn't affected by VRAM, and applications are typically processing data stored in system RAM, not on the graphics card. And again, at least from what AMD has shown, the memory bandwidth of their 6000-series cards can effectively be far higher than GDDR6X for data that can fit inside the large 128MB block of L3 cache that they are calling the \"infinity cache\", which accounts for a relatively large portion of the GPU chip itself. That cache can hold the framebuffer, for example, allowing the GPU to perform operations on it much quicker and more efficiently than if it were stored in VRAM. I'm sure there will be some cases where having faster VRAM would be better, but this new cache is a large part of where AMD's performance and efficiency gains come from this generation, and it reduces the need for faster graphics memory.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhannibal\n\n\nMost likely the difference between pci 3.0 and 4.0 is the normal. Pci 4.0 has bigger bandwide so it can acces the memory faster than 3.0. I think that there were news that this has been working in Linux for some time.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvalidError\n\n\ncryoburner said:but this new cache is a large part of where AMD's performance and efficiency gains come from this generation, and it reduces the need for faster graphics memory.Modern games use GBs worth of assets to render a scene, a larger L3$ won't alleviate the need for more VRAM. All extra cache does is reduce the frequency of cache misses so the GPU as a whole can make better use of available VRAM and PCIe bandwidth. I also bet modern GPUs have far more pressing uses for L3$ than the frame buffer, such as all of the temporary data shaders need to pass around between passes.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmitch074\n\n\nThere was a comment on Phoronix forums a while ago about it and yes, it's about modifying BAR. This however requires BIOS and kernel support, and wasn't possible in Windows for quite a while.\nAMD enabled the feature on Windows when they had enough control to make sure it works, they never said it was a feature only they could support.\nYes, one could ask why Microsoft/Intel/Nvidia never came together to make it possible before... Oh wait.\nEdit: typo\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVforV\n\n\nInvalidError said:Got to love when one company brags about marketing brand-new features that are merely a firmware tweak away from getting matched by every other hardware manufacturer that has the necessary flexibility (maximum BAR mask size in this case) built into older products, just not exposed yet for whatever reason.So you're hating on AMD for bringing this forward, just because they brag about it? Sure, it would have been better to let this go, ignore it like nvidia did and we the gamers would have never had it... perfect reasoning.\n\nDoes it really matter if its a brag or easy to implement as long as NOW thanks to AMD we will get it on both of them?\n\nSome people have such a narrow mind... meh.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 67 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Flower\u2019s beastly 2800W power supply lands at $899 \u2014 enough juice to power a couple of RTX 5090 GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei's Microsoft Windows license for PCs expires this month, company launching PCs with Harmony OS: Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 50-series GPU scalping extends to system integrators \u2014 over $3,000 for a RTX 5090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO gets a $1 million salary plus $68 million in bonuses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNES consoles appear to run faster with age \u2014 APU frequency increased by up to 182 Hz after 35 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech giants call Trump tariffs 'big headache' \u2014 Foxconn CEO teases increased production in US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe week in chip news: Intel gets a new CEO, China chip smuggling, AMD dominates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi Pico powers $75 PicoCalc portable programming handheld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel's new CEO warns employees about 'tough decisions', but Wall Street cheers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI skips RDNA 4 and will not manufacture AMD Radeon 9000-series GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Structura Biotechnology\u2019s groundbreaking software is helping speed things along.\nThe GPU-powered machine learning algorithms underlying Structura\u2019s software power the image processing stage of a technology called cryo-electron microscopy, or cryo-EM, a revolutionary breakthrough in biochemistry that was the subject of the 2017 Nobel Prize in chemistry.\nCryo-EM enables powerful electron microscopes to capture detailed images of biomolecules in their near-native states. These images can then be used to reconstruct a 3D model of the biomolecules.\nWith cryo-EM providing valuable 2D image data, Structura\u2019s AI-infused software, called cryoSPARC, can quickly analyze the resulting microscopy data to solve the 3D atomic structures of the embedded protein molecules. That, in turn, allows researchers to more rapidly gauge how effective drugs will be in binding to those molecules, significantly speeding up the process of drug discovery.\nHundreds of labs around the world already use the three-year-old Toronto-based company\u2019s software, with a significant, but not surprising, surge during 2020. In fact, CEO Ali Punjani states that Structura\u2019s software has been used by scientists to visualize COVID-19 proteins in multiple publications.\n\u201cOur software helps scientists to understand what their proteins look like and how their proposed therapeutics may bind,\u201d Punjani said. \u201cThe more they can see about the structure of the target, the easier it becomes to design or identify a molecule that locks onto that structure and stops it.\u201d\nAn Intriguing Test Case\nThe idea for Structura came from a conversation Punjani overheard, during his undergraduate work at the University of Toronto, about trying to solve protein structures using microscopic images. He thought the topic would make an intriguing test case for his developing interest in machine learning research.\nPunjani formed his team in 2017, and Structura started building its software, backed by large-scale inference and computer vision algorithms that help to recover a 3D model from 2D image data. The key, he said, is to collect and analyze \u2014 with increasing accuracy \u2014 a sufficient amount of microscopic data to enable high-quality 3D reconstructions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a highly scientific domain with zero tolerance for error,\u201d Punjani said. \u201cGetting it wrong can be a huge waste of time and money.\u201d\nStructura\u2019s software is deployed on premises, typically on customers\u2019 hardware, which must be up to the task of processing real-time 3D microscope data. Punjani said labs often run this work on NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 GPUs, or something similar, while many larger pharmaceutical companies have invested in clusters of NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs accompanied by a variety of NVIDIA graphics cards.\nStructura does all of its model training and software development on machines running multi-GPU nodes of V100 GPUs. Punjani said his team writes all of its GPU kernels from scratch because of the particular and exotic nature of the problem. The code that runs on Structura\u2019s GPUs is written in CUDA, while cuDNN is used for some high-end computing tasks.\nRight Software at the Right Time\nGiven the value of Structura\u2019s innovations, and the importance of cryo-EM, Punjani isn\u2019t holding back on his ambitions for the company, which recently joined NVIDIA Inception, an accelerator program designed to nurture startups revolutionizing industries with advancements in AI and data sciences.\nPunjani says that any research related to living things can now make use of the information from 3D protein structures that cryo-EM offers and, as a result, there\u2019s a lot of industry attention focused on the kind of work Structura\u2019s software enables.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re building right now is a fundamental building block for cryo-EM to better enable structure-based drug discovery,\u201d he said. \u201cCryo-EM is set to become ubiquitous throughout all biological research.\u201d\nStay up to date with the latest healthcare news from NVIDIA.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: COVID-19 | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | Science | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The announcement comes at the start of\u00a0SC20, a supercomputing conference which takes place in\u00a0a different city each year, but this year is being held as a virtual event given the COVID-19 pandemic. \u00a0Nvidia calls the DGX Station A100 an \"AI appliance you can place anywhere.\" The box, measuring 25 inches high, 10 inches across, and 20 inches deep, comes with four GPUs, either existing 40-gigabyte A100 GPUs, or a newly unveiled 80-gigabyte version. It weighs 91 lbs, though fully outfitted, it tops out at 127 lbs. The total system has a maximum memory size of 320 gigabytes. More information is available in the spec sheet.   Nvidia touts the throughput of the 80-gigabyte version of A100 for large workloads.\u00a0   The A100 80GB also enables training of the largest models with more parameters fitting within a single HGX powered server such as GPT-2, a natural language processing model with superhuman generative text capability. This eliminates the need for data or model parallel architectures that can be time consuming to implement and slow to run across multiple nodes. \t \t \tThe A100 chips, based on Nvidia's \"Ampere\" GPU architecture, were first unveiled in May of this year.\u00a0   With today's announcement, the building of AI systems by chip makers is now officially a trend. Nvidia's box comes a year after startup Cerebras Systems unveiled a workstation-sized AI computer containing its WSE chip, the world's largest computer chip. At the time, Cerebras made significant mention of the size difference between its workstation computer and the data center pod needed to get equivalent super-computing power from Nvidia GPUs.   Such prowess, Nvidia hopes, will keep its systems at the top of the MLPerf benchmark tests for AI performance.\u00a0  Also: Nvidia intros new Ampere GPUs for visual computingAnother competitor, Graphcore, in July announced it would produce its first dedicated AI computer system, after initially only selling chips.   If 320 gigabytes of GPU memory is not enough for you, Nvidia also announced an update to its DGX A100, which is a 6U rack-mounted system. It now has the option of up to 640 gigabytes of GPU memory. The new DGX A100 is also expected to start shipping this quarter, Nvidia said. \u00a0   Nvidia has no plans to sell the computer system directly, it will rely on partners. Pricing is to be announced by partners later this week, Nvidia said.   Also: Nvidia Ampere, plus the world's most complex motherboard, will fuel gigantic AI modelsAlong with the new chip and the new system, Nvidia announced the newest version of its Infiniband networking technology from its Mellanox Group. The technology, in the form of switches, cables, adaptor cards, and the new \"data-processing unit,\" or DPU, daughter cards, run at 400 gigabytes per second.   One of the main accomplishments of the new spec, according to Gilad Shainer, Nvidia's head of networking technology, is that it is able to use copper wiring for lengths up to 1.5 meters, with optical transponders used beyond that. \"We were happy we were able to do copper at 400 gig at all,\" said Shainer in a media briefing.\u00a0   The new spec is not only faster but allows for greater interconnection of a greater number of devices, including connecting up to one million GPUs.   Nvidia's head of accelerated computing will give an address at SC20 today at 3 pm, Pacific time, which you can catch here.

Reports coming in from financial analysts suggest that NVIDIA had sold a huge chunk of its gaming Ampere GPUs to miners which might indicate why there's an immense shortage and why we won't see a proper retail supply till 2021.\nNVIDIA Sold $175 Million Worth of Ampere GeForce RTX 30 Series Graphics Cards To Miners, Claims Report\nAccording to Financial Analysts at RBC Captial Markets and Barrons, it is estimated that NVIDIA has sold at least $175 Million worth of GeForce RTX 30 graphics cards utilizing its Ampere GPUs directly to miners. NVIDIA reported a very strong 37% year-on-year growth in its gaming segment during its Q3 FY21 earnings report.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB MemoryThe company earned a revenue of $2.27 Billion for the gaming segment alone which means if we take out the mining revenue, the company actually earned $2.1 Billion in revenue from Gaming but NVIDIA reports mining sales within its Gaming segment. $2.1 Billion in revenue from Gaming alone still puts it as the top NVIDIA revenue segment in the outgoing quarter.\nFor the quarter in review, Nvidia sold at least $175 million worth of new generation GPUs to ethereum miners, helping the outperformance,\u00a0according\u00a0to a note from RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves. The analyst had guided sales to miners to come in at $150 million for the quarter.\nSteves noted that the upcoming network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, also known as Ethereum 2.0, which is scheduled to take place sometime in December, demands that miners switch over to more efficient mining hardware. Nvidia\u2019s new Ampere GPU chips are thought to meet that need.\nBitcoin (via TweakTown)\n$175 Million however is no small figure and that would mean a large chunk of GeForce RTX 30 GPU series which were dedicated for gaming purposes were sold out to miners. The demand from the mining community is on the rise as Bitcoin.com suggests that Ethereum V2.0 is just around the corner and as such demand for more efficient hardware has increased.\nIt was previously speculated prior to the GeForce RTX 30 series launch that we will see a resurgence in the mining segment, prompting higher demand for graphics cards & the subsequent shortages that we are witnessing today. NVIDIA selling directly to miners may have attributed to an immense shortage in the consumer market. This also suggests that NVIDIA could have had a better launch supply of GeForce RTX 30 GPUs, even more so than AMD (who still had an extremely sparse supply of RX 6000 series cards than what NVIDIA managed at launch).\n\nOver at the red team, several shops and retailers had boycotted the launch sales since they couldn't get their supply on time & are now suggesting supply to resume to normal by 2021. NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, has also released a similar statement regarding the GeForce RTX 30 series supply while NVIDIA's CFO recently stated that it will take a few more months for supply to catch up with demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nAll in all, it really sucks to be a gamer right now as both NVIDIA and AMD underestimated the huge demand for next-generation GPUs. Gamers who have ordered have been shown shipment dates as far as February 2021.\nNVIDIA and AMD could've taken their time to establish a bigger stock but they have been running behind 'Unprecedented Demand' as a means to tackle the backlash of one of the worst graphics card launches in terms of availability. With that said, we hope that 2021 can start off better for gamers all around the globe who just want a new graphics card to enjoy the latest gaming titles.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n137\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n84\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n78\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n52\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n49\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

It will work on any DXR-compatible GPU,\" Burke said. \"Nothing related to Cyberpunk 2077 ray tracing is proprietary to NVIDIA.\"Cyberpunk 2077 - PC Ray-Tracing Screenshots6 ImagesThis puts the rumours to bed that only Nvidia card owners would be able to experience Ray Tracing in Cyberpunk 2077. If you own a DirectX Raytracing-compatible GPU, regardless of its make, you'll be able to enjoy the shiny stuff in CD Projekt Red's next big game \u2013 although we know that some of the ray tracing effects will be exclusive to PC as a whole when the game launches.In other Cyberpunk 2077 news, CD Projekt Red's stock recently dropped by 25% in two months.

Both the game and GeForce Now's basic tier offer free access, although Nvidia limits these sessions to one hour.It is unclear whether playing via the cloud will put players at a disadvantage.Apple removes Fortnite developer from App StoreApple fires back in Fortnite App Store battleDeveloper coalition takes on Apple App StoreNvidia uses remote computer servers to process the players' commands and to generate graphics. Streaming the relevant data back and forth to the mobile devices introduces a very short delay.Winning or losing Fortnite's multiplayer battles can come down to split-second decisions, so lag could be a problem.Apple removed Fortnite from its App Store in AugustOne recent review of GeForce Now praised the platform's performance, but warned that there was an \"occasional degradation in the video quality\" and reports of \"spotty connection\" errors, even when tested on fast internet connections.Amazon already offers its rival Luna cloud-gaming platform to select \"early access\" iOS users, but does not include Fortnite in its current library of games.Google's Stadia cloud gaming service was briefly available to iOS users via an unofficial app, but it has since been removed from Apple's store and likewise did not support Fortnite.Microsoft is reportedly developing a version of its xCloud service for the mobile version of Safari, but it is not clear when it will launch.Developer coalition takes on Apple App StoreFacebook avoids Apple with cloud-gaming launchNintendo profits soar as games boom continuesBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.

That represents a considerable boost compared to lower-end Turing GPUs (the GTX 1650 Super offers 1,280 CUDA cores, the 1660 \u2013 and Super variant \u2013 have 1,408, and the 1660 Ti has 1,536).Power consumption for the RTX 3080 will sit at 90W, but bear in mind that this all remains speculation. Furthermore, obviously we don\u2019t have a full picture of purported specs yet, with clock speeds and memory configuration details missing, in terms of trying to guess at exactly how powerful the supposed RTX 3050 will be.Also, as Videocardz, which spotted the above tweet, points out, Nvidia doubled the number of CUDA cores per SM (streaming multiprocessor) with the Ampere architecture, meaning of course that comparing performance across Nvidia\u2019s GPU generations isn\u2019t quite as simple as it scaling linearly with more cores.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Exciting times?So in short, it\u2019s a complex picture with bits missing, but that hasn\u2019t stopped folks on Twitter getting excited about the prospect that this 3050 could give us something like the power of the RTX 2060 \u2013 the baseline card for ray tracing in the 2000 series \u2013 for hopefully a lot less cash. But as we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s way too early to be leaping to any conclusions (although we can but hope).Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3060 Ti will supposedly be the next Ampere GPU to be released, theoretically landing in December, with the vanilla RTX 3060, and both the RTX 3050 and its Ti version expected to arrive early in 2021 (the rumor mill reckons all three of those graphics cards will be here by the end of February, but take that with even more salt than the info in the rest of this story).Today\u2019s best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $39.99 $34.99ViewDeal ends Tue, Apr 1, 2025 $99.99 $79.99ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesFind the best Nvidia GPU for you\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

Jade platform advance Arm in high performance computing.\t\t\t\n\n\nNovember 17, 2020 by Dion Harris \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  In the past 18 months, researchers have witnessed a whopping 25.5x performance boost for Arm-based platforms in high performance computing, thanks to the combined efforts of the Arm and NVIDIA ecosystems.\nMany engineers deserve a round of applause for the gains.\n\nThe Arm Neoverse N1 core gave systems-on-a-chip like Ampere Computing\u2019s Altra an estimated 2.3x improvement over last year\u2019s designs.\nNVIDIA\u2019s A100 Tensor Core GPUs delivered its largest ever gains in a single generation.\nThe latest platforms upshifted to more and faster cores, input/output lanes and memory.\nAnd application developers tuned their software with many new optimizations.\n\nAs a result, NVIDIA\u2019s Arm-based reference design for HPC, with two Ampere Altra SoCs and two A100 GPUs, just delivered 25.5x the muscle of the dual-SoC servers researchers were using in June 2019. Our GPU-accelerated, Arm-based reference platform alone saw a 2.5x performance gain in 12 months.\nThe results span applications \u2014 including GROMACS, LAMMPS, MILC, NAMD and Quantum Espresso \u2014 that are key to work like drug discovery, a top priority during the pandemic. These and many other applications ready to run on Arm-based systems are available in containers on NGC, our hub for GPU-accelerated software.\nCompanies and researchers pushing the limits in areas such as molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry can harness these apps to drive advances not only in basic science but in fields such as healthcare.\nUnder the Hood with Arm and HPC\nThe latest reference architecture marries the energy-efficient throughput of Ampere Computing\u2019s Mt. Jade, a 2U-sized server platform, with NVIDIA\u2019s HGX A100 that\u2019s already accelerating several supercomputers around the world. It\u2019s the successor to a design that debuted last year based on the Marvell ThunderX2 and NVIDIA V100 GPUs.\nMt. Jade consists of two Ampere Altra SoCs packing 80 cores each based on the Arm Neoverse N1 core, all running at up to 3 GHz. They provide a whopping 192 PCI Express Gen4 lanes and up to 8TB of memory to feed two A100 GPUs.\nThe Mt. Jade server platform supports 192 PCIe Gen4 lanes.\nThe combination creates a compelling node for next-generation supercomputers. Ampere Computing has already attracted support from nine original equipment and design manufacturers and systems integrators, including Gigabyte, Lenovo and Wiwynn.\nA Rising Arm HPC Ecosystem\nIn another sign of an expanding ecosystem, the Arm HPC User Group hosted a virtual event ahead of SC20 with more than three dozen talks from organizations including AWS, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the Juelich Supercomputing Center, RIKEN in Japan, and Oak Ridge and Sandia National Labs in the U.S. Most of the talks are available on its YouTube channel.\nIn June, Arm made its biggest splash in supercomputing to date. That\u2019s when the Fugaku system in Japan debuted at No. 1 on the TOP500 list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers with a stunning 415.5 petaflops using the Arm-based A64FX CPU from Fujitsu.\nAt the time it was one of four Arm-powered supercomputers on the list, and the first using Arm\u2019s Scalable Vector Extensions, technology embedded in Arm\u2019s next-generation Neoverse designs that NVIDIA will support in its software.\nMeanwhile, AWS is already running in the cloud HPC jobs like genomics, financial risk modeling and computational fluid dynamics on its Arm-based Graviton2 processors.\nNVIDIA Accelerates Arm in HPC\nArm\u2019s growing HPC presence is part of a broad ecosystem of 13 million developers in areas that span smartphones to supercomputers. It\u2019s a community NVIDIA aims to expand with our deal to acquire Arm to create the world\u2019s premier company for the age of AI.\nWe\u2019re extending the ecosystem with Arm support built into our NVIDIA AI, HPC, networking and graphics software. At last year\u2019s supercomputing event, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang announced our work accelerating Arm in HPC in addition to our ongoing support for IBM POWER and x86 architectures.\nNvidia has expanded its support for the Arm ecosystem.\nSince then, we\u2019ve announced our BlueField-2 DPUs that use Arm IP to accelerate and secure networking and storage jobs for cloud, embedded and enterprise applications. And for more than a decade, we\u2019ve been an avid user of Arm designs inside products such as our Jetson Nano modules for robotics and other embedded systems.\nWe\u2019re excited to be part of dramatic performance gains for Arm in HPC. It\u2019s the latest page in the story of an open, thriving Arm ecosystem that keeps getting better.\nLearn more in the NVIDIA SC20 Special Address.\n\n\nCategories: SupercomputingTags: GPU Computing | High-Performance Computing | Parallel Computing | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The lineup will consist of the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, RTX 3060, RTX 3050 Ti, and the RTX 3050. In addition to all of these cards, NVIDIA will also introduce its GeForce RTX 3060 TI a month earlier in December as it's rival also ready mid-range cards based on the RDNA 2 graphics architecture.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, RTX 3060, RTX 3050 Ti, RTX 3050 All Set For A January 2021 Launch, Alleges Rumor - RTX 3060 Gets 12 GB & RTX 3060 Ti Gets 8 GB Memory\nAs per the rumor, NVIDIA has decided to push forward the launch of its mid-range and entry-level lineup in hopes to competitively tackle whatever AMD has to offer within its Radeon RX 6000 series stack of graphics cards. So in addition to the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti which is being designed as a rival to the Radeon RX 6900 XT, NVIDIA will also offer four mainstream mid-range and entry-level cards between December and January.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 'Rumored' Graphics Card Specifications\nDetails from Kopite7kimi suggest that the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti FE (Founders Edition) graphics card will feature the PG133-SKU15 PCB design and the GA102-250-KD-A1 graphics core. The GA102-250 GPU has also changed since the last time we saw them and is now exactly the same as the GeForce RTX 3090 at 10496 FP32 CUDA cores.\nAs for memory, the card will feature 20 GB of GDDR6X memory. Unlike the 19.5 Gbps speeds of the RTX 3090, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is said to retain the same memory speeds as the RTX 3080 at 19 Gbps. Since we are getting a 20 GB bus interface, NVIDIA will be using a 320-bit bus interface which equals a total bandwidth of 760 GB/s. TGP for the card is set to be the same as the RTX 3080 at 320 Watts. That's definitely needed to feed the extra cores so NVIDIA might have to optimize the clocks a bit here.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti 'Rumored' Graphics Card Specifications\nThe specifications for the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti feature the GA104 GPU which confirms that this is the second GPU to feature the said chip. There's no specific variant or SKU number mentioned but previous reports have hinted at the GA104-200 SKU for the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti. The GA104-200 GPU on the NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti graphics card features 4864 CUDA Cores, 80 ROPs, clock speeds 1410 MHz base, and 1665 MHz boost. Based on the specs, the card should deliver an effective compute horsepower of 16.2 TFLOPs.\n\nFor memory, the graphics card will feature 8 GB of GDDR6 memory which will be running across a 256-bit bus interface. The memory clock for the GDDR6 memory would be maintained at 1750 MHz or 14 Gbps effective which rounds up a total bandwidth of 448 GB/s. The pixel and texture fillrate are both reported at 133.2 GPixel/s & 674.3 GTexel/s, respectively. We expect the RTX 3060 Ti to land around $399 US in terms of pricing.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 'Rumored' Graphics Card Specifications\nThe GeForce RTX 3060 is suggested to feature the GA106-400 GPU which is expected to feature 3840 FP32 cores in a total of 30 SM units. The graphics card will make use of the PG190 SKU by board partners which are both GA104 and GA106 pin-compatible. The graphics card has seen a range of memory specs update starting with 6 GB (14 Gbps) and now listed at 12 GB (16 Gbps).\n\nReally? RTX 3060 will have 12GB GD6, RTX 3050 Ti will get 6GB.\ud83e\udd14\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) November 9, 2020\n\nIt is rumored that the card will feature a massive 12 GB memory buffer which is larger than that of the RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 3070, and even the RTX 3080. This is not confirmed yet but the reason could be that NVIDIA wants to really tackle AMD in the mainstream segment. Again, we saw rumors of 20 GB and 16 GB for the RTX 3080 & RTX 3070 too which didn't end up being true as they were early designs which were later on canceled. The card will feature a 192-bit bus interface and at 16 Gbps, deliver bandwidth of up to 384 GB/s. The GeForce RTX 3060 could end up being priced at $299 US which will make it a formidable graphics card that offers performance close to the RTX 2080 but with much higher memory capacity.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti 'Rumored' Graphics Card Specifications\nJust like the GeForce RTX 3060, the GeForce RTX 3050 Ti will also be featuring the GA106 GPU but a cut-down GA106-300 configuration. The card is expected to be based on the PG190 SKU 60 board which is different than the 40/50 variant that the RTX 3060 will utilize. The GPU is expected to come with 3584 FP32 cores in a total of 28 SM units.\n\nAh, the desktop cards based on GA106 will be called RTX 3060(3840FP32) and RTX 3050 Ti(3584FP32).\ud83d\ude05I don't know if it will change in the future.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) November 4, 2020\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3050 Ti is surprisingly going to feature a 6 GB GDDR6 memory interface too which is a big upgrade over its 4 GB predecessors. This suggests a 192-bit bus interface and we can also expect similar bandwidth numbers from the card if it ends up utilizing 16 Gbps memory dies. The green team could save some production costs and go for 14 Gbps memory dies here too. As for the pricing, the GeForce RTX 3050 Ti could launch around the $199-$249 US range.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 'Rumored' Graphics Card Specifications\nThe GeForce RTX 3050 is suggested to feature the GA107-300 GPU which seems to be the most entry-level Ampere GPU at this point in desktop graphics cards. Only time will tell if we will see something even lower-end like the GA108 GPU but the RTX 3050 leaves little room for that. The card is expected to feature 2304 FP32 cores in a total of 18 SM units and is suggested to feature a 90W TGP.\n\nRTX 3050, GA107-300, 2304FP32, 90W TGP\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) November 9, 2020\n\nThis would mean that the GeForce RTX 3050 will require an external 6-pin connector to boot unlike its predecessor, the GeForce GTX 1650, which conformed to a 75W TGP and didn't require any plug to boot in several custom variants. The GeForce RTX 3050 should feature a 128-bit bus interface & up to 4 GB of GDDR6 memory. We are likely to see speeds of 14 Gbps on the card but that remains to be confirmed. In terms of pricing, the GeForce RTX 3050 is expected to carry a sub-$200 US price of around $149 US.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere' Graphics Card Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA107Ampere GA107Ampere GA106-300Ampere GA104-200Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA104-400Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA102-225Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie SizeTBATBATBA395.2mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBATBATBA17.4 Billion17.4 Billion17.4 Billion28 Billion28 Billion28 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores2048?2560?358448645888614487041024010496\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs64 / 4080 / 48112 / 64152 / 80184 / 96192/ 96272 / 96320 / 112328 / 112\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores64 / 1680 / 20112 / 28152 / 38184 / 46192/ 48272 / 68320 / 80328 / 82\n\n\nBase ClockTBATBA1320 MHz1410 MHz1500 MHz1575 MHz1440 MHz1365 MHz1400 MHz\n\n\nBoost ClockTBATBA1780 MHz1665 MHz1730 MHz1770 MHz1710 MHz1665 MHz1700 MHz\n\n\nFP32 ComputeTBATBA12.7 TFLOPs16.2 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs22 TFLOPs30 TFLOPs34 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPsTBATBA25.4 TFLOPs32.4 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs42 TFLOPs58 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs69 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPsTBATBA101 TOPs129.6 TOPs163 TOPs174 TOPs238 TOPs273 TOPs285 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity4 GB GDDR6?4 GB GDDR6?12 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6X10 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus128-bit128-bit192-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory SpeedTBATBA15 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidthTBATBA360 Gbps448 Gbps448 Gbps608 Gbps760 Gbps912 Gbps936 Gbps\n\n\nTGP~75W~100W170W200W220W290W320W350W350W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$149?$199?$329$399 US$499 US$599 US$699 US$1199$1499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)2021?2021?February 2021December 202029th October 202010th June 202117th September 20203rd June 202124th September 2020\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, these are rumored specifications and these might change given how NVIDIA reacts to the upcoming AMD RDNA 2 'Radeon RX 6000' series announcements. The AMD Radeon RX 6700 series graphics cards are planned for a January 2021 launch too and we already know what they are going to look like and the specifications they will offer so it's going to be a heated winter this time in the mainstream graphics card segment.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n130\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n92\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n49\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n34\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1463\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1142\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The software uses a neural network to create a compact representation of a person's face. This compact representation can then be sent across the network, where a second neural network reconstructs the original image\u2014possibly with helpful modifications.\nNvidia says that its technique can reduce the bandwidth needs of video conferencing software by a factor of 10 compared to conventional compression techniques. It can also change how a person's face is displayed. For example, if someone appears to be facing off-center due to the position of her camera, the software can rotate her face to look straight instead. Software can also replace someone's real face with an animated avatar.\nMaxine is a software development kit, not a consumer product. Nvidia is hoping third-party software developers will use Maxine to improve their own video conferencing software. And the software comes with an important limitation: the device receiving a video stream needs an Nvidia GPU with tensor core technology. To support devices without an appropriate graphics card, Nvidia recommends that video frames be generated in the cloud\u2014an approach that may or may not work well in practice.\nBut regardless of how Maxine fares in the marketplace, the concept seems likely to be important for video streaming services in the future. Before too long, most computing devices will be powerful enough to generate realtime video content using neural networks. Maxine and products like it could allow for higher-quality video streams with much lower bandwidth consumption.\nDueling neural networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                A generative adversarial network turns sketches of handbags into photorealistic images of handbags.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Phillip Isola et al.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      A generative adversarial network turns sketches of handbags into photorealistic images of handbags.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n                      \n          \n          Phillip Isola et al.\n\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\nMaxine is built on a machine-learning technique called a generative adversarial network (GAN).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA GAN is a neural network\u2014a complex mathematical function that takes numerical inputs and produces numerical outputs. For visual applications, the input to a neural network is typically a pixel-by-pixel representation of an image. One famous neural network, for example, took images as inputs and output the estimated probability that the image fell into each of 1,000 categories like \"dalmatian\" and \"mushroom.\"\nNeural networks have thousands\u2014often millions\u2014of tunable parameters. The network is trained by evaluating its performance against real-world data. The network is shown a real-world input (like a picture of a dog) whose correct classification is known to the training software (perhaps \"dalmatian\"). The training software then uses a technique called back-propagation to optimize the network's parameters. Values that pushed the network toward the right answer are boosted, while those that contributed to a wrong answer get dialed back. After repeating this process on thousands\u2014even millions\u2014of examples, the network may become quite effective at the task it's being trained for.\nTraining software needs to know the correct answer for each input. For this reason, classic machine-learning projects often required people to label thousands of examples by hand. But the training process can be greatly sped up if there's a way to automatically generate training data.\nA generative adversarial network is a clever way to train a neural network without the need for human beings to label the training data. As the name implies, a GAN is actually two networks that \"compete\" against one another.\nThe first network is a generator that takes random data as an input and tries to produce a realistic image. The second network is a discriminator that takes an image and tries to determine whether it's a real image or a forgery created by the first network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe training software runs these two networks simultaneously, with each network's results being used to train the other:\n\nThe discriminator's answers are used to train the generator. When the discriminator wrongly classifies a generator-created photo as genuine, that means the generator is doing a good job of creating realistic images\u2014so parameters that led to that result are reinforced. On the other hand, if the discriminator classifies an image as a forgery, that's treated as a failure for the generator.\nMeanwhile, training software shows the discriminator a random selection of images that are either real or created by the generator. If the discriminator guesses right, that's treated as a success, and the discriminator network's parameters are updated to reflect that.\n\nAt the start of training, both networks are bad at their jobs, but they improve over time. As the quality of the generator's images improve, the discriminator has to become more sophisticated to detect fakes. As the discriminator becomes more discriminating, the generative network gets trained to make photos that look more and more realistic.\nThe results can be spectacular. A website called\u00a0ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com does exactly what it sounds like: it generates realistic photographs of human beings that don't exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      This person does not exist.\n              \nThisPersonDoesNotExist.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis person does not exist.\n\nThisPersonDoesNotExist.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      This person does not exist.\n              \nThisPersonDoesNotExist.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis person does not exist.\n\nThisPersonDoesNotExist.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      This person does not exist.\n              \nThisPersonDoesNotExist.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis person does not exist.\n\nThisPersonDoesNotExist.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis person does not exist.\n\nThisPersonDoesNotExist.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis person does not exist.\n\nThisPersonDoesNotExist.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      This person does not exist.\n              \nThisPersonDoesNotExist.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      This person does not exist.\n              \nThisPersonDoesNotExist.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      This person does not exist.\n              \nThisPersonDoesNotExist.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe site is powered by a generative neural network called StyleGAN that was developed by researchers at Nvidia. Over the last decade, as Nvidia's graphics cards have become one of the most popular ways to do neural network computations, Nvidia has invested heavily in academic research into neural network techniques.\nApplications for GANs have proliferated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Researchers used a conditional GAN to project how a face would age over time.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Grigory Antipov, Moez Baccouche, and Jean-Luc Dugelay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Researchers used a conditional GAN to project how a face would age over time.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n                      \n          \n          Grigory Antipov, Moez Baccouche, and Jean-Luc Dugelay\n\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\nThe earliest GANs just tried to produce random realistic-looking images within a broad category like human faces. These are known as unconditional GANs. More recently, researchers have developed conditional GANs\u2014neural networks that take an image (or other input data) and then try to produce a corresponding output image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, the training algorithm provides the same input information to both the generator and the discriminator. In other cases, the generator's loss function\u2014the measure of how well the network did for training purposes\u2014combines the output of the discriminator with some other metric that judges how well the output fits the input data.\nThis approach has a wide range of applications. Researchers have used conditional GANs to generate works of art from textual descriptions, to generate photographs from sketches, to generate maps from satellite images, to\u00a0predict how people will look when they're older, and a lot more.\nThis brings us back to Nvidia Maxine. Nvidia hasn't provided full details on how the technology works, but it did point us to a 2019 paper that described some of the underlying algorithms powering Maxine.\nThe paper describes a conditional GAN that takes as input a video of one person's face talking and a few photos of a second person's face. The generator creates a video of the second person making the same motions as the person in the original video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia's experimental GAN created videos that showed one person (top) making the motions of a second person in an input video (left).\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Ting-Chun Wang et al, Nvidia.\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Nvidia's experimental GAN created videos that showed one person (top) making the motions of a second person in an input video (left).\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Ting-Chun Wang et al, Nvidia.\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nNvidia's new video conferencing software uses a slight modification of this technique. Instead of taking a video as input, Maxine takes a set of keypoints extracted from the source video\u2014data points specifying the location and shape of the subject's eyes, mouth, nose, eyebrows, and other facial features. This data can be represented far more compactly than an ordinary video, which means it can be transmitted across the network with minimal bandwidth used. The network also sends a high-resolution video frame so that the recipient knows what the subject looks like. The receiver's computer then uses a conditional GAN to reconstruct the subject's face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA key feature of the network Nvidia researchers described in 2019 is that it wasn't specific to one face. A single network could be trained to generate videos of different people based on the photos provided as inputs. The practical benefit for Maxine is that there's no need to train a new network for each user. Instead, Nvidia can provide a pre-trained generator network that can draw anyone's face. Using a pre-trained network requires far less computing power than training a new network from scratch.\nNvidia's approach makes it easy to manipulate output video in a number of useful ways. For example, a common problem with videoconferencing technology is for the camera to be off-center from the screen, causing a person to appear to be looking to the side. Nvidia's neural network can fix this by rotating the keypoints of a user's face so that they are centered. Nvidia isn't the first company to do this. Apple has been working on its own version of this feature for FaceTime. But it's possible that Nvidia's GAN-based approach will be more powerful, allowing modifications to the entire face rather than just the eyes.\nNvidia Maxine can also replace a subject's real head with an animated character who performs the same actions. Again, this isn't new\u2014Snapchat popularized the concept a few years ago, and it has become common on video chat apps. But Nvidia's GAN-based approach could enable more realistic images that work in a wider range of head positions.\nMaxine in the cloud?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                           Patrick T.

Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nMaxine isn't a\u00a0consumer product. Rather it's a software development kit for building video conferencing software. Nvidia is providing developers with a number of different capabilities and letting them decide how to put them together into a usable product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd at least the initial version of Maxine will come with an important limitation: it requires a recent Nvidia GPU on the receiving end of the video stream. Maxine is built atop tensor cores, compute units in newer Nvidia graphics cards that are optimized for machine-learning operations. This poses a challenge for a video-conferencing product, since customers are going to expect support for a wide variety of hardware.\nWhen I asked an Nvidia rep about this, he argued that developers could run Maxine on a cloud server equipped with the necessary Nvidia hardware, then stream the rendered video to client devices. This approach allows developers to capture some but not all of Maxine's benefits. Developers can use Maxine to re-orient a user's face to improve eye contact, replace a user's background, and perform effects like turning a subject's face into an animated character. Using Maxine this way can also save bandwidth on a user's video uplink, since Maxine's keypoint extraction technology doesn't require an Nvidia GPU.\nStill,\u00a0Maxine's strongest selling point is probably its dramatically smaller bandwidth requirements. And the full bandwidth savings can only be realized if video generation occurs on client devices. That would require Maxine to support devices without Nvidia GPUs.\nWhen I asked Nvidia whether it planned to add support for non-Nvidia GPUs, it declined to comment on future product plans.\nRight now, Maxine is in the \"early access\" stage of development. Nvidia is offering access to a select group of early developers who are helping Nvidia refine Maxine's APIs. At some point in the future\u2014again, Nvidia wouldn't say when\u2014Nvidia will open the platform to software developers generally.\nAnd of course, Nvidia is unlikely to maintain a monopoly on this approach to video conferencing.\u00a0As far as I can tell, other major tech companies have not yet announced plans to use GANs to improve video conferencing. But Google, Apple, and Qualcomm have all been working to build more powerful chips to support machine learning on smartphones. It's a safe bet that engineers at these companies are exploring the possibility of Maxine-like video compression using neural networks. Apple may be particularly well-positioned to develop software like this given the tight integration of its hardware and software.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            How neural networks work\u2014and why they\u2019ve become a big business\n          \n\n            Neural networks have grown from an academic curiosity to a massive industry.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Listing image:\n    Nvidia\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimothy B.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCfor\u00a0Moor Insights and StrategyFollow AuthorNov 16, 2020, 09:00am ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.Today AMD announced its first data center GPU to compete in high-performance computing (HPC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Last year, the company announced that it would bifurcate its GPU technology into two architectures: CDNA for computation and RDNA for graphics. This approach is now coming to fruition and should allow the company to optimize chips for different workloads while still leveraging common elements. The new Instinct MI100 GPU is the first instantiation of the CDNA design. As such, it is an essential milestone in the company's journey to an exascale supercomputer platform for Frontier and El Capitan, projected for 2023. Let's dive in and see whether this chip will allow AMD to finally compete with NVIDIA, today's leader in HPC and AI GPUs.\n\nWhat is the MI100, and should NVIDIA be worried?\n\nThe new GPU is essentially a ground-up design focused on high performance and high memory bandwidth for HPC and, to a lesser extent, for AI. Like the NVIDIA A100, the AMD MI100 utilizes fast HMB2 memory (1.23 TB/s). However, it only supports four HBM2 dies (32GB) while the A100 supports five (40 GB). The new architecture includes Matrix Core operations, which sound similar to the Tensor Cores NVIDIA introduced in the Volta generation in 2017. Tensor Cores now support a wide range of precisions, while the Matrix Core appears to provide only support for 16- and 32-bit tensor operations. I suspect AMD will enhance these cores capabilities in the next-generation GPU, including integer and perhaps even 64-bit floating-point operations.\n\n\nAs Figure 1 shows, the MI100 performs admirably for traditional floating-point intensive applications. HPC centricity makes sense for now, given AMD's focus on that market for both CPUs and now GPUs.\n\nHowever, the NVIDIA A100 outperforms the MI100 for AI intensive workloads that typically take advantage of \"quantization,\" the utilization of lower precision formats and operators in tensor operations. I had many discussions with AMD about this data, and they correctly pointed out that the TF32 format, which only has the precision of FP16 (10 bits) is not the same as the IEEE standard FP32 format (23 bits). TF32 has 8 bits of mantissa, just like FP32. However, NVIDIA has not published FP32 FLOPS on Tensor Cores, only TF32, so that is the only comparison I can make for now. AMD also said that most customers it talks with have built models that use IEEE FP32 for training, not BFloat16 or TF32. That may be true\u2014however, in my experience, many HPC and AI implementation teams will refactor their code to take advantage of the massive performance increases that Tensor Cores and TF32 offer.\nFigure 1: The AMD MI100 has solid HPC performance, besting NVIDIA by some 18% at a lower price. But ... [+] in AI, where direct comparisons are difficult, NVIDIA still rules the roost.Moor Insights & Strategy\nI must note that NVIDIA also announced a new data center GPU product on the same day, which we covered here. This new version of the industry-leading A100 GPU supports 80 GB of HBM2e, which is twice the memory of the still-new A100 announced in May. This announcement widens the performance gap versus AMD, although at a higher price point.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nThere was no mention of any support for sparsity optimizations for the MI100, which could theoretically double AI models' performance. There was also no mention of GPU sharing, along the lines of the NVIDIA Multi-GPU Instance capability of the A100. This feature may become especially important for cloud service providers.\n\nNotably, the new chip supports the Infinity Fabric that AMD will use in exascale GPUs to improve CPU (EPYC) to GPU bandwidth and cache-coherent memory sharing. But there were no announcements of such a tightly integrated configuration for the MI100, at least not yet. Perhaps this feature could be activated when the next-generation EPYC (Milan) comes out next year, possibly by HPE's Cray with whom AMD has won two out of three US DOE exascale supercomputers.\n\n\nFinally, AMD shared a slide that claimed a 50% lower cost per FLOP than the A100 for HPC apps. The HPC performance described above is about 18% faster than NVIDIA, which would imply an aggressive list price of around $7200 by my math. That\u2019s a price that could help AMD get significant attention and traction.\nROCm Software: Ready for prime time\nSo, the new chip is an attractive HPC platform and a respectable chip for AI training workloads. But the challenge any NVIDIA competitor must address lies in the software needed to engender an ecosystem of AI models and applications. AMD has been developing its ROCm open compute offering for over three years. The new V4.0 release features the missing elements that can ease porting to AMD from NVIDIA. When combined with the MI100,\u00a0AMD claims it has delivered an 8X increase in throughput in two years.Figure 2: The ROCm software stack has matured to the point needed for full support for production AI ... [+] deployments.AMD\nSince AMD cannot directly support NVIDIA CUDA without incurring significant legal and technical risks, the ROCm approach relies on up-compiling CUDA to \"HIP,\" a higher-level parallel programming language, which is then down-compiled to a GPU. Ideally, this approach would entice developers to use HIP to create a single-source language that can be down-compiled to NVIDIA or other accelerators. While this is an elegant vision, it will take considerable time to be realized and will require significant AMD competitive advantage. After all, I would anticipate any major GPU installation would need to support both NVIDIA and AMD concurrently. Meanwhile, ROCm remains a viable porting and run-time platform to evaluate and deploy AMD GPUs, but customers may have to support two source code trees\u2014one for ROCm and one for CUDA.\nAMD also shared a few success stories for ROCm porting that are quite impressive. If customers can port a complex application in a half-day, I believe AMD will begin to see traction for its data center-class GPUs. However, QUDA took three weeks to port, probably due to deep exploitation of CUDA libraries.Figure 3: AMD has made significant progress with the ROCm software stack and can share a few ... [+] impressive success stories.AMD\nConclusions\nSo, given this analysis, should NVIDIA be worried about AMD's new entry into the data center? In AI, no. In HPC, yes. AMD\u2019s new GPU is an excellent stepping stone to its exascale platform. I expect AMD will be selected by price-sensitive supercomputer installations which may not have a tremendous need for bleeding-edge AI on the same platform in the short term. However, many or even most HPC users see AI as an integral part of the workflow these days.\nNVIDIA will remain unchallenged in AI-centric environments, for the time being, based on these early raw performance numbers and its new 80GB A100 just announced. Note that the performance data shared by AMD is limited to peak performance of mathematical operations. I will anxiously await application performance data such as mlPerf for AI to determine AMD's competitive strength. \u00a0\nIn the longer term, improvements in AI performance and a tighter Infinity Fabric interconnect with EPYC Rome could make AMD a significant competitive force. I have previously opined that this approach is one reason why NVIDIA needs to develop a data center-class CPU using Arm.\nMeanwhile, the Frontier and El Capitan applications' ecosystem now has an affordable on-ramp to AMD experimentation and support, especially if Cray creates a MI100/EPYC Rome platform in 2021.\nWelcome back to the party, AMD! It's great to have you back.\nDisclosure:\u00a0My firm, Moor Insights & Strategy, like all research and analyst firms, provides or has provided research, analysis, advising, and/or consulting to many high-tech companies in the industry, including AMD and NVIDIA.

The report comes from Expreview who has alleged that the graphics card will now be launching in early December which is around a month after the GeForce RTX 3070.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti 8 GB Graphics Card Now Allegedly Launching on 2nd December\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti was previously suggested to launch on 17th November but that has changed. It looks like NVIDIA has decided to move it to December now. This is not technically any delay of sorts since the card needs to be announced but since it hasn't, it doesn't change the fact that the card is still coming but only slightly later than what earlier leaks had mentioned. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti will be a mainstream offering in the GeForce RTX 30 series lineup and will sit right below the GeForce RTX 3070 for a price of around $349-$399 US.\nRelated Story Watch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For UnveilingNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Full Specifications:\nComing to the specifications, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti was submitted for validation by an anonymous user on 25th October. According to GPU-Z, the specifications feature the GA104 GPU which confirms that this is the second GPU to feature the said chip. There's no specific variant or SKU number mentioned but previous reports have hinted at the GA104-200 SKU for the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti.\nThe GA104-200 GPU on the NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti graphics card features 4864 CUDA Cores, 80 ROPs, clock speeds 1410 MHz base, and 1665 MHz boost. Based on the specs, the card should deliver an effective compute horsepower of 16.2 TFLOPs. These are also the default clock speeds for the card so it is likely that we are looking at a stock clocked variant rather than a custom design.\nNVIDIA will utilize a cut-down GA104 GPU for the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti graphics card.\nFor memory, the graphics card will feature 8 GB of GDDR6 memory which will be running across a 256-bit bus interface. The memory clock for the GDDR6 memory would be maintained at 1750 MHz or 14 Gbps effective which rounds up a total bandwidth of 448 GB/s. The pixel and texture fillrate are both reported at 133.2 GPixel/s & 674.3 GTexel/s, respectively.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere' Graphics Card Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA106-300Ampere GA104-200Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie SizeTBC395.2mm2395.2mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBC17.4 Billion17.4 Billion28 Billion28 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores358448645888870410496\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs112 / 64152 / 80184 / 96272 / 96328 / 112\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores112 / 28152 / 38184 / 46272 / 68328 / 82\n\n\nBase Clock1320 MHz1410 MHz1500 MHz1440 MHz1400 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock1780 MHz1665 MHz1730 MHz1710 MHz1700 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute13 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs30 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPs25 TFLOPs32 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs58 TFLOPs69 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPs101 TOPs192 TOPs163 TOPs238 TOPs285 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity12 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR610 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus192-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed16 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth384 Gbps448 Gbps448 Gbps760 Gbps936 Gbps\n\n\nTGP170W175W220W320W350W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$329 US$399 US$499 US$699 US$1499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)25th February 20212nd December 202029th October 202017th September 202024th September 2020\n\n\n\nAMD hasn't introduced its Radeon RX 6700 series cards which are to be the main competitor for this card. The Radeon RX 6700 XT and Radeon RX 6700 are likely to be positioned at around $449 and $349 US which will target the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti. Unlike the 8 GB VRAM on the RTX 3060 Ti, the AMD Radeon RX 6700 series is expected to feature 12 and 10 GB memory capacities which will certainly give them an edge at 1440p while the strong IPC lead over RDNA 2 is likely to push higher frames at both 1080p and 1440p resolutions.\n\nDo note that NVIDIA also plans to launch a cheaper GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card with 6 GB VRAM and 192-bit bus interface based on the GA106 GPU core but that is most likely coming next year.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n100\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n71\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n69\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n64\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n54\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

It is aimed at the mainstream segment around $400 US and will deliver performance faster than the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER while coming close to the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti with RTX & DLSS options enabled.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Graphics Card Specifications\nThe specifications for the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti feature the GA104 GPU which confirms that this is the second GPU to feature the said chip. There's no specific variant or SKU number mentioned but previous reports have hinted at the GA104-200 SKU for the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti.\nThe GA104-200 GPU on the NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti graphics card features 4864 CUDA Cores, 80 ROPs, clock speeds 1410 MHz base, and 1665 MHz boost. Based on the specs, the card should deliver an effective compute horsepower of 16.2 TFLOPs.\n\nFor memory, the graphics card will feature 8 GB of GDDR6 memory which will be running across a 256-bit bus interface. The memory clock for the GDDR6 memory would be maintained at 1750 MHz or 14 Gbps effective which rounds up a total bandwidth of 448 GB/s.

Compared to the GeForce RTX 3070, the RTX 3060 Ti is around 10% slower if we factor in custom models that will offer higher performance. The RTX 2080 Ti is much ahead with a 15% lead over the 3060 Ti and the RX 6800 is about 40% faster on average in Fire Strike and 25% in Time Spy.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Leaked 3Dmark benchmarks show 10% slower performance than RTX 3070. (Image Credits: Videocardz)\nThe RX 6800 retails for a $149 US higher price if we consider a $399 US price point as the official MSRP for the 3060 Ti. It will be interesting to see if this price to performance proposition is also similar in AMD's RX 6700 series mainstream performance offerings which will compete with the RTX 3060 Ti.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Geekbench Benchmarks\nTUM_APISAK has also discovered entries of the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti graphics card within the Geekbench database. The graphics card scores the following numbers in the various tests and results vary depending on the API used.\n\nRTX 3060 Ti - Open CL (GB5) - 123279\nRTX 3060 Ti - CUDA (GB5) - 133974\nRTX 3060 Ti - Vulkan (GB5) - 107979\nRTX 3060 Ti - OpenCL (GB4) - 326720\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe GPU was apparently tested by both ASUS and MSI, internally hence the Geekbench V4 and V5 benchmarks are based on different test setups. The MSI results are based on an AMD Ryzen 5000 platform while the ASUS results are based on an Intel 10th Gen Core i9 platform. In CUDA, the RTX 3060 Ti is 8% slower than the RTX 3070 while in Vulkan, for some odd reason, it's 10% faster and a whole 30% faster than RX 6800.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Mining Performance\nThe mining performance numbers for the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti were also reported at Chiphell. The card was adjusted to 120W which is a 60% reduction from its stock TGP of 200W while the memory was overclocked to an effective 16 Gbps (vs 14 Gbps reference). In Etherum, the graphics card was able to crunch 61 MH/s which is 10 MH/s higher than the Radeon RX 5700 (tuned to 160W). Mining performance seems to be pretty decent given the lower wattage but at the same time, these results may affect availability of the card as miners can flock to buy the card as RX 5700 series was affected by miners soon after launch too.\n\nThe GPU was running at clocks of 1440 MHz with the memory clock at 2000 MHz (16 Gbps effective) and temperatures were reported at 56C.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Ashes of The Singularity Benchmarks\nLastly, we have the Ashes of The Singularity benchmarks for the RTX 3060 Ti which were also first spotted by TUM_APISAK and Videocardz. At 1080p, the graphics card scores 7900 points in CRAZY preset. This is 14% lower than the RTX 3070 and 20% lower than the Radeon RX 6800. The same is the case with 4K where the RTX 3060 ti is 8% slower than the RTX 3070 and 24% slower than the Radeon RX 6800.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti is planned for launch on 2nd December and will be available in several custom variants at launch.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n147\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n120\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n74\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nA Mac Studio Cluster Of Four Units, All Featuring Apple\u2019s Latest M3 Ultra, Consume Less Than Half The Power Of A Network Switch When Running At Idle\n\n\n\n41\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n29\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n920\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

No problem \u2014 at least not for character concept artist Furio Tedeschi.\nTedeschi has worked on films like Transformers and Bumblebee: The Movie, as well as games like Mass Effect: Andromeda from Bioware. Currently, he\u2019s working on the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 video game.\nNo stranger to working while traveling, Tedeschi often goes from one place to another for his projects. So he\u2019s always been familiar with using a workstation that can keep up with his mobility.\nBut when the coronavirus pandemic hit, the travel stopped. Tedeschi had a workstation setup at home, so he adjusted quickly to remote work. However, he didn\u2019t want to be chained to his desk, and he wanted a mobile device that could handle the complexity of his designs.\nWith the Lenovo ThinkPad P53\u00a0accelerated by the NVIDIA RTX 5000 GPU, Tedeschi gets the speed and performance he needs to handle massive scenes and render graphics in real time, no matter where he works from.\nAll images courtesy of Furio Tedeschi.\nRTX-tra Boost for Remote Rendering Work\nOne of the biggest challenges Tedeschi faced was migrating projects, which often contained heavy scenes, from his desktop workstation to a mobile setup.\n\nHe used to reduce file sizes and renders because his previous laptop couldn\u2019t run complex graphics workflows. But with the RTX laptop, Tedeschi has enough power to quickly migrate his scenes without slowing anything down. He no longer has to reduce scene sizes because the RTX 5000 can easily handle them at full quality across the creative applications he uses to work on scenes.\n\u201cThe RTX laptop has made working on the move very comfortable for me, as it packs enough power to handle even some of the heavier scenes I use for concepts,\u201d said Tedeschi. \u201cNow I feel 100 percent comfortable knowing I can work on renders when I go back to traveling.\u201d\nWith the RTX-powered Lenovo ThinkPad P53, he gets speed and performance that\u2019s similar to his workstation at home. The laptop allows Tedeschi to see the models and scenes from every single view, all in real time.\nWhen it comes to his artistic style, Tedeschi likes to focus on form and shapes, and he uses applications like ZBrush and KeyShot to create his designs. After using the RTX-powered mobile workstation, Tedeschi experienced massive rendering improvements with both applications.\nWith KeyShot specifically, the GPU rendering is \u201cleaps faster and gives instant feedback through the render viewpoint,\u201d according to Tedeschi.\nThe faster workflows, combined with the ability to see his concepts running in real time, allows Tedeschi to choose better angles and lighting and get closer to bringing his ideas to life in a final image. This results in reduced prep time, faster productions and even less stress.\nWith Keyshot, ZBrush and Photoshop all running at the same time, the laptop\u2019s battery lasts up to two hours without being plugged in, so Tedeschi can easily get in the creative flow and work on designs from anywhere in his house without being distracted.\nLearn more about Furio Tedeschi and RTX-powered mobile workstations.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: NVIDIA RTX | Remote Work | Rendering \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The latest to join the party is Hyundai Motor Group which will have its entire lineup including the Genesis, Hyundai and Kia brands using the Nvidia Parker system-on-a-chip (SoC) by 2022.\u00a0\n\n\nThe move to Nvidia has already begun starting with the new 2021 Genesis G80 and GV80. These latest models from the premium Genesis brand are using the Parker SoC to drive a 14.5-inch widescreen display that sits atop the dashboard along with the user interface and applications that run on it. The high-resolution display can show up to three panes of information and the system features a new rotary controller interface in the center console.\u00a0\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz MBUX system that debuted a couple of years ago is also powered by a Parker SoC. The Parker SoC debuted in 2016 and was utilized as part of Nvidia\u2019s Drive PX2 development platform that was adopted by many of the startups in the automated driving sector. The PX2 used two Parkers and two Pascal GPUs.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen Tesla\nTSLA\n launched its Autopilot V2 system that year after their relationship with Mobileye came to an end, they utilized essentially half of the PX2 with a single Parker and Pascal chip configuration. In 2018, Tesla upgraded to V2.5 with a second Parker chip added to the board. In 2019, Tesla began using its own in-house developed chips for Autopilot in V3.\u00a0\nblock diagram of Nvidia Parker system-on-a-chipNvidia\nMORE FROM FORBES WHEELSA Bigger Tax Credit For Going Electric: What It Could Mean For ConsumersBy John O'Dell, ContributorBest Ceramic Coatings For 2021By Tara Hurlin, Contributor\n\n\n\nParker, like most Nvidia SoCs, is actually a combination of multiple different types of processors on a single silicon die. There are six ARM instruction set cores, four of which are standard Cortex A57 cores that are widely used by many chip companies. The other two are custom-designed Nvidia Denver 2 cores that are compatible with the ARM v8 instruction set. There is also a Pascal GPU with 256 Nvidia Cuda cores. The Pascal GPU micro-architecture is used in the Nvidia GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 video cards.\u00a0 Other elements of the chip include the input/output bus, security engine, video encoders/decoders, gigabit ethernet and LPDDR4 memory.\u00a0\n\nBy the end of 2021, Hyundai plans to start rolling out a new digital cockpit system that is also powered by these Nvidia processors and eventually a new in-house developed connected car operating system (ccOS). The ccOS will tie together a range of systems in the vehicle and make data available to third-party partners to provide new services to drivers.\nFollow me on\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Unless you pay a fortune for one from eBay, it might be wishful thinking. Another Nvidia executive has confirmed that demand for the cards is expected to far outweigh supply into 2021. \nAnyone who's tried and failed to buy an Ampere card since their release will doubtlessly be frustrated at what has become a familiar situation---the Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, Ryzen 5000 CPUs, and the newly launched Radeon RX 6800 series have all proved maddeningly difficult to get hold of, and things are unlikely to improve anytime soon.\nBack in October, Nvidia boss Jensen Huang said that demand for the latest RTX cards would outstrip supply through the year, a situation that would be made worse by the upcoming holiday season. \"The demand issue is that it is much, much greater than we expected,\" said the CEO.\n\nDon't do it!\nNow, Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress has echoed Huang's statement. \"Given industry-wide capacity constraints and long cycle times, it may take a few more months for product availability to catch up with demand,\" she said during an earnings call with investors this week.\nHuang, who also spoke on the call, suggested that Nvidia wasn't to blame. \"We would appreciate shorter cycle times. We would appreciate more agile supply chains. But you know the world is constrained at the moment. And so, we just have to make the best of it,\" he said. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\n AMD board partner says Radeon RX 9070 GPU supply will stabilize after April \n\n\n\nNvidia says the Ampere cards' supply issues are expected to last throughout the fourth quarter of its fiscal year, which ends in late January 2021.\n\nBitcoin's price over the last three months\nAnother factor that could make the situation even worse is the increasing price of Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is currently at just over $18,000, its highest value since 2017. With mining becoming more profitable, it could lead to a resurgence in demand for multi-GPU mining rigs. Additionally, Ampere cards are reportedly very popular with Ethereum miners. Back when Bitcoin last hit such high levels in late 2017, graphics card prices went through the roof for months.\nNvidia made $4.73 billion during the last quarter, an increase of 57 percent compared to the $3.01 billion brought in during the same period last year and up 22 percent compared to the $3.87 billion in Q2. It expects to generate $4.80 billion during the holiday season.\n\n\n\n\n 45 comments\n \n416 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Defender misidentifies key driver, disrupting popular PC monitoring tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

Nvidia's DLSS feature is better than ever these days: many implementations of the technology can give players tremendous performance upticks at little to no visual cost. Though it's only available in a handful of select games so far, that number has just increased by four today, as DLSS arrives across several new and existing titles. \nAs Nvidia's Andrew Burnes announced over on the official GeForce blog, the company's AI-based super sampling tech (an image renders at a lower resolution, and then gets upscaled to a higher one) is now available in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, War Thunder, Enlisted, and Ready or Not.\nWe'd need to extensively test each of these games to say how good their implementation of DLSS is, but we'll share some of Nvidia's performance claims \u2013 which you should take with a grain of salt, as we're not sure how they perform their benchmarks \u2013 now.\nFor starters, Black Ops Cold War is promising tremendous framerate improvements of up to 85 percent at 4K with ray tracing effects (ray-traced shadows and ambient occlusion) switched on. That takes the game from an uncomfortable 40 FPS on the RTX 2070 Super all the way up to a very playable 76 FPS with DLSS on.\n\nHigher-end GPUS, such as the RTX 3090 or 3080, enjoy much higher DLSS-powered max framerates of up to 124 FPS (about 113 for the 3080). Combined arms warfare title War Thunder's DLSS gains are quite a bit smaller, but it's also worth noting that the game doesn't feature any RTX tech. Regardless, you can expect performance to be \"accelerated\" by up to 30 percent here.\nSquad-based MMOFPS Enlisted (another combined arms title with infantry combat, tanks, and jets) is also an RT-free game, but it benefits from FPS gains of up to 55 percent at 4K. The game is already very playable across a wide range of GPUs, so DLSS is probably overkill: the 3090 bumps framerates up to 233 from 163. Even the humble RTX 2060 can already push a solid 60 frames, but with DLSS, it goes up to 98. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\n AMD FSR 4 is Very Impressive: 1440p Upscaling Tested \n\n\n\n\nFinally, we've got Ready or Not, which benefits from tremendous performance improvements with DLSS. The game is completely unplayable on lower-end hardware with ray-traced reflections, shadows, and ambient occlusion, but it becomes tolerable with DLSS. The 2060 can only handle a pathetic 15 FPS with RT features cranked up, but DLSS pushes that number up to 40. At the high end, we're seeing pre and post-DLSS numbers of 46.7 and 95.2 (respectively) for the 3090, and 39 and 86 for the 3080.\nOverall, the results are a bit of a mixed bag: some games see massive performance improvements, some get more modest increases, but in all cases, your FPS will improve materially with DLSS on in the above titles. It's worth noting that all of Nvidia's testing took place at 4K, so your mileage may vary at lower resolutions like 1080p and 1440p.\n\n\n\n\n 9 comments\n \n156 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nValve opens up SteamOS, a new Windows alternative?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHalf-Life 2 RTX demo arrives March 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

Now Nvidia\u2019s joined the party with its own Dynamic Boost, which aims to leverage the \u201cunused\u201d thermal budget in a laptop.\nFor example, if a laptop has a thermal budget of 115 watts with 35 watts for the CPU, and 80 watts for GPU\u2014why not take any additional power the CPU isn\u2019t using to increase performance when gaming?\n\nThat\u2019s the idea behind Nvidia\u2019s answer to AMD\u2019s SmartShift and Intel\u2019s Dynamic Power Share. How it works the company isn\u2019t detailing, but it is limited to DirectX gaming right now. We\u2019d guess Nvidia has created algorithms to dynamically jack up the GPU\u2019s power usage under certain loads, and dynamically gate the CPU\u2019s performance to the point where it doesn\u2019t injure the frame rate performance.\n Nvidia\nOriginally, it was thought the feature would only be brought to the GeForce RTX 2070 Super and GeForce RTX 2080 Super announced earlier this year. Nvidia tells us it can be supported on any Turing-based laptop\u2014but it\u2019s up to the laptop maker to implement it. The laptop should also be built around a shared heat pipe design, because dedicated heat pipes would mean there\u2019s no point to try to share.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe recently got a chance to see how just well it works on an Acer Predator Triton 500 configured with an Intel Core i7-10750H and GeForce RTX 2080 Super. The feature is on by default, but you can turn it on or off inside the Nvidia control panel. You can set it globally, and as an option to trigger on or off for particular applications as well.\n IDG\nTo try Dynamic Boost, we ran the laptop in its default cooling profile but turned off G-sync (which can make benchmark results a little wacky sometimes) and also set the laptop to always have the discrete GPU on. The laptop features a shared heat pipe design and at 18mm thick, making it the poster child for a shared boost technology.\n Acer\n\nWe used an Acer Predator Triton 500 with 6-core Core i7-10750H and Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super Max-Q inside of it to look at the Dynamic Boost feature.\n\n\nDynamic Boost Gaming Results\nTo test Dynamic Boost we ran the Predator Triton 500 through multiple games as well as a few synthetic graphics tests. We typically saw performance increases from 5 percent to 9 percent, which is inl line with Nvidia\u2019s previous claims about Dynamic Boost. We\u2019ve highlighted the percent change in green for performance boosts we consider worthwhile, yellow for results that probably fall within the margin of error, and red for decreases in performance. Yes, we said decrease, but you\u2019ll have to wait a bit longer to see why.\nLooking at the synthetics first, you get a taste for where Dynamic Boost is working the most. 3DMark\u2019s Port Royal, for example, is a ray tracing benchmark that\u2019s particularly intensive for GPUs. There we see a 9.4-percent advantage with Dynamic Boost.\n\n IDG\n\nNvidia\u2019s Dynamic Boost feature works best on very graphically intense gaming loads.\n\n\nWhen we step back to 3DMark\u2019s Time Spy, we can see a 7.9-percent increase in performance on the graphics side but a slight decrease in the physics. Why? 3DMark is benchmark created to measure 3D gaming performance, breaking down its tests into graphics and then a physics test. Each test uses the CPU, of course, but the scoring is constructed to ignore CPU performance for the graphics portion but score it higher for the physics test.\u00a0\nWhile Time Spy isn\u2019t as harsh as Port Royal, it\u2019s still a fairly heavy graphics test. You can\u2019t say the same for 3DMark Sky Diver. Sky Diver is like Time Spy with both a graphics test, and a physics test. But unlike Time Spy, it\u2019s made to see how well a laptop with integrated graphics can play games. In its graphics test, we actually see a fairly decent 8.5-percent boost but the physics test actually sees its score drop by 6.6 percent.\nNvidia said it was unable to reproduce our results, but we suspect Dynamic Boost\u2019s clamp on the CPU\u2019s was just enough to cause a drop in Sky Diver\u2019s Physics test.\nThe harsher the load, the better Dynamic Boost works\nGames don\u2019t typically work like a synthetic test. The CPU and GPU behavior is affected by a stew of unknowns that is prone to change. Still, we do see a similar pattern as 3DMark\u2019s where games that are largely bottlenecked by GPU performance seem to gain the most.\n\nFor example, the fully path traced\u00a0Quake II RTX gives us a 9.4-percent increase with Dynamic Boost on. Metro Exodus with its DirectX Ray Tracing support flipped on gives us 8 percent. Strange Brigade\u00a0coughs up 7.4 percent with other games, such as Shadow of the Tomb Raider, giving us \u201conly\u201d 5 percent gains.\nAgain, Nvidia doesn\u2019t say how Dynamic Boost works, but the results suggest that the gains are tied to just how much a game leans on the GPU performance and CPU performance. Sometimes, both can be fairly balanced, such as\u00a0Far Cry New Dawn and Rise of the Tomb Raider.\u00a0\nWe tried to look into that by using the same game set to its maximum image quality and its lowest image quality settings. The results mostly matched up.\nStrange Brigade\u00a0on its highest setting yields about 7.4 percent, but set it to its lowest graphics setting which should make the game less reliant on the GPU, we saw the performance increase drop to 4.2 percent.\n\nWe also saw that with Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which \u201conly\u201d gives us 5.1 percent on its highest setting using DXR\u2014but on its lowest setting, performance is basically the same with Dynamic Boost.\nWe see the same thing with Metro Exodus, but in one of the few cases, performance goes from an 8 percent-increase to 5-percent decrease. We\u2019re again going from a heavy, heavy GPU load with ray traced global illumination and frame rates in the 50-fps range, to frame rates in the 160 to 170 range with the game at to its lowest quality setting. Nvidia officials said they were looking into this one decrease in performance but when the GPU isn\u2019t the bottleneck, you\u2019re now more at the mercy of the CPU\u2019s boost clocks which just might throw everything out of whack on occasion.\nThis isn\u2019t a deal breaker to us, because it was the one title that exhibited it. We also think few will play a game that showcases all of the advanced graphics bells and whistles with them turned off. And as we said, even games that you would play at high frame rates didn\u2019t lose performance. The CPU-heavy Counter Strike: Global Operations was within the margin of error and didn\u2019t gain anything from boosting the GPU\u2019s clock speeds. One result we do want to show is for\u00a0Red Dead Redemption II. The game exhibited a pretty huge increase of 14 percent by switching on Dynamic Boost.\nWhile our results are real, Nvidia hasn\u2019t claimed double-digit performance increase at all. Our 14-percent increase might come from running the game using the DirectX12 API rather than using the Vulkan API which the game defaults to. Basically don\u2019t expect that huge of a gain most of the time.\n\nFinally, we sorted our results from the best gains to the worst. This makes it easier to see that the more graphically intense the load is, the more performance you get.\n IDG\n\nSorted by performance gains, you can see that Dyanmic Boost performance gains generally skews toward graphics-heavy settings with results diminishing as you get to lighter loads.\u00a0\n\n\nHere\u2019s how Dynamic Boost looks\nNvidia has said Dynamic Boost increases the GPU thermal budget by 15 watts, and that looks to largely be true. We used HWInfo to log GPU and CPU during runs to see if that was occurring or not. Below you can see a 3Dmark Time Spy run and how much wattage is consumed by the graphics chip. The first hump is during the graphics portion, with the second portion showing the physics portion of the test. The blue is the wattage the GeForce RTX 2080 Super Max-Q uses on the Predator Triton 500 with Dynamic Boost off, while green is with Dynamic Boost on.\n IDG\n\nYou can see with Dynamic Boost on that the GeForce RTX 2080 power consumption goes from 80 watts to 95 watts.\n\n\nLooking at the wattage of the CPU during the same 3DMark run you can see the CPU\u2019s power consumption in blue is indeed lowered from the mid 20s to the low teens during the graphics portion of the test. Its power budget is also reduced during the physics test.\n IDG\n\nYou can see the CPU\u2019s power consumption is reduced with Nvidia\u2019s Dynamic Boost on (green) versus when it\u2019s off (blue).\n\n\nWe also wanted to look at GPU power during a gaming run so we also recorded it during Metro Exodus with the ray tracing features turned on. You can see that it mostly matches 3DMark, with the GPU given 15 watts more during the three distinctive runs of the built-in benchmark in Metro.\n\n IDG\n\nDynamic Boost on (green) vs. Dynamic Boost off (blue)\n\n\nMoving on to the CPU, we can see that the CPU\u2019s is running with a budget of just under 20 watts with Dynamic Boost on. With Dynamic Boost off, the CPU would use about 45 watts of the thermal budget.\n IDG\n\nDynamic Boost on during Metro Exodus gates the CPU\u2019s to under 20 watts instead of 45 watts.\n\n\nTo see how much clock speed the CPU lost while limited to under 20 watts, we looked at that with Dynamic Boost on and off. Below you can see where the CPU\u2019s clock speed takes maybe a 100MHz hit throughout the three benchmark runs.\n IDG\n\nThe CPU runs at a slightly slower clock speed when Dynamic Boost is on.\n\n\nGetting back to our previous talk about just what happens when you crank a game from its most intensive graphics settings to its lowest, we did that for Metro. Comparing it to the Metro run with all the bells and whistles on, the low setting shifts more of the burden to the CPU.The clock speeds are very close overall, but you can see the second and third humps representing the 2nd and 3rd runs are at a lower clock speed. The clock speeds throughout the runs are also closer to about 2GHz, which is about 600MHz to 700MHz higher than when the game is mostly GPU.\n IDG\n\nSet to its low setting, Metro sees the CPU running at much higher clock speeds.\n\n\nConclusion\nGoing forward, Nvidia will find itself jostling for attention between AMD and Intel, as both rivals offer proprietary power sharing routines likely closed off to Nvidia. AMD\u2019s own SmartShift also promises single-digit performance gains, and we\u2019ve seen that in some of the testing we\u2019ve done (Our long overdue look at SmartShift is in the works.)\n\nWhile AMD is likely to squeeze Nvidia on the mid-range and up (we\u2019d imagine with mobile parts based on its RDNA2), Intel is likely to squeeze Nvidia on the entry level with its own Dynamic Power Share with Xe Max GPUs and 11th-gen CPUs.\nThrough this prism, we can say that Dynamic Boost is overall pretty impressive nonetheless. Using what looks like mostly software technology, Nvidia is able to squeeze very solid performance gains even though it lacks the keys to control the CPU as deeply as AMD or Intel would.\nWhat the smart-shifting-sharing world looks like in 12 months, though, is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Autodesk plans to add Omniverse compatibility to its full suite of design products.\nImage Courtesy of KPF\n\n\n\nNovember 12, 2020\n\n\n\nThe frustrations of working on complex design files across multiple software platforms are real, and have only been compounded as BIM files grow in size and complexity. Architects and engineers, working in Revit, Tekla, Grasshopper and other design tools often end up\u00a0spending extra\u00a0time to ensure data imported and exported between these platforms transfers smoothly.\nIn an effort to create a common environment for design visualizations, Autodesk has partnered with Nvidia to bring its broad suite of design software to Nvidia's Omniverse, a recently launched collaborative 3D environment that allows users of different software to see their 3D designs in one shared online space. Using Nvidia\u2019s RTX\u00a0technology and built upon Pixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description (USD) format and Nvidia\u2019s open-source Material Definition Library (MDL), Omniverse can fully display the live building models in real-time, drawing data from a range of applications in real-time. This allows collaboration between users across the world and among different design software applications.\n\u201cA lot of our customers don\u2019t use Autodesk software exclusively,\u201d says Amy Bunszel, senior vice president of design and construction products at Autodesk. While many Autodesk products already have the ability to send data back and forth, they lacked a single, online visualizer. Omniverse will allow for even competing design software to be used in the same shared space as Autodesk\u2019s suite, without any additional work to import or export design files.\u00a0\nWhile Omniverse was not purpose-built for design and engineering, Nvidia decided it would be useful to industries other than entertainment and media, particularly during the remote work situations of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cIt works in different markets. We now have this common platform to bring out to all our [industries],\u201d says Richard Kerris, Nvidia general manager for media and entertainment.\u00a0\nOmniverse runs on Nvidia\u2019s RTX technology, which allows for a level of real-time 3D visualization with ray-tracing for realistic simulations of building lighting conditions. \u201cWith this we can simulate reality with physics and real-world lighting and rendering, and it allows collaborators to work across the room or the globe, as it all runs in the cloud,\u201d explains Kerris.\nPromising Results\nThe Omniverse platform recently entered into open beta\u00a0for other industries, but so far only a few select architects and engineers have had access to its AEC software features. Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates has been running its own internal tests of Omniverse\u00a0and so far the results have been promising, according to Cobus Bothma, director of applied research at KPF. \u201cWe can have two to three offices working on one project, and now they can collate these large data sets and visualize them much more accurately.\u201d\nBothma\u00a0has had teams\u00a0working on the same model in Omniverse with users in different applications, allowing for different disciplines to better test out ideas in real time. \u201cWe have two very large Revit files running live, with Rhino and Grasshopper [instances] as well. It\u2019s important for us to have multiple applications.\u201d Working in Omniverse, the different teams can make live adjustments to the model in the software they know, while \u201cthe left-hand side is a working view, not a render, in real-time,\u201d explains Bothma.\u00a0KPF has also tested the remote collaboration features of Omniverse, with offices around the world logging in to work on the same model. \u201cWe have tested connections from New York to London. We\u2019ve had Revit and Rhino running off machines in my house and in offices. Everything is dislocated, nothing is on a LAN or closed network.\u201d\nWhile KPF has only taken the first steps to using Omniverse on real projects, Bothma\u00a0says he expects the time savings from not having to build connections between different software packages will be huge. \u201cWith one airport project\u2014put on hold for COVID\u2014we had to spend two to three weeks optimizing and writing scripts to get it into a virtual environment for the client to navigate.\u201d But with Omniverse doing the heavy lifting, that work could be eliminated. \u201cPushing 15 million polygons is not difficult\u00a0for Nvidia, so that cuts two to three weeks off of our optimization,\u201d he says.\u00a0\nWhile Bothma\u00a0is primarily using Omniverse with powerful PC workstations to run the design software, there is also potential to let users on less-powerful devices log into the session and contribute as well. \u201cWe could stream this big Revit model, 12 to 14 million polygons, to devices like iPhones or iPads,\u201d he says. \u201cReal-time renderers have changed the way we work in the last few years, but it\u2019s still very centralized. This definitely will change the way we work, with so many more people able to work on it and make decisions.\u201d\nNvidia Omniverse for AEC\u00a0is currently open for pre-registration for users, with the full platform expected to be available later in the fall.\n\n\nKEYWORDS:  Autodesk Design Software Nvidia Omniverse Revit\n\n\nShare This Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\nJeff Rubenstone is Deputy Editor for News and Technology at the Engineering News-Record.

NVIDIA has supported it with hardware-based accelerated RT cores since the launch of Turing and eve extended support back to the Pascal generation through driver updates that enabled the function despite those cards not having hardware accelerators. With the upcoming release of the next-gen consoles and Radeon's RX 6000 Series the talk of Ray Traced effects in games has taken even more of center stage, but it's also raising some questions among consumers and enthusiasts.\n\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostWe recently reported on the statement by AMD regarding their support for ray tracing and what games they are planning to support. We've included that statement here so you don't have to go running off in case you missed it.\nAMD will support all ray tracing titles using industry-based standards, including the Microsoft DXR API and the upcoming Vulkan raytracing API. Games making of use of proprietary raytracing APIs and extensions will not be supported.\nAMD Marketing via\u00a0AdoredTV\nThe part of that quote that seems to have caught the most eyes was the portion regarding 'proprietary raytracing APIs and extensions' leading to many repeats. This seemed odd since we just got word through Tom's Hardware that Intel was working on support for Khronos' open-source ray tracing extension but will consider using NVIDIA's extension if more developers start using it. So, it doesn't seem as proprietary if Intel can use it if they want? Time for some answers. I reached out to Brian Burke, NVIDIA PR Gaming Technology, Esports & Consumer VR, for some clarification. and this is how it went.\nWhat ray tracing games are out now that use NVIDIA proprietary technology?\nBrian: The vast majority of games released with ray tracing support use the industry standard Microsoft DirectX Ray Tracing (DXR) API.\u00a0 Three exceptions we are aware of include\u00a0Quake II RTX,\u00a0Wolfenstein: Youngblood,\u00a0and\u00a0JX3,\u00a0which use NVIDIA ray tracing extensions for Vulkan.\nDoes NVIDIA support the use of proprietary methods to add ray tracing support to games?\nBrian: We support the use of industry standard APIs, such as DXR and the upcoming Vulkan Ray Tracing extension.\u00a0 Ahead of the release of the official Vulkan Ray Tracing extension, NVIDIA has enabled Vulkan developers to implement ray tracing via an NVIDIA extension.\nWhy did NVIDIA use extensions that will only work on NVIDIA GPUs in\u00a0Quake II,\u00a0Wolfenstein: Youngblood\u00a0and\u00a0JX3?\nBrian:\u00a0We believe in rapid innovation and open standards working together. At the time these early adopter games\u00a0were being developed, the Vulkan working group had not yet released any specifications, and so shipping a vendor extension was the only way to enable these developers and bring ray tracing to our customers. It also helped gather feedback for the Khronos discussions. Shipping an early vendor extension is a common step in the standardization process.\nWhat does that process look like?\u00a0\nBrian: The creation of every open standard proceeds through a number of steps as that functionality gains wider industry support. Vulkan proves new functionality as extensions before integration in the standard. For significant new areas of the API it is common for the first hardware vendor with that functionality to ship a vendor extension to provide early exposure and gather developer feedback. When multiple hardware vendors become interested in creating a cross-vendor standard for the new functionality, Khronos provides a well proven process for those companies to cooperate and develop an open standard Khronos or \u2018KHR\u2019 API extension. For significant new functionality, Khronos often chooses to distribute a provisional version of a KHR extension to enable industry feedback in parallel with finalizing the specification and conformance tests. When the specification has incorporated all industry feedback, a final version of the KHR extension is released together with conformance tests, so that any hardware vendor implementing the specification can become officially conformant for reliable cross-vendor operation.\nThe evolution of Vulkan Ray Tracing followed all of these steps, including NVIDIA shipping its Vulkan ray tracing vendor extension, which was a necessary first step in enabling early access for developers and gathering the first round of developer feedback.\nIs NVIDIA putting up any roadblocks, either through publishers or the Khronos Group, that would prevent AMD from adding ray tracing support to\u00a0Quake II,\u00a0Wolfenstein: Youngblood\u00a0and\u00a0JX3\u00a0\u00a0if they choose to?\nBrian: Absolutely not.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been contributing to the growth of the RT ecosystem for years and welcome other IHVs to add support.\nWhat work did NVIDIA do to bring ray tracing support to Vulkan?\nBrian: Bringing ray tracing into Vulkan has been a multi-year effort by many companies and NVIDIA has taken an active leadership position in each stage of its evolution. We were elected to chair the Vulkan ray tracing subgroup at Khronos, we contributed the design of our vendor extension to Khronos to help the Vulkan working group make rapid progress, and we shipped drivers for the provisional version of the Vulkan ray tracing extension to enable developer feedback for the subgroup. Plus, we intend to ship drivers for the final version of the KHR extension on the same day as the specification is released by Khronos.\nWill DXR games work on AMD GPUs?\nBrian: DirectX Ray Tracing is an API defined by Microsoft for any hardware vendor to implement. Games built using DXR should work on any DXR-compatible GPU.\u00a0 NVIDIA cannot speak to other IHV\u2019s support plans for DXR.\nI have seen stories that say that\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077\u00a0ray tracing will only work on NVIDIA GPUs. Why is that?\nBrian: Cyberpunk 2077\u00a0uses the industry standard DirectX Ray Tracing API. It will work on any DXR-compatible GPU. Nothing related to\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077\u00a0ray tracing is proprietary to NVIDIA.\nThank you for your time today.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n90\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n62\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n26\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n20\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n15\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

They\u2019re smarter and support a greater variety of workloads, too.\nNearly 70 percent of the machines, including eight of the top 10, on the latest TOP500 list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers, released today at SC20, are powered by NVIDIA technology.\nIn addition, four of the nominations for the Gordon Bell Prize, supercomputing\u2019s most prestigious award \u2014 to be named this week at SC20 \u2014 use AI to drive their discoveries.\nThe common thread: our end-to-end HGX AI supercomputing platform, which accelerates scientific computing, data analytics and AI workloads. It\u2019s a story that begins with a great chip and extremely fast, smart networking, but ultimately is all about NVIDIA\u2019s globally adopted data-center-scale platform for doing great science.\nThe shift to incorporating AI into HPC, and a platform that extends beyond traditional supercomputing centers, represents a significant change in a field that, since Seymour Cray\u2019s CDC 6600 was launched in 1964, has focused on harnessing ever larger, more powerful machines for compute-intensive simulation and modeling.\nThe latest TOP500 list is about more than high-performance Linpack results:\n\nSpeed records: Measured by the traditional benchmark of supercomputing performance \u2014 the speed it takes to do operations in a double-precision floating-point format called FP64 \u2014 NVIDIA technologies accelerate the world\u2019s fastest clusters, powering eight of the top 10 machines. This includes the No. 5 system \u2014 NVIDIA\u2019s own Selene supercomputer, the world\u2019s most powerful commercial system \u2014 as well as new additions like JUWELS (Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich) at No. 7 and Dammam-7 (Saudi Aramco) at No. 10.\n\u201cSmarts\u201d records: When measured by HPL-AI, the mixed-precision standard that\u2019s the benchmark for AI performance, NVIDIA-powered machines captured top spots on the list with Oak Ridge National Lab\u2019s Summit supercomputer at 0.55 exaflops and NVIDIA Selene at 0.25 exaflops.\nGreen records: The NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD system captured the top spot on the Green500 list of most efficient supercomputers, achieving a new world record in power efficiency of 26.2 gigaflops per watt. Overall, NVIDIA-powered machines captured 26 of the top 30 spots on the list.\n\nThe Era of AI Supercomputing\u00a0 Is in High Gear\nMaybe the most impressive achievement: We\u2019ve surpassed exascale computing well ahead of schedule.\nIn October, Italy\u2019s CINECA supercomputing center unveiled plans to build Leonardo, the world\u2019s most powerful AI supercomputer with an expected 10 exaflops of AI performance. It\u2019s joined by a wave of new EuropHPC AI systems in the Czech Republic, Luxembourg and Slovenia. More are coming not only in Europe but also across Asia and North America.\nThat\u2019s because modern AI harnesses the incredible parallel processing power of NVIDIA GPUs, NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries and NVIDIA Mellanox InfiniBand \u2014 the world\u2019s only smart, fully accelerated in-network computing platform \u2014 to pour vast quantities of data into advanced neural networks, creating sophisticated models of the world around us. This lets scientists tackle much more ambitious projects than would otherwise be possible.\nTake the example of the team from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\u2019s Computational Research Division, one of this year\u2019s Gordon Bell Prize nominees. Thanks to AI, the team was able to increase the scale of their molecular dynamics simulation by at least 100x compared to the largest system simulated by previous nominees.\nIt\u2019s About Advancing Science\nOf course, it\u2019s not just how fast your system is, but what you do with it in the real world that counts.\nThat\u2019s why you\u2019ll find the new breed of AI-powered being thrown into the front-line of the fight against COVID.\nThree of the four of the nominees for a special Gordon Bell award focused tackling the COVID-19 pandemic rely on NVIDIA AI.\nOn the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\u2019s Sierra supercomputer \u2014 No. 3 on the TOP500 list \u2014 a team trained an AI able to identify new drug candidates on 1.6 billion compounds in just 23 minutes.\nOn Oak Ridge\u2019s Summit supercomputer \u2014 No. 2 on the TOP500 list \u2014 another team harnessed 27,612 NVIDIA GPUs to test 19,028 potential drug compounds on two key SARS-CoV-2 protein structures every second.\nAnother team used Summit to create an AI-driven workflow to model how the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the main viral infection machinery, attacks the human ACE2 receptor.\nThanks to the growing ubiquity of the scalable NVIDIA HGX AI supercomputing platform \u2014 which includes everything from processors to networking and software \u2014 scientists can run their workloads in the hyperscale data centers of cloud computing companies, as well as in supercomputers.\nIt\u2019s a unified platform, enabling the fusion of high-performance computing, data analytics and AI workloads. With 2.3 million developers and supporting over 1,800 accelerated apps, all AI frameworks and popular data analytics frameworks including DASK and Spark, the platform enables scientists and researchers to be instantly productive on GPU-powered x86, Arm and Power systems.\nIn addition, the NVIDIA NGC catalog offers performance-optimized containers for the latest versions of HPC and AI applications. So scientists and researchers can deploy quickly and stay focused on advancing their science.\nLearn more in the live NVIDIA SC20 Special Address at 3 p.m. PT today.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He\u2019s collaborated closely with George Lucas on the Star Wars prequels and sequels trilogies. Now, he\u2019s working on the popular series The Mandalorian.\nAll images courtesy of Ryan Church.\nWhen he\u2019s not creating unique vehicles and dazzling worlds for film and television, Church captures new visions and illustrates designs in his personal time. He\u2019s always had a close relationship with cutting-edge technology to produce the highest-quality visuals, even when he\u2019s working at home.\nRecently, Church got his hands on an HP Z8 workstation powered by the NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000. With the performance and speed of RTX behind his concept designs, he can render stunning images of architecture, vehicles and scenery faster than ever.\n\nRTX Delivers More Time for Precision and Creativity\nFilmmakers are always trying to figure out the quickest way to bring a concept or idea to life in a fast-paced environment.\nChurch says that directors nowadays don\u2019t just want to see a drawing of a place or item for the set, but to see the actual place or item in front of them.\nTo do so, Church creates his 3D models in Foundry\u2019s Modo and turns to OctaneRender, a GPU render engine that uses NVIDIA RTX to accelerate the rendering performance for his scenes. This allows him to achieve real-time rendering, and with the large memory capacity and performance gains of NVIDIA RTX, Church can create massive worlds freely without worrying about optimizing the geometry of his scenes.\n\u201cNVIDIA RTX has allowed me to work without babysitting the geometry all along the way,\u201d said Church. \u201cThe friction has been removed from the creation process, allowing me to stay focused on the art.\u201d\nLike Church, many concept artists are using technology to create and design complex virtual sets and elaborate 3D mattes for virtual production in real time. The large GPU memory capacities of RTX allow for free flow of art creation while working with multiple creative applications.\nAnd when trying to find the perfect lighting, or tweaking the depth of field or reflections of a scene, the NVIDIA RTX GPU speeds up the workflow to allow for better, quicker designs. Church can do up to 20-30 passes on a scene, enabling him to iterate on his designs more often so he can get the look and feel he\u2019s aiming for.\n\n\u201cThe RTX card in the Z8 allows me to have that complex scene and really dial in much better and faster,\u201d said Church. \u201cWith design, lighting, texturing happening all in real time, I can model and move lights around, and see it all happening in the active, updating viewport.\u201d\nWhen Church needs desktop-class performance on the go, he turns to his HP ZBook Studio mobile workstation. Featuring the NVIDIA Studio driver and NVIDIA Quadro RTX GPU, the ZBook Studio has been tested and certified to work with the top creative applications.\nAs a leading concept designer standing at the intersection between art and technology, Church has inspired countless artists, and his work will continue to inspire for generations to come.\nConcept artist Ryan Church pushes boundaries of creativity with NVIDIA RTX.\nLearn more about NVIDIA RTX.\n\n\nCategories: Pro Graphics | WorkstationTags: NVIDIA RTX | Ray Tracing | Rendering \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It now has more than 2,600 researchers seeking to run workloads.\nThe Grace system promises to enhance A&M\u2019s research capabilities and competitiveness. It will allow A&M researchers to keep pace with current trends across multiple fields enabled by advances in high performance computing.\nResearchers at Texas A&M University will have access to the new system in December. Dell Technologies is the primary vendor for the Grace system.\nBoosting Research\nThe new Grace architecture will enable researchers to make leaps with HPC in AI and data science. It also provides a foundation for a workforce in exascale computing, which processes a billion billion calculations per second.\nThe Grace system is set to support the university\u2019s researchers in drug design, materials science, geosciences, fluid dynamics, biomedical applications, biophysics, genetics, quantum computing, population informatics and autonomous vehicles.\n\u201cThe High Performance Research Computing lab has a mission to infuse computational and data analysis technologies into the research and creative activities of every academic discipline at Texas A&M,\u201d said Honggao Liu, executive director of the facility.\nResearch at Texas A&M University in 2019 provided $952 million in revenue for the university known for its scholarship and scientific discovery support.\nPetaflops Performance\nLike its namesake Grace Hopper \u2014 whose work in the 1950s led to the COBOL programming language \u2014 the new Grace supercomputing cluster will be focused on fueling innovation and making groundbreaking discoveries.\nThe system boosts processing up to 6.2 petaflops. A one petaflops computer can handle one quadrillion floating point operations per second (flops).\nIn addition to the A100 GPUs, the Grace cluster is powered by single-precision NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs and NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs in combination with more than 900 Dell EMC PowerEdge servers.\nThe system is interconnected with NVIDIA Mellanox high-speed, low-latency HDR InfiniBand fabric, enabling smart in-network computing engines for accelerated computing. It also includes 5.12PB of usable high-performance DDN storage running the Lustre parallel file system.\n\n\nCategories: Hardware | SupercomputingTags: High-Performance Computing | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

At that time, CUDA-based applications were focused primarily on accelerating scientific simulations, with the rise of AI and deep learning still a ways off.\nSince then, AWS has added to its stable of cloud GPU instances, which has included the K80 (p2), K520 (g3), M60 (g4), V100 (p3/p3dn) and T4 (g4).\nWith its new P4d instance generally available today, AWS is paving the way for another bold decade of accelerated computing powered with the latest NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU.\nThe P4d instance delivers AWS\u2019s highest performance, most cost-effective GPU-based platform for machine learning training and high performance computing applications. The instances reduce the time to train machine learning models by up to 3x with FP16 and up to 6x with TF32 compared to the default FP32 precision.\nThey also provide exceptional inference performance. NVIDIA A100 GPUs just last month swept the MLPerf Inference benchmarks \u2014 providing up to 237x faster performance than CPUs.\n\nEach P4d instance features eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs and, with AWS UltraClusters, customers can get on-demand and scalable access to over 4,000 GPUs at a time using AWS\u2019s Elastic Fabric Adaptor (EFA) and scalable, high-performant storage with Amazon FSx. P4d offers 400Gbps networking and uses NVIDIA technologies such as NVLink, NVSwitch, NCCL and GPUDirect RDMA to further accelerate deep learning training workloads. NVIDIA GPUDirect RDMA on EFA ensures low-latency networking by passing data from GPU to GPU between servers without having to pass through the CPU and system memory.\nIn addition, the P4d instance is supported in many AWS services, including Amazon Elastic Container Services, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, AWS ParallelCluster and Amazon SageMaker. P4d can also leverage all the optimized, containerized software available from NGC, including HPC applications, AI frameworks, pre-trained models, Helm charts and inference software like TensorRT and Triton Inference Server.\nP4d instances are now available in US East and West, and coming to additional regions soon. The instances can be purchased as On-Demand, with Savings Plans, with Reserved Instances, or as Spot Instances.\nThe first decade of GPU cloud computing has brought over 100 exaflops of AI compute to the market. With the arrival of the Amazon EC2 P4d instance powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs, the next decade of GPU cloud computing is off to a great start.\nNVIDIA and AWS are making it possible for applications to continue pushing the boundaries of AI across a wide array of applications. We can\u2019t wait to see what customers will do with it.\nVisit AWS and get started with P4d instances today.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | Inference | NVIDIA A100 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They showed for the first time fine details of how the spike protein moved, opened and contacted a healthy cell.\nOne simulation (below) packed a whopping 305 million atoms, more than twice the size of any prior simulation in molecular dynamics. It required AI and all 27,648 NVIDIA GPUs on the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\n\nMore than 4,000 researchers worldwide have downloaded the results that one called \u201ccritical for vaccine design\u201d for COVID and future pathogens.\nToday, it won a special Gordon Bell Prize for COVID-19, the equivalent of a Nobel Prize in the supercomputing community.\nTwo other teams also used NVIDIA technologies in work selected as finalists in the COVID-19 competition created by the ACM, a professional group representing more than 100,000 computing experts worldwide.\nAnd the traditional Gordon Bell Prize\u00a0went to a team from Beijing, Berkeley and Princeton that set a new milestone in molecular dynamics, also using a combination of HPC+AI on Summit.\nAn AI Funnel Catches Promising Drugs\nSeeing how the infection process works is one of a string of pearls that scientists around the world are gathering into a new AI-assisted drug discovery process.\nAnother is screening from a vast field of 1068 candidates the right compounds to arrest a virus. In a paper from part of the team behind Amaro\u2019s work, researchers described a new AI workflow that in less than five months filtered 4.2 billion compounds down to the 40 most promising ones that are now in advanced testing.\n\u201cWe were so happy to get these results because people are dying and we need to address that with a new baseline that shows what you can get with AI,\u201d said Arvind Ramanathan, a computational biologist at Argonne National Laboratory.\nRamanathan\u2019s team was part of an international collaboration among eight universities and supercomputer centers, each contributing unique tools to process nearly 60 terabytes of data from 21 open datasets. It fueled a set of interlocking simulations and AI predictions that ran across 160 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs on Argonne\u2019s Theta system with massive AI inference runs using NVIDIA TensorRT on the many more GPUs on Summit.\nDocking Compounds, Proteins on a Supercomputer\nEarlier this year, Ada Sedova put a pearl on the string for protein docking (described in the video below) when she described plans to test a billion drug compounds against two coronavirus spike proteins in less than 24 hours using the GPUs on Summit. Her team\u2019s work cut to just 21 hours the work that used to take 51 days, a 58x speedup.\n\nIn a related effort, colleagues at Oak Ridge used NVIDIA RAPIDS and BlazingSQL to accelerate by an order of magnitude data analytics on results like Sedova produced.\nAmong the other Gordon Bell finalists, Lawrence Livermore researchers used GPUs on the Sierra supercomputer to slash the training time for an AI model used to speed drug discovery from a day to just 23 minutes.\nFrom the Lab to the Clinic\nThe Gordon Bell finalists are among more than 90 research efforts in a supercomputing collaboration using 50,000 GPU cores to fight the coronavirus.\nThey make up one front in a global war on COVID that also includes companies such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies, a genomics specialist using NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA software to accelerate its work.\nOxford Nanopore won approval from European regulators last month for a novel system the size of a desktop printer that can be used with minimal training to perform thousands of COVID tests in a single day. Scientists worldwide have used its handheld sequencing devices to understand the transmission of the virus.\nRelay Therapeutics uses NVIDIA GPUs and software to simulate with machine learning how proteins move, opening up new directions in the drug discovery process. In September, it started its first human trial of a molecule inhibitor to treat cancer.\nStartup Structura uses CUDA on NVIDIA GPUs to analyze initial images of pathogens to quickly determine their 3D atomic structure, another key step in drug discovery. It\u2019s a member of the NVIDIA Inception program, which gives startups in AI access to the latest GPU-accelerated technologies and market partners.\nFrom Clara Discovery to Cambridge-1\nNVIDIA Clara Discovery delivers a framework with AI models, GPU-optimized code and applications to accelerate every stage in the drug discovery pipeline. It provides speedups of 6-30x across jobs in genomics, protein structure prediction, virtual screening, docking, molecular simulation, imaging and natural-language processing that are all part of the drug discovery process.\nIt\u2019s NVIDIA\u2019s latest contribution to fighting the SARS-CoV-2 and future pathogens.\nNVIDIA Clara Discovery speeds each step of a drug discovery process using AI and data analytics.\nWithin hours of the shelter-at-home order in the U.S., NVIDIA gave researchers free access to a test drive of Parabricks, our genomic sequencing software. Since then, we\u2019ve provided as part of NVIDIA Clara open access to AI models co-developed with the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\nWe\u2019ve also committed to build with partners including GSK and AstraZeneca Europe\u2019s largest supercomputer dedicated to driving drug discovery forward. Cambridge-1 will be an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD system capable of delivering more than 400 petaflops of AI performance.\nNext Up: A Billion-Atom Simulation\nThe work is just getting started.\nRamanathan of Argonne sees a future where self-driving labs learn what experiments they should launch next, like autonomous vehicles finding their own way forward.\n\u201cAnd I want to scale to the absolute max of screening 1068 drug compounds, but even covering half that will be significantly harder than what we\u2019ve done so far,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFor me, simulating a virus with a billion atoms is the next peak, and we know we will get there in 2021,\u201d said Amaro. \u201cLonger term, we need to learn how to use AI even more effectively to deal with coronavirus mutations and other emerging pathogens that could be even worse,\u201d she added.\nHear NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang describe in the video below how AI in Clara Discovery is advancing drug discovery.\nAt top: An image of the SARS-CoV-2 virus based on the Amaro lab\u2019s simulation showing 305 million atoms.\n\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | COVID-19 | Customer Stories | GPU Computing | Healthcare and Life Sciences | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Clara | Parallel Computing | Science | Social Impact | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

By making high-performance, energy-efficient compute a standard feature, every vehicle will include a rich, software-defined AI user experience that\u2019s always at the cutting edge.\nHyundai Motor Group has been working with NVIDIA since 2015, developing a state-of-the-art in-vehicle infotainment system on NVIDIA DRIVE that shipped in the Genesis GV80 and G80 models last year. The companies have also been collaborating on an advanced digital cockpit for release in late 2021.\nThe Genesis G80\nNow, the automaker is standardizing AI for all its vehicles by extending NVIDIA DRIVE throughout its entire fleet \u2014 marking its commitment to developing software-defined and constantly updateable vehicles for more intelligent transportation.\nA Smarter Co-Pilot\nAI and accelerated computing have opened the door for a vast array of new functionalities in next-generation vehicles.\nSpecifically, these software-defined AI cockpit features can be realized with a centralized, high-performance computing architecture. Traditionally, vehicle infotainment requires a collection of electronic control units and switches to perform basic functions, such as changing the radio station or adjusting temperature.\nConsolidating these components with the NVIDIA DRIVE software-defined AI platform simplifies the architecture while creating more compute headroom to add new features. With NVIDIA DRIVE at the core, automakers such as Hyundai can orchestrate crucial safety and convenience features, building vehicles that become smarter over time.\n\nThese capabilities include driver or occupant monitoring to ensure eyes stay on the road or exiting passengers avoid oncoming traffic. They can elevate convenience in the car by clearly providing information on the vehicle\u2019s surroundings or recommending faster routes and nearby restaurants.\nDelivering the Future to Every Fleet\nHyundai is making this new area of in-vehicle AI a reality for all of its customers.\nThe automaker will leverage the high-performance compute of NVIDIA DRIVE to roll out its new connected car operating system to every new Hyundai, Kia and Genesis vehicle. The software platform consolidates the massive amounts of data generated by the car to deliver personalized convenience and safety features for the vehicle\u2019s occupants.\nBy running on NVIDIA DRIVE, the in-vehicle infotainment system can process the myriad vehicle data in parallel to deliver features instantaneously. It can provide these services regardless of whether the vehicle is connected to the internet, customizing to each user safely and securely for the ultimate level of convenience.\nWith this new centralized cockpit architecture, Hyundai Motor Group will bring AI to every new customer, offering software upgradeable applications for the entire life of its upcoming fleet.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

For the past 7 years, we\u2019ve used TV\u2019s incorporating technologies from the HDMI 2.0 specification. Now, finally, we have TV\u2019s incorporating technologies from the latest HDMI 2.1 specification bringing great new capabilities that you can take advantage of with GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards and GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards.\nWith HDMI 2.1, a single output cable enables gaming at 4K 120 FPS and 8K 60 FPS. It also enables variable refresh rate G-SYNC Compatible gaming at much higher resolutions and wider refresh rate ranges, and introduces new technologies that help to further improve your experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDMI 2.1 Technologies Supported By GeForce RTX 30 Series and 40 Series GPUs\nOur GeForce RTX 30 Series and 40 Series graphics cards support key HDMI 2.1 technologies, including:\n\nFixed Rate Link (FRL): A new signaling technology that\u2019s necessary to achieve higher uncompressed resolutions, such as 8K, and to enable 48Gbps ultra high speed bandwidth speeds\nDisplay Stream Compression (DSC) 1.2a: A visually lossless compression algorithm that enables higher resolutions, faster refresh rates (e.g. 8K 60Hz), and greater color depths (e.g. 8K HDR 10-bit). DSC also eliminates the color artefacts introduced by older 4:2:2 or 4:2:0 Chroma Subsampling techniques\nVariable Refresh Rate (VRR): VRR eliminates tearing for more fluid and better gameplay. Together with other supported technologies, high-resolution and high-refresh G-SYNC Compatible gaming is now a reality\nSPD Auto Game Mode: This ensures that the display is set up automatically in the optimal mode for gaming, enabling all the relevant features like VRR, HDR and switching to the lowest latency modes. No need to dig into the Display options to enable the options one by one, just plug the TV in and let the GPU switch the display to the correct mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Get Started With HDMI 2.1\n\nInstall a GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics card or GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics card into your PC, followed by our latest Game Ready Driver\nConnect your graphics card to your HDMI\u00a02.1-capable TV or receiver using an HDMI 2.1 48Gbps Ultra High-Speed Certified HDMI cable, which nearly triples the amount of data that can be transmitted. These are backwards compatible with older versions of the HDMI standard, though some TVs might require that you connect to a specific HDMI port. Be sure to check the manufacturer\u2019s manual and/or website\nMake sure your HDMI 2.1 compatible TV has the latest firmware updates (see below).\nActivate HDMI 2.1 support, HDMI 2.1 Variable Refresh Rate support, or G-SYNC Compatible support in your TV\u2019s settings menus (each manufacturers\u2019 settings and options differ, so please refer to the manufacturer\u2019s manual and/or website for steps). \nOpen the NVIDIA Control Panel on your PC and configure options for G-SYNC, G-SYNC Compatible, display resolution, display refresh rate, and other display settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDMI 2.1 TVs\nNVIDIA is working closely with many major TV manufacturers to ensure high quality HDMI 2.1 and G-SYNC Compatible Variable Refresh Rate experiences on GeForce RTX 30 Series and 40 Series graphics cards. Read about G-SYNC Compatible testing and validation here.  The following TVs support HDMI 2.1 on GeForce RTX 30 Series and 40 Series GPUs, though some may first require a firmware update. Please refer to manufacturers websites for lists of compatible TVs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Supported HDMI 2.1 TVs\n\n\nManufacturer\nModel Year Started\nFurther Information\n\n\nLG\n2019\nSee LG\u2019s latest supported TVs here\n\n\nPanasonic (UK)\n2023\nSee the latest list of TVs here\n\n\nPhilips (UK)\n2020\nSee Philips\u2019 latest supported TVs here\n\n\nSamsung\n2020\nSee Samsung\u2019s latest supported TVs here\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWhen you go to buy a TV to pair with a GeForce RTX 30 series or 40 series GPU, check that the TV supports the latest HDMI technologies and is G-SYNC Compatible for the best big screen gaming experience. Consult manufacturers\u2019 websites for specific specifications, and if in doubt ask their customer support teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nHDMI 2.1 is the newest display standard for TVs and associated devices moving forward. Receivers, sound bars and other devices are already adding it following the release of HDMI 2.1 TVs from industry leaders like LG and Samsung, and GeForce RTX graphics cards enable high refresh rate, high resolution, VRR PC gaming on these devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

On PC, this breathtaking game is enhanced with ray-traced reflections, diffuse illumination, ambient occlusion and shadows, and NVIDIA DLSS, delivering the best possible Cyberpunk 2077 experience.\nCheck out our world premiere Behind The Scenes video featuring some of the devs from CD PROJEKT RED, showcasing new Cyberpunk 2077 RTX ON gameplay, captured on GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, we\u2019re also unveiling the recommended system configurations for RTX ON gameplay, helping you pick out the parts for a Cyberpunk 2077-ready system that delivers the experience you desire.\nWith RTX ON, Night City is transformed. Glorious ray-traced reflections are cast on every possible surface; substantially improved shadows naturally soften and sharpen; shops, streets and buildings are realistically illuminated with diffuse lighting; and in general the world is more immersive and detailed, enhancing your Cyberpunk 2077 experience.\nThe minimum GPU for Ray Tracing, at 1920x1080, is the GeForce RTX 2060. Gamers will explore Night City with Medium Ray Tracing Preset powered by DLSS.\nAt 2560x1440, we recommend a GeForce RTX 3070 or GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. Ray tracing is taken to Ultra, which greatly increases the fidelity of the aforementioned effects, and the distance at which they are visible, while DLSS provides boosted frame rates with uncompromised image quality. And with rasterized settings also being cranked to Ultra, GeForce RTX 3070 and 2080 Ti gamers receive an incredible experience at the highest detail levels, unmatched by any other platform.\nAnd finally, if you\u2019re playing at 4K or beyond, the GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3090 deliver the performance to play Cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing at Ultra at this incredibly demanding resolution. Both GPUs are powered by Ampere\u2014NVIDIA\u2019s 2nd gen RTX architecture\u2014with dedicated RT Cores for ray tracing, and Tensor Cores for DLSS AI acceleration, delivering an unrivaled cinematic-quality experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you lack a GeForce RTX PC or laptop, or are away from your gaming system, you can play RTX-enhanced Cyberpunk 2077 at release via GeForce NOW, our cloud gaming service. GeForce NOW gives your low-end rig the power to stream Cyberpunk 2077 with RTX ON. Explore the streets of Night City across all your devices, streaming from the cloud. And instantly play your existing PC library from stores like Steam, UPlay and the Epic Games Store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we approach Cyberpunk 2077 release on December 10th, stay tuned to GeForce.com for more RTX ON trailers and screenshots, our Cyberpunk 2077 Game Ready Driver, and more Cyberpunk 2077 PC content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The game picks up after the story of the original Call of Duty: Black Ops title and follows your journey around the globe as you take down enemies in the face of a potential nuclear war. Featuring ray-tracing, NVIDIA DLSS and NVIDIA Reflex, Call of Duty\u00ae: Black Ops Cold War packs a punch. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Technology is available throughout Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War - NVIDIA RTX enhances the full experience, bringing you immersive ray-traced shadows and ambient occlusion; NVIDIA DLSS enables gamers to achieve high frames at high resolutions; and NVIDIA Reflex provides the lowest latency and best responsiveness. Finally, NVIDIA Ansel in the campaign allows you to frame and snap unique hi-res screenshots, while in Multiplayer NVIDIA Highlights ensures your most entertaining in-game moments are automatically recorded and saved.\nWith realistic shadows and lighting, the added performance of NVIDIA DLSS, and the improved system latency offered by NVIDIA Reflex, no other platform will compare to the Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War experience on a GeForce RTX-powered PC.\nTo ensure your system is ready to go to war, download and install our latest Game Ready Driver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War Ray Tracing\nAs you saw in the trailer above, ray tracing brings an extra level of visual refinement to Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, enabling players to receive the best possible experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to load a fullscreen interactive comparison\nRay-traced shadows from the sun, as well as local light sources, create contiguous silhouettes with contact hardening and high-resolution details without any aliasing or self-shadowing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to load a fullscreen interactive comparison\nAnd ray-traced ambient occlusion adds a sense of depth to the environment and the objects that inhabit it. With ray tracing, the technique determines how much light should fall onto each object, which allows it to create more lifelike shading, without over-darkening entire areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to load a fullscreen interactive comparison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS\nOwners of NVIDIA RTX GPUs can take advantage of AI-accelerated rendering using NVIDIA DLSS. Dedicated AI processors on the GPU called Tensor Cores, combined with an improved deep learning neural network, boost performance so that you can enjoy higher fidelity gameplay at higher frame rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War uses our latest DLSS technology, increasing performance by up to 85% at 4K:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex\nFor competitive gamers that need every edge they can get from their hardware, NVIDIA Reflex can lower your system latency (otherwise known as \u201cinput lag\u201d) while still letting you crank up your resolution and graphics settings.\nIn Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, NVIDIA Reflex can reduce system latency by up to 20%, giving you a more responsive experience in all game modes using a GeForce GTX 900 Series GPU or newer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enjoy an experience like the one shown above, with all the bells and whistles enabled, with performance-enhancing NVIDIA DLSS technology, you\u2019ll need a capable config:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War Bundle Available Now\nDon\u2019t forget, that since the only way to experience all of the exciting new technical features is with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX series GPU, we\u2019re giving buyers of eligible GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3090 graphics cards and desktop systems a Standard Edition copy of the game.\nThe included copy of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is redeemable online, and will be available to play via Battle.net when the game launches on November 13th, 2020.

Since then, its portfolio of cloud NVIDIA GPU instances has grown to include the K80 (P2), K520 (G3), M60 (G3), V100 (P3/P3dn) and T4 (G4).\nThe P4d instance delivers AWS\u2019s highest performance, most cost-effective GPU-based platform for machine learning training and high performance computing applications. The instances reduce the time to train machine learning models by up to 6x with TF32 compared to the default FP32 precision.\nDemos and Sessions\nAs a Gold sponsor at this year\u2019s re:Invent, we\u2019ll be sharing some exciting demos, including NVIDIA CloudXR, our offering for streaming virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality content from any OpenVR XR application. Check out how Theia Interactive uses CloudXR to turn the design process into interactive Unreal Engine VR experiences with The Gettys Group in our virtual demo booth.\nNeed a car but not ready to head to a showroom? The NVIDIA RTX Ray-Tracing Car Configurator transports you to a virtual showroom where you can view cars in photorealistic configurations.\nWith the prevalence of remote work, many enterprises have moved to the cloud. So don\u2019t miss the demo and session showing how AWS and NVIDIA are enabling engineers and designers to continue their work on GPU-accelerated virtual workstations. Also, be sure to check out the session titled \u201cVirtual Workstations for Content Creation with G4 Instances\u201d (CMP305) to hear how NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs with NVIDIA RTX technology enable creative studios to do their work anywhere from the cloud, presented by AWS.\nTo find the best machine learning model before serving it to the world, check out a tutorial that shows how to combine RAPIDS with Amazon SageMaker to accelerate hyperparameter optimization that shows a 12x speedup and 4.5x reduction in cost.\nIn our virtual booth, learn about conversational AI inference at data center scale using NVIDIA Riva, as well as how to easily deploy a BERT language model using NVIDIA Triton Inference Server on Amazon EKS.\nCheck all this out when our sponsor page goes live on Nov. 30.\nIn addition, we\u2019ll be hosting 36 virtual theater sessions covering a range of topics:\n\nbuilding next-generation healthcare AI on NVIDIA Clara\naccelerating natural language processing with GPUs for consumer internet companies\ndriving fintech innovations\nadvanced computer graphics for 3D design and animation\npowering autonomous driving with NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation and NVIDIA DRIVE Sim\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in attending and engaging with our industry experts, check out the session schedule.\nFree AI Training for Developers\nDuring AWS re:Invent, the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute is offering a free enrollment code for a self-paced course to the first 500 developers who sign up for our NVIDIA Developer Program. This program ensures developers have access to all the tools and training necessary to successfully build apps on all NVIDIA technology platforms.\nDLI provides hands-on training in AI, accelerated computing and accelerated data science to help developers, data scientists and other professionals solve their most challenging problems. Select courses offer a certificate of competency to support career growth.\nLearn how to set up an end-to-end project in just eight hours or how to apply a specific technology or development technique in two hours \u2014 anytime, anywhere \u2014 with just a computer and an internet connection.\nAccelerating Startups\nThrough our partnership with AWS Activate, startups within the NVIDIA Inception acceleration program will be eligible for up to $100,000 in credits for the AWS cloud, which can be used to access the new NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU.\nIn addition, NVIDIA Inception members can benefit from preferred pricing on on-premises GPUs, training through the DLI and go-to-market support.\nSwing by NVIDIA\u2019s virtual booth, starting Nov. 30, at AWS re:Invent 2020.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Data CenterTags: CloudXR | Deep Learning Institute | Inception \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Members will receive customized training and support to develop, deploy and integrate NVIDIA GPU-accelerated apps everywhere within the medical imaging ecosystem.\nSelect startup members will have direct access to engage joint customers, in addition to marketing promotion of their results. The initiative will kick off with a pitch competition for leading AI startups in medical imaging and related supporting fields.\n\u201cStartups are on the forefront of innovation and the GE Healthcare Edison Developer Program provides them access to the world\u2019s largest installed base of medical devices and customers,\u201d said Karley Yoder, vice president and general manager of Artificial Intelligence at GE Healthcare. \u201cBringing together the world-class capabilities from industry-leading partners creates a fast-track to accelerate innovation in a connected ecosystem that will help improve the quality of care, lower healthcare costs and deliver better outcomes for patients.\u201d\n\u201cWith Nuance\u2019s deep understanding of radiologists\u2019 needs and workflow, we are uniquely positioned to help them transform healthcare by harnessing AI. The Nuance AI Marketplace gives radiologists the ability to easily purchase, validate and use AI models within solutions they use every day, so they can work smarter and more efficiently,\u201d said Karen Holzberger, senior vice president and general manager of the Diagnostic Division at Nuance. \u201cThe AI models help radiologists focus their time and expertise on the right case at the right time, alleviate many repetitive, mundane tasks and, ultimately, improve patient care \u2014 and save more lives. Connecting NVIDIA Inception startup members to the Nuance AI Marketplace is a natural fit \u2014 and creates a connection for startups that benefits the entire industry.\u201d\nLearn more at the NVIDIA RSNA 2020 Special Address, which is open to the public on Tuesday, Dec. 1, at 6 p.m. CT. Kimberly Powell, NVIDIA\u2019s vice president of healthcare, will discuss how we\u2019re working with medical imaging companies, radiologists, data scientists, researchers and medical device companies to bring workflow acceleration, AI models and deployment platforms to the medical imaging ecosystem.\nSubscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This allows data to be fed quickly to A100, the world\u2019s fastest data center GPU, enabling researchers to accelerate their applications even faster and take on even larger models and datasets.\n\u201cAchieving state-of-the-art results in HPC and AI research requires building the biggest models, but these demand more memory capacity and bandwidth than ever before,\u201d said Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research at NVIDIA. \u201cThe A100 80GB GPU provides double the memory of its predecessor, which was introduced just six months ago, and breaks the 2TB per second barrier, enabling researchers to tackle the world\u2019s most important scientific and big data challenges.\u201d\nThe NVIDIA A100 80GB GPU is available in NVIDIA DGX\u2122 A100 and NVIDIA DGX Station\u2122 A100 systems, also announced today and expected to ship this quarter.\nLeading systems providers Atos, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Inspur, Lenovo, Quanta and Supermicro are expected to begin offering systems built using HGX A100 integrated baseboards in four- or eight-GPU configurations featuring A100 80GB in the first half of 2021.\u00a0\nFueling Data-Hungry Workloads \r\nBuilding on the diverse capabilities of the A100 40GB, the 80GB version is ideal for a wide range of applications with enormous data memory requirements.\nFor AI training, recommender system models like DLRM have massive tables representing billions of users and billions of products. A100 80GB delivers up to a 3x speedup, so businesses can quickly retrain these models to deliver highly accurate recommendations.\nThe A100 80GB also enables training of the largest models with more parameters fitting within a single HGX-powered server such as GPT-2, a natural language processing model with superhuman generative text capability. This eliminates the need for data or model parallel architectures that can be time consuming to implement and slow to run across multiple nodes.\nWith its multi-instance GPU (MIG) technology, A100 can be partitioned into up to seven GPU instances, each with 10GB of memory. This provides secure hardware isolation and maximizes GPU utilization for a variety of smaller workloads. For AI inferencing of automatic speech recognition models like RNN-T, a single A100 80GB MIG instance can service much larger batch sizes, delivering 1.25x higher inference throughput in production.\nOn a big data analytics benchmark for retail in the terabyte-size range, the A100 80GB boosts performance up to 2x, making it an ideal platform for delivering rapid insights on the largest of datasets. Businesses can make key decisions in real time as data is updated dynamically.\nFor scientific applications, such as weather forecasting and quantum chemistry, the A100 80GB can deliver massive acceleration. Quantum Espresso, a materials simulation, achieved throughput gains of nearly 2x with a single node of A100 80GB.\n\u201cSpeedy and ample memory bandwidth and capacity are vital to realizing high performance in supercomputing applications,\u201d said Satoshi Matsuoka, director at RIKEN Center for Computational Science. \u201cThe NVIDIA A100 with 80GB of HBM2e GPU memory, providing the world\u2019s fastest 2TB per second of bandwidth, will help deliver a big boost in application performance.\u201d\nKey Features of A100 80GB\r\nThe A100 80GB includes the many groundbreaking features of the NVIDIA Ampere architecture:\n\nThird-Generation Tensor Cores: Provide up to 20x AI throughput of the previous Volta generation with a new format TF32, as well as 2.5x FP64 for HPC, 20x INT8 for AI inference and support for the BF16 data format.\nLarger, Faster HBM2e GPU Memory: Doubles the memory capacity and is the first in the industry to offer more than 2TB per second of memory bandwidth.\nMIG technology: Doubles the memory per isolated instance, providing up to seven MIGs with 10GB each.\nStructural Sparsity: Delivers up to a 2x speedup inferencing sparse models.\nThird-Generation NVLink\u00ae and NVSwitch\u2122: Provide twice the GPU-to-GPU bandwidth of the previous generation interconnect technology, accelerating data transfers to the GPU for data-intensive workloads to 600 gigabytes per second.\n\nNVIDIA HGX AI Supercomputing Platform \r\nThe A100 80GB GPU is a key element in NVIDIA HGX AI supercomputing platform, which brings together the full power of NVIDIA GPUs, NVIDIA NVLink, NVIDIA InfiniBand networking and a fully optimized NVIDIA AI and HPC software stack to provide the highest application performance. It enables researchers and scientists to combine HPC, data analytics and deep learning computing methods to advance scientific progress.\nLearn more about NVIDIA A100 80GB in the live NVIDIA SC20 Special Address at 3 p.m. PT today.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined modern computer graphics and revolutionized parallel computing.

I remember having to do some fancy work to get it running on my older GTX and though the results were still very good, the hassle was huge.Thankfully Nvidia now offers two versions of the software, one for RTX cards and another that works just fine natively on something a little older.Recently I\u2019ve been having awful problems with my mics. I\u2019m putting it down to the warmer weather but I can\u2019t record a thing without terrible background noise from my PC. It\u2019s not just the white noise from a fan I hear, but a low wub wub wub sound as well. It results in completely unusable audio.I\u2019ve tried multiple mics, cables, ports, everything. It felt like a problem without a solution and it was driving me mad.So I decided to look into the Nvidia software again, and honestly, it\u2019s more amazing than I remembered.It completely gets rid of all that awful background noise I was getting before. I even did the old typing test and banged on my desk during a Zoom call and absolutely none of it was audible.I was already very sold but then I discovered another use case.Part of the reason I\u2019d jumped down this rabbit hole is last week my audio recording for a very good local Australian gaming podcast everyone should listen to, (separate from the Byteside shows you should also listen to) was completely unusable. We\u2019d decided to ditch that one and try again, so I wanted to make sure this time it\u2019d be clean.But it got me wondering, if the Nvidia RTX Voice software can clean audio as it\u2019s recording, why not after?I took to Google in search of answers. It seems lots of folks were wondering the same thing as me. Many had their own solutions, but none on their own completely worked when I tried.So, I wanted to share how I managed to get it working.Cleaning pre-recorded audio in Nvidia RTX VoiceYou\u2019ll need to download whichever Nvidia Voice software is compatible with your graphics card, a virtual cable line in, \u00a0recording software like Audition or Audacity, and have a program that can play the original recording with a chosen output \u2013 I used VLC.Download and install all those bad bois if you haven\u2019t already, then restart your PC. I actually had to restart mine multiple times during this process, so if anything isn\u2019t looking right, try that.Open Nvidia RTX Voice and make your Input device the virtual line in. I\u2019m not sure if it mattered but I also made this my output device and things worked. Honestly, we\u2019re just going to be making almost everything this virtual line in.Next up, crack open your media player and, you guessed it, make the audio device it uses that virtual line.In your recording software you\u2019ll want to set this line in as the input there too, (Usually in hardware preferences) and leave the output as whatever you want to use to listen.Now hit record and make sure you can still see this window when you swap back to your media player, hit play, and wait.You should see your recording software picking up the audio even if you can\u2019t hear it. And if you\u2019re anything like me, it should look much much cleaner than it did before.You basically just have to let this play until the recording is done. There\u2019s not a lot else that can be done but given Nvidia RTX Voice can technically do it this way, hopefully we\u2019ll see an official post-recording audio cleaner from them soon.Because this one, pain as it may be to set up, works really well.\n\n\nTechnologyBusinessAINvidia\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHope Corrigan\n\nSecretly several dogs stacked on top of one another in a large coat, Hope has a habit of getting far too excited about all things videogames and tech.

That means more than 5 million GeForce NOW members can now access the latest experience by launching Safari from iPhone or iPad and visiting play.geforcenow.com.\nNot a member? Get started by signing up for a Founders membership that offers beautifully ray-traced graphics on supported games, extended sessions lengths and front-of-the-line access. There\u2019s also a free option for those who want to test the waters.\nRight now is a great time to join. Founders memberships are available for $4.99/month or lock in an even better rate with a six-month Founders membership for $24.95.\nAll new GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs come bundled with a GeForce NOW Founders membership, available to existing or new members.\nOnce logged in, you\u2019re only a couple clicks away from streaming a massive catalog of the latest and most played PC games. Instantly jump into your games, like Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, Destiny 2 Beyond Light, Shadow of the Tomb Raider and more. Founders members can also play titles like Watch Dogs: Legion with RTX ON and NVIDIA DLSS, even on their iPhone or iPad.\nGeForce NOW on iOS Safari requires a gamepad \u2014 keyboard and mouse-only games aren\u2019t available due to hardware limitations. For the best experience, you\u2019ll want to use a GeForce NOW Recommended gamepad, like the Razer Kishi.\nFortnite, Coming Soon\nAlongside the amazing team at Epic Games, we\u2019re working to enable a touch-friendly version of Fortnite, which will delay availability of the game. While the GeForce NOW library is best experienced on mobile with a gamepad, touch is how over 100 million Fortnite gamers have built, battled and danced their way to Victory Royale.\nWe\u2019re looking forward to delivering a cloud-streaming Fortnite mobile experience powered by GeForce NOW. Members can look for the game on iOS Safari soon.\nMore Games, More Game Stores\nWhen you fire up your favorite game, you\u2019re playing it instantly \u2014 that\u2019s what it means to be Game Ready on GeForce NOW. The experience has been optimized for cloud gaming and includes Game Ready Driver performance improvements.\n\nNVIDIA manages the game updates and patches, letting you play the games you own at 1080p, 60FPS across nearly all of your devices. And when a game supports RTX, Founders members can play with beautifully ray-traced graphics and DLSS 2.0 for improved graphics fidelity.\nPC games become playable across a wider range of hardware, removing the barriers across platforms. With the recent release of Among Us, Mac and Chromebook owners can now experience the viral sensation, just like PC gamers. Android owners can play the newest titles even when they\u2019re away from their rig.\nMore than 750 PC games are now Game Ready on GeForce NOW, with weekly additions that continue to expand the library.\nComing soon, GeForce NOW will connect with GOG, giving members access to even more games in their library. The first GOG.com games that we anticipate supporting are CD PROJEKT RED\u2019s Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.\nThe GeForce-Powered Cloud\nFounders members have turned RTX ON for beautifully ray-traced graphics, and can run games with even higher fidelity thanks to DLSS. That\u2019s the power to play that only a GeForce-powered cloud gaming service can deliver.\nThe advantages also extend to improving quality of service. By developing both the hardware and software streaming solutions, we\u2019re able to easily integrate new GeForce technologies that reduce latency on good networks, and improve fidelity on poor networks.\nThese improvements will continue over time, with some optimizations already available and being felt by GeForce NOW members today.\nChrome Wasn\u2019t Built in a Day\nThe first webRTC client running GeForce NOW was the Chromebook beta in August. In the months since, we\u2019ve seen over 10 percent of gameplay in the Chrome web-based client.\n\nSoon we\u2019ll bring that experience to more Chrome platforms, including Linux, PC, Mac and Android. Stay tuned for updates as we approach a full launch early next year.\nExpanding to New Regions\nThe GeForce NOW Alliance continues to spread cloud gaming across the globe. The alliance is currently made up of LG U+ in Korea, KDDI and SoftBank in Japan, GFN.RU in Russia and Taiwan Mobile, which launched out of beta on Nov. 7.\nIn the weeks ahead, Zain KSA, the leading 5G telecom operator in Saudi Arabia, will launch its GeForce NOW beta for gamers, expanding cloud gaming into another new region.\nMore games. More platforms. Legendary GeForce performance. And now streaming on iOS Safari. That\u2019s the power to play that only GeForce NOW can deliver.\n\n\nCategories: GamingTags: Cloud Gaming | GeForce NOW | NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Largely the introduction of computers into automobiles is welcome and has broken new ground with the rise in AI and assisted driving technologies. However, greater complexity can introduce plenty of potential issues, especially in pioneering implementations.\nAutomaker Tesla is one of the pioneers in using advanced IT in its vehicles. Its mould-breaking cars pack an impressive amount of computing tech beyond the electric drivetrain which propels them. Last year it was reported that Tesla was abandoning its Nvidia partnership to use its own self-driving processor designs. This decision became public about a year after Jim Keller moved on from Tesla to Intel, presumably with his mission complete at the automaker's R&D labs.\n\nIt has recently emerged that a large number of Tesla vehicle owners have started to experience car problems where the root cause is the computing hardware that is tightly integrated with the vehicle. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has noted (PDF) 16,000 complaints and infotainment hardware replacement requests from Tesla car owners and it looks like this might just be the first wave. 159,000 Tesla Model S and Model X vehicles built between 2012 and 2018 are at risk, according to a report published by The Register.\nDrivers have reported car system glitches and issues such as \"loss of rearview/backup camera, loss of HVAC (defogging) setting controls... impact on the advanced driver assistance support (ADAS), Autopilot system, and turn signal functionality due to the possible loss of audible chimes, driver sensing, and alerts associated with these vehicle functions,\" according to the safety administration. Investigations have pointed to eMMC NAND flash wearing out and causing the system issues.\n\nTesla seems to be well aware of the potential issue of eMMC flash wear and has provided firmware updates to help mitigate the problem but they are probably just delaying the inevitable for owners of Tesla autos which feature Nvidia Tegra 3 chips with built-in eMMC flash. The flash memory has in most cases simply reached its program-erase cycle limit and has started to throw up errors or stop certain functions from working.\nNone of the recent news sources I found indicated the off road time or cost of fixing this eMMC wear issue. However, a Tesla-Info user blog post says that eMMC issues under warranty will be fixed for free but out of warranty fixes are charged at a reduced $500/\u00a3400 including parts and labour.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\nUK Royal Navy vision embraces autonomous technology\n\n                    Oulines a stratosphere drone station, a semi-sub carrier, and various unmanned platforms. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nVirgin outlines its vision for deploying Hyperloop systems\n\n                    Video shows maglev pods travelling at nearly 700mph, transporting tens of thousands a day. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n9\nTesla Bot 'friendly' humanoid robot unveiled\n\n                    It is 172cm tall, will be able to do menial tasks, and can carry about 20kg of groceries. \n                \n\n\n\nVirgin Galactic completes its first crewed space flight\nRoyal Navy tests rescue drones for 'man overboard' accidents\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 11 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

DBS Group Holdings Ltd. saw net income fall 20% from a year earlier and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. posted a 12% drop as lending slumped and provisions rose, results for the three months ended Sept. 30 showed Thursday. Yet income increased in some businesses such as wealth.  The banks join smaller rival United Overseas Bank Ltd. in posting better-than-expected results, providing good news for Singapore officials as they pump billions into the shrinking economy and extend loan relief measures to support households and businesses. DBS Chief Executive Office Piyush Gupta flagged better prospects ahead, saying in a presentation that \u201cbusiness momentum improved,\u201d with wealth management and a pickup in credit card spending among the bright spots. He expects a \u201cstrong economic rebound in Asia\u201d to fuel loan growth and fee income. OCBC CEO Samuel Tsien struck a more cautious tone, saying the challenging economic environment will persist as the virus remains. Loan repayments once the moratorium expires \u201cmay be better than expected,\u201d but sustainability is not yet certain, he said. DBS\u2019s profit of S$1.3 billion ($957 million) exceeded the S$1.12 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. OCBC\u2019s earnings came in at S$1.03 billion, higher than the S$850 million projected. UOB on Wednesday posted higher-than-anticipated profit as cost cuts helped it cushion a surge in provisions. Net income dropped 40% from a year earlier to S$668 million. Other Highlights DBS\u2019s net interest margin shrank to 1.53%, while OCBC\u2019s fell to 1.54%. OCBC\u2019s net interest income declined 11% from a year earlier, and DBS posted a 12% drop.  \u00a9 2020 Bloomberg L.P.

(PHOTO: Alibaba)   SINGAPORE \u2014 Lazada, Alibaba's flagship e-commerce arm in Southeast Asia, said the 11.11 shopping festival is a major opportunity for brands in the region to attract buyers amid changing consumer habits due to the coronavirus pandemic. To help the brands expand their sales and presence online, Lazada\u2019s co-president Jessica Liu said the platform has been launching campaigns ranging from training courses to games associated with the mega event on 11 November, popularly known as Singles\u2019 Day.  \u201cAs Southeast Asia\u2019s leading e-commerce platform, our priority is to help SMEs digitise their operations and diversify their retail channels by moving online, which in turn, helps the economy,\u201d said Liu, who is also Lazada\u2019s regional head of commercial, in a recent online press conference. E-commerce in Southeast Asia is at a nascent stage and the entrepreneurs and merchants in the region are not as experienced as their peers in China, Liu said. \u201cHowever, they are fun and young, which makes them eager to learn new things.\u201d Regional brands such as Prism+ from Singapore, Signature Markets from Malaysia and Wardah from Indonesia will be participating in 11.11, with many of them promoting their products online for the first time this year. Lazada has noted the different demand dynamics in its markets as online shopping in the region surged amid the pandemic. \u201cDemand is more relative to the size of population and the maturity of the e-commerce cultures in our six key markets,\u201d Liu said. For example, while Indonesia is the biggest market across the Lazada platform in terms of the number of buyers, the Philippines sees the highest annual growth in gross merchandise volume.  The pandemic has led to higher demand for certain products due to lockdown measures such as chairs and printers. As such, Lazada is stocking up these products for 11.11, Liu said. This year, more than 350,000 brands and sellers across Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam are joining Lazada\u2019s 11.11 event with international brands Lanc\u00f4me, Marks & Spencer, Miniso, Swatch, and Top Shop participating for the first time. Ahead of the event, Lazada has been extending support to over 150,000 local brands and sellers to tap on its sales opportunities such as free online sales training courses, Liu said. It is also providing stimulus packages through cash funds to subsidise start-up costs, and helping small- and medium-sized enterprises to optimise cash flow by partnering with financial institutions, she added. To lend star glitter to 11.11, South Korean actor Lee Min-ho \u2013 Lazada\u2019s first regional brand ambassador \u2013 is helping to promote the event. Among Lee\u2019s promotional activities is a related TV commercial in partnership with Lazada\u2019s brand ambassadors across Southeast Asia \u2013 Agnez Monika and Verrel Bramasta in Indonesia, Ayda Jebat in Malaysia, Kathryn Bernardo in the Philippines, Bella Ranee Campen in Thailand and Chi Pu in Vietnam.   Story continues   South Korean actor Lee Min-ho is Lazada's first regional brand ambassador. (PHOTO: Lazada)  Lazada has just launched its 11.11 exclusive game, Happy Bounce, across Southeast Asia on its gaming platform LazGames. Players can win Lazada coins and vouchers with almost US$2 million worth of rewards from over 5,000 brands and sellers available for redemption.The highlight of the event will be Lazada\u2019s 11.11 Super Show to be held in all its key markets except Singapore, where shoppers stand to win exclusive vouchers.\u201cIn the 12 months ended July, we served more than 80 million annual active consumers so we expect similar demand and very good results for our biggest one-day sale of the year,\u201d Liu said.Related stories:Alibaba CMO Chris Tung: Pandemic underscores need for merchants to embrace digitalisationChina retail sales return to growth, economic recovery continuesExpansion key to emerging stronger from coronavirus crisis: ShopBack CEO  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Public transport operator SBS Transit has reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $46.1 million for the 3QFY2020 ended September, down 10.3% from the $51.4 million reported a year ago.  Revenue for the quarter fell 17.0% y-o-y to $302.0 million mainly due to lower service fee, lower rail ridership and lower advertising revenue. Revenue for its Public Transport Services and Other Commercial Services segments fell 15.7% y-o-y and 45.5% y-o-y for the 3QFY2020. Operating costs fell 16.6% y-o-y to $282.5 million mainly due to lower staff costs that were mitigated by government reliefs, as well as lower costs from fuel, electricity, repairs and maintenance. Operating profit fell 23.1% y-o-y to $19.5 million while profit after tax (PAT) fell 3.3% y-o-y to $19.4 million. Without the Covid-19 government reliefs of $23.6 million, SBS says it would have recorded an operating loss of $4.04 million for the quarter. Year-to-date (y-t-d) ended September, SBS Transit reported a 18.4% y-o-y decline in EBITDA to $159.8 million. Revenue for the same period fell 15.7% y-o-y to $1.07 billion. Operating profit y-t-d fell 30.5% y-o-y to $51.7 million. Without the reliefs of $85.2 million, SBS would have logged losses of $33.4 million year-to-date.  Q-o-q, 3QFY2020 EBITDA was up 5.8% while revenue for the quarter rose 14.3%. For more stories about where the money flows,\u00a0click here\u00a0for our Capital section SBS says most of its bus services that were suspended during the circuit breaker period from April to June have resumed since Phase One of the re-openings. Its Night Owl and Cross Border Bus services will remain suspended till the end of 2020. The company adds that there was a gradual increase in daily ridership on the Downtown Line (DTL) and the North East Line (NEL) after the circuit breaker measures ended. As at end September, ridership for DTL and NEL stood 53% and 60% levels pre-Covid-19 respectively. In the same update, the Public Transport Council (PTC) says it will not grant any fare adjustments in this year\u2019s Fare Review Exercise (FRE) to help commuters mitigate the impact of Covid-19. The maximum allowance fare adjustment computed for FRE 2020 of 4.4% will be rolled over to the next FRE in 2021, it says. Other commercial services remain slow in its recovery due to the poor economic outlook. As at end September, total assets for SBS rose 3.8% y-o-y to $1.18 billion mainly due to the increase in short-term deposits and bank balances. This was partially offset by the depreciation of vehicles, premises and equipment.

Unusual Parasitic Insect Swims Underwater to Make Prey of Caterpillars for Its Larvae (Watch Video)         Team Latestly   7 November 2020 2 min read          There's a new discovery of a parasitic critter from Japan called the 'Godzilla wasp.' And while the name may sound monstrous, it has been called so after watching its ability to swim underwater and attack on its prey, the underwater caterpillars. In a first-of-a-kind sight, scientists have captured the wasp going underwater to attack its prey. There are very few species of wasp that can turn aquatic which makes this find an interesting one. Details of this unsual parasitic wasp have been published in the the Journal of Hymenoptera Research. Let us understand more about this newly discovered critter. But don't worry, they are not as dangerous as the murder hornets.  Also Read | Hairy Scary! Venomous Puss Caterpillars Spotted in Virginia; Know About These Creepy and One of The Dangerous Caterpillars in US Dr. Jose Fernandez-Triana of the Canadian National Collection of Insects and his team found this parasite during their research. They observed that this wasp could dive in water for a few seconds, attack on the underwater caterpillar larvae and forces it out of the shell. Once the caterpillar is out, the wasp then lays its own eggs on the body of its unsuspecting prey. These eggs stay latched on the caterpillar and use it as their food source, devouring it as hey eventually grow! Wasps are not keen of water and there are only two known species that are aquatic.

Talking about the name Dr. Jose said it reminded them of the Japanese fiction series icon Godzilla, the monster that emerges from the water. \"We had biological, behavioral and cultural reasons to justify our choice of a name,\" Fernandez-Triana said in a statement.

Mention a bank, and most people would picture an austere row of counters, manned by busy tellers running to and from the outlet\u2019s backroom vault. But at DBS\u2019s new Takashimaya branch, there is barely a single counter in sight. With most transactions now taking place on self-service banking machines, a single branch can be run by just two or three staff armed with tablets.  The new branch represents the first step in DBS\u2019s journey to redefine branch banking for the digital age. With 95% of regular DBS banking transactions now done digitally via DBS\u2019s digibank mobile app or digibank online, the bank is now moving towards reconfiguring its physical branches to meet the needs of an increasingly digital-savvy customer base. Branches will now focus on providing assistance in using these online services and providing personal financial planning services. \u201cSix years after we launched our digitalisation strategy, we\u2019re seeing an unprecedented boom in digital banking adoption with customers shifting en masse to digital platforms amid Covid-19,\u201d remarks Shee Tse Koon, DBS Singapore Country Head. He observed that monthly average visits per branch fell 15% since Covid-19 while monthly over-the-counter cash deposits and withdrawals per branch fell 22%. \u201cThe pandemic has irrevocably changed the way most of us bank and has undeniably been a catalyst for us to transform further in order to cater to these rapidly shifting needs. Our aim is to provide banking solutions that ensure customers\u2019 lives and their access to both digital and physical banking services remain undisrupted,\u201d Shee continues. The new branch\u2019s new look aims to maximise safe distancing and includes safety features that can protect both customers and staff. Smaller staff numbers, moreover, support efforts towards social distancing.  The addition of more self-service machines, the bank adds, will also allow for access to branch services beyond traditional hours and round-the-clock where possible. Customers can use these machines to access services previously available over the counter only such as cash deposit of business earnings and ATM/debit card replacements. Reduced turnaround time also means that the new branches can now be more space-efficient than existing outlets.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOur new branches will therefore complement our digital banking services to provide what we call a \u2018phygital\u2019 banking experience that retains our \u2018human touch\u2019 in the form of face-to-face assistance and consultations,\u201d Shee explains.\u00a0 \u00a0 DBS intends to re-outfit at least one-third of its bank\u2019s branch network over the next 12-18 months. Outlets will be located in both the heartlands and in retail malls, with data analytics employed to identify locations where these new branches can have the most impact. POSB outlets will also be undergoing similar makeovers.   Story continues Towards digital inclusivity\u00a0Now attempts at revamping traditional approaches to branch banking are not new. OCBC bank, for instance, rolled out its youth-driven FRANK concept in 2011 to create a retail experience that youths and young working adults are familiar with, while UOB has similarly launched Hangout@UOB in 2020. DBS itself experimented with a similar concept through its DBS Remix branches at *SCAPE and the National University of Singapore.But where DBS\u2019s latest initiative differs from these is its desire to develop a more inclusive banking experience that can reach out to a more general audience. To that end, the bank has opted not to create a separate brand for this new concept, with all new outlets carrying the livery of DBS and eventually, POSB too. DBS sees these new branches as \u201cdigital bridges\u201d to connect all Singaporeans to a more digitalised banking experience.Consequently, DBS is strongly committed to ensuring that older Singaporeans will be able to use these new branches effectively. The bank has been working with IMDA since 2014 to reach out to 300,000 seniors unfamiliar with digital tools through workshops and digital literacy programmes. These workshops not only teach attendees about the basics of digital banking, but also work to improve awareness of financial scammers who prey on the elderly. Digital ambassadors are also on site to help less tech-savvy customers navigate the machines.\u201cWhile many people are benefitting from the ease and convenience of digital banking, we are also cognisant that the less digitally-savvy, including some seniors, have yet to make the digital leap. As the bank that serves most of Singapore, it is our responsibility to ensure that everyone has easy access to banking,\u201d says Shee. He sees the new branch concept as a key contribution to Singapore\u2019s goal to become a Smart Nation.But improving financial inclusivity also involves redefining how people understand banking and financial services as well. The new Takashimaya branch is co-located with a Guardian outlet, with the bank seeking to frame financial health as a key part of personal wellness. It features colourful interactive displays that passers-by can interact with, such as a \u201cFace your Future\u201d wall that helps users reimagine their \u201cdream retirement\u201d, and a \u201cFinancial Pharmacy\u201d offering bite-sized financial advice packaged in the shape of pharmaceutical products.At the back of the branch is also a small auditorium where DBS hopes to hold workshops on financial literacy and wellness topics as a form of community outreach in conjunction with Guardian. The branch manager even organised a virtual yoga session for customers to elevate their physical wellness as well. By reinventing finance as key to one\u2019s well being, DBS\u2019s new branch concept could be the spark that transforms retail banking in Singapore into a lifestyle industry.See Also:Moderna says Covid-19 vaccine is 94.5% effective in a preliminary analysis Biden's Covid-19 advisers say implementation of nationwide lockdown only as 'last resort' Singapore\u2019s millennials 'most optimistic' on Covid-19 recovery, says UOB Covid-19 bug lingers in Centurion as revenue slips by 11% in 3Q2020 Local gamblers drive Genting Singapore back into the black with 3Q earnings of $54.5 million   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

It did so to provide a fuller picture to fans - about how the new Radeon RX 6000 cards perform and how they stack up against a range of opposition GPUs.\nOn the Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards launch day, Wednesday last week, the HEXUS editor shared all the comparative performance charts AMD had supplied us with at the time. The selected charts showed one AMD GPU pitted against an Nvidia GPU which AMD saw as the direct competitor, in an FPS bar chart for the 10 AAA games titles.\n\nThe 10 games in this new more detailed release are the same but now you can compare all of the AMD Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards against the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090, GeForce RTX 3080, and previous gen GeForce RTX 2080 Ti on a per game/resolution basis. Thus, on this AMD gaming graphics benchmark page, you pick a game from the dropdown menu, choose a target resolution (1440p or 2160p), check the quality settings, and the API settings and compare all six of the above mention cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree examples from the comparison tool.\nI've embedded some of the example comparison charts above but it is worth a poke about the benchmarks on AMD's site yourself if you are interested in these graphics cards and any of the 10 games (Battlefield V, Borderlands 3, CoD: Modern Warfare, The Division 2, Doom Eternal, Forza Horizon 4, Gears 5, Resident Evil 3, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and Wolfenstein Youngblood) in particular.\n\nRemember you will have to wait until Wednesday 18th Nov for third party independent reviews and benchmarks for the AMD Radeon RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT. The more powerful AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT arrives on Tuesday, 8th December. We have recently seen AMD's AIB partners share some of their launch designs. AMD will be busy this week with the release of the first quartet of AMD Ryzen 5000 Series processors for desktop PCs, on Thursday, 5th November.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nAMD sales up 54 per cent, beats analyst expectations\nAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT Halo Infinite graphics card revealed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 21 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

The green team took the wraps off these new HPC products at the SC20 virtual conference yesterday. It builds on the technology unveiled in Jensen Huang's kitchen (AKA the GTC digital keynote) back in May, so, yes these new products are based upon the Ampere architecture that has only recently begun filtering down to consumers (is the filter blocked?).\n\n\"DGX Station A100 brings AI out of the data centre with a server-class system that can plug in anywhere,\" said Charlie Boyle, VP and GM of DGX systems at Nvidia. \"Teams of data science and AI researchers can accelerate their work using the same software stack as Nvidia DGX A100 systems, enabling them to easily scale from development to deployment.\"\nAccording to Nvidia the new DGX Station is the world's only petascale workgroup server. With four A100 GPU cards inside, talking to each other via NVLink, it delivers up to 2.5 petaflops of AI performance. The quad-A100 system has up to 320GB of HBM2e at its disposal if a customer selects the new A100 GPU cards with 80GB on each. Compared with previous gen DGX Stations, Nvidia says the latest iteration is between 3x and 4x faster in AI workloads.\n\nSpecial mention is given to multi-instance GPU (MIG) as being a particular attraction of the DGX Station. Thanks to this tech a single DGX Station A100 provides up to 28 separate GPU instances to run parallel jobs and support multiple users without impacting system performance, it is claimed.\nNvidia already has customers using new DGX Station machines to power AI and data science projects. Some examples include; BMW using the DGX Station for operational level improvements, Lockheed Martin using the DGX Stations for workplace safety and cost reductions, and NTT Docomo using the workstations to develop AI-driven services for customers.\n\nIf the DGX Station workstation isn't beefy enough for your needs, Nvidia is also producing a new DGX A100 640GB system (yes, it uses eight A100 cards), and these can be integrated into SuperPODs allowing organisations to roll out turnkey supercomputers combining up to twenty DGX A100 systems.\nThe Nvidia DGX Station A100 and Nvidia DGX A100 640GB systems will be available this quarter through the usual partners.

Have AMD ever been in a lawsuit tussle with Nvidia?

Brent crude futures for January dropped 14 cents, or 0.3%, to $43.61 a barrel by 0142 GMT having lost 0.2% on Tuesday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for December slid 25 cents, or 0.6%, to $41.18 a barrel, reversing a 0.2% gain on Tuesday.  The American Petroleum Institute (API) said on Tuesday that U.S. crude inventories rose by 4.2 million barrels last week, well above analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a build of 1.7 million barrels. \"A higher build in U.S. crude stockpiles prompted selling as it fanned fears of slow recovery in fuel demand,\" said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, general manager of research at Nissan Securities. \"Still, hopes that OPEC+ will keep existing cuts further into 2021, or even increase the cuts, underpinned prices,\" he said. Kikukawa predicted WTI will stay boxed into a range of $39 and $44 a barrel until a full meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Nov. 30. To tackle weaker energy demand amid a new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Saudi Arabia called on fellow members of the OPEC+ grouping - OPEC and other producers including Russia - to be flexible in responding to oil market needs as it builds the case for a tighter production policy in 2021. OPEC+ held a ministerial committee meeting on Tuesday that made no formal recommendation. OPEC+ members are leaning towards delaying a previously agreed plan to boost output by 2 million barrels per day (bpd), or 2% of global demand, in January in an effort to support the market, sources told Reuters early this week. Supporting the case for a tighter supply policy next year, OPEC and its allies have revised oil demand scenarios for 2021 with demand seen weaker than previously anticipated, a confidential document seen by Reuters shows.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

As you can see the headlining new from Nvidia is that the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is faster than the previous gen RTX 2080 Super. That achievement seems pretty consistent across gaming and 3D rendering. Moreover the new 3060 Ti is a significant leg-up compared to the RTX 2060 Super that one might say that it succeeds.\n\nThe slide isn't that easy to read, even if you click to view it at 100 per cent. The smallest text at the foot of the slide appears to say that all tests were run at 1440p with max settings in a system packing an Intel Core i9-10900K at stock clocks.\nMoving on, wouldn't it be good to see the as yet unannounced GeForce RTX 3060 Ti specs confirmed? Thanks to Inno3D we now have what should reliably be the final shipping specs for the first AIB models. The key GPU specs, which appear to confirm earlier leaks, are 4,864 CUDA cores, with 152 Tensor cores, and 38 RT cores. GPU base clock is 1.41GHz, and it boosts to 1.67GHz. Meanwhile, the 8GB of GDDR6 memory, on a 256-bit bus, delivers 448GB/s bandwidth. It is expected to be a sub-200W graphics card. Currently the rumour mill points to a release date of Wednesday, 2nd December \u2013 just over a fortnight from now.\n\nIt looks like Inno3D is preparing at least two GeForce RTX 3060 Ti models, based upon its iChill x3 and Twin x2 cooler designs.

(Photo: Getty Images)   By Karl Lester M. Yap The Philippine peso, which lagged behind its peers in Asia this quarter, may get a boost in December with millions of Filipinos abroad set to send record amounts of money home to help families suffering from the pandemic and the recent typhoons. December is seasonally a month of strength for the peso, with the currency gaining in the period in five of the past six years. It is also the month when remittances, which totaled more than $30 billion in 2019, reached their highest levels for the year since 2009.  \u201cWith increased unemployment as a result of the pandemic and the impact of the typhoons, we expect extra remittances in order to support families at home,\u201d said Wouter van Eijkelenburg, an economist at Rabobank in the Netherlands. \u201cThis would support the strength of the peso.\u201d The peso will edge higher to 48.08 per dollar over the next three months, according to Rabobank. It has risen 0.8% this quarter to 48.10, lagging behind some Asian currencies. Rising Inflows Remittances, the nation\u2019s largest source of foreign exchange after exports, unexpectedly climbed 9.3% in September from a year earlier, the fastest pace in more than two years. That\u2019s despite the repatriation of more than 300,000 workers from abroad who\u2019ve lost their jobs due to the pandemic. The overall flow of money from workers abroad to the Philippines are estimated to drop by 5% in 2020, taking into consideration of those who have returned to the country, according to the World Bank. Still, as the major year-end holidays approach, coupled with the recent typhoons, it is possible that funds to the country will show resilience, said Dilip Ratha, World Bank lead economist on migration and remittances in Washington D.C.  For some, it\u2019s not as though the Philippine currency has overcome all the headwinds. The peso may continue to lag behind regional peers given the Philippine economy is more domestically-oriented and less sensitive to bouts of risk-on from external factors, said Yanxi Tan, a strategist at Malayan Banking Bhd. in Singapore. It also depends on whether the recent tapering in daily virus cases in the Philippines can be sustained, Tan said. Still, coupled with the remittance support, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.\u2019s Terence Wu expects foreign flows to the nation\u2019s stock market will start to pick up as vaccine progress boosts global appetite for risk assets. \u201cThese developments should be positive for the peso going into the year-end,\u201d said Wu, a currency strategist at OCBC in Singapore. \u00a9 2020 Bloomberg L.P.

In recent hours various sources have spotted benchmarks of this mid-range graphics card, which is expected to cost about US$399/ UK\u00a3349. The benchmarks include a Crazy 1080p run in Ashes of The Singularity (AoTS) and various Geekbench graphics tests. It is worth noting that we have already seen what looks to be a genuine Nvidia presentation slide charting the performance of the RTX 3060 Ti against both the 2060 Super and 2080 Super in a number of AAA games with RTX On and off.\nStarting with the newly unearthed AoTS run, you can see how the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti fits in the stack next to a stablemate, the RTX 3070, and vs rivals like the AMD Radeon RX 6800 and 6800 XT.\n\nThe RTX 3060 Ti score in the AoTS benchmark is about 14 per cent down from the RTX 3070. However, we expect the price of the upcoming entrant to the RTX 30 Series to be 25 per cent lower. It doesn't really challenge the AMD RDNA 2 GPUs in this test, so perhaps an upcoming Radeon RX 6700/X will be the price/perf competitor to the RTX 3060 Ti.\n\nSerial leakster Tum Apisak has shared some Geekbench data which appears to come from someone testing the RTX 3060 Ti in said benchmark suite. An info page from the program confirms some key configuration details \u2013 4,864 CUDA cores, GPU clock of 1.67GHZ, and 8GB of 14Gbps memory.\n\nLooking at the OpenCL rendering benchmark results, for example, you can see that the RTX 3060 Ti packing system achieves a score of 123,279. Check here for OpenCL score comparisons and you will see this score is nipping at the heels of the AMD Radeon RX 6800 (124,065), and 7 per cent slower than the RTX 3070 (132,046).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 17 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

And NVIDIA is at the forefront of this field, bringing gamers, scientists and creators incredible advancements.\nWith Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), NVIDIA set out to redefine real-time rendering through AI-based super resolution - rendering fewer pixels, then using AI to construct sharp, higher resolution images, giving gamers previously unheard-of performance gains.\nPowered by dedicated AI processors on GeForce RTX GPUs called Tensor Cores, DLSS has accelerated performance in more than 25 games to date, boosting frame rates significantly, ensuring GeForce RTX gamers receive high-performance gameplay at the highest resolutions and detail settings, and when using immersive ray-traced effects. And now, NVIDIA has delivered four new DLSS titles for gamers to enjoy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War\nActivision\u2019s blockbuster launched November 13th with ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex, NVIDIA Ansel, and NVIDIA Highlights!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay tracing introduced an extra level of visual refinement to the cinematic campaign and Multiplayer, with ray-traced shadows and ambient occlusion shading taking graphical fidelity to 11.\nNVIDIA DLSS boosted frame rates by up to 85% at 4K on our range of GeForce RTX graphics cards, for the fastest, highest-fidelity Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War experience possible:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd with NVIDIA Reflex, system latency was reduced by up to 20%. For a deeper dive into each of these enhancements, and the PC edition of the game, head to our dedicated article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWar Thunder\nGaijin Entertainment\u2019s War Thunder is an extremely popular free-to-play, cross-platform PvP game, dedicated to aviation, armoured vehicles, and naval craft from World War II and the Cold War. Players use aircraft, attack helicopters, tanks and naval ships to compete in battle, and with the launch of the game\u2019s \u201cNew Power\u201d update, these battles now look even better thanks to the addition of new and improved effects and features, detailed here.\nAlso included in the New Power update is NVIDIA DLSS, which accelerates performance in the game by up to 30% at 4K:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a look at War Thunder\u2019s NVIDIA DLSS performance-accelerating technology in the video below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnlisted\nDarkflow Software\u2019s Enlisted is an online squad-based first person MMO shooter covering key battles from World War II, with ground forces, tanks, aircraft, and more. In recent days, the game has entered into Closed Beta, which you can participate in, and with that launch came the introduction of NVIDIA DLSS support, boosting frame rates by up to 55% at 4K:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see DLSS in action in Enlisted, check out our video:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady or Not\nVoid Interactive\u2019s Ready or Not is inspired by the classic S.W.A.T. games of old, giving you command of highly trained officers in single-player and multiplayer.\nAn ongoing alpha has received a new update, adding support for ray-traced reflections, ray-traced shadows, ray-traced ambient occlusion shading, and NVIDIA DLSS, which accelerates performance by up to 120% at 4K with the new ray-traced effects enabled:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s Much More To Come\nThese titles join the ever-growing list of games enhanced with NVIDIA technology that makes the experiences of GeForce gamers even better.\nMore integrations of NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex and ray tracing are in the works, including in the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077, and we can\u2019t wait to tell you more about them!

service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA fixes severe flaw in GeForce NOW cloud gaming service\n\n\n                            By Sergiu Gatlan\n\n\n\n\nNovember 11, 2020\n11:40 AM\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA released\u00a0a security update for the GeForce Now cloud gaming\u00a0Windows\u00a0app to address a vulnerability\u00a0that could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or escalate privileges on systems running unpatched\u00a0software.\nGeForce Now is a cloud-based game streaming service that allows users over 80 countries with paid subscriptions to stream free-to-play or games they own, in real-time,\u00a0from a\u00a0library of hundreds of titles\u00a0hosted on NVIDIA's servers.\nNVIDIA's cloud gaming service can be used by customers who\u00a0own NVIDIA Shield, desktop (macOS, Microsoft Windows, and ChromeOS), or mobile (Android) devices via dedicated apps.\nHigh severity flaw fixed in the Windows app\nNVIDIA has fixed today a high severity vulnerability (CVE\u20112020\u20115992) in all versions of the Windows GeForce Now app prior to 2.0.25.119\u00a0to prevent local attackers from elevating their privileges or executing code after successful exploitation.\nThe\u00a0vulnerability was reported by\u00a0Qihoo 360 CERT's Hou\u00a0JingYi and it was found in the\u00a0OpenSSL library, one of GeForce Now's open-source software dependencies.\nWhile this flaw\u00a0requires\u00a0attackers to have local user access and thus it cannot be exploited remotely, it can still be abused using malicious tools deployed on systems running vulnerable app versions as NVIDIA explains in a security advisory published today.\nCVE IDs\nDescription\nBase Score\nVector\nCVE\u20112020\u20115992\nNVIDIA GeForce NOW application software on Windows contains a vulnerability in its open-source software dependency in which the OpenSSL library is vulnerable to binary planting attacks by a local user, which may lead to code execution or escalation of privileges.\n7.3\nAV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\nAttacks that would exploit this bug\u00a0are of low complexity and require low privileges that provide basic user capabilities.\nLuckily, any attacks designed to abuse the\u00a0CVE\u20112020\u20115992 vulnerability also need user interaction before successful exploitation.\nNVIDIA says\u00a0that the \"risk assessment is based on an average of risk across a diverse set of installed systems and may not represent the true risk of your local installation.\"\nThe company also advises \"consulting a security or IT professional to evaluate the risk to your specific configuration.\"\nApplying\u00a0the GeForce Now security update\nTo apply the\u00a0security update and protect your system, you have to open the\u00a0Windows GeForce Now app to have it automatically downloaded and then follow the instructions to install it (the app\u00a0requires admin privileges to update itself).\nIf you cannot run the app as an admin user, you can also\u00a0manually update it by removing it using these instructions and then\u00a0installing\u00a0the latest software version (i.e., 2.0.25.119).\nLast month, NVIDIA also fixed high severity vulnerabilities in the\u00a0Windows NVIDIA GeForce Experience (GFE) app that could allow\u00a0attackers to\u00a0gain access to sensitive info, trigger a denial of service (DoS) state,\u00a0escalate privileges, or\u00a0execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\u00a9 Techniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\nGoogle fixes Android kernel

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nChip designer NVIDIA Corporation has released its earnings release for the third quarter of the fiscal year 2021. NVIDIA has reported $4.7 billion in revenue as it beats its own guidance set at the end of the second quarter and estimates put in place by Wall Street analysts prior to today's release. Additionally, the revenue posted by the company for its previous quarter marks 22% sequential and a staggering 57% year-over-year growth as the company witnessed strong growth in its bread and butter gaming and rapidly expanding data center segments.\nNVIDIA Grows Gaming Revenues By \u00a037% Sequentially and Year Over Year - Attributes Some Growth To RTX 30 GPU Lineup\nEven as it struggled with supply constraints after launching the highly anticipated GeForce RTX 30 graphics processing unit (GPU) series in September, NVIDIA has still managed to post 37% sequential and year-over-year growth in its gaming segment. This segment, which is responsible for having put the company in its current market position accounted for almost half (~49%) of the company's revenues during the third quarter.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostNVIDIA's chief financial officer, Ms. Collette Kress, in her comments accompanying today's earnings release revealed some details behind this growth. Most of it, according to her, is attributed to the vast shifts in entertainment and work applications this year due to lockdowns resulting from the ongoing global pandemic. Some of it, however, is also attributed to gaming GPUs and systems-on-chips (SoCs)\nLooks like the Nintendo Switch has helped NVIDIA during its third quarter, as the company is reporting revenue from console SoCs as helping it to grow gaming sales. This isn't surprising, as Switch's maker Nintendo Corporation had revealed just last week that the console had sold more than 22.5 million units in the United States to date.\nMore importantly, Nintendo's popular console had sold more than 735,000 units last month in the U.S, as it became the second best selling gaming console in the month bested only by the Nintendo Wii's sales figures for October 2008. As NVIDIA's third quarter ended on October 25th this year, it's clear that the Switch has helped it grow gaming revenues.\nAdditionally, NVIDIA is also reporting that desktop GPU sales were helped by the GeForce RTX 30 GPU lineup, but as always, no specific product-level data for these sales are available.\nData Center revenues were NVIDIA's second-largest source of sales in the third quarter of the company's fiscal year 2021. Image: Nvidia Corporation NVIDIA QUARTERLY REVENUE TREND REVENUE BY MARKETS Q3 FY2021\nMellanox Contributes Roughly 30% To NVIDIA's Data Center Sales In 3Q FY2021 Maintaining Trend From Previous Quarter\nFollowing Gaming was Data Center which accounted for 40% of NVIDIA's total revenues with the two segments contributing to approximately 90% of all of the company's net sales during the third quarter of 2021. In this segment, NVIDIA grew revenue by a staggering 162% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, as sales of the company's first-generation DGX A100 system marked their first full quarter of market presence.\nData Center too benefited from the changing trends this year revealed Ms. Kress, but the CFO also outlined that NVIDIA's acquisition of Mellanox accounted for roughly 30% (approximately one-third in NVIDIA's words) of its Data Center revenues. Factor out the revenues from this deal and the non-Mellanox Data Center sales sit at ~$1.3 billion for a roughly 83% growth year-over-year growth.\nCommenting on bottom line profits before moving to crucial fourth-quarter guidance, NVIDIA raked in $1.3 billion in net income, with this metric growing slower than the company's share price has over the past couple of years. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.91/share also beat Wall Street analyst estimates, rounding up a quarter of strong performance for the company.\nFinally, NVIDIA also provided guidance for its fourth quarter, which includes the company's expectations from its recently launched GPUs. According to its own estimates, NVIDIA expects to report $4.8 billion in revenue at the end of this quarter, and should the company achieve precisely this, then it will have grown revenues by 58% year-over-year in Q4, mirroring the growth achieved during the last quarter.\nAfter its shares closed at $537.15 today, they jumped to $545 at 16:20 EST today before dropping to $534.95 at 17:06, slightly below the closing price.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n189\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n81\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Reaches 45% GPU Market Share In Japan, Achieving Peak Market Share And Is Even Aiming Higher\n\n\n\n59\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nResident Evil 9 Is Taking so Long to Release Because It Is a Reinvention of the Series \u2013 Rumor\n\n\n\n53\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1472\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1162\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1157\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

It looks like all of us are in for a long wait as NVIDIA has once again stated that it will take a few more months for supply to get better.\nNVIDIA Says GeForce RTX 30 Series Supply With Take a Few More Months To Catch Up With Demand, Sales Exceeded Turing 'GeForce RTX 20' Launch\nBoth, NVIDIA's CEO and CFO talked about the whole situation surrounding the availability of the GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards during the earnings call for Q3 FY2021. The company earned a record $4.7 Billion in Revenue with the Gaming segment coming back strong and reporting $2.27 Billion in Revenue.\nRelated Story Watch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For UnveilingNVIDIA is still putting the blame on industry-wide capacity constraints and long cycle times and it looks like this might be true as GPUs & CPUs from the other camp aren't doing any great either in terms of availability. Before we talk about that, the following is what NVIDIA's CFO had to say:\n\u201cGiven industry-wide capacity constraints and long cycle times, it may take a few more months for product availability to catch up with demand,\u201d\nNVIDIA CFO - Colette Kress (via PCMag)\nNVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, mentioned that they can only do so much in a constrained world in which we live right now. Despite Ampere being one of the fastest GPU ramps ever, the demand was just way too overwhelming, something which NVIDIA might have severely underestimated & it still is due to which it will take NVIDIA months for its GeForce RTX 30 series supply to catch up with the demand.\n\nJensen had already stated that shortages for the GeForce RTX 30 series are going to last until 2021 and we might get to see more inventory being added by retailers around Q1/Q2 2021. We can only expect that would be the case as NVIDIA has several more products going to be added to their RTX 30 series lineup in January, as per leaks.\n\"Our growth is, in the near term, is more affected by the cycle time of manufacturing and flexibility of supply,\"\n\"We are in a good shape and all of our supply informs our guidance, but we would appreciate shorter cycle times\u2014we would appreciate more agile supply chains. But, the world is constrained at the moment. And so, we just have to make the best of it. But, even in that condition, all of that is building for our guidance, and we expect to grow.\"\nNVIDIA CEO - Jensen Huang (via PCGamer)\nAMD's recently launched Radeon RX 6800 series graphics cards experienced similar or even worse launch supply than the GeForce RTX 30 series with the cards not only going out of stock within few minutes but several retailers didn't even receive their stock on time.\n\nPaper launch has always meant to me no supply. We are producing chips & cards in volume. The demand for gaming devices has grown exponentially this year & beyond anyone's best forecasts. We want nothing more than to put more cards in the hands of gamers. Working to do so.\n\u2014 Frank Azor (@AzorFrank) November 18, 2020\n\nWe can hope that things get better by early 2021 so gamers who have been waiting for years to get new high-end graphics cards can easily grab and enjoy the latest titles. For once, you definitely will require a new high-end graphics card to play next-generation titles such as the hotly anticipated CyberPunk 2077 which hits streets this December (if no more delays occur) but these supply issues will definitely be a major burden in your gaming choices if you don't already have a powerful GPU in your PC.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n55\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n49\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n49\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n41\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n37\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

But AMD was holding back, revving its engines only to drop the clutch and zoom towards team green. After years, Nvidia and AMD are going at it neck and neck, each bringing very powerful and capable cards to market.\u00a0For consumers, increased competition is a good thing. It was fear of what AMD could bring with Vega that Nvidia released the 1080 Ti, a graphics card so good that many of its users forwent upgrading to the 2000 series. And Nvidia even priced the RTX 3080 aggressively, hoping that any affront by AMD would be blunted.\u00a0The best gaming PCs to buy nowOur picks for the best gaming laptopsWhere to buy AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT \u2014 check US and UK stock hereWell, AMD isn\u2019t here to play. To take on the RTX 3080, AMD will be bringing out the Radeon RX 6800 XT. On paper, it performs at or slightly above the RTX 3080, while being $50 less and including six more GBs of memory. Things just got interesting.Here\u2019s a breakdown of everything you need to know about Nvidia RTX 3080 vs AMD RX 6800 XT.Nvidia RTX 3080 vs AMD RX 6800 XT: Price and availability\u00a0The Nvidia RTX 3080 launched on September 17th, and sells for $699. However, Nvidia\u2019s new card has been nearly impossible to find since it first came out, with many scalpers selling it online at exorbitant prices.The RX 6800 XT is due out on November 18, and will undercut the RTX 3080 by $50 with a price tag of $649. As such, we expect it to sell out similarly fast.Nvidia RTX 3080 vs AMD RX 6800: Specs compared\u00a0Swipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 AMD Radeon RX 6800 XTNvidia RTX 3080Price$649$699Compute Units72N/ACUDA CoresN/A8704Base ClockTBD1440 MHzGame Clock2015 MHzN/ABoost Clock2250 MHz1710 MHzMemory16GB GDDR610GB GDDR6XTDP300W TBP320W TDPMemory bus256-bit320-bitNvidia RTX 3080 vs AMD RX 6800 XT: Performance\u00a0While we wish we could give a definitive answer as to which card is most powerful, it\u2019s hard to say without independently testing for ourselves. So don\u2019t be swept away by internet hype as it\u2019s not uncommon for companies to fudge numbers to make its products more appealing.\u00a0Sign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Based on the graphs below, both cards are very similar. According to AMD, at 4K, both the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT perform on par with one another, with Nvidia pulling slightly ahead in some games while AMD edges out in others. Again, we don\u2019t know the exact test parameters, but if AMD is being fair in its testing, then both cards are comparable.\u00a0Likely, AMD is picking and choosing titles it knows it can eek out a performance edge against Nvidia. While AMD wasn\u2019t so crass as to only include games that it knew it could beat Nvidia at, we\u2019re not seeing total transparency here. For example, it\u2019s unclear whether or not ray tracing was turned on for these titles.(Image credit: AMD)On the graph above, we can see that AMD is pulling ahead against Nvidia in most benchmarks. It\u2019s a curious result, given how far ahead Nvidia has been in the graphics card race these past few years.\u00a0Hardcore Nvidia fans will know that team green has a lot more money than AMD. It means it can invest more in research and development, ultimately producing more powerful technology. According to Statista, Nvidia invested $2.8 billion in research and development during the 2020 fiscal year. By comparison, AMD has spent $508 million on R&D in 2020 so far. That\u2019s a massive schism.\u00a0So how is this possible? Well, it\u2019s likely that AMD was taking advantage of Smart Access Memory in these tests. Smart Access Memory is when an RX 6000 series GPU is coupled with a Ryzen 5000 series CPU, allowing the card to have full access to the GPUs GDDR6 memory. This will yield greater overall performance. It may only be a few percentage points, but it could be enough to give AMD the slight edge. Of course, this feature isn\u2019t available when coupled with an Intel CPU. And since Nvidia isn\u2019t in the consumer processor market, this kind of proprietary technological cross-talk can only happen if users are running total AMD hardware.\u00a0(Image credit: AMD)Nvidia RTX 3080 vs AMD RX 6800 XT: Architecture\u00a0Comparing AMD\u2019s RDNA 2 architecture to Nvidia\u2019s Ampere is like comparing \u2014 as much as I bemoan the clich\u0117 \u2014 apples and oranges. The two are based on different technologies, use different manufacturing processes, and use different metrics. Looking at which has the larger number proves little.\u00a0For this generation, AMD has added Ray Tracing hardware on its cards, with research and development collaboration with Microsoft. The goal for both companies has been to optimize DirectX 12 Ultimate, as evidenced by Microsoft\u2019s full hardware support on Xbox.\u00a0RDNA 2, like the original RDNA, is a 7 nanometer chipset, but with 50% performance per-watt improvement. Even though RDNA 2 is using the same manufacturing processes as last generation, AMD says its optimized data paths on the back end to eek out that increased performance per watt. There\u2019s also a 30% clock increase over last gen and it sticks to a 300 watt TDP.Ampere is Nvidia\u2019s architecture with the 3000 series of GPUs. It\u2019s made some major changes over last generation\u2019s Turing. Ampere chips, manufactured by Samsung, sit on an 8 nanometer process, a huge improvement over Turing\u2019s 12 nm. It does require a higher TDP at 350 watts. But over Turing, Ampere brings second generation Ray Tracing cores and third generation Tensor Cores, delivering two times the throughput. While Nvidia claimed in its presentations that 3080 would bring double the performance over 2080 Ti, it was more like a 30-70% increase, depending on the title. Even then, those are dramatic gains.\u00a0Nvidia has invested a significant amount of time and resources into making Ray Tracing a thing. It learned a lot from Turing, and is bringing that experience to Ampere. AMD, on the other hand, is just now getting in on the Ray Tracing game. According to some number crunching from VideoCardz, AMD\u2019s Ray Accelerators appear to be 33% slower than Nvidia\u2019s RT cores. This could prove to be significant once we get out hands on for full comparison testing.On the image upscaling side, AMD did unveil its Fidelity FX Super Resolution, a direct competitor to Nvidia\u2019s DLSS. While DLSS was shaky at first, it\u2019s come a long way, and can help games fake a smooth 4K-looking experience. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how Super Resolution matches up once review units are sent out.Nvidia RTX 3080 vs AMD RX 6800 XT: Memory\u00a0Let\u2019s assume that both the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT are exactly the same in performance. It\u2019s in memory, however, where AMD will pull ahead. While Nvidia was being miserly with the amount of memory included on its cards, only 10 GBs on the 3080, AMD is packing its cards with 16GBs worth of chips. But both Nvidia and AMD are using slightly different technologies.While AMD is sticking with GDDR6 memory, Nvidia has gone with Micron\u2019s GDDR6X, a memory technology that can push double the bandwidth. But Nvidia isn\u2019t clocking its memory at double. It will instead keep it at a lower clock speed while gaining the same level of performance. This can yield less heat, more overclocking capabilities, and of course, Nvidia could push out a patch to increase that frequency.\u00a0Even then, the RX 6800 XT is likely the better value, as that increased overhead can help in 4K gaming, high resolution video encoding and other GPU intensive applications.But the most curious addition to AMD\u2019s technological lineup is Smart Access Memory. Like mentioned above, it\u2019s the ability for both an RX 6000 series GPU \u00a0and a Ryzen 5000 series CPU to work in tandem to address all of the 6000 series GDDR6 memory. We\u2019re seeing a similar idea with the upcoming PS5 in which Sony has designed its chips to work together for greatest overall efficiency.\u00a0If this trend holds true, then it could mean that manufacturers will try and push custom ecosystems of computer hardware so users can obtain maximum performance. What\u2019s stopping AMD from creating custom RAM and SSDs? All of which can be optimized at the hardware level for greater overall performance. We wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Nvidia is trying to figure out a similar solution, which might be difficult as it isn\u2019t competing in the consumer desktop CPU space. Maybe a partnership with Intel?Nvidia RTX 3080 vs AMD RX 6800 XT: Outlook\u00a0It\u2019s a difficult time to be a PC gamer right now. There are amazing new cards on the market, but nobody can seem to find any. From long lines in front of Micro Centers to bots buying up all 3080 inventory only to sell on eBay, finding a GPU has been like searching for water in a drought.\u00a0Even then, if you see pre-orders for an RX 6800 XT, we still would recommend not clicking the Buy It Now button. Wait for independent testing before you drop $650 on a piece of hardware that might leave you disappointed, no matter how tempting it is.Today's best Graphics Cards deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $38.99View $63ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (1)\n\n\n\nImad KhanSocial Links NavigationImad is currently Senior Google and Internet Culture reporter for CNET, but until recently was News Editor at Tom's Guide.

They clearly show when they do use those methods in a separate graphic later on in their presentation:\n\n\n\nAlso, in the post video notes, they list exactly when SAM/RM is used or not:\n\n\nNow admittedly they could have gone the extra mile to say \"No SAM/RM used for this testing\" but it seems fairly clear where it is used and isn't. So it's misleading to suggest that they're hiding something without any evidence.\n\nAnd just for the record, I'm not an AMD fanboy, I currently use an GTX 1080.

Like tunnel vision, it can be easy to miss key areas where substantial improvements go unaddressed simply because of the limits of conventional computing and imaging technology.\nHowever, AI and deep-learning applications are closing this gap \u2014 creating new solutions where previous blindspots in efficacy, task management, and data science research remained beyond our reach.\nWhich is why NVIDIA is fast-tracking a new medical open network for AI \u2014 called MONAI \u2014 an open-source framework and domain-optimized healthcare solution, according to a pre-briefing event Interesting Engineering (IE) attended last week.\nThe go-to AI and supercomputing firm also unveiled updates on the forthcoming release of NVIDIA Clara \u2014 an AI-powered application framework designed to upgrade life sciences and healthcare sectors. Both MONAI and Clara will be available for early access in late December 2020.\nAnd there\u2019s more. NVIDIA also unveiled \u201cInception Alliance for Healthcare\u201d \u2014 a new program to accelerate medical startups via NVIDIA\u2019s AI toolset and healthcare industry partners.\nRELATED: NVIDIA\u2019S AI INFERENCE SMASHED PERFORMANCE RECORDS, MORE GPUs ACTIVE THAN CPUs\nSome of MONAI\u2019s pre-trained models include COVID-19 applications. Source:\u00a0NVIDIA\nNVIDIA debuts MONAI, open-network medical AI platform\nInitially introduced in April and already integrated into leading institutions of healthcare research, MONAI uses PyTorch to enhance the creation and execution of AI technology for medical imaging and data processing for domain-optimized applications, including life sciences.\nAmong MONAI\u2019s 20 pre-trained models are several new ones developed for the COVID-19 crisis, which include novel training optimizations on NVIDIA DGX A100 GPUs to support an acceleration in turnaround time at a factor of six.\n\u201cMONAI is becoming the PyTorch of healthcare, paving the way for closer collaboration between data scientists and clinicians,\u201d said Jayashree Kalpathy-Cramer \u2014 QTIM lab director at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at MGH, according to the press release. \u201cGlobal adoption of MONAI is fostering collaboration across the globe facilitated by federated learning.\u201d\nMONAI is rapidly becoming the deep-learning industry standard for healthcare. Source:\u00a0NVIDIA\nLinking community-driven science to commercial production\nSo far, industry adoption of MONAI into the healthcare ecosystem has seen success. Stanford, DKFZ, King\u2019s College London, Vanderbilt, and Mass General are among the early adopters of the AI framework for imaging in healthcare. MONAI has and continues to see use in several applications, including industry-shaping imaging competitions, and the first boot camp focused on the framework \u2014 held in September 2020, which gathered more than 550 registrants from 40 countries, in addition to undergraduate students.\n\u201cMONAI is quickly becoming the go-to deep learning framework for healthcare. Getting from research to production is critical for integration of AI applications into clinical care,\u201d said Professor Bennet Landman of Vanderbilt University, in the press release. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s commitment to community-driven science and allowing the academic community to contribute to a framework that is production-ready will allow for further innovation to build enterprise-ready features.\u201d\nThe newest version will help radiologists label 3D CT data, with one-tenth of the normal number of clicks. Source: NVIDIA\nNVIDIA Clara to enhance radiologists\u2019 imaging capacities\nNVIDIA Clara takes the latest advances in AI-assisted annotation, production deployment, and deployment to MONAI users throughout and beyond the healthcare industry.\nThe newest NVIDIA Clara version has an incredibly wide range of applications, from advanced theoretical research to the COVID-19 crisis. Source:\u00a0NVIDIA\nThe newest version will help radiologists label complex 3D CT data in one-tenth of the clicks \u2014 via a new model called DeepGrow 3D. Instead of the conventional and time-consuming method of segmenting lesion or organ images, one at a time or slice by slice \u2014 which may take 250 clicks for larger organs like the liver \u2014 NVIDIA Clara users can segment organs of interest with far fewer clicks, according to the press release.\nClara\u2019s AI-assisted annotation features are integrated with Fovia AI. Source: NVIDIA\nNVIDIA Clara\u2019s AI-assisted annotation tools \u2014 along with the new DeepGrow 3D feature \u2014 are integrated with Fovia AI\u2019s F.A.S.T. AI Annotation software, which enables users to label training data and enhance radiologists\u2019 reading capabilities. Fovia includes the XStream HVR SDK suite, allowing users to analyze DICOM images integrated with major industry PACS viewers.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Clara\u2019s AGX developer kit is already available via select partner developers. Source: NVIDIA\nAI models predict oxygen levels in COVID-19 patients\nAnnotating with AI assistance is crucial for accessing rich radiology datasets \u2014 a process recently used to label the public COVID-19 CT dataset, later published by The Cancer Imaging Archive at the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Additionally, this labeled dataset was used during the MICCAI-endorsed COVID-19 Lung CT Lesion Segmentation Challenge.\nResearch collaborations from 20 hospitals worldwide curated a generalized AI model tailored for COVID-19 patients.

According to the rumor, Nvidia is allegedly working on a GeForce Now web client that's compatible with the iOS version of the Safari browser. If the cloud service offers Fortnite, Epic could give Apple the finger and skip the App Store altogether. \nEpic may soon have a way to get Fortnite back on iPhones. On Thursday, the BBC reported that Nvidia is working on a version of its GeForce Now cloud gaming platform that will work on Apple's Safari mobile browser. If true, Epic will not only get its wildly popular game back into iPhone users' hands, but it will also circumvent the 30-percent Apple Tax in the process.\nBefore Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store last summer, there were reportedly more than 116 million players who played the game on iPhone, with 73 million playing the iOS version exclusively. That is a massive chunk of players that Epic stands to gain back.\nDon't get too excited just yet, though. Nvidia has not officially announced GeForce Now for mobile Safari, and the company declined to comment on the matter.\n\"Nvidia is not commenting on any new clients coming to the service, or on the availability of any game on unannounced or unreleased platforms,\" a spokesman told the BBC. \"Fortnite is not confirmed for GeForce Now on platforms beyond PC, Mac, and Android.\"\n\nCNBC reached out to Epic regarding the possibility of returning to iPhones via a mobile GeForce Now web client, but it was also reluctant to comment.\n\"We don't have a comment. The information has not been confirmed by Epic or Nvidia,\" a spokesperson said. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n iPhone 18 Pro could debut with under-display Face ID, smaller Dynamic Island \n\n\n\n Epic Games revokes lifetime bans for some Fortnite cheaters \n\n\n\nAdditionally, Apple may do something to prevent the move. Right now, there are no restrictions for creating and operating cloud gaming platforms on Safari for iOS, but that could change. Indeed, when asked if the company had any problems with Fortnite being played on iPhones through the GeForce Now Safari client, Apple pointed to a statement from August regarding App Store submissions.\n\n\"Our customers enjoy great apps and games from millions of developers, and gaming services can absolutely launch on the App Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable to all developers, including submitting games individually for review.\"\n\nCupertino's response skirts the issue since we are not talking about apps on the App Store, but it does sound like it is not keen on the idea. Given the bitter history between the two companies, it is hard to imagine Apple letting this happen, although it is unclear what it could do to prevent it.\nImage credit: Fortnite by Vladimka Production, GeForce Now by nikkimeel\n\n\n\n\n 6 comments\n \n192 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nValve opens up SteamOS, a new Windows alternative?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndie studios and homebrewers are still making great RPGs with 25-year-old toolkit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

In a tweet by Kopite7kimi, it is reported that NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is now being prepped as a direct competition to the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT graphics card, offering more memory and also much beefier specifications than the existing RTX 3080.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Reportedly Gets Huge Specs Boost, Same Cores as RTX 3090 With 20 GB VRAM To Tackle AMD's Radeon RX 6800 XT\nIt was recently reported that NVIDIA has started working on its GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and GeForce RTX 3070 Ti graphics cards, both of which will be rocking the GA102 GPU core and offer faster GPU performance with their meaty specifications. There were also reports that the original designs for the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and GeForce RTX 3070 Ti were canceled since they weren't on par with the competition, prompting NVIDIA to go back to the drawing board and reassess the specs.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\nRTX 3080 Ti FE:PG133-SKU15,GA102-250-KD-A1,20GB GD6X,the same FP32 count as 3090, 10496FP32,the same MEM speed and TGP as 3080,no NVLINK.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) November 4, 2020\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti \"Rumored\" Graphics Card Specifications\nJust a few months after, it looks like NVIDIA has finally decided the specifications of its GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics card. Details from Kopite7kimi suggest that the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti FE (Founders Edition) graphics card will feature the PG133-SKU15 PCB design and the GA102-250-KD-A1 graphics core.\n\nThe specifications for the GA102-250 GPU have also changed since the last time we saw them and are now exactly the same as the GeForce RTX 3090 at 10496 FP32 CUDA cores. This means that we are essentially looking at RTX 3090 performance at a lower price point. There's a possibility that some select blocks could be disabled for the GA102-250 GPU and the card would almost certainly run at lower clock speeds but that remains to be seen.\nAs for memory, the card will feature 20 GB of GDDR6X memory. Unlike the 19.5 Gbps speeds of the RTX 3090, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is said to retain the same memory speeds as the RTX 3080 at 19 Gbps. Since we are getting a 20 GB bus interface, NVIDIA will be using a 320-bit bus interface which equals a total bandwidth of 760 GB/s. TGP for the card is set to be the same as the RTX 3080 at 320 Watts. That's definitely needed to feed the extra cores so NVIDIA might have to optimize the clocks a bit here.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere' Graphics Card Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA107Ampere GA107Ampere GA106-300Ampere GA104-200Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA104-400Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA102-225Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie SizeTBATBATBA395.2mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBATBATBA17.4 Billion17.4 Billion17.4 Billion28 Billion28 Billion28 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores2048?2560?358448645888614487041024010496\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs64 / 4080 / 48112 / 64152 / 80184 / 96192/ 96272 / 96320 / 112328 / 112\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores64 / 1680 / 20112 / 28152 / 38184 / 46192/ 48272 / 68320 / 80328 / 82\n\n\nBase ClockTBATBA1320 MHz1410 MHz1500 MHz1575 MHz1440 MHz1365 MHz1400 MHz\n\n\nBoost ClockTBATBA1780 MHz1665 MHz1730 MHz1770 MHz1710 MHz1665 MHz1700 MHz\n\n\nFP32 ComputeTBATBA12.7 TFLOPs16.2 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs22 TFLOPs30 TFLOPs34 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPsTBATBA25.4 TFLOPs32.4 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs42 TFLOPs58 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs69 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPsTBATBA101 TOPs129.6 TOPs163 TOPs174 TOPs238 TOPs273 TOPs285 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity4 GB GDDR6?4 GB GDDR6?12 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6X10 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus128-bit128-bit192-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory SpeedTBATBA15 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidthTBATBA360 Gbps448 Gbps448 Gbps608 Gbps760 Gbps912 Gbps936 Gbps\n\n\nTGP~75W~100W170W200W220W290W320W350W350W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$149?$199?$329$399 US$499 US$599 US$699 US$1199$1499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)2021?2021?February 2021December 202029th October 202010th June 202117th September 20203rd June 202124th September 2020\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of performance, we can expect the card to tackle the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT but we do not know if NVIDIA plans to offer the RTX 3080 Ti at a higher price point than the RTX 3080 or reduce prices on their existing RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 cards to match the competition. I believe the price cuts won't be happening soon since NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 series supply is being sold as soon as it ships out of the factory to the retail segment.\n\nThe RTX 3080 Ti could hit a price around $899-$999 US which would be $249 US higher than the RX 6800 XT at the very least. We also know that the GeForce RTX 3090 is around 10-15% faster than the RTX 3080 and the RTX 3080 Ti is also expected to fall within the same range. This mostly looks like a repeat of the GeForce GTX 780 and Radeon R9 290X days where the 780 failed to impress us against the competition and NVIDIA had to go all the way to release the GeForce GTX 780 Ti to undo the damage done by the R9 290X.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n184\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n103\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n70\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n39\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nA Mac Studio Cluster Of Four Units, All Featuring Apple\u2019s Latest M3 Ultra, Consume Less Than Half The Power Of A Network Switch When Running At Idle\n\n\n\n31\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n857\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The ThinkSystem SD650-N V2 and SR7670 V2 are both equipped with water-cooled Nvidia A100 GPUs and should excel in deep learning tasks.\nThinkSystem SD650-N V2\nThe ThinkSystem SD650-N V2 has four Nvidia A100 GPUs in a 1U enclosure. It can be equipped with two Intel Xeon processors, 1TB storage and a few SSDs of your choice.\nSix nodes of the system can be combined into a 6U format, which is water-cooled as a whole. Lenovo claims that such a machine achieves 2.8 PetaFLOPS of HPC performance and 45 PetaFLOPS of AI performance.\n\nThinkSystem SR670 V2\nThe other new system announced by Lenovo is the ThinkSystem SR670 V2. It is a 3U rackmount system with a more conventional layout than the SD650-N.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re considering purchasing one of the GeForce GTX 1650 graphics cards. There are two versions here, which aren\u2019t always immediately discernible from each other. The slightly older model, released in early 2019, uses GDDR5 memory. It\u2019s one of the only 16-series GPUs from Nvidia to do so, and it is outperformed by the later GDDR6 version of the 1650, which runs between five and ten percent faster despite no real difference in price.The GTX 1650 was itself superseded by the 1650 Super in November 2019, but it remains the cheaper of the two cards. The price difference can vary significantly depending on stock and available models, and while the RRPs of the two cards are only ten bucks apart, 1650 Super cards can currently cost as much as $200 while standard 1650 GDDR6 cards are unlikely to be found for more than $170.What is the GTX 1650?Nvidia GTX 1650 SpecCUDA Cores: 896\nROPs: 32\nCore Clock: 1485MHz\nBoost Clock: 1665MHz\nMemory Clock: 8Gbps GDDR5 (12Gbps GDDR6)\nMemory Bus: 128-bit\nVRAM: 4GB\nTDP: 75W\nRelease Date: 04/23/2019\nRelease RRP: $149\u00a0Effectively a follow-up to Nvidia\u2019s previous budget GPU (that\u2019s the GTX 1050, for those not in the know), the 1650 is a fairly pedestrian graphics card suited for mid-range 1080p gaming. It should be able to handle most games at FHD resolution and medium graphics settings without falling below 60fps, but won\u2019t provide too much excitement. It is, however, cheap and low-powered, not requiring a dedicated PCIe power cable from your power supply on most models. The 1650 Super, on the other hand, does require its own power cable.What are the alternatives to the GTX 1650?The GTX 1650 Super is the only real competition that should be considered when looking in this area, since it delivers noticeably better 1080p performance without being a great deal more expensive. While AMD\u2019s older Radeon RX 580, and RX 590, theoretically sit in the same bracket, they are becoming harder to find at reasonable prices and the 1650 Super is a lot newer. There\u2019s also the RX 5500 XT, which can match the 1650 Super for performance, although you\u2019re unlikely to find one of these for less than $190.\u00a0Should I buy the GTX 1650 and at what price?\u00a0Price-tracking GTX 1650 cards on Amazon is a tricksy business. The newer GDDR6 models have yet to properly go on sale, so their pricing sits steady around the $160 mark. Anything below this is worth considering. Older GDDR5 models have gone for as cheap as $130 in the past, which is an excellent deal for a budget GPU even given the somewhat slower VRAM.Alternatively, if we see big sales on GTX 1650 Super or RX 5500 XT 8GB cards, those will likely be the better option. Be cautious, though; a GTX 1650 Super at $160 might seem like a steal given recent prices around the $200 mark, but that GPU originally launched with a $159 RRP.The best Nvidia Geforce GTX 1650 deals

The card was designed for data center systems, however, such as the company\u2019s own DGX A100, rather than anything that the average consumer would run at home. Today, the company has announced the DGX Station A100 which, as the name implies, has the form factor of a desk-bound workstation. It comes with four\u00a0A100 GPUs \u2014 either the 40GB model that the original DGX A100 system came with, or a new 80GB version. If customers go with the latter, they\u2019ll have 320GB of GPU memory to play with. (We\u2019re not jealous at all\u2026)Like the DGX A100, the DGX Station A100 is meant for the science and business world. The kind of research and engineering outfits that are crunching massive datasets and investing heavily in machine learning and artificial intelligence. As my colleague Chris Schodt explained earlier this year (watch his explainer, it\u2019s seriously good), you won\u2019t be gaming on an A100 card anytime soon. It leverages an architecture called Ampere, however, which is now being used in consumer cards such as the GeForce RTX 3080. So while you can\u2019t have an 80GB GPU in your gaming PC, it is possible to leverage some of the same technologies\u2026 provided you still have some serious cash to burn.According to NVIDIA, the DGX Station A100 offers \u201cdata center performance without a data center.\u201d That means it plugs into a standard wall outlet and doesn\u2019t require a data center-grade cooling system. Inside the gold-ish case, you\u2019ll find a 64-core AMD CPU with 512GB of memory and a 7.68TB NVME SSD. It\u2019s the only workgroup server that supports NVIDIA\u2019s Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology, the company explained in a press release. That means a single DGX Station A100 can provide 28 separate GPU instances for parallel jobs or multiple users to access. BMW, Lockheed Martin, NTT Docomo and the Pacific Northwest Laboratory have already adopted DGX Stations for some of their AI and research-focused work.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementThe DGX Station A100 doesn\u2019t make its data center sibling obsolete, though. NVIDIA announced today that the standard DGX A100 will be sold with its new 80GB GPU, doubling memory capacity to 640GB per system. An upgrade option will also be available for customers who have already purchased the DGX A100 with four 40GB A100 cards (320GB). NVIDIA hasn\u2019t disclosed any pricing for its new enterprise-grade hardware, but for context, the original DGX A100 launched with a starting sticker price of $199,000 back in May.If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

In addition to the refined process, core architecture improvements, Infinity Cache, and easy overclocking modes like Rage Mode, it was indicated that users with both AMD RDNA 2 GPUs and AMD Zen 3 CPUs would be able to make use of Smart Access Memory (SAM) to gain a further performance boost of approx 10 per cent or greater.\n\nSomewhat controversially AMD shared just one graph of indicative Radeon RX 6900 XT gaming benchmarks (pitted in 4K against the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090) and it noted the Radeon machines had both Rage Mode and SAM turned on. AMD explains the benefits of SAM come from broadening the CPU and GPU data transfer bus aperture beyond 256MB.\n\nAccording to information Gamers Nexus has garnered from an unnamed Nvidia exec, the green team already has similar tech to SAM working in its labs. \"The capability for resizable BAR is part of the PCI Express spec,\" Gamers Nexus quoted the Nvidia representative of explaining, via Twitter, a few hours ago. The Nvidia source went on to say that the similar functionality will be unlocked on Ampere GPUs in an upcoming software update and that the gains AMD boasted of in its SAM implementation were approximately the same scale that Nvidia had seen in its own hardware tests.\n\nSo, it is interesting to see the show on the other foot, with Nvidia in effect busting AMD 'proprietary' tech. Moreover, Nvidia says that its Ampere SAM-a-like implementation doesn't require a partner AMD CPU with 500 series motherboard (Intel is OK too), and it says that PCIe Gen 4.0 isn't even required.\n\nWe have yet to share AMD Radeon RX 6000 series graphics card tests and benchmarks, as the release date for the first two examples (the Radeon RX 6800 and 6800 XT) is Wednesday, 18th November, next week. It will be interesting to see the impact of SAM in third party tests, and how long we have to wait until Nvidia's facsimile tech arrives.\nIn earlier related news, AMD is developing an open, cross platform alternative to Nvidia's AI-powered DLSS efficient rendering technology.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\nDell updates XPS and Alienware desktops with Alder Lake CPUs\nAsus shares its Intel Z690 motherboard guide\nMore Intel 12th Gen Core performance numbers emerge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 23 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

It costs half as much as the RTX 3090, yet its gaming performance isn't too far behind. It's the right choice as long as you don't need the extra performance from the RTX 3090.\n\nForMore affordableEnough performance for 4K gamingRay tracing and DLSSAgainstNot as much raw power as RTX 3090Poor availabilityNot as good with professional tasks\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n $1,929 at Amazon $1,989 at Amazon Check Walmart\nOverkill Performance The NVIDIA RTX 3090 is an absolute beast of a GPU for gamers and professionals. It costs more than twice as much as the RTX 3080, though, making it more of a niche buy. It's the right choice if RTX 3080 performance just doesn't quite cut it.\n\nForMore powerful than RTX 3080Enough performance for 4K gamingBetter cut out for professional workRay tracing and DLSSAgainstMore expensive than RTX 3080Poor availabilityNot as ideal for gaming\n\nNVIDIA RTX 3080 vs. RTX 3090 tech specsThese two Ampere-powered RTX 30-series NVIDIA graphics cards (GPU) have some interesting specs and features that put them both in the running for best graphics card out there. However, there's a rather large price difference that will have you asking if the RTX 3090 is really worth the cost. Let's start by taking a look at the exact specs of these GPUs.Swipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 RTX 3080RTX 3090CUDA cores8,70410,496Base clock1.44GHz1.40GHzBoost clock1.71GHz1.70GHzMemory10GB GDDR6X24GB GDDR6XMemory bus320-bit384-bitMemory clock19Gbps19.5GbpsMemory bandwidth760GB/s936GB/sRT cores6882Transistors28.3 billion28.3 billionNodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmArchitectureAmpereAmpereTDP320W350WPortsHDMI 2.1Three DisplayPort 1.4aHDMI 2.1Three DisplayPort 1.4aNVIDIA RTX 3080 vs. RTX 3090 performance and featuresConsidering the specifications listed above, it's clear the RTX 3090 is the superior card in terms of raw performance. It has more CUDA cores, more ray tracing cores, more than double the GDDR6X VRAM, a wider memory bus and memory bandwidth, and a slightly higher memory clock. These are both Ampere GPUs based on an 8nm Samsung node, but the RTX 3090 is significantly larger physically and has a higher TDP at 350W.Despite the boosted specs the RTX 3090 is sporting, dedicated gamers out there aren't going to see a big increase when gaming at 4K. In most cases, the gaming performance is only about 10% to 15% less from the RTX 3080. The fact that it also costs, in general, $800 less than the RTX 3090 should make it the right choice for those who don't plan on undertaking professional work.If you're a gamer with an unlimited budget, you're no doubt going to go for the RTX 3090 anyway. It will deliver better gaming performance than the RTX 3080, and it's better cut out to toy with 8K.Source: NVIDIA (Image credit: Source: NVIDIA)The RTX 3090 is an absolute behemoth with 24GB of GDDR6X VRAM, making it better cut out for content creation and professional applications. It's the GPU that's unofficially taking over for NVIDIA's Titan GPU lineup, which were the cards for professionals and creators who didn't want to take the step up to workstation graphics (previously known as \"Quadro\").Whereas gaming performance between the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 is quite close, you should see in some cases up to a 20% increase when working with demanding professional software. Both GPUs have support for extra RTX features like DLSS and ray tracing, but the RTX 3090 is much better prepared to deal with the heavier workload they present.The RTX 3090 will, of course, deliver a strong gaming experience, but at $1,500, it's not going to be worth the money for most people.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Source: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central)Keep in mind the physical size and TDP difference between these two graphics cards. The RTX 3080 takes up two slots, while the RTX 3090 takes up three slots. The larger card should nevertheless fit into most mid-size PC towers, but be sure to reference exact dimensions before making a final purchase. Also, note that NVIDIA recommends a 750W PSU for each of these cards despite the RTX 3080 having a lower 320W TDP.For more information about getting your PC ready for a new GPU, have a look at our guide to preparing your PC for NVIDIA RTX 30-series graphics cards.NVIDIA's RTX 3080 is the right GPU for 4K gamingIf you're looking to game at 4K with smooth frame rates and don't want to spend the extra money on an RTX 3090, the RTX 3080 makes a whole lot of sense. It has the same features as the RTX 3090, and it's the better pick if you want raw gaming performance. Availability isn't great for either of these GPUs, so be sure to check out our guide on where to buy NVIDIA RTX 30-series GPUs.\n\n\n\nFlagship RTX\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\n\n $749.99 at Newegg $839.99 at Amazon $2,480.99 at Walmart\n4K gaming at a far better priceNVIDIA's RTX 3080 costs significantly less than the RTX 3090, yet it brings a performance that's not far behind the heavy hitter.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. for\u00a0Tirias ResearchFollow AuthorNov 06, 2020, 11:07am ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 graphics cardTirias Research\nEarlier this month Tirias Research tested the top end of Nvidia\u2019s new dynamic duo the GeForce RTX 3080 Founder Edition and we were thoroughly impressed, Now we\u2019ve been given the opportunity to review it\u2019s more cost sensitive sister - the GeForce RTX 3070. While there is a noticeable difference in the cards both physically and performance wise, it\u2019s a very impressive card for just $499.\n\nForbesShould You Upgrade Your PC With The RTX 3080 Or Buy A New PS5 Or Xbox Series X?By Jim McGregor\nThe first thing you notice about the 3070 is that it is physically smaller than the 3080 and lacks some of the nickel accents that wrap around the 3080. It still has a dual fan cooling design but in a more traditional configuration. Inside the case, the 3070 is based on the same Ampere architecture and 8nm manufacturing process as the 3080, but the 3070 has a reduced core count (CUDA cores, texture units, tensor cores and ray tracing cores) and memory is reduced from 10GB of GDDR6X in the 3080 to 8GB of GDDR6 in the 3070. However, this also results in a 100W power reduction with the 3070 rated at just 220W. This was very noticeable in testing because the fan noise was quieter - more in line with the previous GeForce RTX 2070 Super but with much higher performance. And all that comes with Nvidia\u2019s ray tracing and Deep Learning Super-Sampling (DLSS) technology.\n\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3070 graphics cardsTirias Research\nFor testing, we used the same 2nd-gen AMD Threadripper system used to test the 3080 and limited the tests to GPU-centric benchmarks. In all the graphics benchmarks, the delta between the 3080 and the 3070 was less than 10%. The delta was 9.9% in 3D Mark Time Spy, 8.92% using PassMark in 3D graphics, 3.4% using Unigine Superposition at 1080p. The largest gaps in performance come at 4K and in GPU compute. The delta between the two cards was 25% using Unigine Superposition at 4K and 27.6% using Geekbench for OpenCL. However, the compute delta is likely much lower using Nvidia\u2019s CUDA for GPU compute.\n\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\nComparison of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 and GeForce RTX 3080 graphics cards using the Unigine ...

[+] Mark benchmarkTirias Research\nFor gaming, we stuck to the games supporting ray tracing, including Battlefield V, Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Fortnite, and Minecraft. When it came to gaming, the RTX 3070 had great resolution and performance at 1080P and 1440P with a slight performance degradation at 4K, but still very playable.\n\nThe competitive gamer or high-end creator will still likely opt for the GeForce RTX 3080 or RTX 3090. At just $499, 29% less than the 3080, but with less than a 10% difference in 1080P and 1440P gaming performance, the 3070 is the perfect solution for the more mainstream gamer. In my previous article I argued that it may be better to upgrade your PC before buying a new PC console and I\u2019m sticking to that sentiment. Both the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 are impressive cards at reasonable prices. And apparently everyone else thinks so too because the orders are selling out as fast as Nvidia can make them.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.The author and members of the Tirias Research staff do not hold equity positions in any of the companies mentioned.

The win marks back-to-back victories for NVIDIA, which also claimed the title in 2019 for its 20-series graphics cards.The RTX 3080's win is impressive, but what really marks it out is the range of other competitors it had to overcome this year. From mobile gaming with the Razer Kishi mobile pad for xCloud, to VR thanks to the Oculus Quest 2, to the gaming-on-the-go offered by the PC Engine Mini, the 2020 nominees were an impressively diverse bunch. Also featuring on the list were the TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition, the Roccat Vulcan 120 Aimo Keyboard, and the Turtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 2 headset.PC Engine MiniOculus Quest 2Razer Kishi mobile pad for xCloudNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 (winner)TCA Sidestick Airbus EditionVulcan 120 Aimo KeyboardTurtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 2Despite that stiff competition, however, it might come as no surprise to some that the RTX 3080 would come out on top. Not only has NVIDIA led the way when it comes to graphics cards in recent years, that success has paid off so well that it was all-but-impossible to grab yourself either a 3080 (or its big brother the 3090) unless you were first in the virtual queue.While the aforementioned 3090 might technically boast the bigger specs, it's the 3080's price point that ensured it found its way onto this year's shortlist - at just $699 it's a bargain, and easily our best graphics card of the year. If you're planning on buying or building a PC any time soon, this should be at the top of your list (as long as you can find one).Sign up to the GamesRadar+ NewsletterWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and moreContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\nSee more Games News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAli JonesSocial Links NavigationNews EditorI'm GamesRadar's news editor, working with the team to deliver breaking news from across the industry.

NVIDIA's RTX 3060 Ti graphics card is going to feature 4864 CUDA cores and is going to be faster than the older RTX 2080 SUPER and priced in at just $399 USD. The card is expected to launch in early December and should make NVIDIA's mid-spectrum lineup killer.\nNVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti Pictures And Performance Leaked, landing on December 2, 2020\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti will feature GA104-200 GPU with 4864 CUDA cores and 8GB of GDDR6 memory clocked at 14 Gbps. The bus width will be 256-bits for a total bandwidth of 448 GB/s of bandwidth. Since the board will require less power, the TBP should be around 200W with the reference design clocking in at around 180W. This is a 5W increase over the RTX 2070 at 175W and in line with how we expect the Samsung node to fair in terms of power efficiency when compared to TSMC's nodes. It is expected to have an MSRP of $399 and will launch on December 2.\n\n\nThe Founder's edition variant features the now-familiar metallic black aesthetic of the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 but both fans are on the top of the card with a small cutout in the backplate visible in the back. The overall shape and form of the founder's edition is very consistent with the RTX 3000 series. The fan towards the end of the card is going to be pushing the air through the heatsink and out the bottom - which is an interesting design philosophy when compared to graphics cards from earlier in this decade.\n\nAs far as benchmarks go, the RTX 3060 Ti is faster than the RTX 2080 SUPER and should trade blows with the RTX 2080 Ti. It is faster not only in shader performance but rendering (compute) and ray-tracing capabilities as well and completely demolishes the older RTX 2060 SUPER it replaces. Of course as with any benchmark comparison, always keep in mind that you should wait for third-party results before making any decision.\nKeep in mind that the reason NVIDIA's RTX 3090 and RTX 3080 cards are not scaling linearly in performance is due to bottlenecking by game engines and binaries that are not designed to handle this much amount of cores. We know that the hardware and driver stack scales linearly because of the benchmark performance of these cards in software like vRAY and Octane - which are designed to handle a huge amount of graphics power. This means that as you scale down cores, performance will not scale down linearly. In fact, I fully expect the RTX 3060 Ti to beat the RTX 2080 clock for clock! Assuming slightly less clocks than the RTX 2080 Ti, it should easily trade blows with the former flagship.\nYields for the initial few batches of the Samsung 8nm node are lower than expected and expensive. The company expects the yields (and therefore prices for wafers) to significantly improve in the coming months. To protect its shareholders, the company has been cautious about its orders of the first few batches and has placed significantly higher volume orders for later batches. This problem was further exacerbated by bots scraping up the entire volume from the get-go.

Those are the words of Cobus Bothma, director of applied research at global architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox (KPF) who has been exploring Nvidia Omniverse, the new virtual collaboration platform which places a big emphasis on real-time physically accurate visualisation.\nBothma is excited by how the platform could help bring together KPF\u2019s global offices to work simultaneously on projects. \u201cIt shows great potential to allow multiple contributors, from across the entire design team using an array of applications, to collaborate effectively \u2013 wherever they\u2019re currently working.\u201d\nNvidia Omniverse is built around Pixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description (USD), an open source file format with origins in visual effects and animation. With the ability to include models, animations, materials, lights, and cameras, it can be used to share a variety of viz-focused data seamlessly between 3D applications.\nIn the AEC space, Nvidia Omniverse works with several 3D design tools, including SketchUp, Revit, and Rhino, and viz tools 3ds Max, Unity, Maya, Unreal Engine, Houdini and (soon) Blender. Importantly, it replaces traditional file-based import / export workflows, with data flowing freely from each 3D application via a plug-in \u2018connector\u2019, which creates a live link to the Omniverse \u2018nucleus\u2019.\nOnce the link is established, and the initial model is synced, the connectors only transmit what has changed in the scene, allowing everything to be \u2018real time and dynamic\u2019. Move a wall in Revit, for example, and it will update live in Omniverse, along with any other connected application. It means teams can use whichever tool best suits the design or modelling task at hand and switch seamlessly between them.\n\u201cWith this sort of technology, and the way we are connecting the tools together, it changes our view of the workflows,\u201d says Nicolas Fonta, Sr. Product Manager for AR/VR/MR at Autodesk, who sees Omniverse as a way of breaking down the barriers between Autodesk products and others. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a waterfall file conversion from one tool to another down the line.\n\u201cAll of those tools are sharing this common representation of the project. Omniverse is one view of it, which is beautiful, but as you\u2019re tweaking things in Revit, it\u2019s one common project that\u2019s sitting on this USD foundation that is exchanged between the different tools.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer about \u2018I need to take my Revit file, send it to Omniverse, send it to [3ds] max\u2019, they\u2019re all just the common representation.\u201d\nAggregated models can be viewed in Omniverse View, an Omniverse App with a toolkit designed specifically for visualising architectural and engineering projects using physically-based real-time rendering with global illumination, reflections and refractions.\nView includes libraries of materials, skies, trees and furniture, and painting tools to scatter large amounts of assets like trees and grass. Dynamic clouds and animated sun studies are also included, along with section tools. More functionality will be added as the platform evolves and it\u2019s also possible to create custom features using C++ or Python extensions.\nImportantly, to help speed decision making at any phase of the design process, Omniverse View allows all project participants, and not just users of 3D authoring tools, to navigate the model, as well as modify and render content.\n\u201cThings happen much quicker and rapidly in the boardrooms, in the meeting rooms, at design phases, especially now,\u201d says Bothma. \u201cWe get to a point where things have to happen within a click. And this is kind of one of those things that does allow that to happen.\u201d\n\n\nNvidia Omniverse View (top) being fed live data from 3ds max, Revit and Rhino with Grasshopper (bottom)\n\nKohn Pedersen Fox\nKPF is one of Nvidia\u2019s \u2018lighthouse\u2019 accounts and has been exploring the potential of Omniverse for several months. However, as the technology is currently in beta and, as Bothma explains, undergoing a \u2018rapid rate of development\u2019, it\u2019s not currently being used on live projects.\nTo demonstrate how it could help optimise KPF\u2019s collaborative workflows, Bothma showed AEC Magazine an example from its 52 Lime Street project, also known as \u2018The Scalpel\u2019, a striking new office tower in the heart of the City of London.\nRhino (with Grasshopper) was used for the design of the canopy and immediate landscaping; 3ds Max to provide some context using a section of KPF\u2019s London model\u2019 and Revit for the construction document model, including the fa\u00e7ade and full internals of the 42 storey building. \u201cThe Revit file could be sitting in a London office and the Rhino model could be in the New York office, says Bothma.\n\u201cWhen you publish, it starts collating automatically on the server side and it does it quite cleverly where it actually names the file names and the application, and then the .USD, so you always know where the source was coming from, and you can keep this up to date.\u201d\n\n\nNvidia Omniverse \u2013 further reading\nNvidia Omniverse for AEC\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual intelligence\nNvidia Omniverse isn\u2019t just about optimising the flow of design data to improve interoperability and team collaboration. Bothma believes there\u2019s a huge value in giving teams much earlier access to models rendered using an accurate physical representation of light, \u201cIt\u2019s getting to see exactly what the project is going to look like much quicker, from probably applications that didn\u2019t always play nicely together.\u201d\nScenes can be viewed in Omniverse \u2018View\u2019, which includes a real-time ray tracing mode as well as an RTX path traced renderer, which can be accelerated by multiple Nvidia RTX GPUs and coupled with \u2018physically accurate\u2019 MDL materials and lighting.\n\n\nCobus Bothma, director of applied research at Kohn Pedersen Fox (KPF)\n\nThe path traced stills that Bothma produced for his presentation are quite simple but were rendered in seconds using a workstation with a single Nvidia Quadro RTX 6000 GPU. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do much on materials, we didn\u2019t do much on lighting, I literally opened up the sun, dragged the slider a little bit, and then screen grabbed it, and that\u2019s what you kind of get straight out of the box as a designer\u2019s working model.\u201d\n\nBut Bothma says there is potential to take things much higher, describing the render quality from Omniverse as \u2018top of the line\u2019, also noting that it works with Substance Designer for advanced materials. \u201cWe can now actually use Substance Designer with Revit and Max and Rhino at the same time, in Omniverse environments.\u201d\nBothma envisions Omniverse scenes could become dynamic assets used throughout the entire design process. \u201cThis would be where I\u2019d do my final renders, this would be where I do design discussions, possibly streaming in the future, testing variations, looking at shadow studies, whatever the case may be \u2013 even running my animations and so forth, that\u2019s kind of where you want to go.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like hopping around too much, so the idea is really like what some of the CG and VFX companies are doing; they\u2019re running into one pipeline where all the data and the geometry is aggregated and that\u2019s the pipeline that then will produce the images \u2013 at whatever level you want in whatever format you kind of want.\u201d\nStreaming to any device with Nvidia Omniverse\nOmniverse View can run on an Nvidia RTX powered desktop or mobile workstation, allowing users to get an interactive viewport into the shared scene. However, the real power of the platform comes into play when using Nvidia RTX Server, a reference design available from a range of OEMs with multiple Nvidia RTX GPUs.\nRTX Server can perform multiple roles. It not only provides buckets of processing power for path tracing, but with Nvidia Quadro Virtual Data Center Workstation (Quadro vDWS) software users can access the Omniverse platform using GPU-accelerated virtual machines. It means all collaborators can view projects in full interactive ray traced quality on low powered hardware \u2013 be it a laptop, tablet or phone.\nFor Bothma this is one of the most exciting developments, and he\u2019s looking forward to being able to stream Ominverse projects live to any lightweight device. \u201cWe can\u2019t put a big [GPU-accelerated] machine in everybody\u2019s face, the whole time,\u201d he says.\nOne might presume that Bothma sees this an opportunity to improve communication with clients, but this isn\u2019t the priority. \u201cWhen I look at technology and the use of it at KPF I always look at team collaboration first, team communication, and the second thing is clients,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a top down design necessarily, we enable everybody to give their feedback and design input, and so forth,\u201d adding that Omniverse streaming will allow principals, directors, or project managers that are not au fait with 3D applications, to look themselves. \u201cIt\u2019ll give them the ability to go and say \u2018well if a designer says the sun is going to shine on this, for example, and the glass is not going to be too blue\u2019, they\u2019re going to be able to say \u2018well let me have a look quickly and open my iPad and go in, adjust the sun go look at it.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cDemocratisation of technology in the industry is one of the big things we\u2019re driving right now, how to get more people to use the technology without having to be coders and scripters or visualisation experts. And we\u2019re seeing it happen,\u201d he says.\nBothma has several options on where to host Omniverse. To date, most of the testing has been done using on-premise hardware, but AWS [Amazon Web Services] is also an option. \u201cI know some other companies \u2013 Woods Bagot, for example \u2013 have been doing some testing on the [Omniverse] View side on AWS with quite good results,\u201d he says.\nWhichever route KPF ends up taking, the Omniverse nucleus will certainly be centralised and maybe imaged in one or two locations. \u201cThat\u2019s the real benefit to us, for someone in Shanghai to be able view this model that\u2019s been published by three of our other offices and be able to see it the same as we see it,\u201d says Bothma. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t have to wait for large files and [wonder] \u2018do we have the right version of whatever software was used in the past.\u2019\u201d\n\nNvidia Omniverse \u2013 beyond viz\nAlways on the front foot, Bothma is already looking beyond core AEC workflows and thinking about where Omniverse could take KPF in the future.\n\u201cIt has the capabilities to do a lot more than just architectural collation and so forth \u2013 robotics, and a whole bunch of other things,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd those things are going to be very appealing to me because we\u2019re going to start looking at not just how we look at a building from its visual aspect, we might want to start looking at how we construct a building, and that might be even with robotics, and the use of machine learning and so forth.

Great news: NVIDIA's RTX 3000 mobility series is going to be landing as soon as January 2021 and the company is finally moving forward with supporting AMD mobility CPUs for its high-end GPUs. There are a lot of updates to cover so let's dig right in.\nNVIDIA RTX 3080 and 3070 mobility GPUs landing in January 2021 in ASUS and MSI laptops, rest to follow in April\nLet's start with NVIDIA's complete mobility lineup and roadmap for the first half of 2021. The company is planning to introduce RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 GPUs to replace its SUPER lineup and the RTX 2060. For the first half of 2021, NVIDIA does not plan to replace the GTX 1660 Ti, GTX 1650 Ti, and the GTX 1650. The full-stack and the parts they will replace is given in the slide below (all slides in the article have been recreated on a 1-1 basis to remove those pesky Fourier transform watermarks):\nFull-stack of NVIDIA's RTX 30 series mobility lineup for 1H 2021.\nWe have been told that the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 mobility GPUs will be fast-tracked to land in January 2021, however, the GPUs will initially only be available in ASUS and MSI flavors. HP, Dell, and Lenovo have reportedly decided to wait until April to support these new GPUs as they want to pair it with launches that are happening then. Because of this, RTX 2080 SUPER and RTX 2070 SUPER mobility GPUs are expected to be EOL-ed in January 2021 (no word on the RTX 2070 mobility for now).\nThe GTX 1650 Ti and GTX 1660 Ti in 1H 2021 do not appear to be identical to the ones shipping now (notice NVIDIA chose to put them in a new box as opposed to the same box for the GTX 1650) although we are not at this time sure what the changes are going to be. My source also mentioned that they expect the RTX 30 mobility series to have a very short life cycle (considering there are rumors of NVIDIA planning to shift to 7nm TSMC for its SUPER variants of the RTX 30 lineup).\nGaming performance is going to get cheaper in laptops above the $999 mark thanks to NVIDIA's RTX 30 mobility series\nNow let's talk about the pricing a bit. NVIDIA expects laptops priced at or around $699 to have the GTX 1650, with the GTX 1650 Ti and GTX 1660 Ti coming in at units priced at $799-$899, RTX 3060 to take over above the $999 mark, RTX 3070 at $1299 and the RTX 3080 at $1999. Keep in mind these are only the manufacturer *suggested* pricing and there is no guarantee that we will actually see these in real-world pricing for all NVIDIA-based laptops.\nNVIDIA's recommended laptop configurations for RTX 3000 series.\nHowever, according to my source, retailers that get significant subsidies from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel (like Walmart) should be able to hit these prices fairly easily. Anyway you slice it however, gaming performance per dollar is going to come down after the $999 mark and you will see actual SKUs that hit these prices (likely from Walmart) in early 2021. Prices for the rest of the retailers, however, are likely going to be expensive at launch and won't normalize till the other vendors enter the ring in April 2021.\nNVIDIA's high-end mobility GPUs will finally be supporting AMD CPUs\nNVIDIA has also provided recommended specifications (laptops) for its mobility GPUs in the presentation and one major announcement here is the support for the next generation of AMD Ryzen with its high-end GPU lineup. Because of the PCIe bottleneck on Renoir, you could only get up to an RTX 2060 with an AMD CPU. Once the AMD 5000 series (Cezzane-H) lands, however, this is going to change with NVIDIA high-end GPUs freely available equally on AMD and Intel parts (TigerLake H). This is going to result in a lot more sales for both NVIDIA and AMD as people who want an AMD CPU coupled with an NVIDIA GPU (in the high-end segment) can finally do so.\nWe have also heard from these AIBs that they want to get rid of the excess inventory of RTX 2000 series (especially the high end), so we might see some great deals in the holiday season (especially around Black Friday and Cyber Monday) as AIBs try to get rid of the excess inventory before the RTX 30 series lands in January 2021\u00a0 - so if you are looking for a discount deal, be sure to check them out. One thing is clear: 2021 is shaping up to be a very exciting year for tech enthusiasts - especially those looking to upgrade their laptops.\nNews Source: Source Link\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n136\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n102\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n78\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n34\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nA Mac Studio Cluster Of Four Units, All Featuring Apple\u2019s Latest M3 Ultra, Consume Less Than Half The Power Of A Network Switch When Running At Idle\n\n\n\n30\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

technology enhances new connected car operating system (ccOS)ccOS developed in-house by Hyundai Motor Group for all future modelsOffers perpetually updatable, software-defined in-vehicle infotainment systems and potential for a wide range of \u2018connected car\u2019 services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Connected Car\n#Infotainment\n\n\n\n\n\nSEOUL / SANTA CLARA, Calif., November 9, 2020 \u2013 Hyundai Motor Group and NVIDIA announced today the roll-out of the NVIDIA DRIVE \u2018connected car\u2019 platform across all new models from Hyundai, Kia and Genesis from 2022 onwards.The technical cooperation with NVIDIA, the global leader in accelerated computing, will enable Hyundai Motor Group to develop high-performance \u2018connected car\u2019 computing systems for its next-generation models. From entry-level to premium vehicles, all future models will feature in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems powered by NVIDIA DRIVE as standard. NVIDIA DRIVE includes a hardware and software stack, enabling Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s IVI systems to combine audio, video, navigation, connectivity and artificial intelligence (AI)-based \u2018connected car\u2019 services.Using the high-performance, energy-efficient NVIDIA DRIVE platform for its future models will allow the Group\u2019s brands to offer customers seamless and continuously enhanced in-vehicle AI user experiences. Hyundai, Kia and Genesis customers will therefore benefit from a feature-rich, software-defined AI user experience that is perpetually updateable.Hyundai Motor Group has been working with NVIDIA since 2015, and the NVIDIA DRIVE platform already underpins the advanced IVI systems found in the Genesis GV80 and G80. The companies have also been collaborating on an advanced integrated digital cockpit, due to be launched in late 2021. Today\u2019s announcement takes the relationship further, as Hyundai Motor Group lays the foundations for IVI systems that can support a wide range of future apps and features, across its entire model line-up.\u201cNVIDIA brought consumer electronic functionality and a graphics-rich user interface to infotainment systems more than a decade ago,\u201d said Ali Kani, Vice President of Autonomous Vehicles at NVIDIA. \u201cNow, we are once again transforming these systems through the power of AI, helping Hyundai Motor Group increase safety and value, along with enhancing customer satisfaction, throughout the lifetime of the vehicle.\u201d\u201cAt Hyundai Motor Group, we are committed to delivering greater value, safety, functionality and enjoyment over the lifetime of the car,\u201d said Paul Choo, Senior Vice President of Electronics Tech Unit at Hyundai Motor Group. \u201cThe NVIDIA DRIVE platform is proven \u2013 it is scalable, energy-efficient and has the performance to support our next generation of software-defined vehicles.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartnership with NVIDIA enables creation of next ccOSThe partnership with NVIDIA will enable Hyundai Motor Group to roll out its next 'connected car operating system' (ccOS) in future models. Developed in-house by Hyundai Motor Group, the new ccOS will bring together the large amount of data generated by the vehicle and its network of sensors, as well as external connected car data centers, providing a more pleasurable and convenient experience for the driver and occupants.The ccOS will use NVIDIA\u2019s software frameworks to implement four core IT competencies:\u2018High-performance computing\u2019, using NVIDIA GPUs to process large amounts of data inside and outside the vehicles and optimize system performance to support advanced IT technologies, such as deep learning.\u2018Seamless computing\u2019, which provides uninterrupted service regardless of the vehicle's online or offline state. The vehicle connects with the surrounding infrastructure and smart devices to bring the user experience from external devices into the vehicle environment.\u2018Intelligent computing\u2019, providing intelligent customized services by properly identifying the driver's intentions and condition.\u2018Secure computing\u2019, protecting the system by monitoring in-vehicle and external networks and isolating data associated with vehicle safety.Furthermore, recent breakthroughs in AI and accelerated computing have opened the door for next-generation vehicles to benefit from new functionality, capabilities and enhanced safety features that can be added after the car is purchased. With a centralized, software-defined computer architecture, future vehicles can be updated throughout their lives to feature the latest in advanced digital cockpit technology, as well as other features.Hyundai Motor Group will announce more specific details of its upcoming IVI and ccOS capabilities in line with future announcements relating to specific vehicles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to the list\nAutonomous & SDV\n\n\n\n\nNext topic\nAAM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinue reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n202502251600\n\n                                    Hyundai Motor Group Launches \u2018Pleos 25\u2019 Conference to Accelerate Vehicle Software Development \n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n202410041900\n\n                                    Hyundai and Waymo Enter Multi-Year, Strategic Partnership\n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n202409251030\n\n                                    Hyundai Motor, Kia and Samsung Electronics Join Forces to Advance SDV User Experience\n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n202406202200\n\n                                    Hyundai Motor Group Powers Up Robotic Services at Smart Office Building in Seoul\n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfooter menus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact & legal\n                            view sub menu list\n\n\n\n\nLegal\n\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n\nCookies policy\n\n\nDo not sell my information\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\n\nCorporate\n                            view sub menu list\n\n\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nAwards\n\n\nVehicle history\n\n\nNetworks\n\n\nAffiliates\n\n\nSupplier\n\n\n\n\nHyundai experiences\n                            view sub menu list\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nHyundai Motorstudio\n\n\nHyundai Collection\n\n\nHyundai Artlab\n\n\n\n\nHyundai social media\n                            view sub menu list\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorldwide\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u24d2 2025 Hyundai Motor Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nMultiple listings for the RTX 3060 Ti have appeared over on the EEC (an electronics registration database for the Eurasian Economic Union), which adds further fuel to the mid-range RTX 30-series fire, and perhaps even hints at a close-at-hand RTX 3060 Ti release date.Asus, Palit, and Inno3D have all registered RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards on the database, which is usually a place to find proof of graphics cards yet to release.\u00a0Asus offers the most in way of specifics. Its RTX 3060 Ti entry suggests multiple models in the ROG Strix, TUF, Turbo, Pheonix, and Dual lineups. Meanwhile Inno3D has loosely registered the generic term 'RTX 3060 Ti' and 'RTX 3060'. So far we've only seen overwhelming evidence of the former, the Ti model, however.There's a chance that Inno3D is simply covering its bases with a preliminary registration. We've seen all sorts on the EEC database over the years: RX 5800 XT, RX 5900XT... you name it.In fact, if you look to Palit's registration, you can see a prime example of just that. The GPU manufacturer has registered just about every possible RTX 30-series nomenclature under the sun, what looks like right the way from RTX 3090s to RTX 3060s.However, there's still something to be gleaned from the registration even if it's lacking in the specifics. That's the simple fact that a graphics card manufacturer is expecting a mid-range RTX 30-series card in the near-future\u2014or in this case many graphics card manufacturers\u2014and is planning for such an eventuality. These three companies certainly believe the hype.(Image credit: Future)Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: the top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest graphics card: your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: get into the game ahead of the restThere's certainly a large trove of leaks to point to in regards to the existence of at least an RTX 3060 Ti. One retailer in Saudi Arabia recently claimed to actually have the card in stock and ready to ship (against Nvidia's best wishes, we're sure) and there was a roadmap leaked from a Galax presentation in China that purported to show an RTX 3060 on the horizon. Oh, and there was that RTX 3060 Ti GPU-Z validation page.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.And don't forget the specs from serial leaker kopite7kimi on Twitter\u2014but you get the picture.The arrival of an RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3060 before the holidays may not yet be a foregone conclusion, but you can at least be confident that such a mid-range RTX 3060 card will arrive soon enough. Given the expected competitive performance of the AMD RX 6800-series of Big Navi GPUs, you can bet Nvidia is going to want to get all its big guns out.The only thing, I would guess, that could push back any such immediate GPU launch is if Nvidia felt the need to stockpile more stock for the big day\u2014demand for the existing RTX 30-series graphics cards has been tremendous and far outstrips supply\u2014and the RTX 3060 Ti, if such a card exists, is likely to be one of the most popular of the lot by numbers alone.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

We posted reviews of the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, Ryzen 7 5800X, Ryzen 9 5900X, and Ryzen 9 5900X, all available on our YouTube channel. In the time since, we\u2019ve been working on Ryzen memory benchmarks, including an upcoming piece featuring Wendell of Level1Techs and Buildzoid of AHOC. That piece will focus on ranks, channels, and Zen 3\u2019s newly exaggerated behaviors with regard to interleaving and scaling. More on that soon. For hardware news this week, the big story is a GN-exclusive about NVIDIA MSRP targets and BOM cost suggestions for an RTX 2060-style replacement.02:23 | Partners on NVIDIA MSRP Target: \u201cWe\u2019d Be Bankrupt\u201dOne of NVIDIA\u2019s next upcoming GPUs will target price levels of the previous RTX 2060 and GTX 1660 Ti cards and currently has internal cost targets that, partners tell us, are unrealistic to hit while maintaining the estimated MSRP. The name of the card could still change, but the goal is something in the $250 to $300 price class. To give some perspective on how things work for NVIDIA\u2019s board partners, it goes like this:Early on, partners are given a technical specs sheet that provides a suggested BOM cost for each part in the product. That\u2019d be a suggested BOM cost for line items of PCB, heatsink-fan, and of manufacturing and assembly. Partners generally know far better than NVIDIA or AMD what the appropriate BOM costs are for each of these parts, but the companies try to help well ahead of launch to ensure certain price points can be met. Of course, the biggest cost is always the GPU and the memory, which are sold as a bundled package to the partners. It is possible for partners to source their own memory supply, but because the volume is so much lower than crowd-sourcing it through the GPU maker, it\u2019s typically bundled together. This also helps NVIDIA obscure the true GPU silicon cost since it\u2019s harder to separate the combined price.Currently, NVIDIA\u2019s goal to hit an MSRP of $250 to $300 is predicated on the usage of a GPU heatsink-fan that costs between $4 and $5. GN has received the exact pricing from partners, but in order to protect our sources, we\u2019ve slightly obfuscated the range so that NVIDIA can\u2019t pinpoint the leak by looking at exact dollars and cents values. For perspective, we\u2019re told that a $4 to $5 cooler would get you an Intel stock-cooler style solution, commonly called a \u201cflower cooler\u201d by the supply factories we\u2019ve toured in China, except applied to a GPU. We were told by partners that their high-end models, often just below the flagship, cost around $50 for the cooling solution. That includes the backplate, the shroud, the RGB LEDs, the thermal pads (this cost can be high if using good pads), the past, the metal finstack, any present vapor chambers, and the tooling. Specifically, the tooling cost is what balloons the total cooler cost, but more on that in a moment. A low-end cooler as found in existing 1650-class GPUs costs about $9 for the absolute cheapest ones on the market, with a $13 BOM cost for the high-end GTX 1650 cards. For perspective, a $9 GPU cooler doesn\u2019t usually cool the memory or VRM and only cools the GPU. Board partners explained to us that the lower-end cards might make them $1 here and there, but otherwise, it was described by one partner as a \u201cwild west for the low-end cards. It\u2019s hard to even say what the margins are because they\u2019re always on and off promotions and don\u2019t have a strict MSRP, so it\u2019s more fluid.\u201dThe BOM cost provided to GN by partners includes thermal pads, screws, sometimes LEDs, the shroud, the backplate (which is about $1 for an aluminum plate), the fans, and the heatsink. The fans cost about $1 to $1.40 each for PWM fans with custom blades, whereas a low-end PC case fan might cost about $0.70.\u00a0None of these complaints include the PCB or assembly cost. For perspective, assembly on an RTX 2060-class GPU with a mid-range cooler is typically in the range of $14. This relates to assembly and often tooling, depending on the partner. Sometimes tooling is counted in the cooler cost, sometimes it\u2019s counted in manufacturing, but it\u2019s ultimately divided out against the order quantity.In asking the partners what they expected from us when providing all of this information, the answer was that they want NVIDIA to either set a higher MSRP that\u2019s realistic -- in other words, something they can actually hit while making a good product -- or for NVIDIA to take a margin cut and sell the GPU and RAM to the partners for cheaper. This obviously indicates a separate motive for the board partners.\u00a0Partner motives here benefit the customer by way of seeking pressure on NVIDIA to bring MSRP to meet higher, realistic expectations, because the partners are concerned that customers will become upset at a lack of cards at MSRP for the next RTX 30 card. We recognize that partners might not be giving us the complete picture when asking NVIDIA to reduce its margins, so we next reached-out to some of our contacts in factories in China to ask about the actual sale price to manufacturers.Our understanding is that, after speaking with factories, the cooler BOM prices quoted to GN from board partners have to include tooling cost divided out by the number of products being made in almost all instances. Tooling can easily cost tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the amount of pre-production tools are made, and is a major investment. The tools are reusable basically forever -- at least, for as long as the life of these shortly lived products -- but their high cost means high volume is needed to make-up the cost. Tools are what\u2019s installed in the large stamp machines and other machines that we\u2019ve shown in our factory tours. Cooling factories think that the price of $4 to $5 isn\u2019t realistic for a dual-fan GPU cooler unless removing the backplate, reducing the fin density significantly, reducing the heatpipe count or removing them, using less copper, and using cheaper thermal interfaces.We then looped-back with the partners with our new information, and were told that they\u2019d have to offer mail-in rebates to hit NVIDIA MSRP targets for the 2060-class replacement at present. This is because MIRs have a redemption rate of 30-40%, and so a $20 MIR really is only reducing the effective global cost of the card by $7 per unit, not $20 per unit.Ultimately, it sounds like tricks will have to be played with MDF and rebates in order to hit MSRP. We\u2019ll have to follow-up after the launch to see if NVIDIA ended up changing its pricing to benefit the partners, and thus make it possible for partners to hit MSRP without MSRP just being an unattainable goal. AIBs told us that, worst case, they\u2019d make short-lived models to hit MSRP and then switch only to the better products.\u201cIf we sold only that, we\u2019d be bankrupt,\u201d one told us, saying that the current guidelines from NVIDIA are not realistic.Source: GamersNexus exclusive13:43 | AMD Ryzen 5000 AvailabilityThis one is just in the video -- but it's timestamped!17:07 | PCI SIG Release PCIe 6.0 Specification, Version 0.7A quick update on the brewing PCIe 6.0 specification, as the PCI-SIG has officially released its PCIe 6.0, version 0.7 specification to members. This should be the last milestone ahead of a full ratification in 2021 (although there will be a version 0.9 before hitting 1.0), as this version has finalized bandwidth, electrical specifications, signaling, etc.PCIe 6.0 will double previous Gen5 bandwidth to 63 GT/s, and PCIe will continue to rely on PAM4 signaling. PCIe 6.0 will also make use of low-latency forward error correction (FEC), and will be fully backwards compatible with PCIe 1.x through 5.0.\u00a0Bear in mind that, like DRAM, interface and bus technologies have a long gestation period. PCI-SIG released the final PCIe 5.0 spec in May of 2019, and consumers won\u2019t see PCIe 5.0 capable hardware until, at soonest, the second half of 2021.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Source: PCISIG: PCIe\u00ae 6.0 Specification, Version 0.7: Continuing ProgressArctic Liquid Freezer II 420mm AIOOne of the more interesting pieces of hardware announced recently (that isn\u2019t a CPU or GPU) is a new 420mm variant in Arctic\u2019s Liquid Freezer II line up. We looked at the Arctic Freezer II 280, which was heavily requested from our readers/viewers, and we ended up rather impressed with it, despite some assembly difficulty. Nonetheless, we ended up naming it the best CPU cooler for Ryzen.So, it\u2019s interesting that Arctic is adding a 420mm radiator option, which may be appealing to those with the case compatibility to mount a 420mm radiator. Aside from the increased radiator size, the other feature to note is the integrated 40mm fan that resides in the pump block. This fan is aimed at adding additional cooling to the surrounding VRM components.\u00a0Arctic is still touting the use of its in-house developed pump solution, which you can learn more about in our previous Arctic Freezer II Tear Down video. Both the pump and the VRM fan are PWM-controlled, and the cold plate is your standard copper, micro-skivved affair. Arctic uses its own MX-4 thermal compound for the cold plate. As users have likely deduced, the radiator uses three 140mm fans. This unit should sell for around ~$140, as EU pricing is currently at \u20ac120.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Source: Arctic: Liquid Freezer II - 420AMD x86 Market Share 3Q20As usual, Mercury Research has provided the x86 market share numbers, which show AMD snatching some of its biggest market share numbers since 2007.\u00a0These numbers represent quarter 3 2020 and were taken before the launch of Ryzen 5000. AMD makes up 22.4% of the x86 market share as a whole. For AMD, this is an increase of 4.1 points over Q2 and 6.3 points over Q3 2019.In the x86 desktop space, AMD is showing it\u2019s 12th consecutive quarter of growth -- with a .9 point quarterly increase bringing them to 20.1% of the desktop market. This is a 2.1 point increase YoY. For notebooks, AMD broke their record for notebook market share, now at 20.2%. This is up from their previous record of 19.9% which was Q2 2020.This is impressive growth for AMD, who now has their strongest presence in the desktop space since 2013, and their largest presence in the overall x86 market since 2007.The server market, as usual, gets a little muddy. AMD historically bases its share number on IDC\u2019s research, which only captures the 1P and 2P market, whereas Mercury Research captures all x86-class servers. That said, Mercury shows AMD sitting at 6.6%, marking a 0.8 point increase QoQ and a 2.3 point increase YoY.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Source:\u00a0 Tom\u2019s: AMD Reaches Highest CPU Market Share Since 2007, Q3 2020 Report (Updated)Massachusetts Expands Right to Repair Law, New PrecedentWhile not strictly hardware news, right to repair is an important measure that affects all consumers in some way or another. Furthermore, unless you\u2019re new here, you likely know that the right to repair is something of extreme importance to us at GN. It\u2019s something we support and follow closely.To that end, Massachusetts has long been an important battleground for right to repair. It was Massuchestts\u2019 2012 right to repair legislation that gave way to The Motor Vehicle Owners' Right to Repair Act, which eventually forced the automobile industry -- and its various coalitions and organizations -- to sign a Memorandum of Understanding, acknowledging that they would support the law in all 50 states.Now, in the face of the deluge of personal and telemetry-related data on drivers, generated by their cars, Massachusetts just passed a very important new law. Question 1, or the \u201cRight to Repair Law\u201d Vehicle Data Access Requirement Initiative, states that independent repair shops are permitted access to wirelessly transmitted repair and diagnostic data that has since been funneled directly to manufacturers. This new law is set to take effect with model year 2022 vehicles.\u00a0iFixit\u2019s CEO commented: \u201cModern cars can send maintenance information directly to the manufacturers, cutting out local mechanics. Question 1 makes sure that consumers can continue to fix their own vehicles, or get them fixed at the shop of their choice.\u201d\u00a0The war over data generated by cars has been brewing for some time. It\u2019s the typical money versus privacy trope: Car makers want to control and monetize the data, and privacy and right to repair advocates rightly take issue with that. This new law could help galvanize another nationwide effort to crack open car data, and pry it away from manufacturers. Separately, it could very well have knock-on effects for digital right to repair intaives, such as for smartphones, consoles, laptops, etc.\u00a0Source: iFixit: Massachusetts Just Passed the World\u2019s Most Advanced Right to Repair LawArm Cortex-A78C CPUArm recently took the wraps of what we believe is its first CPU aimed directly at laptops, the Arm Cortex-A78C. This comes during Apple\u2019s transition to custom Arm silicon, and in increasing interest from Microsoft and its Windows 10 on Arm systems.\u00a0Arm as much as teased that it was looking to dip its toes into the water with x86-competing offerings when it announced its Cortex X Custom Program and the Cortex X-1. The CXC and X1 are borne out of the idea of building chips beyond Arm\u2019s traditional ecosystem and PPA (Performance Per Area) requirements, building custom chips that are scalable to different form factors and larger devices.While the Cortex-A78C CPU isn\u2019t itself derived from CXC -- rather, it\u2019s a derivative of Arm\u2019s most recent Cortex A-series IP -- it demonstrates that Arm seems serious about punching ever higher with its compute performance.\u00a0The Arm Cortex-A78 supported configurations of 4 little cores and 4 big cores. Now, the Cortex-A78C will support 8 big CPU cores with its \u201coctacore\u201d configurations. The Cortex-A78C continues Arm\u2019s heterogeneous, multi-core computing trend with configurations scaling up to eight \u201cbig\u201d cores. The Cortex-A78C also uses a noticeably bigger 8MB L3 cache, aimed at improving performance in data-dense applications. The Cortex-A78C also introduces Pointer Authentication (PAC) which ARM says will \u201cminimize the attack surface to ensure data on the device is kept secure.\u201d PAC will reduce Return-Orientated-Programming (ROP) and Jump-Orientated-Programming (JOP) attacks by 60 and 40 percent respectively.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Source: ARM: Secure scalable performance with Arm Cortex-A78C CPUNext-Gen Consoles Purchases Will Be Different This Year\u00a0Due to growing Covid-19 risks, Sony has already stated that no PS5 consoles will be available in stores on launch day. However, Best Buy has gone as far as not permitting customers in stores on launch day or throughout the holiday season to buy consoles in person. Instead, purchase will be online only. Although, customers are still able to pick up their order via curbside pick up. Target beat Sony to punch, stating on Twitter that the new consoles would only be available in stores to fulfill online orders.\u00a0Wal-Mart has also joined Best Buy in this practice, stating that its inventory of next-gen consoles will only be available online.

For whatever reason, Microsoft has decided to dismantle the Control Panel menu piece by piece, and if preview builds are anything to go by, the \u201cPrograms and Features\u201d page will be the next part of the Control Panel to get the axe.\u00a0Source: TechRadar: Microsoft begins killing off the Control Panel in Windows 10Editorial: Steve Burke, Eric Hamilton, Keegan GallickVideo: Keegan Gallick    Related ArticlesHW News - Newegg Sells Incompatible Combos, EVGA Z790 Boards, PSU Misinformation Hardware  stub October 4, 2022HW News - Intel Arc Isn't Dead, Melting GPU Power Cables 12VHPWR, & RTX 40 Coolers Hardware  stub September 20, 2022HW News - Video Card Maker Layoffs, Intel HEDT Returns, AMD Gaming Chairs Hardware  stub August 7, 2022     Footer                   Privacy Policy   Copyright \u00a9 2023 GamersNexus, LLC.

In an effort to combat this sweltering silicon Asus has announced a slew of watercooled cards will be joining the pool-party.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: the top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest graphics card: your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: get into the game ahead of the restAsus has been working with EKWB to produce water-cooled GeForce RTX cards sporting swanky, pre-installed EK-Quantum Vector water blocks.The new compact, single-slot RTX 3070, RTX 3080, and RTX 3090 GPUs will need to be utilised as part of an existing full water cooling loop, and will be rocking EKWB coolers with a split-flow engine, underpinned by a nickel-plated copper cooling block.\u00a0All this topped with a classy transparent acrylic cover, the minimal design of which allows your choice of coolant and RGB lighting to speak for itself. It will also showcase the beauty of the underlying tech, as opposed to overpowering it with flashy casing, like that of Gigabytes new Aorus Xtreme Waterforce.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Asus)(Image credit: Asus)The exposed PCB look gives it an air of \"Yes, my components are out, and I'm proud.\"The new cards will be hitting stores in late November, but no price has been speculated as yet. Still, don't get your hopes up for nabbing one until next year, these second generation RTX cards are like gold-dust at the moment.\u00a0You can keep an eye out on RTX 3080 stock here, and see what retailers have to say on the matter. Also, if you ever do manage to get your hands on a 30-series card devoid of a water block, you can always get your hands on a separate EKWB cooling block here for around $150. \u00a0The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nAsus\n\n\nKatie WickensSocial Links NavigationHardware WriterScrew sports, Katie would rather watch Intel, AMD and Nvidia go at it.

It corroborates reports that the card features 8GB of GDDR6 memory and a memory clock speed of 1400 MHz.\nMSI's RTX 3060 Ti is selling on Amazon for \u00a3490.18, which works out at around $655. It's important to note that tech goods in the UK cost much more than their US counterparts, mostly because of the extra tax. UK retailer Scan, meanwhile, lists the Gigabyte Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Eagle 8GB with a December 2 launch date, though there's no price right now.\n\nTom's Hardware notes that MSI's RTX 3060 Ti is for sale for between \u20ac550 ($655) and \u20ac685 ($816) in several European countries, while versions of the card from Gigabyte, Inno3D, and Zotac are listed in Estonia, Latvia, and Spain for \u20ac484 ($576) and \u20ac592 ($705).\nThose are all very expensive, even taking into consideration the difference in overseas prices, but we still haven't had confirmation of the MSRP, which is rumored to be between $349 and $399. It could just be that these third-party cards cost more, especially as this will likely be another tech product with low availability at launch. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\n Nvidia RTX 50 series supply woes extend to system builders as scalpers drive up prices \n\n\n\nEarlier this week, the RTX 3060 Ti appeared in the Ashes of the Singularity database, beating all Turing offerings bar the RTX 2080 Super.

Voice and handwriting recognition, medical diagnoses, digital assistants (like the Google Assistant or Siri) and self driving cars are just a scratch in the surface of all the different means and methods by which machines infer, learn, grow and seemingly think on their own. NVIDIA is incredibly invested in machine learning tech, and has seen explosive growth in its datacenter business due to the massive advancements in AI. Of course, data centers are only one place where AI and machine learning live; intelligent devices at the edge also need to capture input from the world around us. That's where NVIDIA's Jetson AI platforms come in.\n\r\nSome of NVIDIA's higher-end Jetson products are a little pricey for hobbyists and beginners, and so the company has created the Jetson Nano. This platform has been around for a little while as a way for AI enthusiasts to break into the world of hardware-accelerated machine learning or experienced developers to prove out and quickly deploy concepts. The cheapest Jetson Nano 2GB kit is now a $59\u00a0system-on-module with plenty of IO connectivity built into edge connectors, where the compute resource is socketed and not much bigger than a traditional laptop SO-DIMM. This little board has a quad-core Arm Cortex A57 CPU and an integrated 128-core NVIDIA Maxwell-based GPU that accelerates CUDA-targeted workloads, and has just enough storage to boot up and run a project.\u00a0\n\r\nNVIDIA's JetPack software development kit drives a whole host of applications that rely on trained AI models and inferencing performed on its GPU architectures. That Maxwell GPU inside the Jetson Nano should be capable of crunching data quickly enough to handle all sorts of real-world use cases. Image processing encompasses a ton of problems that can be solved, from object identification to obstacle tracking. Self-driving cars, agriculture tools, and factory equipment are just a few of the applications that currently run on NVIDIA's AI technologies, and Jetson Nano affords you access to the same APIs and software development tools.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAn Affordable, Accessible AI Development Kit\r\nThe Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit takes that same module and pairs it with a host board with physical USB, HDMI, Ethernet, and DisplayPort connectors. There's also a 40-pin GPIO header and a ribbon cable socket for a serial camera interface.\u00a0Back in March of 2019, NVIDIA released the first version of the Jetson Nano, which has 4 GB of memory for $99.\u00a0The original version of the host board also had a micro USB port and a barrel connector as two different options for the power supply.\u00a0\n\r\nTo get the Jetson Nano dev kit into the hands of even more students and developers, the new 2 GB Jetson Nano pairs that same SoC with just 2 GB of memory, but costs a mere $59. This one trades out the micro USB and barrel connectors in favor of a single USB Type-C connector for power. The GPIO pins and camera socket remain, which is great news for folks interested in robotics. It does strip out a USB port and the DisplayPort connector to keep costs down, though.\n\r\nGetting started is pretty simple. The kit NVIDIA sent us included the Jetson Nano 2 GB SoM, a dev board, a USB-C power supply, and a 64 GB micro SD card. Installing the operating system requires downloading an image from NVIDIA's developer portal and flashing it to the SD card using an image flashing tool like balenaEtcher. Once the image has been flashed to the SD card, pop it into the micro SD reader on the Nano and plug in power, keyboard, mouse, Ethernet, and an HDMI or DisplayPort cable. The development tools are already installed and ready to go as part of the image flashing process.\u00a0\n\n\nFlashing an image to the SD card is a simple one-step process\nGod Mode - Now the AI Creation Fun Can Begin\r\nOnce the Ubuntu 18.04-based Linux distribution is up and running, it's time to start looking into AI projects. To get started, NVIDIA recommends checking out the Hello AI World inference project on GitHub. There's a ton of functionality and a variety of pre-trained models ready to infer data based on images captured by the camera module or stored in local files. The kit supplied by NVIDIA didn't include a camera, but we picked up a module with a Sony IMX219 sensor and a 160-degree field of view for around $22 on Amazon.\u00a0\n\r\nWe cloned this\u00a0Jetson Inference repo and built the project using NVIDIA's documentation, which is straightforward for anybody who's ever run a makefile in Linux. Even if you're not familiar with the process, the instructions are pretty clear for beginners to get going. Unfortunately, since the Jetson Nano relies on its quad-core Cortex A57 complex to handle compilation, that process took around a half hour. It's fine to get up and grab a cup of coffee, but around around half-way through the process we were prompted for our user account password so the next step could install some additional dependencies.\u00a0\n\n\r\nThe simplest use case for these pre-trained AI models is image classification. Using it is simple: drag a bunch of images into a local folder and then turn the AI app loose on it. The AI model reads each picture, pulls out objects, and then makes its best attempt to identify the subject of the image. Along with the answer, the AI also provides a percentile representing how sure it is that it's picked the right subject. It was a lot of fun to try to fool the AI by having it analyze \"bad\" photos, where what we would think of as the subject is out of focus or off-center.\u00a0\r\nFun With Image Detection And Getting It Right\nBuilding the Hello AI World project on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2 GB\n\r\nThe Hello AI World project comes with its own sample photos that have a resolution of 1024x512 that show how the various AI models can process images. We ran the AI on a couple of those to make sure it was all working as anticipated, and then we threw it a curveball. The image below is a blurred person running past a house with a car in the driveway. We wanted to see what the AI thought of an out-of-focus subject. The image is also much larger than the samples at 3888x2592, or around 20 times the number of pixels. These take more processing power to push through the model since they have so much more detail.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\r\nAs we ran the project, we were mostly concerned with whether there would be a performance hit due to the newer, cheaper Jetson Nano having half the RAM of the original model. Happily, that did not seem to be the case. NVIDIA has a series of benchmark figures published for the original model complete with scores expressed in frames per second and in milliseconds. Since each run of the Hello World AI project pumps out metrics showing how long a process took, it was an easy comparison to make. Every time, the 2 GB Jetson Nano sped through the images at roughly the same speed of the original. The only time we ever saw any sort of memory warning was when the Chromium browser was running with a couple of tabs open showing the project's documentation. That means it's possible to run into some overhead issues, but only when trying to do multiple things at the same time.\u00a0\n\r\nImage classification is the process of identifying what is the subject of a photo. The AI model scans over an image and adds a label showing what it thinks the subject is, and a percentage of certainty that the AI has that it's correct. The various models use different sized chunks of the image to figure out what's in each part, and then confidently (or not) decides which detected object in each chunk is the subject. Then figures out overall what the subject is.\u00a0\n\nAfter each run, the AI reports back how long each step of processing took\n\n\n\r\nThe AI did a great job with the sample photos, but kind of stumbled out of the gate with our huge torture test image. While processing only took around 40 milliseconds (according to the tool's output), it identified the subject as a parking meter, with only a 15% confidence in its assessment. Fortunately every processing method has several different models to choose from, many of which take longer to run but do more work to try to refine the conclusion. Unfortunately, we ran a handful of them, and all of them had some hilariously wrong results. Various models thought the subject was a motorized scooter, a car, and a bee. We're guessing the yellow and black appearance of the runner's shirt influenced that decision.\u00a0\n\r\nUndeterred, we moved on. The next \"step\" in the process is object identification. AI models run against an image to try to find various objects that aren't part of the background. This time the model places all of the objects in the photo in different colored boxes. Each box has its own label that shows what it thinks the object is and what percentage of certainty it has in its conclusion. This time, even the simplest AI model was capable of identifying both the runner and a car in the background.\u00a0\n\n\nThis time the model correctly identified objects in the photo, despite how blurry the runner was.\u00a0\n\r\nLast is semantic segmentation, which is a per-pixel process that identifies different objects in a photo and colorizes them. The image below is again our sample with the various objects that the AI thought might be the subject highlighted. This sheds some light on our results earlier where it thought the subject was a motorized scooter or a parking meter, since it really only identified the cars as subjects of the photo. The runner was likely the object identified as a parking meter or a motor scooter, since the only in-focus objects it could really detect semantically were in focus.\u00a0\n\n\nSemantic Segmentation identifies subjects\u00a0on a per-pixel basis\n\r\nAll of that might seem amusing, or like a failure of the AI, but maybe you're familiar with the phrase \"garbage in, garbage out\". The photo might have artistic value, but it's not clear or in focus, and the AI could only rely on a blurry mess to try to identify what it was. The fact that it pulled out a person at all is, frankly, amazing. When the subject was in focus, the results are much more solid. Below is one such example of the image classification neural network using the default fastest model on a clearer image. While the results aren't perfect, we can at least kind of see where they came from.\u00a0\n\nMaybe the white lines made the AI think the photo happened on the race track\n\nThe dark car on the right with tinted windows may not be long like a limo, but this result is understanable\n\nThe traffic light was the closest object in this photo\n\n\nCommunity AI Projects Can Be Fascinating\r\nOnce we were satisfied everything was working as it should by tinkering with the Hello AI World beginner project, it was time to hit NVIDIA's\u00a0Jetson Community Projects page. Some of the projects here require very little in the way of additional hardware, such as NVIDIA's own Real-Time Human Pose Estimator, but have limited utility. One more useful project that doesn't need a ton of hardware is the AI Thermometer, which relies on a FLIR thermal camera module to read the temperature of a person and send an alert if the person has a fever.\u00a0\n\r\nThe best way I've found to learn about a software development topic or framework is to find an existing sample and use it and walk through the code to see what's going on. That meant picking one of the projects we had the hardware for and digging in, and turning a camera stream into electronic music seemed like a fun example.\u00a0The \"DeepStream <3 OSC\" project was the perfect candidate: it only needs a video source, and then it will turn detected objects into sonic frequencies as a sort of interactive music machine. The \"music\" generated by the system is controlled by a script takes in an object and spits out a musical note. The project has a nice demo on YouTube to check out. Hit play below for a taste of The Matrix, recreated in sound...\n\n\n\n\n\r\nOther projects need a bit more of an investment in terms of hardware, but have the potential to be a lot of fun. The JetBot robotics kit looks like a relatively inexpensive way to get started in the world of AI-driven robotics. Folks who own a 3D printer can just print their own chassis, while those who don't can buy one of a handful of commercially produced kits. The robot gets around using a set of Jupyter Notebooks, which are web apps that assist in programming the robot, including live code manipulation in the browser. It looks like a pretty straightforward way to get into robotics, and should make for a nice cold-weather indoor family fun project.\u00a0\n\n\n\r\nWe had wanted to do some benchmark testing with the Jetson Nano. The problem is that the biggest ML test suite around, MLbench, does not support Arm64 in its publicly-available version. When we tried to build using the included scripts, it failed because SSE isn't supported, since that's an x86 feature. The test also doesn't quite know what to make of the CUDA cores, either. As far as the projects that are available from NVIDIA's community, everything seemed pretty speedy, though performance isn't really the focus here. Other higher-end, more expensive Jetson platforms are obviously faster, and those who need the best performance should focus there. The Jetson Nano 2GB kit, on the other hand, is a nice entry-level or low power development and testing platform.\u00a0\n\n\nJetson Nano 2 GB Conclusions\r\nThe 2 GB version of NVIDIA's Jetson Nano can handle just about any project that its more expensive sibling can, at a price that more folks can afford. Ringing in at $59, which is roughly comparable to a Raspberry Pi 4, the 2 GB Jetson Nano has plenty of compute power for a wide variety of machine learning tasks. The SO-DIMM sized compute board is small enough to lose on a cluttered desk (don't ask me how I know this), and the host board that accompanies the development kit only doubles the footprint. Despite its diminutive size, there's enough connectivity to do just about anything from real-time AI image processing (with an optional camera) to driving robotics kits. \n\n\n\n\n\r\nJust as important for any educational or hobbyist platform is the availability of samples and documentation. NVIDIA's got that covered in the form of sample projects. The Jetson community has contributed quite a bit of open-source material for study, too. For anybody who's interested in getting started in the world of machine learning, the Jetson Nano 2 GB is an excellent tool with plenty of documentation and sample code to get started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, (nasdaq:nvda), jetson-nano\n\n\n\nRelated content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring AI With NVIDIA\u2019s $59 Jetson Nano 2GB Dev Kit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRage Against The eMachine: A Ryzen And Radeon Retro Revival\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEK Fluid Gaming 270 Conquest Review: Immaculate PC Gaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTONOR Q9 USB Microphone Kit Review: Affordable, Quality Audio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDJI Mavic Air 2 Review: A Powerful Drone For Any Skill Level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT STUFF IN SYSTEMS\n\nExploring AI With NVIDIA\u2019s $59 Jetson...\nRage Against The eMachine: A Ryzen And...\nEK Fluid Gaming 270 Conquest Review:...\nTONOR Q9 USB Microphone Kit Review:...\nDJI Mavic Air 2 Review: A Powerful Drone...\nMaingear Turbo Review: A Jaw-Dropping...\nOnePlus Buds Review: Great Sound,...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEEP INFORMED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSITE\n\nHome\n\n\nReviews\n\n\nNews\n\n\nBlogs\n\nFull Site\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nPC Components\n\n\nSystems\n\n\nMobile\n\n\nIT Infrastructure\n\n\nLeisure\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nCOMPANY\n\nAbout\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nNews Tips\n\n\nContact\n\n\nPrivacy And Terms\n\n\nHotTech\n\n\n\nMORE\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nShop\n\n\n\nSTAY CONNECTED\n\nTwitter\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            As an Amazon and Howl Technologies Associate, HotHardware earns a commission from qualifying purchases made on this site.

Videocardz asserts that the iChill X3 will run with three 9cm scythe blade fans (as seen elsewhere on Ampere graphics cards from the manufacturer), along with an RGB Tail Fin (as seen above \u2013 which we suspect you\u2019ll either love or hate).As for the Twin X2, that will have the same appearance as the existing RTX 3070 model from Inno3D.Imminent launch?As we\u2019ve already heard, the buzz on the grapevine is that RTX 3060 Ti models will be launched on December 2, only a couple of weeks away now, and the appearance of this evidence would appear to confirm that a release might be very close. But as we\u2019ve said, let\u2019s not get too carried away at this point.Pricing is expected to be pitched around the $399 mark, although take that with a large dose of salt. Of course, prices for third-party manufacturer cards will vary anyway, but Videocardz notes that Inno3D\u2019s price tags should be close to Nvidia\u2019s recommended pricing.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The RTX 3060 Ti was also recently spotted on sale as offered by a Saudi Arabian retailer, with images of boxed Gigabyte products shared on video (and there were leaked images before that, as we mentioned at the outset).

The NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX  is one of  the latest board they\u2019ve released. The board is available as a Developer Kit that contains all the inputs and connections necessary to use it for prototyping IoT solutions.Today we are going to take a look at a new SBC from Nvidia which is the Jetson Xavier NX. It is mainly focused at artificial intelligence techniques like image recognition, computer vision etc.Also, in this guide I\u2019ll show you a workaround to use NVMe SSD as your rootfs device and use a Micro SD card as bootloader only which gives us full SSD performance after boot.So let's have a look at it!What Is the Jetson Xavier NX Developer Kit ?TheJetson Xavier NX Developer Kit costs around $399. It\u2019s the perfect solution for tinkerers and robotics enthusiasts! You can do most things you do with a regular computer like web browsing, document editing, playing games, coding and much more. This developers kit delivers the compute performance necessary to run AI workloads at unprecedented power, cost, and size.\nHere are some of the key compute features of the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX Developer Kit:NVIDIA Volta architecture with 384 NVIDIA CUDA cores and 48 Tensor cores6-core NVIDIA Carmel ARM  v8.2 64-bit CPU6 MB L2 + 4 MB L32x NVDLA Engines7-Way VLIW Vision Processor8 GB 128-bit LPDDR4x 51.2GB/sGigabit Ethernet, M.2 Key E (WiFi/BT included), M.2 Key M (NVMe)2x MIPI CSI-2 D-PHY lanes4x USB 3.1, USB 2.0 Micro-BGPIOs, I2C, I2S, SPI, UARTThe NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX  is static sensitive and is shipped in a static-protective bag, so be sure to follow appropriate antistatic control measures to avoid damage of the board.1 / 2\nAnd it comes with options for 10-watt and 15-watt power envelopes. The Xavier NX Developer Kit has a micro USB port, but unlike with a Raspberry Pi, it\u2019s used for data transfer not power. The Developer Kit is powered via a proprietary power brick that uses a barrel adapter.Things You Will Need:To get started and boot the Jetson Xavier NX you need the following hardwares:Jetson Xavier NX Developer Kit30W power supply (recommended)M.2 NVMe Internal SSD(optional)A minimum 16GB micro SD card.A computer with an internet connection and the ability to flash your microSD card.  It can be computer running Windows, MacOS or Linux. Here we\u2019ll be using laptop.USB keyboard and mouseMonitor and HDMI cableThe below instructions are for installing Jetpack on a Jetson Xavier NX that can be connected to a screen and a keyboard/mouse. If you want to do a headless install, you\u2019ll need to look up instructions for enabling Wi-Fi through a serial USB port and connect to Jetson Xavier NX via SSH from your local area network.Step 1 - Prepare an Anti-Static Work Area (Recommended)Digital electronics are vulnerable to electrostatic discharges (ESD) from your body and surrounding objects. To help maximize the life and reliability of your Jetson Xavier NX, you should not touch it unless you are grounded with a reliable ESD wrist strap from a reputable manufacturer.Here I am using anti-static mat. It will ensure that my sensitive electronics are well protected.Step 2 - Download the Jetson Xavier NX SD Card imageTo boot up your Jetson Xavier NX board you will need to prepare a microSD card with a bootable image. NVIDIA provides a prebuilt image - JetPack,  that you can download from the official website of NVIDIA.Download the latest JetPack image from here.\nSign up for the NVIDIA Developer Program \u2013 this enables you to download  JetPack image.After log in, click on the below button:\nJetPack 4.4 is the NVIDIA stack containing Linux, board drivers and SDKs for GPU, AI and ML processing. NVIDIA calls it's Linux, L4T (Linux for Tegra) and it's currently at version 32.4.2 that comes default with Ubuntu 18.04.Step 3 - Writing the Jetpack Image to the SD CardAfter you have downloaded the image, you need to download the balenaEtcher to flash the image to the SD card.Etcher is a free program for Windows, macOS, and Linux users makes the process simple.To write the operating system image to the SD card, follow the next steps:Download Etcher \u2013 select the right one for your operating system. Then, install it.Under Select Image, point Etcher to the Jetpack image file you downloaded earlier.Under Select Drive, pick out your SD card from the list of options.Finally, click Flash!, and your SD card will be ready for use in no time.Once you have the operating system installed on the SD card, you just need to insert it into the SD card slot of your Jetson Xavier NX.Step 4 - Connecting the NVMe SSD to the Jetson NX(optional)By default, Jetson NX boots up and stores all of its programs on a microSD memory card, which has a maximum theoretical bandwidth of 60 - 95 MB/sec on the Jetson Xavier NX. In real-life, even the best microSD cards for Jetson get no faster than about 40 MB/sec in sequential writes.  Using an internal SSD as your main storage drive could speed things up significantly.1 / 2\nInstalling the SSD into Jetson NX is pretty much a no-brainer. Make sure that your Jetson NX is powered off.Follow the instructions below  to install NVMe SSD:1 / 4\nStep 5 - First boot and configuration of the NVIDIA Jetson NanoAfter you\u2019ve downloaded and flashed the image file to your micro-SD card, insert the card into the micro-SD card slot. Connect a screen via HDMI, a keyboard/mouse and finally connect the board to power. There is no power button on the Jetson Xavier NX, as soon as you plug in the power cable, it will begin booting upWhen you boot the system for the first time, you'll be taken through some initial setup, including:Review and accept NVIDIA Jetson software EULASelect system language, keyboard layout, and time zoneCreate username, password, and computer nameLog in\nAfter all these steps you should see the Ubuntu 18.04 GUI Desktop. That\u2019s it!\nBefore starting anything, it might be good to update everything. You can do that by entering the commands below.sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get upgradeStep 6 - Test the read/write speed of the MicroSD Card and SSDThere are several ways to check the SD memory cards read and write speeds. The best method I prefer is to use gnome disk utility which gives is completely GUI based and presents the results in the form of graph and average read and write speeds.You can also use Hdparm and dd tools. Hdparm is a nice tool focused specifically on storage drives information and benchmarking. It gives basic raw throughput stats for buffered reads. dd simply copies data from one place (if) to another (of) to see write speed.Open terminal windows and copy and paste the below command to launch gnome disk utility:gnome-disks\nSelect SD cardOnce you've selected a storage device, clicking the button with two gears will bring up a menu of actions you can perform on the device. You can delete partitions, finish checking or repairing the file system, retrieve or restore backups and benchmark selected storage media.Click on Benchmark partition. Then, click on Start Benchmarking button it starts benchmarking of SD card.\nA new window with charts opens.Benchmark results for MicroSD Card\nYou\u2019ll read something around 100 MB/s for most of micro SD cards, but none of them got this result in benchmarks. However, Samsung Evo Plus and SanDisk Ultra are probably the best brand for micro SD card, and they often win this kind of benchmarks with their high-end productsThen select your SSD disk and start Benchmarking.Benchmark results for SSD disk.\nThat\u2019s it.As can be seen from the results, adding a powerful, internal SSD to your Jetson Xavier NX can boost performance in certain areas, most notably application load times.So I think, for most projects, it'll still be easiest to use a microSD card, and to pick a really good one, like the one I use and recommend, either Samsung Evo Plus or SanDisk.Step 7 - Run the Jetson Xavier NX from SSD (Not Boot from SSD)Unfortunately, at this time, the Jetson Xavier NX does not currently support SSD boot, so you cannot boot an OS from an NVMe drive currently. However, you can run it from SSD after boot.The solution was already provided by JetsonHacks. The simplest possible way to use the SSD is just as an additional disk drive alongside the standard Jetson Xavier NX micro-SD card. To do this you will have to partition and format the SSD.You still need SD card plugged in order to boot the device cause NX doesn\u2019t allow you to boot directly from SSD.Firstly, format the SSD you have installed. Run gnome-disks utility:1 / 2\nThe next step is to actually create partition. Click on the button with two gears and create partition image.1 / 3\nAfter that, clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/jetsonhacks/rootOnNVMeand switch over to that repository\u2019s directory:cd rootOnNVMeNext, copy the rootfs of the eMMC/SD card to the SSD./copy-rootfs-ssd.shFinally, we will add a service which will run a script when the system starts up:./setup-service.shThen check the boot partition by running below command:df /bootOutput/dev/nvme0n1p1 231626904 13320164 206471044  7% /After creating the partition, just reboot and the SSD will be automatically mounted. You can see that it is mounted, and where, by running the lsblk command, or by simply hovering on the Removable Devices icon at the right end of the top panel.Booting the Jetson Xavier NX from SDD requires updating the firmware. So, let's wait when NVIDIA release it.At this point the installation and simple configuration of the SSD on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX is complete.Step 8 - Maximum frequency and change NVP power modeChange NVP power mode to maximum(6 core and 15W):sudo nvpmodel -m 2Next, we will lock Jetson Xavier NX, at its maximum frequency and power mode by running the following command:sudo jetson_clocksThis will spin the fan, as well as set the CPU and GPU clocks to their maximum value in the current performance profile.To check the current power mode enter the following command in a terminal.sudo nvpmodel -qOutput:NV Fan Mode:quietNV Power Mode: MODE_15W_6CORE2An alternative way to set Xavier NX power mode is to mouse-click power mode options on the top-right corner of the Ubuntu desktop.\nTo maximize the fan speed enter below command:sudo /usr/bin/jetson_clocks --fanTo see the current status, run below commad:sudo /usr/bin/jetson_clocks --showOutput:SOC family:tegra194 Machine:NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX Developer KitOnline CPUs: 0-5CPU Cluster Switching: Disabledcpu0: Online=1 Governor=schedutil MinFreq=1190400 MaxFreq=1420800 CurrentFreq=1190400 IdleStates: C1=1 c6=1cpu1: Online=1 Governor=schedutil MinFreq=1190400 MaxFreq=1420800 CurrentFreq=1190400 IdleStates: C1=1 c6=1cpu2: Online=1 Governor=schedutil MinFreq=1190400 MaxFreq=1420800 CurrentFreq=1190400 IdleStates: C1=1 c6=1cpu3: Online=1 Governor=schedutil MinFreq=1190400 MaxFreq=1420800 CurrentFreq=1190400 IdleStates: C1=1 c6=1cpu4: Online=1 Governor=schedutil MinFreq=1190400 MaxFreq=1420800 CurrentFreq=1267200 IdleStates: C1=1 c6=1cpu5: Online=1 Governor=schedutil MinFreq=1190400 MaxFreq=1420800 CurrentFreq=1267200 IdleStates: C1=1 c6=1GPU MinFreq=114750000 MaxFreq=1109250000 CurrentFreq=114750000EMC MinFreq=204000000 MaxFreq=1600000000 CurrentFreq=1600000000 FreqOverride=0Fan: speed=130NV Power Mode: MODE_15W_6COREStep 9 - Monitor GPU, CPU and other stats on Jetson Xavier NXBy default, the Jetpack provides the tegrastats utility, which reports memory usage and processor usage for Tegra-based devices.

This assists in software development to ensure efficient use of hardware. More details about jetson-stats can be found in pypi.org website.sudo -H pip3 install -U jetson-statsYou may need pip3 for installing some applications that are developed using Python and can be installed easily using pip. Install pip3:sudo apt-get install python3-pipOnce you are done, you can shut down the Jetson Nano board with this command:sudo shutdown -r nowAfter reboot, to start jetson-stats type:jtopIf you installed jetson-stats successfully, you will see this dashboard.1 / 6\nYou can get a real-time view of memory usage using either the top or htop command. You may need to install htop if you get the message htop: command not found.  Install it by running:sudo apt-get install htopNow we're ready to actually run a real AI applications.Step 10 -  Running the Jetson Inference demosA great place to start is the Hello AI World example. Hello AI World is a great way to start using Jetson and experiencing the power of AI. NVIDIA's Jetson Inference repository includes lots of great scripts that allow you to perform image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation on both images and a live video stream.There are two ways to use the jetson-inference project:Run the pre-built Docker ContainerBuild the Project from SourceUsing the Docker container is recommended, you can run the pre-built Docker container without needing to compile the project or install PyTorch yourself. You can install and build jetson-inference project from source if you want, however it can be a frustrating and time-consuming process.To install Jetson Inference, you need to run the following command to clone the project:git clone --recursive https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inferenceGo to jetson-inference folder,cd jetson-inferencethen run,docker/run.shThis will take approximately 1 hour for the completion of installation process.Throughout the build process, you will be asked to download pre-trained models. Leave the default GoogleNet and ResNet-18 models selected and press enter to continue.\nYou may receive the following error message:\nClick Retry to fix it.Once installation is completed, open a terminal and navigate to the bin directory in aarch64:cd build/aarch64/binInside you'll find multiple C++ and Python scripts, there are examples, one for an image and one for a camera. The list of examples available are as follows:detectnet\u2013camera: Object detection with camera as input.detectnet\u2013console: Object detection with image as input instead of camera.imagenet\u2013camera: Image classification with camera as input.imagenet\u2013console: Image classification with input image pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.segnet\u2013camera: Semantic segmentation with camera as input.segnet\u2013console: Semantic segmentation with image as input.Now, you can run imagenet example:./imagenet images/jellyfish.jpg images/test/jellyfish.jpgImage file was generated inside of container. In order to copy a file from a container to the host, you can use the below command:docker cp <containerId>:/file/path/within/container /host/path/targetHere's my example:sudo docker cp sweet_sanderson:/jetson-inference/build/aarch64/bin/images/test/jellyfish.jpg /home/jetsonFinally,\nAnother example for image classification example/imagenet images/cat_1.jpg images/test/cat.jpgOutput:\nThen run command for Object Detection:./detectnet images/peds_0.jpg images/test/peds_0.jpgOutput:\nAnother one:./detectnet images/city_1.jpg images/test/city_1.jpgOutput\nFinally, run command for semantic segmentation./segnet-console images/city_0.jpg images/test/city_0.jpgOutput:\nOK, that is it.

It was their third attempt at getting a Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080. This time, they\u2019d be first in line.Since its September 17 release, the 3080\u2019s stock has been severely limited. And for weeks, Micro Center employees across the country have arrived at work to find eager gamers\u2014sometimes over a dozen of them\u2014waiting not so patiently for the hot GPU. Ebay resellers are listing the graphics cards for about $1,200.At 9 am, Micro Center employees ushered in the Okuns and several other gamers, including K. Kim, who had just dropped his son off at school. Once inside, an employee wearing a face mask solemnly told the group that, unfortunately, they only had four 3080s to distribute. Kim was fifth in line.\u201cIt's pretty crazy\u2014in the middle of a pandemic,\u201d Kim said, holding his Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070, a less specced-out version of the GPU he had hoped for. \u201cI didn't think the apocalypse would go like this\u2014you know, people waiting in line for $700 video cards.\u201dWhen Nvidia released the 30 series on September 17\u2014its most powerful graphics cards yet\u2014the GPUs promised to deliver gaming resolutions up to 8K, and handle 4K without sacrificing performance. Just a shit ton of pixels, right into your eyeballs. With upcoming blockbuster games like Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Cyberpunk: 2077, and Halo Infinite, gamers are scrambling to optimize their PC builds for ultra-ultra gameplay.\"I guess it's just a combination of everything going on in the world.\"Micro Center EmployeeThen, disaster: In a blog post describing the RTX 3080\u2019s launch, Nvidia describes it as \u201csimultaneously the best GPU launch ever and the most frustrating.\u201d Supplies on websites like Best Buy and Amazon vanished in minutes. Bots scooped up dozens of 3080s before customers could. Graphics cards were suddenly the new Supreme drops. In a PC Mag article, one admin for a bot organization explained: \u201cWhen given [the] chance, I\u2019m sure most people would purchase more than 10+ units if they have the capital and look to make upwards of $25,000+ USD in one single day from [the] secondary market.\u201dThe recent launch of AMD\u2019s Ryzen 5000 series of processors\u2014which UK retailer Scan describes as \u201cthe fastest-selling CPU launch we\u2019ve ever seen\"\u2014has experienced similar turmoil. With online purchase options blocked by bots, desperate gamers are braving risks associated with the pandemic and flocking to brick-and-mortar sellers. Best Buy says it\u2019s only selling the 30 series online; in the \u201cchain tech retail\u201d category, that leaves Micro Center.On the day the 3090 was released, cybersecurity worker Nate, 31, camped out outside a Duluth, Georgia, Micro Center for 26 hours to get the $1,500, top-of-the-line GPU. It was worth it, he says, for Destiny 2 or Far Cry 5 gameplay that could average 100 frames per second at 4k, \u201cwith zero dips below 60.\u201d To prepare weeks earlier, Nate went to Target and purchased a tent, sleeping bag, and lawn chair. At 8 am the day before launch, he expected to be the only person in line.\u201cThere were already 10 people there,\u201d he says.Micro Center employees warned Nate and the others that it was not safe for them to stand in a large group during a pandemic, and asked them to sleep in their cars. But the gamers chafed at the idea; for the 3080 launch a week earlier, opportunists waited in their cars until employees left, and then made a mad rush toward the store again. An empathetic employee went inside and came back out with a roll of tape to demarcate 6-foot squares. By the morning of launch, Nate says, 80 people were waiting in line. The store had 10 GPUs in stock.Although Nvidia maintains that it has \u201cgreat supply,\u201d it says it can\u2019t keep up with such high demand. The company says more stock is coming, but the shortage will continue throughout the year. It seems likely that the pandemic, which impacted factory hubs like China and Taiwan and the shipping industry at large, contributed to the worldwide shortage. AMD chief marketing officer John Taylor cites Covid-19 as a reason for the strong demand of his company\u2019s high-end processors as well. \u201cWith so much of the fun part of our lives disrupted,\u201d Taylor said in an emailed statement, \u201cimportant technology products now at the center of our lives are even more exciting when they launch.\u201d\u201cI would go as far as to say this is unprecedented in the last decade\u2014to have, a month and a half later, people waiting in line for a graphics card,\u201d says Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy who worked at AMD for 10 years. \u201cIt\u2019s a hot product, hotter than anyone expected.\u201d Demand for consumer PCs is ferocious right now, with at-home work and big interest in gaming boosting it by 11.7 percent year-on-year, according to research firm IDC. In the US, this has been the best quarter for the PC market in 10 years. For the highest-spec PC build, hobbyists and the hardcore alike want the best possible GPU. (Gamers say the 3080 in particular is a great bang for their buck.)Micro Center employees across the country say they don\u2019t generally know when shipments will come in, or how many at a time. Keeping everyone, including employees, in the dark helps prevent scalpers from dominating both the IRL and URL markets, where hundreds of the 30 series GPUs sell daily. \u201cPeople get angry,\u201d says one Micro Center employee in Brooklyn. \u201cYesterday, some older dude came up and started screaming about how he took a cab out here and wasted all his money. He was furious.\u201d The employee compared their workday mornings to hypebeast sneaker or streetwear launches, which regularly draw lines that wrap around city blocks.\u201cIt attracts some very weird people. Not people you should be afraid of. Just dorky people who are very passionate about their computer,\u201d says the Micro Center employee. Like other Micro Center staff WIRED spoke with, they didn\u2019t really \u201cget\u201d all the hype. Older graphics cards are fine, and at this stage in gaming tech, it\u2019s difficult to take full advantage of a 3090 when mainstream 8k gaming is still a distant dream. \u201cI guess it's just a combination of everything going on in the world\u2014people locked in for months and months\u2014and, you know, a lot of people got into this kind of PC gaming,\u201d the Brooklyn employee said. \u201cSomething new comes out and you've been sitting around doing nothing. You know, you want to go out and get it.\u201dSam, an art director for film and TV who also games, was standing outside the Brooklyn Micro Center with a big bag Thursday after calling an Uber. It was his third visit in recent weeks. Last Friday, after waiting in line outside the store for the 3080, he happened upon somebody returning theirs and followed them to a register. \u201cAt that point, I was flirting with the idea of the 3090,\u201d he says. The guy who got that day\u2019s 3090 decided he actually wanted a 3080, so they traded.Back again on Thursday morning, Sam had scored a scarce 5950 Ryzen processor. He\u2019d already ordered AMD\u2019s  Ryzen 3900 off B&H, which he says he\u2019ll probably sell to help pay off the pricier unit. He was buzzed. He finally got all his things. \u201cI call it going fishing,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have spent this much except it\u2019s so damn scarce.\u201dMore Great WIRED Stories\ud83d\udce9 Want the latest on tech, science, and more?
