(Photo: JOEL NITO/AFP via Getty Images)   By Ditas Lopez Banks in the Philippines warn their cash flow may be reduced by as much as 4 trillion pesos ($82 billion) should a bill that seeks to delay loan payments by a year becomes a law. The plan could result in \u201cmassive liquidity crunch\u201d of 2 trillion to 4 trillion pesos, or 20%-40% of outstanding loans, according to a document from the Bankers Association of the Philippines. This followed warnings from the central bank and a business group. \u201cNew lending would dry up; worthy borrowers deserving of new funds would not get them,\u201d the nation\u2019s largest group of lenders said. Smaller banks may not survive the financial squeeze, putting depositors\u2019 money at \u201cundue risk,\u201d it said. A pandemic relief bill passed by the House of Representatives proposes a year-long loan payment holiday, while the Senate\u2019s version suggests a one-month reprieve, according to the Bankers Association, which supports the latter. Lawmakers from both chambers of Congress must come up with a unified measure before it\u2019s sent for President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s final approval. \u00a9 2020 Bloomberg L.P.

The German manufacturer of BMWs, Minis and Rolls-Royces said sales had started to recover during the latest three-month period, including a 17% jump in deliveries in China, but the rebound would not fully make up for sales lost to COVID-19.  As a result of the sales slide, and higher costs for developing low-emission cars, BMW posted a pretax loss of 498 million euros, its first in over 11 years, and an operating loss of 666 million euros ($790 million) for the quarter. Shares in BMW fell 3% following the results, with some analysts saying they had not expected such a big loss in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). \"What matters now is how robust this upward trend is and when individual markets will follow suit,\" said Chief Executive Oliver Zipse, adding that its overall cars sales in July were higher than last year. BMW said, however, that its outlook did not factor in the potential impact of a second wave of COVID-19 infections, nor the prospect of a more sustained or deeper recession than expected in its key markets. Zipse said on a call that developments in the United States, which has the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide, were \"extremely worrying\". Sales in the United States made up 12.6% of deliveries in the first half of 2020, down from 15.2% in 2020. Overall, BMW said it expected global demand for luxury cars to fall by a fifth this year.  'CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM' The COVID-19 pandemic has already hit carmakers such as Fiat Chrysler <FCHA.MI>, Ford <F.N> and Daimler <DAIGn.DE> particularly hard at time when the auto industry is ramping up spending to clean up their combustion engines as well as developing low-emission technologies to conform with stringent European anti-pollution rules. BMW's EBIT margin for cars slumped to minus 10.4%, an historic low, down from 6.5% in the second quarter last year, though it maintained the forecast it made in May for a margin of 0% to 3% for the year as a whole. By contrast, electric-only car manufacturer Tesla <TSLA.O> saw its automotive gross margin widen to 25.4% in the second quarter, up from 18.9% a year earlier, despite a 5% drop in deliveries. Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois said BMW's margin forecast for the year suggested a healthy recovery in the second half of 2020, even though the second-quarter results were below the consensus.   Story continues \"We are now looking ahead to the second six-month period with cautious optimism and continue to target an EBIT margin between 0% and 3% for the automotive segment in 2020,\" Zipse said in a statement.BMW reiterated that it expected to make a pretax profit in 2020, albeit well below 2019 levels and for car deliveries to customers to fall significantly this year.(Reporting by Edward Taylor; Editing by Michelle Martin and David Clarke)  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

The rupee was aided by dollar sales by foreign banks and exporters during the session, a trader at a mid-sized private bank said.   Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

The University of Florida will use the design to build the fastest AI computer in academia.\nDGX SuperPODs are driving business results for companies like Continental in automotive, Lockheed Martin in aerospace and Microsoft in cloud-computing services.\nBirth of an AI System\nThe story of how and why NVIDIA built Selene starts in 2015.\nNVIDIA engineers started their first system-level design with two motivations. They wanted to build something both powerful enough to train the AI models their colleagues were building for autonomous vehicles and general purpose enough to serve the needs of any deep-learning researcher.\nThe result was the SATURNV cluster, born in 2016 and based on the NVIDIA Pascal GPU. When the more powerful NVIDIA Volta GPU debuted a year later, the budding systems group\u2019s motivation and its designs expanded rapidly.\n\nAI Jobs Grow Beyond the Accelerator\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to anticipate what\u2019s coming based on what we hear from researchers, building machines that serve multiple uses and have long lifetimes, packing as much processing, memory and storage as possible,\u201d said Michael Houston, a chief architect who leads the systems team.\nAs early as 2017, \u201cwe were starting to see new apps drive the need for multi-node training, demanding very high-speed communications between systems and access to high-speed storage,\u201d he said.\nAI models were growing rapidly, requiring multiple GPUs to handle them. Workloads were demanding new computing styles, like model parallelism, to keep pace.\nSo, in fast succession, the team crafted ever larger clusters of V100-based NVIDIA DGX-2 systems, called DGX PODs. They used 32, then 64 DGX-2 nodes, culminating in a 96-node architecture dubbed the DGX SuperPOD.\nThey christened it Circe for the irresistible Greek goddess. It debuted in June 2019 at No. 22 on the TOP500 list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers and currently holds No. 23.\nCutting Cables in a Computing Jungle\nAlong the way, the team learned lessons about networking, storage, power and thermals. Those learnings got baked into the latest NVIDIA DGX systems, reference architectures and today\u2019s 280-node Selene.\nIn the race through ever larger clusters to get to Circe, some lessons were hard won.\n\u201cWe tore everything out twice, we literally cut the cables out. It was the fastest way forward, but it still had a lot of downtime and cost. So we vowed to never do that again and set ease of expansion and incremental deployment as a fundamental design principle,\u201d said Houston.\nThe team redesigned the overall network to simplify assembling the system.\nThey defined modules of 20 nodes connected by relatively simple \u201cthin switches.\u201d Each of these so-called scalable units could be laid down, cookie-cutter style, turned on and tested before the next one was added.\nThe design let engineers specify set lengths of cables that could be bundled together with Velcro at the factory. Racks could be labeled and mapped, radically simplifying the process of filling them with dozens of systems.\nDoubling Up on InfiniBand\nEarly on, the team learned to split up compute, storage and management fabrics into independent planes, spreading them across more, faster network-interface cards.\nThe ratio of NICs to GPU doubled to 1:1. So did their speeds, going from 100 Gbit per second InfiniBand in Circe to 200G HDR InfiniBand in Selene. The result was a 4x increase in the effective node bandwidth.\nLikewise, memory and storage links grew in capacity and throughput to handle jobs with hot, warm and cold storage needs. Four storage tiers spanned 100 terabyte/second memory links to 100 Gbyte/s storage pools.\nPower and thermals stayed within air-cooled limits. The default designs used 35kW racks typical in leased data centers, but they can stretch beyond 50kW for the most aggressive supercomputer centers and down to 7kW racks some telcos use.\nA portrait of Selene by the numbers.\nSeeking the Big, Balanced System\nThe net result is a more balanced design that can handle today\u2019s many different workloads. That flexibility also gives researchers the freedom to explore new directions in AI and high performance computing.\n\u201cTo some extent HPC and AI both require max performance, but you have to look carefully at how you deliver that performance in terms of power, storage and networking as well as raw processing,\u201d said Julie Bernauer, who leads an advanced development team that\u2019s worked on all of NVIDIA\u2019s large-scale systems.\nSkeleton Crews on Strict Protocols\nThe gains paid off in early 2020.\nWithin days of the pandemic hitting, the first NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs arrived, and engineers faced the job of assembling the 280-node Selene.\nIn the best of times, it can take dozens of engineers a few months to assemble, test and commission a supercomputer-class system. NVIDIA had to get Selene running in a few weeks to participate in industry benchmarks and fulfill obligations to customers like Argonne.\nAnd engineers had to stay well within public-health guidelines of the pandemic.\n\u201cWe had skeleton crews with strict protocols to keep staff healthy,\u201d said Bernauer.\n\u201cTo unbox and rack systems, we used two-person teams that didn\u2019t mix with the others \u2014 they even took vacation at the same time. And we did cabling with six-foot distances between people. That really changes how you build systems,\u201d she said.\nEven with the COVID restrictions, engineers racked up to 60 systems in a day, the maximum their loading dock could handle. Virtual log-ins let administrators validate cabling remotely, testing the 20-node modules as they were deployed.\nBernauer\u2019s team put several layers of automation in place. That cut the need for people at the co-location facility where Selene was built, a block from NVIDIA\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters.\nSlacking with a Supercomputer\nSelene talks to staff over a Slack channel as if it were a co-worker, reporting loose cables and isolating malfunctioning hardware so the system can keep running.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to wake up in the night because the cluster has a problem,\u201d Bernauer said.\nIt\u2019s part of the automation customers can access if they follow the guidance in the DGX POD and SuperPOD architectures.\nThanks to this approach, the University of Florida, for example, is expected to rack and power up a 140-node extension to its HiPerGator system, switching on the most powerful AI supercomputer in academia within as little as 10 days of receiving it.\nAs an added touch, the NVIDIA team bought a telepresence robot from Double Robotics so non-essential designers sheltering at home could maintain daily contact with Selene. Tongue-in-cheek, they dubbed it Trip given early concerns essential technicians on site might bump into it.\nThe fact that Trip is powered by an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 module was an added attraction for team members who imagined some day they might tinker with its programming.\nTrip helped engineers inspect Selene while it was under construction.\nSince late July, Trip\u2019s been used regularly to let them virtually drive through Selene\u2019s aisles, observing the system through the robot\u2019s camera and microphone.\n\u201cTrip doesn\u2019t replace a human operator, but if you are worried about something at 2 a.m., you can check it without driving to the data center,\u201d she said.\nDelivering HPC, AI Results at Scale\nIn the end, it\u2019s all about the results, and they came fast.\nIn June, Selene hit No. 7 on the TOP500 list and No. 2 on the Green500 list of the most power-efficient systems. In July, it broke records in all eight systems tests for AI training performance in the latest MLPerf benchmarks.\n\u201cThe big surprise for me was how smoothly everything came up given we were using new processors and boards, and I credit all the testing along the way,\u201d said Houston. \u201cTo get this machine up and do a bunch of hard back-to-back benchmarks gave the team a huge lift,\u201d he added.\nThe work pre-testing NGC containers and HPC software for Argonne was even more gratifying. The lab is already hammering on hard problems in protein docking and quantum chemistry to shine a light on the coronavirus.\nSeparately, Circe donates many of its free cycles to the Folding@Home initiative that fights COVID.\nAt the same time, NVIDIA\u2019s own researchers are using Selene to train autonomous vehicles and refine conversational AI, nearing advances they\u2019re expected to report soon. They are among more than a thousand jobs run, often simultaneously, on the system so far.\nMeanwhile the team already has on the whiteboard ideas for what\u2019s next. \u201cGive performance-obsessed engineers enough horsepower and cables and they will figure out amazing things,\u201d said Bernauer.\nAt top: An artist\u2019s rendering of a portion of Selene.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep Learning | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA A100 | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | NVIDIA DGX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Supposedly the U.S. is losing/could lose/has already lost leadership in this \u201ccritical\u201d field of technology, the understructure of the digital economy, a loss which puts at risk practically everything we might care about \u2013 life (\u201cSemiconductors are essential to modern life\u201d), liberty (\u201cAmerican leadership in semiconductors also is vital to the technological superiority of the U.S. military\u201d), and presumably happiness as well (Facebook, Youtube, Instagram and Netflix all run on silicon)\u2026\n\n\nPoliticians, journalists and think tank analysts have been pushing this dire story year after year, decade after decade, administration after administration.\n\n\n\n\nThe Reagan Era: \u201cThe health and vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry is essential to America's future competitiveness. We cannot allow it to be jeopardized.\u201d \u2013 Ronald Reagan (1987)\nThe Clinton Era: \u201cThe decline of American semiconductor producers\u2026 the days of American dominance of science-based industries might be numbered\u2026 the first domino in a cascading fall of downstream electronic-systems industries.\u201d \u2013 An industry assessment (1999)\nThe Obama Era: \u201cSemiconductor innovation is slowing\u2026 A concerted push by China to reshape the market in its favor, using industrial policies backed by over one hundred billion dollars in government-directed funds, threatens the competitiveness of U.S. industry.\u201d \u2013 The President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science & Technology (2016)\nThe Present Day: The U.S. needs to invest ambitiously in semiconductor research\u2026.[or] risk losing its innovation edge and the global competition for technology leadership. \u2013 Report by the Semiconductor Industry Association (2019)\n\n\n\nThe threat is (of course) China.

It is based on a crude misunderstanding of the structure of the industry. In fact, the U.S. is in firm control of the high ground in the semiconductor business, which dominates the rest of the industry (with one quasi-exception).\n\n\nChip-making comprises several technological processes: design; precision manufacturing of the integrated circuits; and \u201cpackaging\u201d (which includes assembly of the integrated circuits into durable \u201cchips\u201d). The original business model of the industry combined all three. Such companies are known as the Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs). A few firms still employ this model, notably Intel\nINTC\n, the overall industry leader (by revenue).The Original Industry Business ModelFigure by author\nBeginning in the 1980s, a new trend developed, based on the disarticulation of these functions. Some companies, known as foundries, focused strictly on the manufacturing business. Others specialized in design, and contracted out to the foundries to manufacture chips based on their designs. These become known as \u201cFabless\u201d semiconductor companies. Other companies focused on packaging and are known as Outsourced Assembly and Test (OSAT) segment.The Current Disarticulated Semiconductor Value ChainFigure by author\n\n(Firms in the OSAT segment are comparatively small; the business is crowded, competitive, low margin, and very cyclical, with weak pricing power compared to IDMs. A fourth segment, the suppliers of the capital equipment used by foundries and IDMs in the fabrication process, is highly profitable and economically powerful. It stands apart from the rest of the industry, and is a story for another column.)\nThe Fabless vs. Foundry contrast\nThe difference between the Fabless and Foundry models is based on the economics of IC fabrication, which are staggering. A new IC fab plant can cost up to $20 Bn \u2013 about twice the cost of a Nimitz class aircraft carrier, three times the cost of a nuclear power plant \u2013 and an IC fab may have a useful lifetime of just a few years before it becomes technologically obsolete. The implications of this are significant, and mostly negative from a strategic standpoint. It is a scale-based business (as all heavy-capex industries are) and it is dominated today by one firm: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).\nThe Fabless model is \u201casset-lite.\u201d They do not need to buy a new aircraft carrier every year, so to speak. Instead, they can invest in design talent and functional innovation.\nIDMs like Intel still do both. But the capital expenditure demands weigh heavily. Over time, a number of IDMs have surrendered to the economic logic and have split themselves into two pieces \u2013 a Fabless design firm and a foundry \u2013 to go their separate ways. AMD was an IDM until 2009, when they spun off their foundry business into a new company, Global Foundries. Even Intel has flirted with the idea of a split.\nThe confusion of these business models under the non-discriminating category \u201csemiconductor companies\u201d is surprisingly common. For example, the Wall Street Journal recently listed the \u201cTop Semiconductor Companies by Sales\u201d in a chart I have redrawn here (adding a few other prominent semiconductor companies not included in the WSJ chart):\nSales of Major Semiconductor CompaniesChart by author\n\nThis is a heterogeneous mishmash. Intel and Samsung are IDMs. TSMC is a pure foundry. Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD are Fabless IC firms. Texas Instruments is an IDM of a special sort, focusing on what are called analog and mixed signal chips (not the digital processors and memory chips that most of the industry produces). Analog chip manufacturing has different and possibly more favorable economics (lower capital costs). In short, these companies are very different, with very different cost structures, and are valued very differently by investors. Throwing them together under one label is like grouping Ford and General Motors with Hertz and Uberas \u201cautomotive companies.\u201d\nThe first flag that the \u201cDecline thesis\u201d is invalid is the fact that 10 of the 14 firms listed here are American. One is Taiwanese, two are Korean. Only Hi-Silicon \u2013 a Fabless IC designer \u2013 is based in mainland China. HiSilicon is a fully owned subsidiary of Huawei, which puts them in the middle of the risky geopolitical chess game I have discussed elsewhere. Huawei takes about 90% of HiSilicon\u2019s output \u2013 \u201coutput\u201d which HiSilicon does not and cannot manufacture, but outsources to Taiwan\u2019s TSMC (and perhaps others now).\nAll in all, the American position, even by this crude tabulation, is strong.\nBut if we divide the firms into their true categories, the picture clarifies. Compare them on the basis of the capital investment required \u2014 property, plant and equipment, \u201ccapex\u201d \u2014 and the distinction between the foundries and IDMs on one hand, and the Fabless and mixed signal firms on the other is striking. Nvidia \u2013 which has a market value $60 billion higher than Intel \u2013 creates this value with 25 times less capital investment.Net Capital Investment for major semiconductor companiesChart by author \nThen consider how many dollars of revenue a company generates from each dollar of capital investment.Dollars of Revenue per Dollar of Capex for major semiconductor companiesChart by author\n\nWhich would you rather own? The company that can take your investment dollar and generate 75 cents of sales, or the company that can take that same dollar and generate $8 of sales?\nThe market sees and respects this difference.Price-Earnings Ratios for Major Semiconductor CompaniesChart by author\n\nThe Fabless model creates 2 to 4 times more shareholder value per dollar of earnings-per-share than the asset-heavy foundries and IDMs.\nNow notice the national clustering. The high-valued firms (high P/E), and the highly efficient business models (high dollars of revenue per dollar of investment) are all U.S. companies.\nSummary: Show Me The Money\nLet\u2019s recap:\n\n\nFirst, with the exception of Intel (an IDM which is truly a special case and perhaps even that rara avis, an American \u201cnational champion\u201d) the U.S. semiconductor industry has essentially conceded the capex-heavy foundry model to one company, TSMC. (TSMC in Taiwan is the quasi-exception to America\u2019s semiconductor hegemony. Dependence on TSMC may create some risk potentially, but to date it has been a successful symbiosis between the Fabless players and their main foundry.)\nThe few important non-U.S. companies in the foundry and IDM segments \u2013 TSMC, Samsung \u2013 are closely coupled to the U.S. market and supply-chains, and are reliably \u201cfriendly.\u201d\nAmerica dominates the Fabless sector, and is in no jeopardy of losing that position\nThe Fabless segment is where the market sees the real value in semiconductors, and the market is not wrong; the foundry business is a commodity-type business, favoring consolidation and scale; heavy investments in rapidly depreciating plant and equipment do not inspire investors; the Fabless business model is where the value-creating innovation we associate with the digital economy is concentrated\nChina\u2019s only Fabless entry is Hi-Silicon, which is a captive subsidiary of its one main customer; they have yet to prove they can compete in the global market\nChina\u2019s entry in the foundry sector \u2014 SMIC, another of Huawei\u2019s step-children \u2013 has struggled, and not likely to gain much ground against TSMC in Taiwan any time soon \n\n\nIn short, the U.S. controls the semiconductor world, and controls the direction of technological innovation. China is starting at the bottom, and it will be tough hill to climb. In the 21st-century economy, value accrues to companies that control the \u201cintangible\u201d assets like design, brand, human capital (talent), loyal customers, and intellectual property. Traditional 19th-century style \u201cassets\u201d like factories, machinery, inventories, accounts receivable, and even excess accumulations of cash begin to seem more like, well, liabilities. U.S. companies \u2013 in many segments of the economy, not just semiconductors \u2014 have figured this out. Except for Huawei \u2013 troubled Huawei \u2013 China is mostly still stuck in the industrial age.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.George Calhoun's new book is\u00a0Price & Value: A Guide to Equity Market Valuation Metrics\u00a0(Springer 2020).

And the company is already teasing future expansions, including a new program for partners selling cloud services that the chipmaker plans to introduce by the first quarter of next year.\n[Related: These Are The Top 10 Nvidia Partners Driving AI Adoption]\n\n\nid\nunit-1659132512259\n\n\ntype\nSponsored post\n\n\n\u201cOne of the areas we\u2019re looking to enhance and we\u2019re working on right now is our cloud service provider program,\u201d said Alvin DaCosta, vice president of Nvidia\u2019s global partner organization, in an interview with CRN. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to work with those type of partners in the future to start developing customized GPU utilization within [cloud vendors like] Amazon [Web Services] and Google.\u201d\nDaCosta said Nvidia also plans to integrate the partner programs for Mellanox Technologies and Cumulus Networks, the two companies it acquired this year, into the Nvidia Partner Network next year.\nAmong the changes in the Nvidia Partner Network are new and expanded incentives meant to make it easier for partners to get recognized for their sales activity and investments in the Nvidia ecosystem. This includes a new fixed back-end rebate for Elite-level compute and visualization partners, who will receive a 1 percent rebate on their Nvidia-based revenue.\n\u201cThis shows that Nvidia is making an investment in the enterprise partners because we know that our partners are making investments in [not-for-resale] gear, they\u2019re hiring data scientists, they\u2019re building practices,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what that fixed rebate is, it\u2019s whatever revenue they do, we give them 1 percent back in rebate to help offload some of those costs.\u201d\nFor Elite-level providers and integrators across most competencies, Nvidia is also providing a new dedicated reserve of market development funds that are based on quarterly partner revenue, expanding beyond the project-based MDF the company already provides.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say, for example, if a partner did $500,000 in [the first quarter]. Then in [the second quarter] they would get $5,000 worth of MDF,\u201d DaCosta said.\nFor Nvidia\u2019s top DGX systems sellers, the company has expanded its AI Champions Club, which gives those partners access to product teams, among other things.\nNvidia has also enacted a change that will make it easier for its broader base of partners to have their revenue contributions recognized throughout the year. With its enhanced quarterly performance bonus program, the company now sets an annual goal that means partners won\u2019t be penalized if they have one bad quarter due to the seasonality of their business.\n\u201cIt gives the partner the ability to make money regardless of their seasonality at the end of the year,\u201d DaCosta said.\nIn addition to the new and improved incentives, the Nvidia Partner Network has expanded in other ways. This includes a new AI Consulting Network, which gives partners access to other partners who have built large practices around artificial intelligence and data science. The company has also expanded the categories with new partner types for federal government systems integrators and storage solution providers.\nOn the training side, Nvidia has introduced several new training courses for the company\u2019s expanded portfolio of products, including the new A100 data center GPU, as well as a variety of industries, including health care, higher education, financial services and retail. The company plans to expand this industry-focused purview with courses for energy and telecommunications next year.\nTo help partners navigate the expanded course offerings, the company has introduced a new tool called NPN Learning Maps, which provides partners with a learning matrix based on their industry and role.\n\u201cThe challenge we\u2019ve heard from partners is that when they logged into our partner portal, they didn\u2019t know where to start because there\u2019s been so many classes that are listed,\u201d DaCosta said. \u201cSo what we did is we started building Learning Maps to make it easier for the partner to understand exactly what classes to take.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s partner portal has been enhanced in other ways, with one of the biggest changes being a Salesforce integration that gives partners better visibility into historical revenue, rebate history, deal registration and training activity. The company also now provides partners with resources to build industry-specific marketing campaigns.\nTim Brooks, managing director at top Nvidia partner World Wide Technology, said the expanded benefits and resources of the Nvidia Partner Network puts WWT in a better position because the St. Louis-based company has been aggressively investing in the vendor and in AI services.\n\u201cThey have essentially curated an ecosystem for people to come together and build solutions, as opposed to each one of us trying to go about doing something independently and leave it to the customers to cobble together from multiple vendors,\u201d he said.\nBrooks said WWT has seen demand for Nvidia\u2019s GPUs for natural language processing and genomics, among other kinds of research-heavy workloads. The company has also seen a diversity in the types of organizations that need GPU solutions for AI, ranging from universities and research institutes to large financial services providers. In addition, the company is exploring opportunities with customers who want to deploy GPU systems at the edge for things like mask detection to reduce virus risk.\nWith the expanded incentives, Brooks said, WWT can explore even more opportunities with Nvidia.\n\u201cTo the extent that this helps Word Wide, extending both the opportunities [for us] to use Nvidia GPU infrastructure as well as educate customers about what AI solutions can do in their industry, that is all good and that\u2019s what our customers and end users expect,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(AP Photo/Jon Gambrell) \u00b7 Associated Press     AYA BATRAWY  Updated 19 August 2020 2 min read          DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 International port operator DP World said on Wednesday profits were down 56% for the first half of the year, with earnings sliding to $333 million as coronavirus lockdowns and a global recession impact trade around the world. The Dubai state-owned company's $420 million dollar drop in profits for the period between January to June was due largely to a decline of nearly 4% in container volume at DP World ports.  \u201cThe COVID-19 outbreak has undoubtedly resulted in one of the most challenging periods in the history of our industry,\u201d DP World Group Chairman and CEO, Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, said in a statement. Already, full-year profits had fallen by more than 8% to $1.2 billion last year amid trade wars and other disruptions. Meanwhile, revenue for the first half of 2020 grew 18% to $4.1 billion from $3.5 billion during the same period in 2019. The company said growth was supported by acquisitions. DP World said that while the outlook for the rest of the year remains uncertain, trade is expected to recover when economies around the world re-open. The company operates across 51 countries around the world ranging from Brisbane, Australia, in the East to Prince Rupert, Canada, in the West. The company said volumes in Europe reflected the severity of government lockdowns there to try and contain the virus. Container volume globally is expected to drop by 8-10% this year. Early this year, DP World de-listed from the Dubai stock exchange, returning the company to full state-ownership in a move to help the Dubai government\u2019s investment company repay more than $5 billion to banks. Parent company, Port and Free Zone World, acquired 20% of shares not already owned for $2.7 billion.

We may make money when you click on links to our partners. Learn More.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMLPerf is the definitive performance benchmark for Artificial Intelligence. The latest set of competitive performance benchmarks were released this week, and NVIDIA so dominated the benchmarks they effectively stand alone in this market right now for core functions like image classification, object detection, and machine translation. Others either didn\u2019t have a technology ready to submit to a category, or their performance was so low to be arguably meaningless.\u00a0\nThis lead provides NVIDIA with both a substantial competitive advantage and a significant problem. This result is because it is hard to have a race when only one team is competitive and, in the early phases of a market (and we are still clearly in the early phases) you need a lot of viable players and, at least in the segments measured by MLPerf there is only one, NVIDIA.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s talk about the promise and the problems with being so far out front.\nNVIDIA\u2019s AI Promise\nBy being so dominant in this space, it places NVIDIA\u2019s core technology at the top of any shortlist for those partnering in this area. It helps explain why Mercedes, a famous company for not accepting technology from others for critical strategic programs, partnered with NVIDIA. If they wanted a viable self-driving platform backed by deep simulation, NVIDIA was the only short term path to achieving that goal.\u00a0\nAs a result, expect NVIDIA to gain even more partners, to dominate more industries, and to remain the definitive leader of the segment.\u00a0 Tactically they are unbeatable.\u00a0 But this kind of overwhelming leadership can lead to problems.\nThere are three unique problems that NVIDIA will now have to deal with, given their extreme leadership.\u00a0 They are false confidence, regulatory oversight, and higher than average intellectual property theft.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take each in turn.\nFalse Confidence\nWhile most every major AI tech vendor (and several universities) is participating in MLPerf, it is unusual to submit results when you are well off the mark.\u00a0 Those not submitting benchmark results could be far better off than these latest charts indicate, and they may be far more competitive than they appear as a result.\u00a0\u00a0\nNVIDIA, believing they are unbeatable, could falsely feel their lead is unbeatable and slow down their impressively fast development effort allowing the other firm(s) to pass them and then be unable to keep up. While there is no evidence I can see that NVIDIA is slowing down, the risk remains very real. A closer ranked competitor generally will help drive the leader to ever-higher performance, something that NVIDIA will have to do itself until such a competitor emerges.\u00a0\nRegulatory Oversight\nWhen you are effectively the only vendor capable of performing at an adequate level, you own the market.\u00a0 That could have anti-trust implications because of the resulting market power. We just saw Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google begin what will likely be a dance concluding with one or more of them being broken up (odds favor Google and Amazon being broken up, Facebook being sanctioned, and Apple being left to the States which have begun their actions).\u00a0\nTighter competition generally shields the leading company from this kind of government response. Right now, NVIDIA doesn\u2019t appear on any anti-trust action I\u2019m aware of, but NVIDIA will need to be very careful they don\u2019t abuse their market power to avoid being in that hot seat.\u00a0 NVIDIA has a decent reputation with its partners, and if they maintain that, they should be safe here, but it remains a risk.\u00a0\nIntellectual Property Theft\nWhen you are as far out ahead as NVIDIA does competitors, and particularly other countries will look to mine you for information illegally. This means everything from placing people in the company to get that information, appearing as customers rather than IP thieves to gain access to it that way.\u00a0\nThis level of leadership in a technology area seen as a critical part of the next industrial revolution will be an extremely attractive lure that many may not be able to resist.\u00a0 NVIDIA needs to be able to share its technology with customers (it has sizeable open-source component) so that those customers can implement it in their products but, in so doing, will increase the likelihood of IP theft, meaning the firm will need to be extraordinarily vigilant.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nNVIDIA Once Again Demonstrates They Are The Company To Beat, But\u2026.\nWhen it comes to core AI technology, NVIDIA remains the company to beat and by an impressively significant margin. However, this is based on public information, and few are sharing where they are. This can lead to several problems for NVIDIA ranging from false confidence to intellectual property theft that NVIDIA should be able to deal with if they don\u2019t take their eyes off the ball, and NVIDIA\u2019s CEO is known for having eyes in the back of his head.\u00a0\nThe biggest potential problem, though, is the abuse of their market power because that is something that tends to catch every company that becomes dominant up eventually and it is the most difficult to mitigate because it means putting in place oversight which managers universally find annoying.\u00a0\nRight now, NVIDIA stands alone, that will change, and whether NVIDIA remains out front or not, as this market matures, a lot will have to do with how the firm anticipates the related unique threats, including typical executive behavior.\u00a0\n\nRELATED NEWS AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nHuawei\u2019s AI Update: Things Are Moving Faster Than We Think\nFEATURE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0Rob Enderle,\nDecember 04, 2020\n\n\n\nKeeping Machine Learning Algorithms Honest in the \u2018Ethics-First\u2019 Era\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0Guest Author,\nNovember 18, 2020\n\n\n\nKey Trends in Chatbots and RPA\nFEATURE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0Guest Author,\nNovember 10, 2020\n\n\n\nTop 10 AIOps Companies\nFEATURE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0Samuel Greengard,\nNovember 05, 2020\n\n\n\nWhat is Text Analysis?\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0Guest Author,\nNovember 02, 2020\n\n\n\nHow Intel\u2019s Work With Autonomous Cars Could Redefine General Purpose AI\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0Rob Enderle,\nOctober 29, 2020\n\n\n\nDell Technologies World:  Weaving Together Human And Machine Interaction For AI And Robotics\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0Rob Enderle,\nOctober 23, 2020\n\n\n\nThe Super Moderator, or How IBM Project Debater Could Save Social Media\nFEATURE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0Rob Enderle,\nOctober 16, 2020\n\n\n\nTop 10 Chatbot Platforms\nFEATURE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0Cynthia Harvey,\nOctober 07, 2020\n\n\n\nFinding a Career Path in AI\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0Guest Author,\nOctober 05, 2020\n\n\n\nCIOs Discuss the Promise of AI and Data Science\nFEATURE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0Guest Author,\nSeptember 25, 2020\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Is Building An AI Product That Could Predict The Future\nFEATURE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0Rob Enderle,\nSeptember 25, 2020\n\n\n\nTop 10 Machine Learning Companies 2020\nFEATURE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0Cynthia Harvey,\nSeptember 22, 2020\n\n\n\nNVIDIA and ARM: Massively Changing The AI Landscape\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0Rob Enderle,\nSeptember 18, 2020\n\n\n\nContinuous Intelligence: Expert Discussion [Video and Podcast]\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0James Maguire,\nSeptember 14, 2020\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence: Governance and Ethics [Video]\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0James Maguire,\nSeptember 13, 2020\n\n\n\nIBM Watson At The US Open: Showcasing The Power Of A Mature Enterprise-Class AI\nFEATURE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0Rob Enderle,\nSeptember 11, 2020\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence: Perception vs. Reality\nFEATURE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0James Maguire,\nSeptember 09, 2020\n\n\n\nAnticipating The Coming Wave Of AI Enhanced PCs\nFEATURE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0Rob Enderle,\nSeptember 05, 2020\n\n\n\nThe Critical Nature Of IBM\u2019s NLP (Natural Language Processing) Effort\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0By\u00a0Rob Enderle,\nAugust 14, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSEE ALL\n  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ARTICLES\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious articleAI Your Staff Can Believe In, Now and After COVID-19Next articleOptimizing Network Operations During Times of Change\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Subscribe to Data Insider                \n\n                    Learn the latest news and best practices about data science, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, data security, and more.                \n\n\n\n\n                        Email Address\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.                        \n\n\n\n                    Subscribe                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar articles\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAI\n9 Best AI Certification Courses to Future-Proof Your Career in 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAI\n9 Top RPA Companies of 2024: Front Runners in Smart Technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAI\nAI in Cybersecurity: The Comprehensive Guide to Modern Security\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\nFacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Get the Free Newsletter!

The stock has more than doubled in 2020, fueled by surging demand for its chips used in data centers and gaming consoles.\n\nA strong and impressive rally in NVIDIA shares during the current global health crisis clearly separates this semiconductor stock from the rest of the crowd. NVIDIA's shares have hugely outperformed the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which is up about 19% since the start of 2020. NVIDIA gained about 4.5% on Friday to close at $507.34.\nThe key question for investors, however, is just how much more runway exists for this stock, especially when it\u2019s trading at the highest price-to-earnings multiples in nearly a decade.\nAfter the stock's powerful rise this year, NVIDIA is now one of the most richly valued chip stocks with a price-to-earnings ratio of 86.36, fetching almost three times the semiconductor group\u2019s average multiple of 30. That makes the stock susceptible to correction on any negative surprise, especially when the economic and geopolitical environment remains fragile.\nSanta Clara, California-based NVIDIA is the biggest maker of graphics chips used in personal computer gaming. Over the past few years, the chipmaker has successfully adapted its technology for the Artificial Intelligence market, creating a new multi-billion-dollar business.\nStill, the majority of the company\u2019s\u00a0sales come from PC gaming, where NVIDIA\u2019s graphics chips create the most realistic experiences. Top-of-the-line GeForce parts cost more than many consumers spend on a whole PC.Bullish ForecastsNVIDIA\u2019s last earnings report provided some mixed signals about the company's performance for the rest of the year. While sales figures from data centers soared 167% and gaming was up 26% in the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said during a conference call that sales will grow in the \u201clow-to-mid single digits\u201d percentage range in the fiscal third quarter, compared with the previous quarter.\nWhile demand from major cloud service providers remains solid, the company has a more \u201cmixed\u201d outlook on spending by companies in some industries, the CFO added during the conference call, as cited by Bloomberg. NVIDIA is also facing some demand slowdown from cyclical industries, such as autos.\nBut despite this cautious note from management, analysts are generally upbeat about NVIDIA.\nBank of America analyst Vivek Arya raised his price target on the stock from $520 to a high of $600, an 18% upside from Friday's close.\nArya based his bullish forecast on continued secular momentum with new product cycles (next gen 7nm Ampere launch) and recovery in cyclical autos offsetting a potentially \u2018lumpy\u2019 data center business. According to the analyst:\u00a0\n\u201cBigger picture, we believe NVDA has an unassailable hardware / software / developer lead in some of the largest and fastest growing markets in semis/tech (AI, Gaming, Autonomous), all derived from a common architecture.\u201d\nJefferies analyst Mark Lipacis, who raised his price target to $570, says NVIDIA has been able to create an ecosystem in chip manufacturing that powers the heart of AI and machine learning.\n\u201cWe think the company will continue to surprise on the upside, and wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see NVDA undertake more M&A to build out its data center system capabilities,\u201d he said in a note.\nBMO Capital analyst Ambrish Srivastava also maintained his outperform rating while raising its price target to $565 from $425 in a recent note. \u00a0\n\"Given the continued run in shares, expectations are high. However, we expect the company to deliver on earnings and expectations.\"\nBottom LineNVDA is well-positioned to benefit from the global shift to working, studying and entertaining from home. This trend has produced a perfect growth scenario for NVIDIA which has chips to satisfy this demand.

Closing at 3397.16, the index of 505 stocks that makes up the vast majority of the U.S. stock market's value, ended the week at an all-time high, after returning to record levels on Tuesday.\u00a0\nToday's move higher was underpinned by a big day for two mega-cap stocks. Apple\u00a0(AAPL -0.51%) shares gained more than 5% following positive analyst comments, and semiconductor giant NVIDIA\u00a0(NVDA -3.24%) shares closed up 4.5% on continued momentum following its earnings earlier this week. The two tech giants were the two biggest gainers in the S&P on the day.\u00a0\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThere were more S&P 500 stocks that lost value today than gained, with the mega-caps that moved higher doing the heavy lifting to move the index higher. Big losers included the airline sector, with\u00a0United Airlines\u00a0(UAL -3.17%) leading the way down 3%, along with oil stocks\u00a0Marathon Oil (MRO),\u00a0Diamondback Energy\u00a0(FANG 1.15%), and Apache Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ: APA) falling on weak oil prices and concerns about the global economy.\u00a0\nOptimism around tech giants moving the market\nDespite the ongoing coronavirus crisis that started a global recession and put tens of millions of Americans out of work, technology companies have proved surprisingly resilient. Apple shares are up almost 70% year to date and up about double from the 2020 coronavirus crash in March. Yet its business has proven surprisingly durable for a consumer products company, with profits remaining very strong.\u00a0\nAt least one analyst thinks the good times could get even better. Dan Ives of Wedbush, in a note to investors, says the stock could run another 27% over the next year or so, citing a \"supercycle\" for the upcoming iPhone series as millions of customers look to upgrade to 5g. Ives thinks as many as 350 million of the 950 million iPhones in service today could get upgraded over the next 18 months.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^SPX data by YCharts\nFor NVIDIA, the depth and breadth of the markets its products serve continue to expand, and investors are piling in. Its shares have surged even higher than Apple's this year, and with a $300 billion market cap compared to Apple's $2\u00a0trillion\u00a0market value, investors think there's plenty of room to run.\u00a0\nAirline stocks down on American service cuts, economic worries\nUnited Airlines shares were the worst-performing of the S&P 500 airline stocks, but American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) stock also fell more than 2.7% to close the week. Yesterday, American detailed its plan to suspend service to 15 markets starting on October 7, through at least early November.\u00a0\nThese cuts were delayed due to financial support it and its peers got as part of the CARES Act earlier this year, but once the requirements to maintain service and payroll levels expire at the end of September, every major airline will be forced to make major cuts, barring additional -- and substantial -- government financial support that is increasingly unlikely.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nEven with financial support, the airline industry is facing what will likely prove a multi-year downturn due to the coronavirus pandemic. Air travel has increased 10-fold over the past few months from the lows in April, but still remains down about 70% in the U.S. Barring a medical breakthrough, travelers could avoid air travel in large numbers for at least another year.\u00a0\nOil stocks feeling a similar pinch\nThe S&P 500's oil sector also took it on the chin today, with 20 of the 26 sector stocks falling. Oil prices finished lower, with Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude futures both down more than 1% and still in the low $40s per barrel.\u00a0\nLow prices and weak demand continue to weigh on the energy industry on a global basis. While China soaked up a lot of excess oil demand in recent months, taking advantage of record low prices, most of the rest of the world has dealt with double-digit drops in demand. India imported less oil in July than in any other month in more than a decade, while U.S. driving travel was down more than 13% in June.\u00a0\n\nMRO data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nWith prices still below breakeven for many producers, demand remaining constrained, and the amount of oil in commercial storage still above five-year averages, the oil patch continues to feel immense pressure as a protracted downturn looks likely. This will continue to weigh on oil producers like Marathon, Apache, and Diamondback for some time to come.\nEarnings next week\nWhile many of the biggest companies have already dropped their second-quarter results, next week brings us a handful of notable names. Best Buy, Hormel Foods, Salesforce.com, and Medtronic report on Tuesday, Aug. 25, giving investors a look at four very different sectors: consumer discretionary spending, consumer staples, enterprise cloud services, and healthcare.\u00a0\nLater in the week, consumer specialty retailers\u00a0Tiffany & Co\u00a0and\u00a0Ulta Beauty, along with discounters Dollar Tree\u00a0and Dollar General\u00a0will report. Be sure to tune in here for a closer look when they report.\u00a0\n\n\n\nJason Hall owns shares of NVIDIA.

In a technical brief that was posted to their website, dubbed \u201cThe Demand for Ultra-Bandwidth Solutions\u201d, Micron detailed their portfolio of high-bandwidth memory technologies and the market needs for them. Included in this brief was information on the previously-unannounced GDDR6X memory technology, as well as some information on what seems to be the first card to use it, NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 3090.\nThe document seems to have been posted a month (or more) early, given the mention of the NVIDIA card, which we\u2019re not expecting to be announced any sooner than at NVIDIA\u2019s September event. Furthermore the document links to other, still-unpublished Micron technical briefs involving GDDR6X. None the less, the document does come directly from Micron\u2019s public webservers, so what we have today is an unexpected sneak peek at Micron's upcoming GDDR memory plans.\nAt any rate, as this is a market overview rather than a technical deep dive, the details on GDDR6X are slim. The document links to another, still-unpublished document, \u201cDoubling I/O Performance with PAM4: Micron Innovates GDDR6X to Accelerate Graphics Memory\u201d, that would presumably contain further details on GDDR6X. None the less, even this high-level overview gives us a basic idea of what Micron has in store for later this year.\nUpdate 8/20: Micron has since published (and removed) the second GDDR6X document. By and large it confirms our expectations for the GDDR6X technical specifications that weren't in Micron's original document. More information is available below.\nThe key innovation for GDDR6X appears to be that Micron is moving from using NRZ coding on the memory bus \u2013 a binary (two state) coding format\u00a0\u2013 to four state coding in the form of Pulse-Amplitude Modulation 4 (PAM4). In short, Micron would be doubling the number of signal states in the GDDR6X memory bus, allowing it to transmit twice as much data per clock.\n\n\n\nGPU Memory Math\n\n\n\u00a0\nGDDR6X\n\t\t\t(RTX 3090)\nGDDR6\n\t\t\t(Titan RTX)\nGDDR5X\n\t\t\t(Titan Xp)\nHBM2\n\t\t\t(Titan V)\n\n\nTotal Capacity\n12 GB\n12 GB\n12 GB\n12 GB\n\n\nB/W Per Pin\n21 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n11.4 Gbps\n1.7 Gbps\n\n\nChip capacity\n1 GB (8 Gb)\n1 GB (8 Gb)\n1 GB (8 Gb)\n4\u00a0GB\u00a0(32\u00a0Gb)\n\n\nNo. Chips/KGSDs\n12\n12\n12\n3\n\n\nB/W Per Chip/Stack\n84 GB/s\n56 GB/s\n45.6 GB/s\n217.6\u00a0GB/s\n\n\nBus Width\n384-bit\n384-bit\n352-bit\n3072-bit\n\n\nTotal B/W\n1008 GB/s\n672 GB/s\n548\u00a0GB/s\n652.8\u00a0GB/s\n\n\nDRAM Voltage\n1.35 V\n1.35 V\n1.35 V\n1.2 V\n\n\nData Rate\nQDR\nQDR\nDDR\nDDR\n\n\nSignaling\nPAM4\nBinary\nBinary\nBinary\n\n\n\nPAM4 itself is not a new technology, and has been used in other high-end devices like network transceivers well before now. More recently, the PCI-SIG announced that they\u2019d be adopting PAM4 coding for PCIe 6.0. So for a slightly more detailed discussion on PAM4, here is our explaination from our PCIe 6.0 primer:\n\nAt a very high level, what PAM4 does versus NRZ (binary coding) is to take a page from the MLC NAND playbook, and double the number of electrical states a single cell (or in this case, transmission) will hold. Rather than traditional 0/1 high/low signaling, PAM4 uses 4 signal levels, so that a signal can encode for four possible two-bit patterns: 00/01/10/11. This allows PAM4 to carry twice as much data as NRZ without having to double the transmission bandwidth, which for PCIe 6.0 would have resulted in a frequency around 30GHz(!).\n\nNRZ vs. PAM4 (Base Diagram Courtesy Intel)\nPAM4 itself is not a new technology, but up until now it\u2019s been the domain of ultra-high-end networking standards like 200G Ethernet, where the amount of space available for more physical channels is even more limited. As a result, the industry already has a few years of experience working with the signaling standard, and with their own bandwidth needs continuing to grow, the PCI-SIG has decided to bring it inside the chassis by basing the next generation of PCIe upon it.\nThe tradeoff for using PAM4 is of course cost. Even with its greater bandwidth per Hz, PAM4 currently costs more to implement at pretty much every level, from the PHY to the physical layer. Which is why it hasn\u2019t taken the world by storm, and why NRZ continues to be used elsewhere. The sheer mass deployment scale of PCIe will of course help a lot here \u2013 economies of scale still count for a lot \u2013 but it will be interesting to see where things stand in a few years once PCIe 6.0 is in the middle of ramping up.\n\nThus far, PAM4 signaling has only been used for networking and expansion buses, so using it for a memory bus, though a logical extension, would represent a big leap in technology. Now Micron has to develop memory that can not only do clean PAM4 modulation \u2013 which is not a simple task \u2013 but NVIDIA needs a matching memory controller on the other end. It\u2019s doable, and probably inevitable, but it\u2019s a big change from how memory buses have traditionally operated \u2013 even high-speed buses like those used for GDDR.\nAccording to Micron\u2019s brief, they\u2019re expecting to get GDDR6X to 21Gbps/pin, at least to start with. This is a far cry from doubling GDDR6\u2019s existing 16Gbps/pin rate, but it\u2019s also a data rate that would be grounded in the limitations of PAM4 and DRAM. PAM4 itself is easier to achieve than binary coding at the same total data rate, but having to accurately determine four states instead of two is conversely a harder task. So a smaller jump isn\u2019t too surprising.\nUltimately, PAM4 is a means of trading signal-to-noise tolerances for greater bandwidth. Decoding among 4 states instead of 2 requires a very clean and strong signal (just take a look at Micron's PAM4 eye diagram below), but because GDDR6 already has very tight signal requirements due to its high bus frequency, PAM4 doesn't require exceptionally higher SNRs\u00a0\u2013 at least not at more modest data rates. Still, video card makers will be working with a technology that has tighter SNR requirements than any memory technology before it, so expect to see this reflected in board designs, both with regards to memory placement (very closely placed for the shortest traces) and in board design costs.\n\nFor that reason alone, video card vendors will likely have separate PCB designs for GDDR6 and GDDR6X designs \u2013 it's all but guaranteed that GDDR6X host processors will also support GDDR6 as a fallback option \u2013 but GDDR6X's requirements do hint at some flexibility here. It's noteworthy that the new memory uses the exact same package and pin count as GDDR6: a 14mm x 12mm package with a 180 pin BGA interface. At this point it isn't confirmed whether GDDR6X's pin-out is identical to GDDR6's \u2013 that information will likely come after NVIDIA's new cards are announced \u2013 but I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if that were the case. Especially as Micron's sheets reveal that of those 180 pins, GDDR6X uses the same 70/74 signal pins as GDDR6.\n\nOne notable innovation here is that both GDDR6X hosts and memory devices implement now implement sub-receivers in order to achieve the fidelity required to read PAM4 modulation. Each I/O pin gets an Upper, Middle, and Lower receiver, which is used to compare the PAM4 signal against that respective portion of the data eye. So while one signal is still coming in on a pin, it's being viewed by three different receivers to best determine which of the four signal levels it is.\nMeanwhile, Micron's second document indicates that the company is going to be pushing the core clocks of their memory a little bit higher than they did GDDR6. As a refresher, DRAM cells more or less flatlined in performance years ago \u2013 you can only drive a mixed transistor/capacitor device so quickly \u2013 so newer memory technologies have been about ever-greater parallelism. In the case of GDDR technologies, for example, this means that 16Gbps GDDR6 has the same core clock rate as 8Gbps GDDR5.\nBased on Micron's documents, it looks like the company intends to achieve a 21Gbps data rate by pushing the core DRAM clockspeed higher. All of their technical comparisons between GDDR6X and GDDR6 show the two running at the same data rates and the same clockspeeds. So we can rule out a GDDR5X-style chance in pre-fetch sizes, as GDDR6X has the same access granularity and burst length (in bits) as GDDR6X.\nThe major wildcard for the moment is going to be costs. As I mentioned earlier, PAM4 has been around for quite a while; it\u2019s just expensive to use due to the engineering and silicon required. How much will adding PAM4 to a memory chip add to its cost? Clearly this is going to be a premium memory technology, though at the same time it\u2019s a safe bet that Micron wouldn\u2019t be going this route if it was going to cost as much as HBM, which has already become cost-prohibitive for consumer video cards.\nMoving on, there\u2019s one final interesting nugget of information on GDDR6X in Micron\u2019s whitepaper, and that\u2019s on power consumption. One of the indirect benefits of PAM4 is that by running a bus at a lower clockrate than would otherwise be required, the power consumption requirements go down. It\u2019s by no means a 2x difference, as PAM4 coding\u2019s complexity eats up power in other ways, but it\u2019s more efficient none the less. And according to Micron, this is going to play out for GDDR6X as well, with GDDR6X having a slightly lower energy cost per bit.\n\nAccording to Micron's initial brief, we\u2019re looking at an average device power of roughly 7.25 picojoules per byte for GDDR6X, versus 7.5 for GDDR6. Going by this data, this is also relatively close in power efficiency to HBM2, though well behind HBM2E. That said, as this is efficiency per byte, it means that actual power consumption is a function of bandwidth; and while GDDR6X is a little more efficient, it\u2019s slated to be a lot faster.\n\nThis is further backed up by Micron's second brief, which offers a power comparison that's normalized to GDDR6. There, Micron states that 21Gbps GDDR6X requires 15% less power per transferred bit than GDDR6 at 14Gbps. But as with Micron's first brief, this is efficiency per byte/bit, not total power consumption. So either way, it's clear that the total power consumption of GDDR6X is going to be higher than today's 14Gbps GDDR6, with Micron projecting 25-27% more power required for 21Gbps GDDR6X memory.\nOverall, Micron presents PAM4 as the natural evolution of GDDR memory technology. And while this is wrapped up in obvious technical marketing, there is a nugget of truth, in as much as the official data rates for GDDR6 still top out at 16Gbps. Rambus, for its part, has demonstrated 18Gbps GDDR6 in the labs, but from the outside looking in, it\u2019s not clear right now if that is commercially viable \u2013 no memory vendor currently has 18Gbps chips in its catalog.\nBut regardless of where vanilla GDDR6 eventually tops out at, the memory industry as a larger whole has long been staring down a reckoning with memory bus speeds. Successive standards have employed various techniques to improve data rates, such as GDDR6\u2019s QDR, but GDDR has always remained a single-ended I/O standard using binary coding. With transfer rates per pin now over 16GT/second, one of those two core principles will eventually have to change, as we\u2019ve seen in other fields employing high-speed I/O.\n\nAMD 2011 Technical Forum and Exhibition, Examing Memory Options After GDDR5\nPAM4, in turn, is likely to be the lesser of two evils. Throwing out binary coding for PAM4 is, if nothing else, the more energy efficient option. The other route would have been to throw out single-ended I/O for differential signaling, which is something the memory industry is keen to avoid. Differential signaling works, and it works well \u2013 GDDR6 even uses it for clocking (and not memory transfers) \u2013 but it consumes a lot of pins and even more power. Which is part of the reason that HBM came around. So in one respect PAM4 can be thought as another way to stave off differential signaling on GDDR for at least another generation.\nFinally, and while we\u2019re on the subject of memory standards, the conspicuous absence of JEDEC in Micron\u2019s document bears mentioning. The trade organization and standards body is responsible for setting GDDR memory standards, including GDDR6 as well as Micron\u2019s previous attempt at a memory technology offshoot, GDDR5X. Given the premature nature of the brief\u2019s release, it\u2019s not clear whether GDDR6X is another JEDEC standard that is currently being developed privately ahead of a public launch, or if Micron is truly going solo and has developed its own memory standard.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090: 12GB of GDDR6X With Nearly 1TB of Memory Bandwidth?\nLast, but not least, let\u2019s talk about the second secret spilled in Micron\u2019s brief, NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 3090. The presumably high-end video card is apparently Micron\u2019s flagship use case for GDDR6X, and the company has helpfully laid out its typical memory configuration.\nIn short, according to Micron the video card will ship with 12GB of GDDR6X in a 384-bit memory bus configuration. That memory, in turn, will be clocked at somewhere between 19Gbps and 21Gbps, which at the higher- end of that range would give the card 1008GB/sec of memory bandwidth, just shy of a true 1TB/sec (1024GB/sec) of bandwidth.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nRTX 3090\nRTX 2080 Ti\nRTX 2080\nGTX 1080 Ti\n\n\nCUDA Cores\nMany\n4352\n2944\n3584\n\n\nMemory Clock\n19-21Gbps GDDR6X\n14Gbps GDDR6\n14Gbps GDDR6\n11Gbps GDDR5X\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n384-bit\n352-bit\n256-bit\n352-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n912 - 1008 GB/sec\n616 GB/sec\n448 GB/sec\n484 GB/sec\n\n\nVRAM\n12GB\n11GB\n8GB\n11GB\n\n\nArchitecture\nAmpere\nTuring\nTuring\nPascal\n\n\nManufacturing Process\nShiny\nTSMC 12nm \"FFN\"\nTSMC 12nm \"FFN\"\nTSMC 16nm\n\n\nLaunch Date\nFall 2020?\n09/27/2018\n09/20/2018\n03/10/2017\n\n\n\nCompared to NVIDIA\u2019s current-generation GeForce cards, this would be a sizable step up in memory bandwidth. At a minimum we\u2019re looking at 36% more bandwidth than a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, and at the high-end of that estimate that figure becomes a full 50% jump in bandwidth. This is still well below what NVIDIA\u2019s Ampere-based A100-accelerator can do (1.6TB/sec), but it would be phenomenal for a card using GDDR-type memory on a 384-bit bus. And it goes without saying that it would go a long way towards helping feed the beast that is a next-generation high-end video card.\nAt any rate, this is clearly far from the final word for GDDR6X or NVIDIA\u2019s RTX 3090, so we\u2019ll have more to look forward to as NVIDIA\u2019s September event approaches.\nHeader Image Credit: Micron, Bare DRAM (DDR5) Die\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n68 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nextide - Friday, August 14, 2020 - link\nGigabit over Copper uses PAM5, even. You don't need to look into exotic networking standards to see basic modulation schemes such as PAM being used. One day we will be using QAM across motherboard traces, now that will be nuts.\n\n\n\nSantoval - Friday, August 14, 2020 - link\nPAM-5 is not much different from PAM-4. PAM-5 is PAM-4 + 1 bit for FEC (Forward Error Correction). PAM-4 might still require FEC, depending on the signal quality, distance, SNR levels etc but it is implemented differently.By the way, there cannot be a digital PAM with an odd number : by definition the digital PAM values are always a power of 2. So the only possible values are 4, 8, 16*, 32 etc In other words the 5th bit of PAM-5 (which was by the way first employed in the now deprecated 100BASE\u2011T2, not gigabit ethernet) is not really counted. Analogue PAM, in contrast, can have an infinite number of amplitude values, both even and odd.*PAM-16 is used in 2.5GBASE-T ethernet and above, though there are variants with a different signaling scheme. \n\n\n\njim bone - Friday, August 14, 2020 - link\nPAM5 is not PAM4 + 1 bit. It's a signaling scheme with one more symbol level than PAM4.That extra level gives an additional ~0.32 bits per symbol; not 1 bit.\n\n\n\nnevcairiel - Saturday, August 15, 2020 - link\nIncidentally Ethernet actually uses PAM5 with just 2 bits of payload and the additional data for error correction.\n\n\n\nwillis936 - Friday, August 14, 2020 - link\nAll PAM4 specs include the use of FEC.

You just can't think of each signal as a separate sequence of bits (2 bits in PAM4). For example using 4 PAM-5 signals you can encode 9 bits (and use the unused combinations for some level of error-detection).\n\n\n\nalbertmamama - Saturday, August 15, 2020 - link\nWe humans can detect neutron star collision from million light years away... now that's exotic.\n\n\n\nArcadeEngineer - Friday, August 14, 2020 - link\n12GB for 3090 seems a bit stingy given Titan X from 2016 already had that much.

Granted only 1gb more than either of the TI cards but it's still the most memory. Additionally memory size on GPUs has always been affected by the bus width. 16gb of memory may have been nice but there's also no good way to do that on a 364 bit bus and retain the full memory bandwidth across the entire memory space. 24gb was probably out of the question for a variety of reasons. Supply is going to limited on the new memory and costs are going to be high. So much like Vega was limited by it's memory design I expect 12gbs was the only practical answer here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nARM, the chip designer owned by the Japanese telecommunication giant SoftBank, has become a hot commodity lately as major players in the silicon sphere continue to contemplate its acquisition.\nWe reported in early August that SoftBank representatives have purportedly approached NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), TSMC (NYSE:TSM), Foxconn, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Samsung for acquiring ARM. For SoftBank, an outright sale of ARM is just one option. Other options include a possible relisting of the chip designer or a consortium of major silicon players buying significant stakes in the company. Interestingly, subsequent reports indicated that Apple and Samsung have apparently stepped away from the negotiating table, leaving NVIDIA at the head of the pack, followed by TSMC and Foxconn.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostWell, as per the exclusive reporting by UK\u2019s Evening Standard, NVIDIA is now entering final talks for acquiring ARM, with a potential deal emerging before the end of the current summer season. According to the report, SoftBank\u2019s CEO Masayoshi Son is demanding a price as high as \u00a340 billion ($52 billion) for ARM. This translates to a premium of around $20 billion relative to the $32 billion that SoftBank paid in 2016 to acquire ARM.\nAs a refresher, ARM designs silicon chips and licenses instruction sets that govern how chips communicate. Moreover, ARM\u2019s intellectual property \u2013 including the company's Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) \u2013 is utilized by Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, Huawei, etc. for their smartphone chips, thereby, corresponding to a market coverage of around 90 percent.\nIt does make sense for NVIDIA to pursue a takeover of ARM. After all, SoftBank has been a major investor in NVIDIA, having amassed a $4 billion stake in 2017. Nonetheless, SoftBank\u2019s gargantuan $100 billion Vision Fund disclosed in early 2019 that the entirety of its NVIDIA stake had been liquidated.\nIf NVIDIA succeeds in taking over ARM, it would constitute one of the chip industry\u2019s largest acquisitions. Nonetheless, the way forward is littered with obstructions and complications. Along with the usual hurdles associated with a deal of such magnitude, regulatory glare may prove to be a stumbling block. The British government may take a dim view of this development, particularly if the deal entails moving ARM headquarters out of the UK. Bear in mind that ARM provided a commitment to retain its UK headquarter and to increase its workforce as part of the 2016 deal with SoftBank. Finally, the chip designer's existing customers may try to block the acquisition or demand assurances regarding equal access to ARM\u2019s technology.\nNVIDIA will benefit from synergies emerging out of its acquisition of ARM should the deal achieve closure. The development would also mark a continuation of the recent acquisition spree by the maker of GPU cards. As a refresher, NVIDIA officially completed its acquisition of Israel\u2019s Mellanox Technologies on the 27th of April, capping an arduous process that spanned over 13 months. Moreover, on the 4th of May, NVIDIA declared that it was buying the open networking software company, Cumulus Networks, for an undisclosed amount. NVIDIA shares have risen around 95 percent year to date, thereby, eclipsing Intel\u2019s market capitalization by $76.54 billion.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n158\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n75\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n69\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nResident Evil 9 Is Taking so Long to Release Because It Is a Reinvention of the Series \u2013 Rumor\n\n\n\n58\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAn AT&T Rep Went Too Far By Secretly Posting A Review From A Customer\u2019s Phone Under Their Name Without Consent\n\n\n\n40\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1463\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

With over $3.8 billion in revenue, Q2\u2019FY21 was not only NVIDIA\u2019s biggest quarter yet, however for the first time NVIDIA\u2019s datacenter revenue has surpassed their gaming revenue, the traditional cornerstone of the company. Thanks to the Mellanox acquisition as well as ongoing A100 accelerator sales, the datacenter market has, at long last, become NVIDIA\u2019s single largest revenue segment.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Q2 FY2021 Financial Results (GAAP)\n\n\n\u00a0\nQ2'FY2021\nQ2'FY2020\nQ1'FY2021\nQ/Q\nY/Y\n\n\nRevenue\n$3866M\n$2579M\n$3080M\n+26%\n+50%\n\n\nGross Margin\n58.8%\n59.8%\n65.1%\n-6.3%\n-1.0%\n\n\nOperating Income\n$651M\n$571M\n$1028M\n-33%\n+14%\n\n\nNet Income\n$622M\n$552M\n$917M\n-32%\n+13%\n\n\nEPS\n$0.99\n$0.90\n$1.47\n-33%\n+10%\n\n\n\nFor Q2\u2019FY21, NVIDIA booked $3.87B in revenue. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this is a jump in revenue of 50%, making it not only NVIDIA\u2019s best Q2 yet, but their biggest quarter overall. And while NVIDIA\u2019s relative profitability took a hit due to GAAP accounting rules, the company still booked $622M in net income for the quarter, 13% more than in Q1\u2019FY20.\nImpacting NVIDIA\u2019s results both positively and negatively was the Mellanox acquisition, which closed at the start of Q2. Mellanox added another 14% to NVIDIA\u2019s revenue \u2013 all in the datacenter segment \u2013 helping to fuel NVIDIA\u2019s new highs. At the same, however, closing the acquisition came with additional one-time charges for NVIDIA, cutting into NVIDIA\u2019s profit margins. As a result, NVIDIA\u2019s gross margin for the quarter was 58.8%, down 1 percentage point from last year, and several percentage points from last quarter.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Quarterly Revenue Comparison (GAAP)\r\n\t\t\t($ in millions)\n\n\nIn millions\nQ2'FY2021\nQ2'FY2020\nQ1'FY2021\nQ/Q\nY/Y\n\n\nGaming\n$1654\n$1313\n$1339\n+24%\n+26%\n\n\nProfessional Visualization\n$203\n$291\n$307\n-34%\n-30%\n\n\nDatacenter\n$1752\n$655\n$1141\n+54%\n+167%\n\n\nAutomotive\n$111\n$209\n$155\n-28%\n-47%\n\n\nOEM & IP\n$146\n$111\n$138\n+6%\n+32%\n\n\n\nBreaking down NVIDIA\u2019s revenue by platform, the big news here is NVIDIA\u2019s datacenter revenue, which at $1.752B, has for the first time has surpassed NVIDIA\u2019s gaming revenue. A significant contributor to this shift was Mellanox\u2019s networking products, which contributed over 30% to NVIDIA\u2019s datacenter revenues. But even without Mellanox\u2019s gear, NVIDIA\u2019s comparable GPU-centric datacenter revenue would be over $1.2B, surpassing even last quarter\u2019s numbers.\nAmong several firsts, Q2 is also the first full quarter for A100 revenue for NVIDIA. Even a quarter later, A100 production is still ramping \u2013 and is nowhere near the majority of NVIDIA\u2019s datacenter GPU sales \u2013 but the high performance (and highly profitable) accelerator is helping to further grow NVIDIA\u2019s already sizable datacenter GPU revenues.\nOverall, datacenter revenue overtaking gaming revenue has been a long time coming for NVIDIA, and an important step in the company\u2019s long-term goal of diversifying beyond graphics. While it\u2019s arguably taken longer than CEO Jensen Huang would perhaps have liked to see, there\u2019s no longer a question of whether NVIDIA has \u201cmade it\u201d as a compute company rather than a gaming graphics company \u2013 and this is a big factor in NVIDIA\u2019s market cap recently surpassing Intel\u2019s.\nMeanwhile NVIDIA\u2019s gaming revenue, even after being bumped from the lead spot in terms of revenue, closed out on another record quarter with $1.65B in revenue. This was up almost 25% on both a yearly and quarterly basis, with NVIDIA finding itself the unusual beneficiary of the current coronavirus pandemic. With people largely staying isolated and staying home, video gaming is on the rise, and according to NVIDIA this has also boosted gaming GPU and SoC sales.\nGoing forward, it will be interesting to see if gaming revenue remains solidly in second-place for NVIDIA, or if it and datacenter revenue end up jockeying for position. Both segments are expected to grow, especially as NVIDIA prepares for the impending launch of their next generation of GeForce video cards. A strong showing late in the year could give gaming revenue one more \u2013 and possibly its last \u2013 hurrah as NVIDIA\u2019s largest segment.\nMeanwhile NVIDIA\u2019s professional visualization segment once again brought up third place for the company. That segment saw just $203M in revenue, which is down significantly both on a quarterly and yearly basis. After enjoying a mild bump in Q1 due to the coronavirus pandemic, office closures and other changes have begun suppressing ongoing demand, with both laptop and desktop sales declining. For the same reason, this has driven higher sales of virtualization/cloud products for remote working, but not by enough to offset PC losses.\nNVIDIA\u2019s automotive business was also a victim of COVID, with the segment pulling in just $111M in revenue for the quarter. This was down on both a quarterly and yearly basis, with the latter representing a 47% drop in revenues. According to comments made on NVIDIA\u2019s earnings call, automotive production bottomed out in April due to COVID, hurting revenue for the segment.\nended up being something of a laggard for Q1\u2019FY21. The segment booked $155M in revenue, which is down 7% from the year-ago quarter. NVIDIA\u2019s automotive business moves at a much different pace than its GPU businesses \u2013 in part because it\u2019s not set to really take off until self-driving cars become a retail reality \u2013 so the business tends to ebb and flow.\nFinally, NVIDIA booked $146M in OEM & IP revenue for Q2. Among other things, this is the segment where NVIDIA books its entry-level laptop GPU sales, and it\u2019s those products that helped to drive higher revenues here.\nWrapping things up, looking ahead to Q3 of FY2021, NVIDIA\u2019s current predictions call for another record quarter. The company is expecting around $4.4B in revenue, and gross margins are anticipated to recover to above 62% as well. On the product side of matters, Q3 should see additional ramping of NVIDIA\u2019s A100 accelerators, and almost certainly will see the launch of new Ampere-based GeForce video cards from the company as well.\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n35 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nplopke - Wednesday, August 19, 2020 - link\nIf they keep growing in data center like this and keep their ridicules lead over amd on the high end , why not charge 2000$ dollars for a 3090 , yes I would make me cry , but MONEY MONEY MONEY!Plz for the love of god more competition in the GPU market.\n\n\n\nshabby - Wednesday, August 19, 2020 - link\nWho will buy those? \n\n\n\nsurt - Wednesday, August 19, 2020 - link\nEveryone with a datacenter, apparently.\n\n\n\nnathanddrews - Wednesday, August 19, 2020 - link\nEveryone that always buys the highest end gear without flinching. I'm guessing $1499 Founders Edition.\n\n\n\np1esk - Thursday, August 20, 2020 - link\nI'll gladly pay $2k for 3090 card IF it has 24GB of memory. In fact I'd order eight of them IF they also have blower type fans (to install them side by side). If A100 are priced the same as V100, choosing 4x or 5x 3090 cards vs 1x A100 is a no-brainer. \n\n\n\nplopke - Wednesday, August 19, 2020 - link\nnot me ,but who bought the 1100-1400$ 2080Ti , tons of people , it feels like people already forgot how insanly high the 2080Ti was priced , if you compared to how much value we can get these days on the cpu market like a 3700X etc.who buys 1000$ smart phones ,  tons.And if you can't afford it you can buy streaming game pass from Nvidia and if that gets popular who on earth do they wanna sell a cheap high end card 2 , nobody.So plz more competition in the GPU market.\n\n\n\nplopke - Wednesday, August 19, 2020 - link\nwell they would sell like surt said to datacenter :P\n\n\n\nlilkwarrior - Wednesday, August 19, 2020 - link\nThe 2080TI was not overpriced; all it did was replace the initial Titan (RTX after all has tensor cores too now), release alongside the rest of the cards instead of 8-12 months later, & had more deep-learning capabilities than a $3000 Titan. \n\n\n\nbeginner99 - Thursday, August 20, 2020 - link\nThe Titan usually also had more VRAM which for any real deeplearning is actually needed.\n\n\n\nlilkwarrior - Thursday, August 20, 2020 - link\nNot all deep-learning endeavors need that much VRAM; if you need that VRAM you would't bother w/ Nvidia RTX at all being a non-starter. That said, many do just fine using RTX's tensor cores for deep-learning otherwise that is again faster than the $3000 Titan before it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

McHale III\nEditorial Director\nMilitary Embedded Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect Tech image.\n\nGUELPH, Ontario, Canada. HEICO Corp. acquired Connect Tech, a producer of embedded computing and NVIDIA GPU solutions for military applications such as unmanned systems, communications, ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance), and more various form factors such as COM Express and PC104. As a subsidiary of HEICO Corporation, Connect Tech will continue to serve its global customer base.\n\n\nConnect Tech and its specialization in NVIDIA-based solutions has fueled the company's growth over the last few years, and company officials say that joining HEICO's vast group of technology companies\u00a0should continue that success. \"Connect Tech has continued on a significant growth path over the past few years, primarily due to our ability to provide extremely fast turn-around time of custom solutions and creating standard product lines servicing cutting-edge technologies,\" says David Worthen, president and founder of Connect Tech. \"Having the financial backing of HEICO, with annual revenues of over $2 billion, gives us the ability to continue investing in capital equipment that will help us scale at a trajectory faster than we could accomplish independently \u2014\u00a0especially in the defense and aerospace markets.\"\u00a0\nRegarding defense and aerospace, Worthen added that HEICO\u00a0being an American-based company\u00a0helps broaden Connect Tech's reach in the U.S. defense market. \"Being a part of an American company with over 60 years of aerospace and defense experience provides visibility into programs that Connect Tech, as a Canadian company, would not necessarily be invited to participate in,\" he says. \"HEICO and its various subsidiaries have an in-depth knowledge of the technological goals and challenges within the defense sector. Connect Tech has the experience of bringing both standard and customized embedded computing solutions to market - this partnership will allow us to anticipate the market\u2019s needs and deliver in-demand solutions to aerospace and defense companies.\"\nFrom an outward facing standpoint, not much will change for Connect Tech's customers and partners.\n\"Not only will I remain President of Connect Tech, but our entire team will stay intact,\" Worthen notes. \"Our customer base will not see any changes in our day-to day operations, and we will continue to offer the level of quality engineering customers have come to depend on. Connect Tech\u2019s acquisition by HEICO is an ideal scenario \u2013 it allows us to continue doing what we do best, while leveraging the resources and access of our parent organization.\"\nFinancial details of the acquisition were not disclosed.\nConnect Tech Inc. is NVIDIA\u2019s largest global embedded hardware partner offering a wide array of NVIDIA\u00a0Jetson\u00a0solutions, as well as embedded solutions for a variety of industry standards including COM Express, SMARC, and more. With more than 35 years of embedded computing experience, the company's technology offering\u00a0includes complete embedded systems, carrier boards, thermal solutions, and more.\nFor more information visit\u00a0www.connecttech.com.\nHEICO Corporation is engaged primarily in the design, production, servicing and distribution of products and services to certain niche segments of the aviation, defense, space, medical, telecommunications and electronics industries through its Hollywood, Florida-based Flight Support Group and its Miami, Florida-based Electronic Technologies Group.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)As PC Gamer reported, the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) published a very interesting entry today. Apparently, MSI has registered 29 different Nvidia graphics cards based off the next-gen Ampere architecture with the regulatory body. These could be MSI's take on the GeForce RTX 3090, 3080 and RTX 3070, respectively.Instead of publicly exposing the model names for the graphics cards, MSI cunningly filed their part numbers. It's a good tactic, since hardware sleuths are constantly on the lookout for new model name listings, but almost no one pays attention to the part numbers.\u00a0Fortunately, we do have MSI's current Turing-powered offerings as reference; however, we don't for sure if MSI will maintain the same formula for its Ampere cards.\u00a0The part numbers on the EEC don't really tell us much about the specifications, so we still have to to get all the juicy details. Hopefully, that'll come on September 1, when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang plans on making a GeForce announcement.\u00a0For the current GeForce RTX-20 series, MSI utilizes the V371, V372 and V373 prefixes for the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, RTX 2080 and RTX 2070, respectively. MSI generally uses smaller numbers to denote higher-specced models.\u00a0We've applied the same pattern for MSI's alleged Ampere products in the table below:\u00a0Swipe to scroll horizontallyPrefixPart NumberModelV388?GeForce RTX 3090V389?GeForce RTX 3080V390?GeForce RTX 3070V371V371-026RMSI GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Gaming X TrioV372V372-031RMSI GeForce RTX 2080 Gaming X TrioV373V373-015RMSI GeForce RTX 2070 Gaming XV374V375-008RMSI GeForce RTX 2060 Gaming XThe 29 different part numbers from the EEC listing can be separated into three groups: V388, V389 and V390. According to MSI's nomenclature for Turing, the V388 should be the GeForce RTX 3090, while the V389 and V390 likely correspond to the GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3070, respectively.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.As a result, the EEC submission seemingly points to 14 GeForce RTX 3090s, 11 GeForce RTX 3080s and four GeForce RTx 3070s. It is important to note that not every EEC-registered product makes it to market. Brands often register an abundance of part numbers or product names just to get dibs on other competitors. The companies will use some of them, while others remain inactive forever.MSI Ampere Graphics Cards (Image credit: Eurasian Economic Commission)As mentioned, Nvidia has a big GeForce-related online event scheduled for September 1. \u00a0If you believe in coincidences, Nvidia announced the GeForce 256 graphics card on August 31, 1999. So this year marks the 21 year anniversary of the \"the world's first GPU\" as Nvidia marketed it. There's simply no better time or a bigger stage to announce Ampere.At this point, it's pretty much anybody's guess which models will star in Nvidia's Ampere show. The GeForce RTX 3090 and RTX 3080 are strong candidates; although, we wouldn't be surprised if the RTX 3070 also gets in on the fun.Today's best GeForce RTX 2080 deals No price informationCheck Amazon No price informationCheck WalmartWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nMSI-Microstar\nGeForce RTX 3090\nrtx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (0)\n\n\n\nZhiye LiuSocial Links NavigationNews Editor and Memory ReviewerZhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

In an unusual twist, the second quarter of 2020 saw a major boost in GPU shipments from both NVIDIA and AMD.\nNVIDIA Gains 80% Discrete GPU Market Share in Q2 2020, AMD Falls Down To 20%\nIt looks like the COVID-19 pandemic didn't stop consumers from buying new hardware and as a result, Q2 2020 saw a 2.5% increase in GPU shipments compared to Q1 2020. Typically, the 2nd quarter is down each year but as seen in the results, NVIDIA and AMD moved a good amount of units.\nRelated Story AMD Targets NVIDIA\u2019s Grace & Intel Granite Rapids Xeon CPUs With New 5th Gen EPYC Performance Showcase, Up To 2.75x Power Efficiency\n\n\nQuick highlights\n\nAMD\u2019s overall unit shipments increased by 8.4% quarter-to-quarter, Intel\u2019s total shipments decreased by -2.7% from last quarter, and Nvidia\u2019s increased by 17.8%.\nThe overall attach rate of GPUs (includes integrated and discrete GPUs, desktop, notebook, and workstations) to PCs for the quarter was 126% which was up by 2.3% from last quarter.\nThe overall PC market increased by 0.68% quarter-to-quarter and increased by 12.54% year-to-year.\nDesktop graphics add-in boards (AIBs that use discrete GPUs) increased by 6.55% from last quarter.\nQ2'20 saw no change in tablet shipments from last quarter.\n\nvia JPR\nTalking about overall GPU shipments, AMD's shipments increased by 8.4% which led to an 18% GPU market share, NVIDIA's shipments increased by 17.8% which led to a 19% market share and finally, Intel shipments fell by 2.7% leading to a market share of 64%. The numbers also take into account integrated graphics which are usually featured onboard processors from AMD and Intel.\n\nComing to the discrete graphics numbers, the overall AIB market increased by 6.55% from the previous quarter. NVIDIA gained some huge market share, climbing back to 80% versus 75% in the previous quarter. AMD didn't fare as well in the discrete graphics segment as its share fell to 20%. AMD's discrete GPU market share was 29% during Q2 2019 which means that AMD has lost 9% of its graphics foothold since last year.\nThe higher number of shipments could be attributed to the release of NVIDIA's GeForce SUPER line up of GPUs, both for the desktop and mobility segment. NVIDIA's SUPER line of mobility GPUs were featured on several high-performance AMD 3rd Gen Ryzen and Intel's 10th Gen Core laptops. They were also featured in mainstream options priced within the sweet-spot category. At the same time, promotions on the older GeForce Turing graphics cards and game bundles pushed sales for the PC desktop cards.\n\nAMD didn't hold back in the desktop field with the Radeon RX 5700 and Radeon RX 5600 cards getting price cuts every now and then but AMD failed to offer any product within the enthusiast performance category, both in the desktop and mobility space. AMD's Radeon RX 5700 Mobility was also missing in action entirely from the notebook space for a long time whereas NVIDIA had several high-end and mainstream budget options targetted at the mobility segment.\nFor the second half of 2020, we can see NVIDIA retaining or pushing its share even further since they are about to release their next-generation Ampere GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards. AMD also plans to release its Big Navi 'Radeon RX' graphics cards around Q4 2020 so expect the market to remain heated during the winter season!\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJP Morgan Believes AMD\u2019s AI GPU Business Would Grow By 60 Percent This Year, Highlights Oracle\u2019s Initial Order Of 30,000 MI355X GPUs\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n195\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n73\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n67\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAn AT&T Rep Went Too Far By Secretly Posting A Review From A Customer\u2019s Phone Under Their Name Without Consent\n\n\n\n53\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nResident Evil 9 Is Taking so Long to Release Because It Is a Reinvention of the Series \u2013 Rumor\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1472\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1162\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1157\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Since then, however, I've noticed that other UWP games sometimes default to the integrated Intel GPU, both on my Surface Book and other laptops. Thankfully, there's an easy way to fix it.Here's how to force your Surface Book (or any laptop with an NVIDIA GPU \u2060\u2014 check out our best graphics card picks) to use its discrete graphics processing, and check whether your games are using it as appropriate.Type Nvidia into the Start Menu to find the Nvidia Control Panel.Click Manage 3D Settings is selected in the left column.Select the Program Settings tab on the right side.Find the game you want in the drop down list, or click Add if you can't find it.Note: Often UWP games don't find their way into the list by default, and need to be added.Click Add Selected Program to include it in the menu.With your target game selected in the first drop down menu, now select High-performance NVIDIA processor in the bottom drop down menu.Note: The program might lock up briefly while it does the switch over, be patient!Win32 games seem to have no issues when it comes to defaulting to the correct graphics processor, but sometimes games from the Windows 10 Store seem to get a bit confused. This is the best workaround for now until Microsoft issues a more comprehensive fix.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nPC Gaming\nGaming\n\n\nJez CordenSocial Links NavigationExecutive EditorJez Corden is the Executive Editor at Windows Central, focusing primarily on all things Xbox and gaming.

His coverage areas include audio (Sonos, Apple, Bose, Sony, etc.), home theater, smartphones, photography, and more.Nvidia is delivering a number of new features to the tube-shaped Shield TV and Shield TV Pro streaming devices it released last year, and older models are also getting improvements. The company patted itself on the back with a blog post celebrating the 25th software update for Shield TV. It\u2019s fair to say that Nvidia knows its audience, and this latest round of upgrades is targeted at home theater enthusiasts and streaming power users.The impressive, AI-powered 4K upscaling feature of the 2019 Shield TV and Shield TV Pro will now work with 360p and 1440p content in addition to the 720p and 1080p resolutions that it supported before. (The Pro model can now upscale 60fps content, which should prove handy for sports.)Owners of the newer Shield TVs can also now do more with the remote control: the customizable menu button can now be assigned actions for a double press and long press, Nvidia says you can pick from 25 actions in all, so this extends beyond just more shortcuts for your favorite apps. (If you bought the remote separately for an older Shield TV, you get these expanded customizations too.)Photo by Chris Welch / The VergeIR and CEC volume control support have been improved in the latest update, with support for digital projectors and the ability to adjust volume even when the Shield itself isn\u2019t active. \u201cIt also adds IR volume control when using the Shield TV app, and when you\u2019ve paired your Google Home with Shield. The 2019 Shield remote adds IR control to change the input source on TVs, AVRs and soundbars,\u201d Nvidia said.And the last bit of good news for home theater nerds: Nvidia says that older models of the Shield (2015 and 2017) are getting an option to always match the frame rate of displayed content.See More: AndroidGoogleNewsNvidiaTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019Lego announces Pok\u00e9mon sets are coming next yearInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Just a few days ago we learned of a rumor that the NVIDIA RTX 3090, the apparent flagship in NVIDIA's new lineup, will feature GDDR6X memory, which boasts much improved speeds thanks to a higher bandwidth. Now, a new rumor is surfacing that tells us even more about this powerful PC component.A report from wccftech may reveal long-awaited information regarding the pricing of the RTX 3090, as well as how much of this new GDDR6X memory the GPU could have, and both are much higher than originally expected. The RTX 3090 (which is expected to be the successor to the already expensive RTX 2080 Ti) could start at $1,399 in the US, with an extra $100 on top for the Founder's Edition, bringing the final price to a wallet-emptying $1,499. However, these prices could be justified if the RTX 3090 is as powerful as rumors suggest.Utilizing a huge 24GB of new GDDR6X memory, the RTX 3090 will have over twice the amount of the RTX 2080 Ti, which came with only 11GB, and this upgrade memory will have higher speeds and better efficiency. Not only that, but the new cores the RTX 3090 will use may give players a 40-50% performance leap over the RTX 2080 Ti, one of the most powerful graphics cards you can stick in your PC, and a mainstay in our picks of best graphics card) for your PC.We'll have to wait for NVIDIA's official reveal to verify any of this information, so take these rumors with a hefty pinch of salt for now. In the meantime, are you excited for what could be the king of PC GPU's going forward? Are you impressed with the apparent features and performance the RTX 3090 will offer?

There's still just under a week to go before their big GeForce event, but today Nvidia released a new video and blog post detailing the next-gen cooling solution for their RTX 3000 cards, giving us our first glimpse of the new power connector, as well as a few more details on why they've decided to eschew the traditional 8-pin connectors in favour of this new (and seemingly vertical) power solution.\n\nAlas, the video stops short of showing us the full and final design of the upcoming Nvidia Ampere GPUs, but it does go into quite a lot of detail about how Nvidia come up with the designs of their graphics cards more generally. It also drops a few, if slightly vague clues about what to expect from their Ampere GPUs, though, which seem to confirm everything we've seen and heard about Nvidia's RTX 3000 series so far - namely, that they're going to have a rather funky new fan design, as seen in previously leaked photos, and will probably be pretty darn large. \n\nTo see this content please enable targeting cookies.\n\nManage cookie settings\n\nFirst up, Nvidia talk about how they've had to essentially rip up their own rule book when it comes to graphics card design for Ampere, suggesting that, yep, the RTX 3000 cards aren't going to look like any kind of Founders Edition card that have come before them.\n\"To achieve even more cooling performance, we have to move more air through the system,\" Nvidia's thermal architect David Haley says in the video. \"In order to achieve this perfect airflow, we have to remove the constraints that we had before. We have to change the PCB. We have to move the fans. We need to change the software stack that's controlling the fans.\"\nNext up, it's the turn of Andrew Bell, Nvidia's VP of product design. He starts by talking about how previous cooling solutions have traditionally been fixed onto the PCB with very tall springs. \"So we challenged our mechanical engineers to come up with a leaf-spring design to keep the springs that hold the thermal solution to the GPU low-profile enough that we could fit a back cover over them,\" he says, presumably so said back cover can whack another fan onto the other rear of the graphics card, like we've seen in the photos.\nNvidia then move on to talk about that all-important 12-pin PSU connector, and how it was one of their goals this time round to \"generate more performance by getting more power into the GPU\" in addition to the usual performance gains you get simply by moving to a new architecture. The problem with this is that the more power you squeeze through a high-end graphics card, the risk of introducing things like crosstalk gets much bigger, which can corrupt the electrical signals being passed through multiple wires inside the GPU. Now, there isn't a lot of room on a graphics card's PCB to try and help space these wires out.\n\"The way to mitigate it is, of course, using more layers on the PCB,\" says Gabriele Gorla, Nvidia's director of system engineering. \"One of the components we reduced the size of significantly was the power connector, and we designed a new connector, which is smaller than the PCIe Express, but actually ends up carrying more power.\"\n\nFinally, Nvidia's senior industrial designer Joseph Lee comes out to reassure us that the final design of the new Ampere RTX 3000 series (i.e: the bit we see on the outside) won't compromise all the stuff they've just talked about \"in the name of aesthetics\". The video also shows off some simple pencil sketches (pictured above) of various types of graphics cards, but none of them really correspond to the leaked photos we've seen so far of the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090. The one at centre right just at the top of the image is probably the closest thing we've seen so far to the leaked photos, but even I'm willing to admit it's a bit of a stretch.\nEither way, Lee goes on to say that as an industrial designer, \"you should try not to look at what's been done before,\" implying once again that these cards are going to be quite different from previous Nvidia Founders Editions, and that these fans will be right at the fore of their overall look.\n\"As a design team, before we started to dive into the conceptualisation phase, we naturally gravitated towards this idea where, really, the thermal aspect of the design is fully embraced. From that foundation, we were able to achieve this breakthrough thermal technology.\"\nAnd then, the very briefest of glimpses of one side of the RTX 3000 series right at the 8.10 mark:\n\nTo follow the full reveal of Nvidia's Ampere RTX 3000 series, you can tune into their special GeForce Event next Tuesday on September 1st at 9am PT / 5pm BST, or keep your eyes peeled on RPS where I'll be covering the whole launch as it happens.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nKatharine Castle: Katharine was RPS' editor-in-chief from 2021 to 2024.

But it\u2019s also packed with foundational information to help graphics enthusiasts understand just what drove the design decisions of Ampere.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe video leads with thermal architect David Haley, who said a GPU without cooling attached to it would heat up to about 760 degrees Celsius, which is 100 degrees hotter than the melting point of aluminum. Haley talks viewers through how cooling works in a graphics card, and then said a lot of changes had to be made for this generation.\n\u201cIn order to achieve this perfect airflow, we had to remove the constraints we had before,\u201d Haley said. \u201cWe have to change the PCB, we have to move the fans, we have to change the software stack that\u2019s controlling the fans.\u201d\n\n\n\n Reddit \n\nOn Redditor posted a rendered image of what many believe the Ampere design will look like.based on an earlier leak.\n\n\nThat\u2019s obviously in reference to the radical look of Nvidia\u2019s next-gen GeForce graphics cards, which has already leaked. The leaks, however, didn\u2019t explain what\u2019s behind the design\u2014but it\u2019s starting to make more sense now.\u00a0Unlike most graphics cards with rectangular PCBs, the leaks of Ampere-based GeForce graphics cards appear to show a much shorter 6- to 7-inch PCB with a V-notch at the rear.\u00a0\nThat seems to be confirmed by a reference Haley makes to the computational fluid dynamics workups the company did on airflow in a typical desktop.\nIn the Nvidia video, you can see the fan closest to the back of the PC sucking air in, and exhausting it out the rear of the case\u2014very much like a typical blower style card that\u2019s good for internal case temperatures, but not so great in performance. Nvidia\u2019s video, however, shows a second fan closer to the front of the PC sucking air in and exhausting it directly up, where the the fan mounted behind the CPU will exhaust it. We suspect some air is also channeled to the rear fan as well to cool components.\nThat\u2019s a big change from a typical dual-fan blower cooler, which simply forces air in over fin stacks of a GPU and then hopes the case itself has enough raw air flow to deal with the heat generated.\n\nHaley also hints that the new card will feature a rethink of the base plate to aid, rather than hinder in cooling as well. The rendering from Nvidia\u2019s video (seen in the screenshot below) also shows a heat sink stack on the side that looks identical to the cooler design in the leaks.\n Nvidia\n\nNvidia said airflow will be critical to Ampere. You can see air coming in the front lower right quadrant of a case, and being sucked through one fan on the far left of the card with the second fan apparently using front air flow to and blowing it up and out past the CPU.\n\n\nFrom a mechanical standpoint, Nvidia\u2019s product design V.P. Andrew Bell said engineers had to take all of their goals and \u201cdreams\u201d and come with a way to actually make them. One innovation, Bell said, is a low-profile leaf spring design that holds the cooler to the GPU core while still allowing for a backcover to fit.\nShorter PCB and 12-pin connector explained\nLast to speak was Gabriele Gorla, the director of system engineering at Nvidia. Gorla said the shorter PCB required addressing crosstalk, or interference issues with the wire and power density. Gorla said to mitigate crosstalk, you typically add layers to the PCB, and you \u201chave awesome layout engineers\u201d so it\u2019s likely Ampere has more layers than previous designs.\nGorla also directly addressed the latest buzz around the card: The new 12-pin connector, which has already been shown off by Seasonic. Many have wondered just why Nvidia would bother to redesign the existing power connectors, but it\u2019s clear from Gorla that board space was at a premium for Ampere.\u00a0Here you can see a CAD drawing of how much space a standard dual 8-pin connector would take.\n\n Nvidia\n\nThis is how much space a conventional dual 8-pin connector would take.\n\n\nAnd here\u2019s how much space is saved with Nvidia\u2019s new 12-pin connector.\u00a0\n Nvidia\n\nNvidia\u2019s 12-pin connector saves a considerable amount of space.\n\n\nAs you can see, the new 12-pin power connector has a significantly smaller footprint, which means more space for cooling and power. Leaked images of the Ampere-based GeForce RTX 3090 indicate it\u2019s a fairly huge graphics card, but the small cable connector (which is included) and small PCB means the insides will be very compact. Assuming the leaked images all prove accurate (and this video certainly suggests they will), we\u2019d guess that most of the new electrical, mechanical, and industrial design in the new GeForce cards is for one simple purpose: Cooling.\n Nvidia\nWhile most of the video features previous GeForce cards in it, the upcoming Ampere-based GeForce appears at the end\u00a0 The video closes with what looks to be the only view of the exterior of the card flying by the camera. The build up will likely continue until next Tuesday, when Nvidia is expected\u00a0to announce the GeForce RTX 3090 at a scheduled GeForce event it\u2019s been hyping up for weeks.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Unlike Windows and Mac users, you won't need a native app to get started. Instead, you can simply point your browser to play.geforce.now and login with a new or existing GeForce Now account. As before, you'll need to own some games to take advantage of the service. GeForce Now supports a range of titles from digital storefronts like Steam, Epic Games Store and Ubisoft\u2019s Uplay. You essentially queue up for an NVIDIA-owned machine in a server farm somewhere, then access your game by remotely logging into the relevant storefront client.The expansion to Chromebooks is a welcome one. GeForce Now doesn't make sense if you're sat at home with a powerful gaming rig in front of you. But if you're on the move -- a bustling coffee shop or cramped dorm room, for instance -- there's a good chance that a lower-specced clamshell is sitting on your lap instead. If you're carrying a cheap Chromebook, there's no way that you're playing high-end games like Control without some kind of streaming involved. Google Stadia, one of many GeForce Now rivals, already supports Chromebooks but its game library is fairly limited, both for Pro subscribers and people who would rather buy games \u00e0 la carte.Now, ChromeOS users have a second option. GeForce Now has its own catalog issues, though. When the service formally launched last February, many publishers were caught off guard and quickly asked NVIDIA to pull their catalogs. The company called it a \"misunderstanding\" and has subsequently changed its policy so that game makers have to opt into the service. NVIDIA says GeForce Now users can stream \"one of more than 650 games instantly,\" including \"over 70 of the most-play free-to-play games.\" Other titles will be added throughout the year, including Cyberpunk 2077.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementChromeOS might be the headline announcement, however NVIDIA has emphasized that it's working on updates for PC, Mac, Shield and Android users too. The PC and Mac clients will soon support Ansel, for instance, a screenshot tool that lets you snap digital photos from any angle, add filters and capture 360-degree photospheres that are viewable in virtual reality.GeForce Now is free to use, though your sessions are limited to an hour and you often have to wait for a remote machine to become available. You can, however, pay $4.99 per month for a Founders membership that ups the session limit to six hours, gives you priority access, and turns on NVIDIA\u2019s RTX ray-tracing acceleration. The company is also offering a six-month Founders pass for $24.95 that includes a battle pass token and in-game bundle (worth $69.94, apparently) for Ubisoft\u2019s Hyper Scape battle royale.If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

But the Japanese firm is now reportedly in advanced talks to sell it to Nvidia.Hermann Hauser told the BBC he thought the UK government should intervene.The tech entrepreneur - who spun off ARM from Acorn Computers in 1990 - says ministers should help make it an independent UK business again.'Unsuitable owner'ARM creates computer chip designs that others then customise to their own ends. It also develops instruction sets, which define how software controls processors.Just about every modern mobile phone and smart home gadget is powered by a chip that relies on one or both of these innovations.When Softbank bought the firm for \u00a324bn soon after the referendum to leave the EU in 2016, it was hailed by the government as a vote of confidence in a post-Brexit Britain.But Dr Hauser said at the time it was a sad day for him and for UK technology.Dr Hauser was given an honorary knighthood in 2016 for his services to UK industry and engineeringFour years on, after a number of big bets went wrong for the Japanese firm - notably its investment in the shared office space business WeWork - SoftBank wants to dispose of ARM, either returning it to the stock market through a share sale or letting another organisation buy it outright.In recent days, there have been a number of reports that Nvidia - which recently overtook Intel to become the world's most valuable chip-maker - is keen to buy it. The last weekend in July, I contacted Dr Hauser who spends the UK's winters in New Zealand and remained there because of the coronavirus pandemic.He told me that a sale of ARM to Nvidia would be a disaster, but thought it very unlikely to happen. This past weekend he got back in touch to say the reports now looked very credible and his concern had deepened.He explained that ARM's business model - in which all the big chip-makers license its technologies - made Nvidia an unsuitable owner.\"It's one of the fundamental assumptions of the ARM business model that it can sell to everybody,\" he explained.\"The one saving grace about Softbank was that it wasn't a chip company, and retained ARM's neutrality. \"If it becomes part of Nvidia, most of the licensees are competitors of Nvidia, and will of course then look for an alternative to ARM.\"While Dr Hauser voted against the Softbank deal in 2016, he says the Japanese firm kept its promises to retain Cambridge as the main focus of ARM's research and to boost employment there. He has little faith in that remaining the case if Nvidia takes over.ReutersAcquiring ARM would be a major coup for Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang\"It will become one of the Nvidia divisions, and all the decisions will be made in America, no longer in Cambridge.\" But the Austrian-born venture capitalist hopes that can still be avoided.\"The great opportunity that the cash needs of Softbank presents is to bring ARM back home and take it public, with the support of the British government,\" he said.'Not about the money'Dr Hauser added that he would like to see it listed on both the London and New York Stock Exchanges.He acknowledged that an already financially stretched government could not be expected to provide cash for the deal, but could still encourage it to happen.\"It's not about the money, it's the industrial strategy statements that the government can make,\" he said.Dr Hauser thinks the government's recent move to invest $500m (\u00a3378m) in the satellite firm OneWeb may be a sign that it is prepared to intervene when the UK's technology future is at stake. And he thinks the UK's wider microprocessor sector should be championed, pointing to the success of Bristol-based Graphcore in designing AI chips.\"[OneWeb was] a strong statement that the government is actually serious about industrial strategy,\" he said.\"And if ever there was a big strategic prize to be had, it would be to take the crown away from Intel as the number one microprocessor company in the world and make it part of the UK\".

The recently made a\u00a0 Facebook post showcasing how they have their latest water blocks ready for the next generation of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards.\nAlphacool confirmed that it has Water Blocks Ready for the upcoming NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series \"Ampere\" Graphics cards\nAlphacool is well known for its custom-designed water blocks, which offer a combination of extreme cooling and stylish design. They create water blocks for both NVIDIA GPUs and Radeon GPUs, which enables PC builders that utilize either to add those to their water cooling loop easily.\nRelated Story Mysterious NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Graphics Card With Dual-Slot & Blower-Type Cooler SpottedSource: AlphaCool\nAlphacool has stated in a Facebook (via Videocardz) post that they have the Cooler, Manual, and Packaging all completed for the next-generation NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards. In the same Facebook post, they state that the Custom Designs are currently being worked on & its focus is to ensure that the water block provides the performance that Alphacool is known.\nSource: AlphaCool\nOne user wanted to Alphacool to specify that these new coolers will be for the GeForce RTX 30 series and not the existing GeForce RTX 30 series. This user also asked a very important question, \"You have the specs already?\" This question and the answer that Alphacool gave shows that they have already received the necessary information from NVIDIA.\nThe company stated, \"For the new coming up Nvidia cards, yes, we have.\" This shows that they received the information, most likely, by NVIDIA themselves. its water block will be designed with NVIDIA's quirky new polygonal PCB with a triangular tail-end, this new design will utilize its latest cooling solution that uses fans on either side of the card to have adequate airflow. In a similar fashion, EKWB is also readying its next-generation of water blocks for NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards.\nLittle other information about these upcoming coolers is known and until the next generation of NVIDIA graphics cards is available until the announcement which is planned for the 1st of September.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce GPUs Do Not Incorporate Peer-To-Peer Support, Redirecting Consumers To Purchase Expensive GPUs\n\nJason R.

He also clarifies that this is the RTX 3090 (again, we can take that with a good deal of caution too \u2013 Nvidia may come up with a different naming scheme for its next-gen GPUs, although we are seeing the 3090 label pop up with more regularity now as we near the Ampere launch).Supersized GPUWhat\u2019s clear enough is that this looks to be a giant of a GPU, as you can see in the images in which it is sat next to a current-gen RTX 2080, and absolutely dwarfs it.If this is indeed Nvidia\u2019s incoming top-end graphics card, the RTX 3090 will be a three slot GPU, no less, as you can see from the mounting bracket. And by the looks of it, the GPU could present size problems for smaller cases, or indeed concerns about supporting the thing when putting it into the PCIe slot (perhaps requiring the use of some kind of support to prevent the card sagging).As mentioned, the design looks the same as some of the previous leaked images we\u2019ve seen, which include the purported RTX 3080 and its giant heatsink. That massive heatsink is accompanied by a pair of fans, as you can see: one on the front, and one on the back.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The rumors about hefty power usage \u2013 with a 350W TDP having been previously speculated, and potentially the use of a new power connector \u2013 also seem more believable now, looking at the sheer size of this graphics card.The Twitter leaker also shared alleged prices for the rest of the Ampere GPU range, with another tweet claiming that the RTX 3080 will retail at $800, with the RTX 3070 being pitched at $600, and the RTX 3060 coming in at $400.If true, those prices are all notched up (by $100, and $50 in the latter case) compared to the RTX 2000 series at release, but treat this nugget of info with even more caution (and remember that supposedly the initial Ampere launch won\u2019t include the RTX 3070 or 3060, anyway, going by the rumor mill).These are the best graphics cardsVia Tom\u2019s Hardware\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

Also reportedly disclosed was the RTX 3080's 10GB memory configuration and the lack of an RTX 3080 Ti at launch\u2014a fact we can also attest to from our own discussions with board partners.These latest rumours would have the RTX 3090 as the most memory laden GeForce graphics card to date by some margin. GDDR6X memory has already been confirmed to exist by manufacturer Micron, who also alluded to a use within Nvidia's upcoming high-end GPUs. That would have the RTX 3090 sitting pretty with high capacity, high speed memory.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: the top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest graphics card: your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: get into the game ahead of the restGDDR6X memory has been listed at up to 21Gbps. Worst case scenario you're looking at 19Gbps\u2014a dramatic increase on the 11GB of GDDR6 memory within the RTX 2080 Ti rated to 14Gbps.The report suggest the RTX 3090 would be fitted with a 384-bit bus and the RTX 3080 a 320-bit bus.Videocardz report is able to confirm only the RTX 3090 and RTX 3080's memory capacity. However, we also expect an RTX 3070 to launch in September\u2014as suggested by MSI's recent registry on the Eurasion Economic Commission (EEC). \u00a0We can also say with confidence that our own digging suggest no RTX 3080 Ti is set to be a part of the initial 30-series lineup, as similarly suggested in the aforementioned report.We're less than a week out until the proposed launch day for Nvidia Ampere. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is set to make an appearance in his kitchen once again for the \"GeForce Special Event\" on September 1, 2020, and we're expecting him to spill all on the upcoming Ampere generation of gaming graphics cards.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

As in, the card is just under a year old, and there is already chatter that NVIDIA is discontinuing the SKU. The reason? To make room for a new generation of graphics cards based on Ampere, of course.\n\n\nTo be perfectly clear, there is no official confirmation from NVIDIA that the GeForce RTX 2070 Super is getting the Old Yeller treatment. However, according MyDrivers, the SKU has been \"completely discontinued,\" with the last batch of chips having gone out to NVIDIA's hardware partners. No new orders for the GeForce RTX will be accepted, the report states.\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 2070 Super was part of a refresh to NVIDA's Turing stack. NVIDIA also launched Super variants of the GeForce RTX 2080 and 2060, and GeForce GTX 1660 and 1650.\n\n\nAccording to Videocardz, the GeForce RTX 2070 Super is one of four Turing models to be discontinued so far. The others include the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, GeForce RTX 2080 Super, and GeForce RTX 2070. If true, then NVIDIA is essentially gutting its high-end graphics card lineup in preparation for upcoming Ampere-based cards.\n\n\nWhat about the rest of the lineup? As the story goes, NVIDIA is not planning to replace its current crop of mainstream graphics cards with Ampere, at least not at the outset. Higher end parts will debut parts, and then eventually we will see more affordable Ampere options.\n\n\nThat's if the rumors and leaks are true. It's hard to predict what exactly NVIDIA will, given the unique situation with COVID-19, and an impending launch by rival AMD, with Navi on the horizon.\n\n\nAll that said, there are still a bunch of GeForce RTX 2070 Super cards to be found. However, glancing at Newegg, there is only one model priced at $499.99, which is the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 2070 Super Windforce OC. It's still a good card overall, though if you can wait a bit, it's worth seeing what Ampere and Navi will bring to the table.\n\n\nAs for how long you'll have to wait, the same source indicates NVIDIA will launch Ampere to the consumer sector on September 17, starting with the GeForce RTX 3080 and/ore 3080 Ti. Then in October and November, we will see the debut of the GeForce RTX 3070 and 3060, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, (nasdaq:nvda), ampere, geforce rtx 2070 super\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorAug 31, 2020, 04:11pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.If the slides below are to be believed, Nvidia's upcoming RTX 3000-series 'Ampere' graphics cards could be more than twice as fast in some games than the RTX 2000-series, with the performance of the RTX 3090 smashing the RTX 2080 Ti - it's current 2000-series flagship.\nA render of Nvidia's RTX 3080 by Reddit user tor6770tor6770\n\nThe benchmark results, revealed by Twitter user @yuten0x, show that in Control, the new Ampere card was more than twice as fast as the RTX 2080 Ti with RTX features such as DLSS turned on at 4K resolution. It was exactly twice as rapid in Minecraft RTX and somewhere around 1.8x as fast in Wolfenstein: Youngblood.\nNvidia's RTX 3090 could be more than twice as fast as the RTX 2080 Ti@yuten0x\n\nThe next slide to be supposedly leaked suggests the RTX 3090 could have a massive 24GB memory, 5,2848 cores and memory bandwidth of 19.5Gbps. Various rumors have pointed at prices around $1400, but many in the community have suggested that's too low for the specification.\n\n\n\nNvidia is set to hold an online event on Tuesday where it is widely expected to reveal its 3000-series Ampere GPUs.

For many Chromebook users, GeForce NOW presents a better version of what Stadia promises: solid streaming games, a vast library (including many titles you may already own), a massive existing player base (these are PC games, after all), and a fantastic overall user experience in the web player.\nWe already put some thoughts together about how well this all works on Chromebooks, but our testing was admittedly on higher-end hardware.  I\u2019ve played on the Acer Chromebook 713, the HP Pro c640 Chromebook, and the Lenovo Flex 5 before this morning.  We were made aware of a minimum requirements page that NVIDIA has put up concerning GeForce NOW on Chromebooks and what sort of hardware users need to take advantage of it.  I was immediately dubious.  To their credit, the page states:\nXremove ads\n\n\nWe expect GeForce Now to work well across a broad set of Chromebooks and are in the process of testing. Based on preliminary testing with the devices listed at the bottom of this page, please find our recommendations below. We will continue to evolve our recommendations as we test our service on more Chromebooks.\nTheir testing only covers 10 Chromebook models and they go a step further to lay out the baseline of device that they recommend for playing games on GeForce NOW. At the bottom of the system \u2018requirements\u2019 sits Intel Core M and Celeron processors with at least 4GB of RAM. NVIDIA states that \u201cyou may experience stuttering or high latency on some systems\u201d when it comes to these processors. As a streaming service that does all the work in the cloud on powerful servers, I wasn\u2019t sure what difference it made when talking about processors in Chromebooks. As long as the device has enough steam to stream full HD content, I figured that was enough.\nLow power Chromebooks tested\nSo, as we do around here, we tested some things.  As one of the most popular devices around right now, the Lenovo Duet was a perfect starting point.  The system requirements page from NVIDIA states that ARM-based Chromebooks are not recommended at all.  They go as far as saying \u201cwe do not recommend ARM based Chromebooks.\u00a0 You may experience stuttering and high latency.\u201d Challenge accepted.\nFeatured Videos\n \n\nXremove ads\n\n\nAs expected, the Duet handled Fortnite just fine and I even played a few matches while I was in there.  I then moved on to far more inferior hardware in the ASUS Chromebook C223 (Celeron N3350 + 4GB RAM) and the AOPEN Chromebase (Rockchip RK3388 + 4GB RAM) and loaded up Fortnite on those screens.  And you know what?  It was perfect, too.  No hesitation, to stutters, no problems.  I played a few matches on each to get a better feel for what longer play sessions would feel like, and there was no discernible difference between GeForce NOW on a $600 Chromebook and on a $200 one.  \nFrom what we can tell at this moment, if your Chromebook is up to date, it will probably work with GeForce NOW quite well.  You do need the latest version of Chrome and I\u2019d wager that 4GB of RAM helps, but we also tested on the ASUS Chromebit with its meager RK3388 processor and 2GB of RAM and everything was crazy-smooth there as well.  As it turns out, these low-end Chrome OS devices struggle more with loading NVIDIA\u2019s website then they do with the actual game play.\nI would recommend shutting other resource-heavy tabs and apps down in the background while you play, however.  A bunch of updates or random Android apps that may be taking your precious bandwidth won\u2019t help anything, here, so it\u2019s best to stream with as clean of a setup as you can muster.  With a solid connection (NVIDIA says 15MB/s will get you HD gameplay) to your router and an updated Chromebook, you should be up and running, playing games in a far-better environment than a cheap Chromebook deserves to be.  Our next test?  LTE.  Stay tuned.\nXremove ads\n\n\nSign Up for GeForce NOW\n\nJoin Chrome Unboxed Plus\nIntroducing Chrome Unboxed Plus \u2013 our revamped membership community.

The information consists of specifications of all cards based on the next-gen Ampere GPU architecture.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, RTX 3080, RTX 3070 To Be Unveiled on 1st September - 7nm, Up To 350W TGP on Flagship & 19.5 Gbps GDDR6X Speeds\nAccording to the leak, NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3090, Geforce RTX 3080, and GeForce RTX 3070 trio will be announced on the 1st of September during the GeForce digital event. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 and GeForce RTX 3080 will be the first to hit retail with a hard launch planned for mid of September.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSThe most interesting details that come aside from the specifications is the feature set that these new cards will support. For starter, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series cards will feature the 2nd Generation Ray Tracing cores (1st Gen featured on Turing) and the 3rd Generation Tensor Cores (1st Gen on Volta & 2nd Gen on Turing). The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series cards will support the HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4a connectors for display output and additionally come with a brand new NVLINK connector.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ampere Gaming Graphics Card Render. (Image Credits: Reddit u/dertpert88)\nThere's also a confirmation that the NVIDIA Ampere GeForce RTX 30 series will be utilizing a 7nm process node. It is not known whether we are looking at TSMC's 7nm processor Samsung 7nm EUV which began mass production in Q1 2020. Also, one thing to note is that the clock speeds reported within the specifications are based on custom variants and not the Founders Edition cards that will set the reference specifications.\n\nHello34.5B\n\u2014 Elysian Realm (@KittyYYuko) August 28, 2020\n\nIn a recent tweet, leaker KatCorgi (@KittyYYuko) posted what seems to be the transistor count of the Ampere GA102 GPU. The transistor count for the chip is said to be 34.5 Billion which is almost twice the transistor count of NVIDIA's previous gaming flagship GPU, the TU102 (18.6 Billion).\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 - The Fastest Ampere Gaming Graphics Card\nAccording to leaked details, the GeForce RTX 3090\u00a0 will feature the GA102-300-A1 GPU. The GA102-300-A1 GPU is said to be comprised of 5248 CUDA cores or 82 SMs. In total, that's a 20% increase in cores over the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. No details such as clock speeds, TMU/ROP counts are provided and we can't take the Ampere A100 die as a reference since gaming & HPC parts share a different configuration hierarchy. The GA102-300 GPU is going to clock up to a boost frequency of 1695 MHz.\n\nMoving on to the memory side, things start to look interesting as it is stated that the card will get up to 24 GB memory with faster GDDR6X pin speeds of 19.5 Gbps. Since that's a 384-bit bus we are looking at, it will be able to offer nearly 1 TB/s bandwidth. The GeForce RTX 3090 is going to come with a total graphics power of 350W (TGP). As per recent leaks, the GeForce RTX 3090 is expected to cost $1399 US.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 - GA102 For High-End Gaming\nMoving on to the GeForce RTX 3080, the rumor reports that the card will be featuring the GA102-200-KD-A1 SKU. This cut down SKU will feature the same 4352 CUDA cores as the RTX 2080 Ti that will be arranged in a total of 68 SMs. The GPU will feature a maximum clock speed of 1710 MHz.\nThe card is reportedly going to feature up to 10 GB of memory that is also going to be GDDR6X but there are several vendors who will be offering the card with a massive 20 GB frame buffer but at higher prices. Since the memory is running at 19 Gbps across a 320-bit bus interface, we can expect a bandwidth of up to 760 GB/s.\n\nThe card is reportedly going to feature up to 10 GB of memory that is also going to be GDDR6X but there are several vendors who will be offering the card with a massive 20 GB frame buffer but at higher prices. Since the memory is running at 19 Gbps across a 320-bit bus interface, we can expect a bandwidth of up to 760 GB/s.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 - Sweet-Spot Gaming Ampere For The Masses\nThe switch to GA102 from TU104 on the RTX 2080 is definitely an interesting one. A high-end SKU would also result in higher wattage and thermals but I believe this could be done to raise the bar up on the sub $500 segment which should comprise of GA104 based RTX 3070 and RTX 3060.\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 will as such feature the Ampere GA104-300 GPU. The specifications are hinted at around 2944-3072, the same as the existing RTX 2080 (SUPER) cards. The core specs are not known but the graphics card is said to feature a 220W TGP and 8 GB of GDDR6 memory with up to 16 Gbps speeds. This would give the card 512 GB/s of bandwidth.\nThe latest performance leaks also show a considerable performance improvement over the RTX 2080 and even the RTX 2080 Ti in synthetic benchmarks. If the same could translate over to the gaming performance, then Ampere does look like a super enticing product for gamers who have waited for almost 2 years now.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 \"Ampere' Graphics Card Rumored Lineup:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameGPU NameCUDA Cores / SMsMemory CapacityMemory BusBandwidthTDPLaunch Timeframe\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX RTX 3090Ampere GA102-30010496 (82)24 GB GDDR6X384-bit936 Gbps (19.5 Gbps)350WSeptember 2020\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti/SUPER?Ampere GA102-250?TBD20 GB GDDR6X320-bitTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080Ampere GA102-2008704 (68)10 GB GDDR6X320-bit760 Gbps (19 Gbps)320WSeptember 2020\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti/SUPER?Ampere GA104-400?6144 (48)?16 GB GDDR6X256-bitTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070Ampere GA104-3005888 (46)8 GB GDDR6256-bit512 Gbps (16 Gbps)220WOctober 2020\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti/SUPER?Ampere GA104-200?4864 (38)?8 GB GDDR6?256-bit?TBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060Ampere GA106-300?TBD6 GB GDDR6?192-bit?TBDTBDNovember 2020?\n\n\n\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 'Ampere' Gaming graphics card lineup is expected to be announced on 1st September at a digital event which will be hosted by CEO of NVIDIA, Jensen Huang. We expect at the very least, three new graphics cards during the event which include the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (or RTX 3090), GeForce RTX 3080, and a next-generation Titan.

Since 2017, it\u2019s been improved by researchers using AI at the Frontier Development Lab, in partnership with NASA and the SETI Institute.\nThe project uses AI to identify whether a point of light moving in the night sky is a bird, plane, satellite or, in fact, a meteor. The CAMS network consists of cameras that take pictures of the sky, at a rate of 60 frames per second.\nThe AI pipeline also verifies the findings to confirm the direction from which meteoroids, small pieces of comets that cause meteors, approach the Earth. The project\u2019s AI model training is optimized on NVIDIA TITAN GPUs housed at the SETI Institute.\nEach night\u2019s meteor sightings are then mapped onto the NASA meteor shower portal, a visualization tool available to the public. All meteor showers identified since 2010 are available on the portal.\nCAMS detected two new meteor showers in mid-May, called the gamma Piscis Austrinids and the sigma Phoenicids. They were added to the International Astronomical Union\u2019s meteor data center, which has recorded 1,041 unique meteor showers to date.\nAnalysis found both showers to be caused by meteoroids from long-period comets, which take more than 200 years to complete an orbit around the sun.\nImproving the Meteor Classification Process\nPeter Jenniskens, principal investigator for CAMS, has been classifying meteors since he founded the project in 2010. Before having access to NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs, Jenniskens would look at the images these cameras collected and judge by eye if a light curve from a surveyed object fit the categorization for a meteor.\nNow, the CAMS pipeline is entirely automated, from the transferring of data from an observatory to the SETI Institute\u2019s server, to analyzing the findings and displaying them on the online portal on a nightly basis.\nWith the help of AI, researchers have been able to expand the project and focus on its real-world impact, said Siddha Ganju, a solutions architect at NVIDIA and member of FDL\u2019s AI technical steering committee who worked on the CAMS project.\n\u201cThe goal of studying space is to figure out the unknowns of the unknowns,\u201d said Ganju. \u201cWe want to know what we aren\u2019t yet able to know. Access to data, instruments and computational power is the holy trifecta available today to make discoveries that would\u2019ve been impossible 50 years ago.\u201d\nPublic excitement around the CAMS network has spurred it to expand the number of cameras fourfold since the project began incorporating AI in 2017. With stations all over the world, from Namibia to the Netherlands, the project now hunts for one-hour long meteor showers, which are only visible in a small part of the world at a given time.\nApplying the Information Gathered\nThe AI model, upon identifying a meteor, calculates the direction it\u2019s coming from. According to Jenniskens, meteors come in groups, called meteoroid streams, which are mostly caused by comets. A comet can approach from as far as Jupiter or Saturn, he said, and when it\u2019s that far away, it\u2019s impossible to see until it comes closer to Earth.\nThe project\u2019s goal is to enable astronomers to look along the path of an approaching comet and provide enough time to figure out the potential impact it may have on Earth.\n\nMapping out all discoverable meteor showers brings us a step closer to figuring out what the entire solar system looks like, said Ganju, which is crucial to identifying the potential dangers of comets.\nBut this map, NASA\u2019s meteor shower portal, isn\u2019t just for professional use. The visualization tool was made available online with the goal of \u201cdemocratizing science for citizens and fostering interest in the project,\u201d according to Ganju. Anyone can use it to find out what meteor showers are visible each night.\nCheck out a timeline of notable CAMS discoveries.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Data Science | Machine Learning | Science \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Riyaz\n\n22 August 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July Bloomberg reported that Nvidia\u2019s market cap - driven up by the high demand for graphics chips in data centres and other new-age technologies \u2013 had eclipsed Intel\u2019s for the first time. The semiconductor market has seen significant changes in recent years. Focus has shifted to specialised chips, which possess higher performance and efficiency, to serve cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) demands. It is an area in which Nvidia is showing early strength. Now the company could further capitalise on the opportunity with rumours of a potential tie-up with Arm, which is currently wholly-owned by Japan\u2019s SoftBank.GPU and CPU deal (Nvidia \u2013 Arm)Nvidia is a prominent data centre player with its graphics processing unit (GPU) technology stack in the AI training market, where it faces competition from Intel, AMD and others. Beyond data centres it is also a leading player within the gaming market. The missing pieces within Nvidia\u2019s portfolio are smartphone, wearables and internet of things (IoT) technologies.The acquisition of Arm, should it materialise, would help Nvidia to diversify and scale up its business. It would also be the biggest-ever semiconductor deal.Arm would be the stepping stone to fill the gaps in Nvidia\u2019s portfolio, while also contributing to the company\u2019s current strategy of becoming the world\u2019s leader in data centres. The American computer game company has been busy building up its cloud ecosystem in the past year with a trail of acquisitions. In April it completed its purchase of Mellanox Technologies for $7 billion, as well as signing deals with SwiftStack and Cumulus.Arm\u2019s value as an acquisition target Arm specialises in designing chips and it licenses these to manufacturers. Nvidia, for example, license an Arm design for its Tegra CPUs. Arm\u2019s designs power over 95% of the world\u2019s smartphone market and its IP is also critical for PCs, data centres and IoT devices. It is certainly an industry heavyweight, with the likes of Apple, Qualcomm, Huawei and Samsung as clients.The semiconductor company\u2019s primary business is in licensing its IP. Since it was acquired by SoftBank in 2016 it has been investing heavily in developing AI, computer vision and augmented reality technologies to create alternate revenue streams in adjacent markets. It further moved into the cloud and software markets via the acquisition of Treasure Data in 2018 and also created a presence in autonomous driving through a collaboration with Toyota.Nvidia and Arm together would create a processor powerhouse Nvidia has a lot to gain from Arm. It stands to benefit from adding the company\u2019s licensing and royalty business to its portfolio. Nvidia\u2019s Tegra CPUs generated about 13% of its revenue in 2019 and the deal could bump its margins higher as it will no longer have to pay royalties. Nvidia also licenses Arm\u2019s core for its autonomous driving which, post-acquisition, would give it direct access to \u2013 and bolster capabilities in \u2013 this key business segment.The tie-up would also help Nvidia make further inroads beyond GPU backed data centres, an area in which Intel is the current leader. Last year Nvidia extended its support to Arm-based processors with a new reference architecture and ecosystem with GPU acceleration support. It also made its CUDA-X libraries, GPU-accelerated AI frameworks and software development kits (SDKs) available to Arm developers such as Ampere, Fujitsu and Marvell. This investment would give Nvidia more choice, an open platform and energy efficient systems for its end customers.The graph below shows that Arm\u2019s patent strength in memory management and low power utilisation coupled with Nvidia\u2019s leadership in image processing and visual computing would create a processor powerhouse.The IP portfolios complement each other (CPU and GPU)Source: Dolcera PCSAs more processes move to the cloud/edge computing, data analysis and the use of AI and machine learning (ML) are increasingly being used for real-time analysis. As such, many companies have turned their focus to AI and ML for data centres. Arm and Nvidia are not absent from this shift. When Arm came under SoftBank\u2019s wing there was an uptick in the filing of patents within the AI and ML domain. Nvidia started filing patents in these areas recently and while its output is greater than Arm\u2019s it still lags behind other industry players (see graphs below). \u00a0Arm: AI and machine learning patent filing trendSource: Dolcera PCS Nvidia: AI and machine learning patent filing trendSource: Dolcera PCS Key AI/ML areas where Nvidia and Arm are filing patentsSource: Dolcera PCSPatent filings for technologies relating to AI and ML for data centres Source: Dolcera PCS In terms of patent volume, Nvidia is not the top dog. But, with Arm on board it would have access to all the key players in the ecosystem since the company licenses its IP to nearly everyone in this domain (including Qualcomm, Samsung, TSMC, Apple, Huawei and Fujitsu).Arm\u2019s position in the market makes its IP licensing revenue highly lucrative \u2013 and highly coveted. In the past, Nvidia has tried to create its own licensing model for its chips, but it was not very successful. An existing model from Arm would mean that it could include its own portfolio, as well as go ahead and create a new generation of processors to compete with others, while also licensing the technologies that it creates through the existing ecosystem.The hurdlesThe deal would be bound to ruffle some feathers. The competition would intensify if Nvidia had direct control over the IP that companies across the ecosystem require - especially with major players like Qualcomm, Apple, Huawei, NXP, and ST Micro all having licensed from Arm over the years.This may trigger competitors to seek an alternative, such as RISC-V, an open source organisation which assists in developing IP except for the cores (the instructions and ecosystem). RISC-V has been making headway in the industry and is leveraged by large players including Nvidia.This option seems likely unless Nvidia can convince the players in the ecosystem that it can emulate the Qualcomm business model. In this scenario it would have a separate technology licensing business where it licenses its technology to its competitors in the very market in which it competes.Other things that could get in the way of a deal are geopolitical issues and regulatory hurdles. The latter would take a few years to clear. The ongoing tensions between the US and China also has further potential to stall an agreement, as it did previously with the Qualcomm-NXP deal.The road aheadWhile it might be a great deal for Nvidia, the acquisition of Arm would not be smooth sailing. SoftBank is experiencing tough times owing to a string of investments that have negatively impacted profits (ie, WeWork, Uber, OneWeb). A deal of such scale is likely to help SoftBank secure significant cash, more than what it invested in Arm in 2016 ($32 billion).\u00a0Given the current dicey grounds, it has two other options to look at apart from a complete sale to Nvidia:The first is to proceed with an early IPO where Arm remains independent and all players are satisfied.The second is to give other interested parties a stake in Arm, so that each player has a say in influencing the direction of the architecture that they intend to have. \u00a0It\u2019s too early to predict which way this deal is going to swing. Even if SoftBank does make a complete sale to Nvidia - or any other player \u2013 it is going to meet significant regulatory hurdles and geopolitical standoffs. But should it materialise, it will be a critical moment in Nvidia\u2019s patent history.\n\n\n\nRelated Topics\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nAsia-Pacific\nAutomotive\nChemicals\nChina\nComputers & Software\nEurope\nFujitsu\nHuawei\nIntel\nInternet\nInternet of Things\nJapan\nLicensing\nMarket developments\nMobile Communications\nNorth America\nNvidia\nPatents\nQualcomm\nSamsung\nSemiconductors\nStrategy\nTelecommunications\nToyota\nTransactions\nUber\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States of America\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS Rajan Kumar\nLead technical analysis\nDolcera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSumair Riyaz\nLead business development\nDolcera\n\n\n\n\nView full biography\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Law Business ResearchCompany Number: 03281866 VAT: GB 160 7529 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\nNovo Nordisk sues Mylan as part of wave of ANDA suits over blockbuster semaglutide products\n\n\nHalozyme targets world\u2019s best-selling drug to expand successful licensing efforts\n\n\nEducating companies on trade secret protection more vital than ever amid growing threat of leaks\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet more from IAM\nSign up to our daily email\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost read\n\n\nAI-driven innovation on the rise as patent analytics reveal unprecedented growth and new players\n\n\nNatera damages blow; Ozempic patent gold rush; H&M IP strategy; Tesla loses Avanci 5G appeal; International Women\u2019s Day; plus much more\n\n\nMadras High Court at odds with Indian Patent Office over prosecution process following Signal Pharmaceuticals application refusal\n\n\nExclusive: Lenovo seeking ETSI intervention in Ericsson cellular patent spat\n\n\nEricsson declared unwilling by English Court of Appeal after refusing Lenovo short-term licence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Insight\n\n\nChina: Trade secrets \u2013 policy and latest developments\n\nFeatured in \nTrade Secrets Hub 2025\n\n\n\nUnited States: Trade secrets \u2013 policy and latest developments\n\nFeatured in \nTrade Secrets Hub 2025\n\n\n\nSpecialist chapter: Trends emerging from UPC indicate growing divergence from EPO practices\n\nFeatured in \nThe Patent Prosecution Review 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlock unlimited access to all IAM content\n\n\nSubscribe Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\nWho we are\n\n\nContact\n\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n\nCode of ethics\n\n\nTerms & conditions\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nIAM Market\n\n\nIP Hall of Fame\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews & Analysis\n\n\nAll News & Analysis\n\n\nLong Reads\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData & Reports\n\n\nSpecial Reports\n\n\nPanel Reports\n\n\nData Analysis\n\n\nData Hub\n\n\nUPC Library\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRankings\n\n\nPatent 1000\n\n\nIAM Global Leaders\n\n\nStrategy 300\n\n\nStrategy 300 Global Leaders\n\n\nPatent 1000 Analytics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight\n\n\nGuides\n\n\nReviews\n\n\nMarket Insight\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany Number: 03281866 VAT: GB 160 7529 10\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Law Business Research\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Terms and conditions\n                        \n\n\n\n                            Privacy Policy\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We\u2019ve been gaining valuable experience and having a lot of fun \u2014 all through our screens.\nFellow interns have contributed ideas to teams ranging from robotics to financial reporting. I\u2019ve been writing stories on how cutting-edge tech improves industries from healthcare to animation, learning to work the backend of the company newsroom, and fostering close relationships with some fabulous colleagues.\nAnd did I mention fun? Game show and cook-along events, a well-being panel series and gatherings such as book clubs were part of the programming. We also had several swag bags sent to our doorsteps, which included a customized intern company sweatshirt and an NVIDIA SHIELD TV.\nMeet a few other interns who joined the NVIDIA family this year:\nAmevor Aids Artists by Using Deep Learning\nChristoph Amevor just graduated with a bachelor\u2019s in computational sciences and engineering from ETH Zurich in Switzerland.\nAt NVIDIA, he\u2019s working on a variety of deep learning projects including one to simplify the workflow of artists and creators using NVIDIA Omniverse, a real-time simulation platform for 3D production pipelines.\n\u201cMachine learning is such a powerful tool, and I\u2019ve been interested in seeing how it can help us solve problems that are simply too complex to tackle with analytic math,\u201d Amevor said.\nHe lives with another NVIDIA intern, which he said has made working from home feel like a mini company location.\nSantos Shows Robots the Ropes\nBeatriz Santos is an undergrad at California State University, East Bay, studying computer science. She\u2019s a software intern working on the Isaac platform for robotics.\nThough the pandemic has forced her to social distance from other humans, Santos has been spending a lot of time with the robot Kaya, in simulation, training it to do various tasks.\nHer favorite virtual event this summer was the women\u2019s community panel featuring female leaders at NVIDIA.\n\u201cI loved their inputs on working in a historically male-dominated field, and how they said we don\u2019t have to change because of that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can just be ourselves, be girls.\u201d\nSindelar Sharpens Websites\nWhen researching potential summer internships, Justin Sindelar \u2014 a marketing major at San Jose State University \u2014 was immediately drawn to NVIDIA\u2019s.\n\u201cThe NVIDIA I once knew as a consumer graphics card company has grown into a multifaceted powerhouse that serves several high-tech industries and has contributed to the proliferation of AI,\u201d he said.\nUsing the skills he\u2019s learned at school and as a web designer, Sindelar has been performing UX analyses to help improve NVIDIA websites and their accessibility features.\nHis favorite intern activity was the game show event where he teamed up with his manager and mentors in the digital marketing group to answer trivia questions and fill in movie quotes.\nZhang Zaps Apps Into Shape\nMaggie Zhang is a third-year biomedical engineering student at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. She works on the hardware infrastructure team to make software applications that improve workflow for hardware engineers.\nWhen not coding or testing a program, she\u2019s enjoyed online coffee chats, where she formed an especially tight bond with other Canadian interns.\nShe also highlighted how thankful she is for her team lead and mentor, who set up frequent one-on-one check-ins and taught her new concepts to improve code and make programs more manageable.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve taught me to be brave, experiment and learn as I go,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about what you learn than what you already know.\u201d\nFor many interns, this fulfilling and challenging summer will lead to future roles at NVIDIA.\nLearn more about NVIDIA\u2019s internship program.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | NVIDIA LifeTags: Education \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(Image via Reddit User u/dertpert88)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards that include the GeForce RTX 3090 & GeForce RTX 3080 which are based on the new Ampere architecture are launching next week and the memory specifications of these cards have been confirmed by Videocardz.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Flagship Gets 24 GB GDDR6X Memory, RTX 3080 Gets 10 GB GDDR6X\nThere have been several rumors regarding the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series memory specs. Now it looks like the flagship GeForce RTX 3090 will be placed in a purely ultra-enthusiast position when compared to the rest of the lineup.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSAccording to Videocardz, the information comes straight from an AIB which has confirmed to them that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 would feature 24 GB of GDDR6X memory while the GeForce RTX 3080 would feature 10 GB of GDDR6X memory. There's a huge difference between the RTX 3090 & the RTX 3080 when it comes to memory capacity but that's what the Founders Editon cards will end up holding.\n\nThere has been a rumor that AIBs might prepare the GeForce RTX 3080 variants with twice GDDR6X memory capacities. That would give the GeForce RTX 3080 a total of 20 GB VRAM but we cannot say for sure whether that rumor is true or not. It is possible that a SUPER refresh later next year would feature double the memory but that remains to be seen as the main focus is on the cards that are getting announced next week.\nVideocardz has also mentioned that the GeForce RTX 3070 is also expected to be announced at the event. The pricing and general specifications of the cards will be provided however more detailed & technical aspects of the cards such as performance, thermals and power numbers will be provided later on when reviews hit the web.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 - The Fastest Ampere Gaming Graphics Card\nAccording to leaked details, the GeForce RTX 3090\u00a0 will feature the GA102-300-A1 GPU. The GA102-300-A1 GPU is said to be comprised of 5248 CUDA cores or 82 SMs. In total, that's a 20% increase in cores over the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. No details such as clock speeds, TMU/ROP counts are provided and we can't take the Ampere A100 die as a reference since gaming & HPC parts share a different configuration hierarchy.\n\nMoving on to the memory side, things start to look interesting as it is stated that the card will get up to 24 GB memory with faster GDDR6X pin speeds. Since that's a 384-bit bus we are looking at, it will be able to offer nearly 1 TB/s bandwidth.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 - GA102 For High-End Gaming\nMoving on to the GeForce RTX 3080, the rumor reports that the card will be featuring the GA102-200-KD-A1 SKU. This cut down SKU will feature the same 4352 CUDA cores as the RTX 2080 Ti that will be arranged in a total of 68 SMs. The card is reportedly going to feature up to 10 GB of memory that is also going to be GDDR6X. Assuming the memory is running at 19 Gbps across a 320-bit bus interface, we can expect a bandwidth of up to 760 GB/s.\n\nThe switch to GA102 from TU104 on the RTX 2080 is definitely an interesting one. A high-end SKU would also result in higher wattage and thermals but I believe this could be done to raise the bar up on the sub $500 segment which should comprise of GA104 based RTX 3070 and RTX 3060. The latest performance leaks also show a considerable performance improvement over the RTX 2080 and even the RTX 2080 Ti in synthetic benchmarks. If the same could translate over to the gaming performance, then Ampere does look like a super enticing product for gamers who have waited for almost 2 years now.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 \"Ampere' Graphics Card Rumored Lineup:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameGPU NameCUDA Cores / SMsMemory CapacityMemory BusBandwidthTDPLaunch Timeframe\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX RTX 3090Ampere GA102-30010496 (82)24 GB GDDR6X384-bit936 Gbps (19.5 Gbps)350WSeptember 2020\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti/SUPER?Ampere GA102-250?TBD20 GB GDDR6X320-bitTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080Ampere GA102-2008704 (68)10 GB GDDR6X320-bit760 Gbps (19 Gbps)320WSeptember 2020\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti/SUPER?Ampere GA104-400?6144 (48)?16 GB GDDR6X256-bitTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070Ampere GA104-3005888 (46)8 GB GDDR6256-bit512 Gbps (16 Gbps)220WOctober 2020\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti/SUPER?Ampere GA104-200?4864 (38)?8 GB GDDR6?256-bit?TBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060Ampere GA106-300?TBD6 GB GDDR6?192-bit?TBDTBDNovember 2020?\n\n\n\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 'Ampere' Gaming graphics card lineup is expected to be announced on 1st September at a digital event which will be hosted by CEO of NVIDIA, Jensen Huang. We expect at the very least, three new graphics cards during the event which include the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (or RTX 3090), GeForce RTX 3080, and a next-generation Titan. There's definitely a lot more to talk about regarding the Ampere GPUs but we will have to wait until more information comes our way.\nNVIDIA GeForce #UltimateCountdownCountdown\n\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA GeForce 'Ampere' GPU are you waiting for the most?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n160\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The next-generation Ampere based graphics cards will be announced this week in several custom and Founders Edition variants with impressive cooling solutions. The new custom designs which have been pictured are from ASUS and Gainward.\nASUS & Gainward's Custom NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 & GeForce RTX 3080 Graphics Cards Leak Out\nStarting with the ASUS graphics card, the GeForce RTX 3090 ROG STRIX Gaming graphics card has been leaked by Videocardz and features the same shroud design that leaked back in July. Back then, the card featured the 'RTX 3080 Ti' branding but that has changed as the specific SKU isn't planned for the Ampere GeForce RTX 30 series lineup, at least initially. As for the design of the card, the ASUS ROG STRIX GeForce RTX 3090 looks rather impressive with a more aggressive look that comes with three axial-tech based fans and a massive heatsink underneath the shroud.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nThe front of the custom card has a dual-tone design with frames that seem to be made out of aluminum extending out & giving the card a more premium feel which looks similar to ASUS's Poseidon series offerings. The heatsink underneath is made up of a large aluminum fin stack that makes use of at least 6 heat pipes. The card seems to fall in the 2.7 slot tier and has extra width to it for the extended PCB to make way for all the custom electrical components that the board will feature.\nASUS may also be investing in some cool features such as an OLED display and we can see the addition of a large LED panel on the side of the card. There are no additional details such as the specifications or the launch date of the card but we are hoping to learn them soon enough if the cards are already getting custom designs built around them this early. The ASUS ROG STRIX RTX 30 series graphics cards will be unveiled tomorrow but expect sales to begin around mid or later in September.\nGainward GeForce RTX 3090 & RTX 3080 Cards Leak Out Again\nMeanwhile, Gainward's GeForce RTX 3090 and GeForce RTX 3080 Phoenix graphics cards have leaked out once again but this time by the manufacturer themselves. The Gainward GeForce RTX 30 series high-end lineup will feature the Phoenix 'Golden Sample' line of graphics cards, both of which feature a 2.7 slot design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe design of both cards is similar to each other as both feature the NVIDIA Ampere GA102 GPU. The cooler features a triple-fan design and a nice aluminum shroud which is illuminated by RGB LEDs. The card features a large GeForce RTX logo on the sides and also comes with an aluminum backplate that extends beyond the PCB.\nTalking about the PCB, it seems like the cards will make use of a very compact design that doesn't extend the full length of the cooler. The design is not similar to the reference Founders Edition PCB that we saw earlier but comes in a standard form factor. The GeForce RTX 3090 and GeForce RTX 3080 graphics cards will require dual 8-pin connectors to boot. From the looks of it, the RTX 3090 will feature next-generation NVLINK connectors while the GeForce RTX 3080 won't feature any such interface.\nGainward GeForce RTX 3090 & RTX 3080 Phoenix Graphics Cards (Image Credits: Videocardz Via @harukaze5719)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThis goes off to show that even with 350W TBP, the GeForce RTX 3090 will still have several custom variants that won't require the outrageous triple 8-pin connector configuration to boot. The triple 8 pin cards will, however, offer higher overclockability and faster clock speeds compared to the stock variants.\nGainward GeForce RTX 3090 & RTX 3080 Phoenix Graphics Cards Specs (Image Credits: Videocardz Via @harukaze5719)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 - The Fastest Ampere Gaming Graphics Card\nAccording to leaked details, the GeForce RTX 3090\u00a0 will feature the GA102-300-A1 GPU. The GA102-300-A1 GPU is said to be comprised of 5248 CUDA cores or 82 SMs. In total, that's a 20% increase in cores over the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. No details such as clock speeds, TMU/ROP counts are provided and we can't take the Ampere A100 die as a reference since gaming & HPC parts share a different configuration hierarchy. The GA102-300 GPU on the Gainward Phoneix GS model is going to clock up to a boost frequency of 1725 MHz while the standard model is going to clock in at 1695 MHz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nMoving on to the memory side, things start to look interesting as it is stated that the card will get up to 24 GB memory with faster GDDR6X pin speeds of 19.5 Gbps. Since that's a 384-bit bus we are looking at, it will be able to offer nearly 1 TB/s bandwidth. The GeForce RTX 3090 is going to come with a total graphics power of 350W (TGP). As per recent leaks, the GeForce RTX 3090 is expected to cost $1399 US.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 - GA102 For High-End Gaming\nMoving on to the GeForce RTX 3080, the rumor reports that the card will be featuring the GA102-200-KD-A1 SKU. This cut down SKU will feature the same 4352 CUDA cores as the RTX 2080 Ti that will be arranged in a total of 68 SMs. The Gainward Golden Sample will feature a maximum boost clock of 1740 MHz while the standard variant will feature a boost clock of 1710 MHz.\nThe card is reportedly going to feature up to 10 GB of memory that is also going to be GDDR6X but there are several vendors who will be offering the card with a massive 20 GB frame buffer but at higher prices. Since the memory is running at 19 Gbps across a 320-bit bus interface, we can expect a bandwidth of up to 760 GB/s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe latest performance leaks also show a considerable performance improvement over the RTX 2080 and even the RTX 2080 Ti in synthetic benchmarks. If the same could translate over to the gaming performance, then Ampere does look like a super enticing product for gamers who have waited for almost 2 years now.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere' Graphics Card Lineup:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA106-300?Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess Node7nm7nm7nm7nm\n\n\nSMs / CUDA CoresTBD2944 (46)?4352 (68)5248 (82)\n\n\nBoost ClockTBDTBD1710 MHz1695 MHz\n\n\nMemory Capacity6/12 GB GDDR6X8/16 GB GDDR610/20 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus192-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit\n\n\nBandwidth384 Gbps (16 Gbps)512 Gbps (16 Gbps)760 Gbps (19 Gbps)936 Gbps (19.5 Gbps)\n\n\nTDPTBD220W320W350W\n\n\nLaunch TimeframeNovember 2020October 2020September 2020September 2020\n\n\n\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 'Ampere' Gaming graphics card lineup is expected to be announced on 1st September at a digital event which will be hosted by CEO of NVIDIA, Jensen Huang. We expect at the very least, three new graphics cards during the event which include the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (or RTX 3090), GeForce RTX 3080, and a next-generation Titan. There's definitely a lot more to talk about regarding the Ampere GPUs but we will have to wait until more information comes our way.\nNVIDIA GeForce #UltimateCountdownCountdown\n\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA GeForce 'Ampere' GPU are you waiting for the most?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n160\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Tier featuring next generation NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs\u00a0on Google Cloud with record performance surpassing 8000 OctaneBench. This milestone was reached on a Google Cloud Accelerator-Optimized VM (A2) instance with 16 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Each A100 GPU offers up to 20x the compute performance compared to the previous generation processor.\nWith Google Cloud's NVIDIA A100 instances on OTOY's RNDR Enterprise Tier, artists can leverage OctaneRender's industry-leading, unbiased, spectrally correct, GPU-accelerated rendering for advanced visual effects, ultra-high resolution rendering, and immersive location-based entertainment formats. Benchmarked using OctaneRender 2020.1.4, Google Cloud instances bring thousands of secure, production-ready NVIDIA high-performance GPU clusters to the OctaneRender ecosystem - featuring both NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs (with up to 3000 OctaneBench) and NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs (with up to 8000 OctaneBench).\nThis fall, OctaneRender users will get early access to Google Cloud's new NVIDIA A100 GPU instances with 40GB VRAM, 8-way NVIDIA NVLink\u00ae\u00a0support and 1.6 TB/s memory bandwidth, delivering remarkable memory capacity for blazing-fast GPU render times for the most demanding memory-intensive scenes \u2013 which was previously only available with slower out-of-core or CPU rendering.\nAccording to OTOY Founder and CEO Jules Urbach, \"For nearly a decade we have been pushing the boundary of GPU rendering and cloud computing to get to the point where there are no longer constraints on artistic creativity. With Google Cloud's NVIDIA A100 instances featuring massive VRAM and the highest OctaneBench ever recorded, we have reached a first for GPU rendering - where artists no longer have to worry about scene complexity when realizing their creative visions.\"\nUrbach added, \"OctaneRender GPU-accelerated rendering democratized visual effects enabling anyone with an NVIDIA GPU to create high-end visual effects on par with a Hollywood studio. Google Cloud's NVIDIA A100 instances are a major step in further democratizing advanced visual effects, giving any OctaneRender users on-demand access to state of the art NVIDIA GPUs previously only available in the biggest Hollywood studios.\"\n\"Built on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU has come to the cloud faster than any NVIDIA GPU in history,\" says Bob Pette, vice president of professional visualization at NVIDIA. \"Its record-breaking performance will open creative possibilities for artists and designers who use OctaneRender to produce their leading-edge work.\"\n\"Google Cloud Accelerator-Optimized VM (A2) instances\u00a0are one of the only places with 16 GPUs connected via NVLink topology, enabling artists to push creative boundaries without sacrificing speed or performance. Bringing A2 instances to RNDR\u00a0is a game changer for ultra-high resolution production, machine learning augmented rendering workflows, and next generation immersive media formats,\" said Manish Sainani, Director, Product Management, ML Infrastructure, Google Cloud.\nIntroduced earlier this year along with OctaneRender 2020, the RNDR Network allows artists to choose between rendering jobs on secure Enterprise Tier GPUs like Google Cloud's NVIDIA instances or leverage the massive processing power available on a network of decentralized GPUs.\u00a0Artists processing renders on the RNDR Enterprise tier can also use decentralized GPUs for overflow capacity, providing the flexibility to scale renders across thousands of peer-to-peer nodes when on a deadline or for ultra-high resolution formats.\nThe RNDR Enterprise tier on Google Cloud is available for users of all OctaneRender integrated plugins across 20 of the industry's leading content creation tools \u2013 including Maxon Cinema 4D, SideFX Houdini and Autodesk Maya.

Leaked out by twitter user @GarnetSunset, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 is going to be the flagship offering in the Ampere gaming graphics card lineup and features a massive cooling design.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Flagship Ampere Gaming Graphics Card Pictured In All Its Glory\nThe leak shows NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3090 sitting right next to the GeForce RTX 2080. Just looking at the card, the GeForce RTX 3090 looks insanely huge and supports a triple slot form factor. This leak not only confirms the earlier leaked heatsinks and cooling shroud but also confirms several reports that had stated that NVIDIA is going all out with its Founders Edition design on the higher end Ampere GPU based graphics cards such as the GeForce RTX 3090.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nJust looking at the card itself, the GeForce RTX 3090 seems to be the first reference graphics card to come in such a massive shape and size. It's a triple-slot behemoth with dual axial-tech fans placed on the front and back in a push-and-pull configuration. The front of the card seems to feature the exposed heatsink blocks with several fins placed on top of the PCB. There's the aluminum bar that helps reinforce the shroud and even features a small NVIDIA logo etched on to the metal frame.\nThe backside of the card features a backplate with a matte black color and the same aluminum bar that reinforces the shroud. Since the card features GDDR6X memory on the backside too as seen on a custom PCB, it makes sense to include a fan on the back to keep the thermals under check at both sides.\nThe name of the card has been blurred out and from the looks of it, the card is still in an early test phase given the 'Config 1' marking on the PCIe slot. \u00a0The Founders Edition design is also expected to\u00a0feature over 20 power chokes\u00a0which put it is a more premium design than the flagship non-reference RTX 20 series cards.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 leaked coolers feature a 2-slot design and a smaller design footprint than the 3-slot GeForce RTX 3090 flagship.\nFor comparison sakes, the leaked NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition from a few months back featured a standard 2-slot design so the 3-slot design seems to be exclusive to the GeForce RTX 3090.\nThe leaker has also mentioned a price of $1400 US for the Founders Edition graphics card which is close to the rumors we heard last week. The previous rumors had stated that the pricing of the RTX 3090 starts at $1399 US while the Founders Edition would cost an extra $100 US for $1499 US. This remains to be confirmed but either way, the card would be slightly more expensive than the RTX 2080 Ti, based purely on the rumors.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 - The Fastest Ampere Gaming Graphics Card\nAccording to leaked details, the GeForce RTX 3090\u00a0 will feature the GA102-300-A1 GPU. The GA102-300-A1 GPU is said to be comprised of 5248 CUDA cores or 82 SMs. In total, that's a 20% increase in cores over the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. No details such as clock speeds, TMU/ROP counts are provided and we can't take the Ampere A100 die as a reference since gaming & HPC parts share a different configuration hierarchy.\n\nMoving on to the memory side, things start to look interesting as it is stated that the card will get up to 24 GB memory with faster GDDR6X pin speeds. Since that's a 384-bit bus we are looking at, it will be able to offer nearly 1 TB/s bandwidth.\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 'Ampere' Gaming graphics card lineup is expected to be announced on 1st September at a digital event which will be hosted by CEO of NVIDIA, Jensen Huang. We expect at the very least, three new graphics cards during the event which include the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (or RTX 3090), GeForce RTX 3080, and a next-generation Titan. There's definitely a lot more to talk about regarding the Ampere GPUs but we will have to wait until more information comes our way.\nNVIDIA GeForce #UltimateCountdownCountdown\n\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA GeForce 'Ampere' GPU are you waiting for the most?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n184\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n103\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n70\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n39\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nA Mac Studio Cluster Of Four Units, All Featuring Apple\u2019s Latest M3 Ultra, Consume Less Than Half The Power Of A Network Switch When Running At Idle\n\n\n\n31\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n857\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

With this, Blaize said it can provide up to 60 times better system-level efficiency over GPUs and CPUs for edge AI applications while also enabling 50 times less memory bandwidth and 10 times lower latency. The architecture is also fully programmable and supports multi-threading and streaming.\nDinakar Munagala, Blaize\u2018s co-founder and CEO who previously worked on Intel\u2019s graphics microarchitecture for 12 years, said in a briefing that edge AI computing needs requires a different hardware approach from the architectural level because legacy solutions like CPUs and GPUs were initially built for different purposes.\nThere\u2018s also a strong need for architecture that addresses the edge\u2019s unique efficiency and latency requirements and can actually function as a real product working in the field, he added.\n\u201cThe advantage that we had was that we started with a clean sheet of paper and we built everything from the ground up \u2014 from the architecture, to chips, to boards and software tools \u2014 to make an efficient AI edge computer,\u201d Munagala said.\nBlaize\u2019s Xplorer lineup consists of two products. The first is the Xplorer X1600E, an EDSFF 1U \u201cruler\u201d form factor card that will cost $299 in volume orders and is designed to fit in industrial PCs and small 1U servers for small and power-constrained environments like convenience stores and industrial sites. The second is the Xplorer X1600P, a PCIe 3.0 accelerator card that costs $999 in volume and can \u201ceasily replace a power-hungry desktop GPU\u201d and provide 16 to 64 TOPs within an edge server.\nThe Pathfinder P1600 system-on-module, on the other hand, costs $399 in volume and is meant for sensor and network devices at the edge.\nRichard Terrill, Blaize\u2018s vice president of strategic business development, said the company plans to go to market with OEMs, system integrators, value-added resellers and independent software vendors, but details will be shared at a later date.\n\u201cWe\u2018re in extended negotiations with a full range of them,\u201d he said. \u201dOur goal is to make sure we have the proper infrastructure sales channel and logistics in place to support what we believe is going to be a very quick, very agile, very dynamic marketplace.\u201d\nKey to Blaize\u2018s efforts is its AI software suite, which consists of the Picasso software development kit and the no-code AI Studio visual interface for technical and non-technical users, respectively. Both tools use Blaize Netdeploy, which can improve accuracy and performance of algorithms at the edge.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The latest teaser confirms the design of the next-gen graphics cards which even in the form of a teaser looks seriously impressive.\nNVIDIA Teases Next-Gen GeForce RTX 30 Series Gaming Graphics Cards - Brand New Cooling & Power Delivery Showcased\nThe teaser shows us the first official look at the next-gen Founders Edition cards which were leaked months earlier. Not only that, but we also get some more information on the PCB and power layout incorporated by the GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB MemoryNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series Founders Edition Cooling\nNVIDIA has developed one of their best Founders Edition cooling design to date for the GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards. The Founders Edition cooling makes use of a full aluminum alloy heatsink with dual-sided axial-tech based fans. The cooler heatsink is coated with a nano-carbon coating and should do a really good job at keeping the temperatures in control.\n\nThe previously leaked shrouds and heatsinks indicate at least four massive heat pipes running through all 4 sets of heatsinks.\nThe design is interesting in the sense that not only does it goes all out with a fin and heat pipe design, the first design of its kind since the original Founders Edition launch back with NVTTM on the GeForce GTX 780, but it also comes with a unique fan placement, one on the front and one at the bottom. This push & pull fan configuration which as it is referred to is yet to be tested in the field on a graphics card but it's definitely one unique implementation.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series PCB & Power Design\nThe Founders Edition design is also expected to feature over 20 power chokes which put it is a more premium design than the flagship non-reference RTX 20 series cards. In addition to that, GeForce RTX 30 series Founders Edition cards will be featuring the 12-pin Micro-Fit 3.0 power connectors.\nThese connectors don't require a power supply upgrade as the cards will ship with bundled 2x 8-pin to 1x 12-pin connectors so you can run your latest graphics card without any compatibility issues.\n\nThe placement of the 12-pin connector on the PCB is also noteworthy. It is placed in a vertical position and judging by the PCB design, we can tell why NVIDIA moved to a single 12-pin plug instead of the standard dual 8-pin design.\nThe next-generation RTX cards come with a unique PCB design which is very compact compared to any previous flagship designs we've seen from NVIDIA. There's limited room on the PCB to do stuff and as such, it was necessary to go for a more small and compact power input.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 - The Fastest Ampere Gaming Graphics Card\nAccording to leaked details, the GeForce RTX 3090\u00a0 will feature the GA102-300-A1 GPU. The GA102-300-A1 GPU is said to be comprised of 5248 CUDA cores or 82 SMs. In total, that's a 20% increase in cores over the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. No details such as clock speeds, TMU/ROP counts are provided and we can't take the Ampere A100 die as a reference since gaming & HPC parts share a different configuration hierarchy.\n\nMoving on to the memory side, things start to look interesting as it is stated that the card will get up to 24 GB memory with faster GDDR6X pin speeds. Since that's a 384-bit bus we are looking at, it will be able to offer nearly 1 TB/s bandwidth.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 - GA102 For High-End Gaming\nMoving on to the GeForce RTX 3080, the rumor reports that the card will be featuring the GA102-200-KD-A1 SKU. This cut down SKU will feature the same 4352 CUDA cores as the RTX 2080 Ti that will be arranged in a total of 68 SMs. The card is reportedly going to feature up to 10 GB of memory that is also going to be GDDR6X. Assuming the memory is running at 19 Gbps across a 320-bit bus interface, we can expect a bandwidth of up to 760 GB/s.\n\nThe switch to GA102 from TU104 on the RTX 2080 is definitely an interesting one. A high-end SKU would also result in higher wattage and thermals but I believe this could be done to raise the bar up on the sub $500 segment which should comprise of GA104 based RTX 3070 and RTX 3060. The latest performance leaks also show a considerable performance improvement over the RTX 2080 and even the RTX 2080 Ti in synthetic benchmarks.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  As its evocative name suggests, Abyss Solutions is a company taking AI to places where humans can\u2019t \u2014 or shouldn\u2019t \u2014 go.\nThe brainchild of four University of Sydney scientists and engineers, six years ago the startup set out to improve the maintenance and observation of industrial equipment.\nIt began by developing advanced technology to inspect the most difficult to reach assets of urban water infrastructure systems, such as dams, reservoirs, canals, bridges and ship hulls. Later, it zeroed in on an industry that often operates literally in the dark: offshore oil and gas platforms.\nAbyss Solutions Lantern Eye output.\nA few years ago, Abyss CEO Nasir Ahsan and CTO Suchet Bargoti were demonstrating to a Houston-based platform operator the insights they could generate from the image data collected by its underwater Lantern Eye 3D camera. The camera\u2019s sub-millimeter accuracy provides a \u201cway to inspect objects as if you\u2019re taking them out of water,\u201d said Bargoti.\nAn employee of the operator interrupted the meeting to describe an ongoing problem the company was having with their topside equipment that was decaying and couldn\u2019t be repaired sufficiently. Once it was clear that Abyss could provide detailed insight into the problem and how to solve it, no more selling was needed.\n\u201cEvery one of these companies is dreading the next Deepwater Horizon,\u201d said Bargoti, referencing the 2010 incident in which BP spilled nearly 5 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, killing 11 people and countless wildlife, and costing the company $65 billion in cleanup costs and fines. \u201cWhat they wanted to know is, \u2018Will your data analytics help us understand what to fix and when to fix it?\u2019\u201d\nToday, Abyss\u2019s combination of NVIDIA GPU-powered deep learning algorithms, unmanned vehicles and innovative underwater cameras is enabling platform operators to spot faults and anomalies such as corrosion on equipment above and below the water and address it before it fails, potentially saving millions of dollars and even a few human lives.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the stakes have risen. Offshore rigs have emerged as hotbeds for the spread of the virus, forcing them to adopt strict quarantine procedures that limit the number of people onsite in order to reduce the disease\u2019s spread and minimize interruptions.\nEssentially, this has sped up the industry\u2019s digital transformation push and fueled the urgency of Abyss\u2019 work, said Bargoti. \u201cThey can\u2019t afford to have these things happening,\u201d he said.\nAbyss Solutions corrosion detections.\nBetter Than Human Performance\nHistorically, inspection and maintenance of offshore platforms and equipment has been a costly, time-consuming and labor-intensive task for oil and gas companies. It often yields subjective findings that can result in missed needed repairs and unplanned shutdowns.\nAn independent audit found that Abyss\u2019 semantic segmentation models are able to detect general corrosion with greater than 90 percent accuracy, while severe corrosion is identified with greater than 97 percent accuracy. Both are significant improvements over human efforts, and also have outcompeted other AI companies in the audit.\nWhat\u2019s more, Abyss says that its oil and gas platform clients report reductions in operating costs by as much as 25 percent thanks to its technology.\nTraining of Abyss\u2019s models, which rely on many terabytes of data (each platform generates about 1TB a day), occurs on AWS instances running NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs. The company also uses the latest versions of CUDA and cuDNN in conjunction with TensorFlow to power deep learning applications such as image and video segmentation and classification, and object detection.\nBargoti said the company also is working with the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 module and TensorRT software to condense its models so they can run on their unmanned vehicles in real time.\nMost of the data can be processed in the cloud because of the slowness of the corrosion process, but there are times when real-time AI is needed onsite, such as when a robotic vehicle needs to make decisions on where to go next.\nTaking Full Advantage of Inception\nAs a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program to help startups working in AI and data science get to market faster, Abyss has benefited from a try-before-you-buy approach to NVIDIA tech. That\u2019s allowed it to experiment with technologies before making big investments.\nIt\u2019s also getting valuable advice on what\u2019s coming down the pipe and how to time its work with the release of new GPUs. Bargoti said NVIDIA\u2019s regularly advancing technology is helping Abyss squeeze more data into each compute cycle, pushing it closer to its long-term vision.\n\u201cWe want to be the intel in these unmanned systems that makes smart decisions and pushes the frontier of exploration,\u201d said Bargoti. \u201cIt\u2019s all leading to this better development of perception systems, better development of decision-making systems and better development of robotics systems.\u201d\nAbyss is taking a deep look at a number of additional markets it believes its technology can help. The team is taking on growth capital and rapidly expanding globally.\n\u201cContinuous investment in R&D and innovation plays a critical role in ensuring Abyss can provide game-changing solutions to the industry,\u201d he said.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Energy | Inception | Industrial and Manufacturing | Jetson \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

So when NASA researchers magnify images of the sun with a telescope, they can see tiny blobs, called granules, moving on the surface.\nStudying the movement and flows of the granules helps the researchers better understand what\u2019s happening underneath that outer layer of the sun.\nThe computations for tracking the motion of granules requires advanced imaging techniques. Using data science and GPU computing with NVIDIA Quadro RTX-powered HP Z8 workstations, NASA researchers have developed deep learning techniques to more easily track the flows on the sun\u2019s surface.\n\nRTX Flares Up Deep Learning Performance\nWhen studying how storms and hurricanes form, meteorologists analyze the flows of winds in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. For this same reason, it\u2019s important to measure the flows of plasma in the sun\u2019s atmosphere to learn more about the short- and long-term evolution of our nearest star.\nThis helps NASA understand and anticipate events like solar flares, which can affect power grids, communication systems like GPS or radios, or even put space travel at risk because of the intense radiation and charged particles associated with space weather.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like predicting earthquakes,\u201d said Michael Kirk, research astrophysicist at NASA. \u201cSince we can\u2019t see very well beneath the surface of the sun, we have to take measurements from the flows on the exterior to infer what is happening subsurface.\u201d\nGranules are transported by plasma motions \u2014 hot ionized gas under the surface. To capture these motions, NASA developed customized algorithms best tailored to their solar observations, with a deep learning neural network that observes the granules using images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, and then learns how to reconstruct their motions.\n\u201cNeural networks can generate estimates of plasma motions at resolutions beyond what traditional flow tracking methods can achieve,\u201d said Benoit Tremblay from the National Solar Observatory. \u201cFlow estimates are no longer limited to the surface \u2014 deep learning can look for a relationship between what we see on the surface and the plasma motions at different altitudes in the solar atmosphere.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re training neural networks using synthetic images of these granules to learn the flow fields, so it helps us understand precursor environments that surround the active magnetic regions that can become the source of solar flares,\u201d said Raphael Attie, solar astronomer at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center.\nNVIDIA GPUs were essential in training the neural networks because NASA needed to complete several training sessions with data preprocessed in multiple ways to develop robust deep learning models, and CPU power was not enough for these computations.\nWhen using TensorFlow on a 72 CPU-core compute node, it took an hour to complete only one pass with the training data. Even in a CPU-based cloud environment, it would still take weeks to train all the models that the scientists needed for a single project.\nWith an NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 GPU, the researchers can complete one training in about three minutes \u2014 a 20x speedup. This allows them to start testing the trained models after a day instead of having to wait weeks.\n\u201cThis incredible speedup enables us to try out different ways to train the models and make \u2018stress tests,\u2019 like preprocessing images at different resolutions or introducing synthetic errors to better emulate imperfections in the telescopes,\u201d said Attie. \u201cThat kind of accelerated workflow completely changed the scope of what we can afford to explore, and it allows us to be much more daring and creative.\u201d\nWith NVIDIA Quadro RTX GPUs, the NASA researchers can accelerate workflows for their solar physics projects, and they have more time to conduct thorough research with simulations to gain deeper understandings of the sun\u2019s dynamics.\nLearn more about NVIDIA and HP data science workstations, and listen to the AI Podcast with NASA.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Data Science | NVIDIA RTX | Quadro \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With Y2K fast approaching, the news is doom and gloom and makes us wonder, \u201cWill my Pentium III PC explode into a fireball at the stroke of midnight?\u201d But what can we do, really? We\u2019ve already backed up everything to our trusty CD-RWs and Iomega Zip disks. As we all nervously await the new year, let\u2019s ask a different question: Has there ever been a better time to be a PC Gamer?\nFirst off: ISDN AND CABLE BROADBAND INTERNET! Game changer. Fire up Team Fortress and Q3Test without the ear piercing dial up modem waking up the parents or the dog, and you\u2019re in a fast-paced world, fragging your online friends and noobs. We\u2019re getting 512 KILOBYTES PER SECOND; downloading 650MB in less than 3 hours!\nAnd then, wow\u2026NEW GAMES. Descent 3, SimCity 3000, Heroes of Might and Magic III, Gabriel Knight 3, SWAT 3, Homeworld, Aliens Versus Predator, Alpha Centauri, plus sequels to Dungeon Keeper and Freespace - the list goes on. And who knows if Counter-Strike Beta is a passing fad, but we\u2019re already hooked on this new shooter! We might need to double the day to 48 hours so we can get in enough Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun and Rollercoaster Tycoon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork by Rachid Lotf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s not forget Everquest, which came out in North America this March, sporting new Direct3D hardware-accelerated graphics that are sure to make fans of Meridian 59 very sad (and require an 8MB graphics accelerator, as well a ridiculous 64MB of RAM!). We\u2019ll see if this whole \u201cMassively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game\u201d thing catches on. We\u2019ve come a long way from MUDs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother big thing\u2026 GRAPHICS. Honestly, I don\u2019t know how any studio will top what we\u2019re seeing in Unreal Tournament - just a stunning achievement! I\u2019ve been having an incredible time in Facing Worlds, blasting peeps in low-G with rocket launchers, and attacking the beachhead in Assault, while marveling at the pixel-perfect character models and stunning graphics. I wouldn\u2019t bet even my Phantom Menace collectibles that we will see anything better anytime soon (well maybe Quake 3 Arena, if Carmack and co. manage to release it before the Y2K apocalypse...).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut man, those graphics\u2026 I was getting only 20 FPS at 640x480, which is why I got a big advance on my allowance from my (admittedly sometimes \u2018ok\u2019) parents, so I could buy the NVIDIA GeForce 256, the world\u2019s first \u201cGraphics Processing Unit\u201d (GPU). Maximum PC has been hyping it for months and it doesn\u2019t disappoint!\nNVIDIA\u2019s TNT2 gaming accelerator went head to head with the Voodoo 3, but this all-in-one 220nm, 120MHz GPU smashes it, with up to 50% faster performance, Direct3D 7.0 support, and more.\nJust look at this radical tech: Integrated Transform and Lighting delivers 2-4X the triangle rate for 2-4X more detailed 3D scenes. Plus, Independent Pipelined QuadEngine\u2122 technology separates engines for transformation, lighting, setup and rendering provide a very powerful, highly efficient architecture that delivers 15 million triangles per second. Man, that\u2019s a lot of triangles! Throw in a Soundblaster and PC Gaming will never be the same.\nIt really feels like we are entering a Golden Age of Gaming. We\u2019re having so much fun that every year feels like a day, and it packs so much new delight and so many breakthroughs. Forget 2000. Where will gaming be in 2020? It\u2019s impossible to know. If only we could accelerate through time\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1999 was a wild time, and gaming\u2019s only got better since - we\u2019ll be posting our favorite memories spanning the last 21 years on social media. Each day will be a brand new year in succession, until we reach 2019 on August 31st. We welcome you to join us! Here\u2019s a .zip kit you can use to create and share your memories, and if you do it via #UltimateCountdown on any social platform, everyone will be able to see and share your favorite memories and moments.\nOn September 1st, we usher in a new era with a special event broadcast featuring NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang.\nGet ready for the #UltimateCountdown, concluding 9am PT on September 1st.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It takes a skilled birdwatcher to tell a chipping sparrow from a house sparrow from an American tree sparrow.\nNow researchers are using AI to take this to the next level \u2014 identifying individual birds.\nAndr\u00e9 Ferreira, a Ph.D. student at France\u2019s Centre for Functional and Evolutionary Ecology, harnessed an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 to train a powerful AI that identifies individual birds within the same species.\nIt\u2019s the latest example of how deep learning has become a powerful tool for wildlife biologists studying a wide range of animals.\nMarine biologists with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Research Organization use deep learning to identify and track the endangered North Atlantic Right Whale. Zoologist Dan Rubenstein uses deep learning to distinguish between individuals in herds of Grevy\u2019s Zebras.\nThe sociable weaver isn\u2019t endangered. But understanding the role of an individual in a group is key to understanding how the birds, native to Southern Africa, work together to build their nests.\nThe problem: it\u2019s hard to tell the small, rust-colored birds apart, especially when trying to capture their activities in the wild.\nIn a paper released last week, Ferreira detailed how he and a team of researchers trained a convolutional neural network to identify individual birds.\nFerreira built his model using Keras, a popular open-source neural network library, running on a GeForce RTX 2070 GPU.\nHe then teamed up with researchers at Germany\u2019s Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior. Together, they adapted the model to identify wild great tits and captive zebra finches, two other widely studied bird species.\nTo train their models \u2014 a crucial step towards building any modern deep-learning-based AI \u2014 researchers made feeders equipped with cameras.\nThe researchers fitted birds with electronic tags, which triggered sensors in the feeders alerting researchers to the bird\u2019s identity.\nThis data gave the model a \u201cground truth\u201d that it could check against for accuracy.\nThe team\u2019s AI was able to identify individual sociable weavers and wild great tits more than 90 percent of the time. And it identified captive zebra finches 87 percent of the time.\nFor bird researchers, the work promises several key benefits.\nUsing cameras and other sensors to track birds allows researchers to study bird behavior much less invasively.\nWith less need to put researchers in the field, the technique allows researchers to track bird behavior over more extended periods.\nNext: Ferreira and his colleagues are working to build AI that can recognize individual birds it has never seen before, and better track groups of birds.\nBirdwatching may never be the same.\nFeatured image credit: Bernard DuPont, some rights reserved.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Users can load their data onto the platform, which then segments objects and annotates them. It also allows for training and deploying models.\nV7 Darwin is trained on several million images and optimized on NVIDIA GPUs. The startup is also exploring the use of NVIDIA Clara Guardian, which includes NVIDIA DeepStream SDK intelligent video analytics framework on edge AI embedded systems. So far, it\u2019s piloted laboratory perception, quality inspection, and livestock monitoring projects, using the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and Jetson TX2 modules for the edge deployment of trained models.\nV7 Labs is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program that provides AI startups with go-to-market support, expertise and technology assistance.\nPixel-Perfect Object Classification\n\u201cFor AI to learn to see something, you need to give it examples,\u201d said Rizzoli. \u201cAnd to have it accurately identify an object based on an image, you need to make sure the training sample captures 100 percent of the object\u2019s pixels.\u201d\nAnnotating and labeling an object based on such a level of \u201cpixel-perfect\u201d granular detail takes just two-and-a-half seconds for V7 Darwin \u2014 up to 50x faster than a human, depending on the complexity of the image, said Rizzoli.\nSaving time and costs around image annotation is especially important in the context of healthcare, he said. Healthcare professionals must look at hundreds of thousands of X-ray or CT scans and annotate abnormalities, Rizzoli said, but this can be automated.\n\nFor example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, V7 Labs worked with the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service and Italy\u2019s San Matteo Hospital to develop a model that detects the severity of pneumonia in a chest X-ray and predicts whether a patient will need to enter an intensive care unit.\nThe company also published an open dataset with over 6,500 X-ray images showing pneumonia, 500 cases of which were caused by COVID-19.\nV7 Darwin can be used in a laboratory setting, helping to detect protocol errors and automatically log experiments.\n\nApplication Across Industries\nCompanies in a wide variety of industries beyond healthcare can benefit from V7\u2019s technology.\n\u201cOur goal is to capture all of computer vision and make it remarkably easy to use\u201d said Rizzoli. \u201cWe believe that if we can identify a cell under a microscope, we can also identify, say, a house from a satellite. And if we can identify a doctor performing an operation or a lab technician performing an experiment, we can also identify a sculptor or a person preparing a cake.\u201d\nGlobal uses of the platform include assessing the damage of natural disasters, observing the growth of human and animal embryos, detecting caries in dental X-rays, creating autonomous machines to evaluate safety protocols in manufacturing, and allowing farming robots to count their harvests.\nStay up to date with the latest healthcare news from NVIDIA, and explore how AI, accelerated computing, and GPU technology contribute to the worldwide battle against the novel coronavirus on our COVID-19 research hub.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | COVID-19 | GPU | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | Jetson | Machine Learning | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Rob Legato, the VFX supervisor for Disney\u2019s recent remake of The Lion King, referred to real-time rendering with GPUs serving as the future of creativity.\u00a0And developers have adopted real-time techniques to create cinematic video game graphics, like ray-traced reflections in Battlefield V, ray-traced shadows in Shadow of the Tomb Raider and path-traced lighting in Minecraft.\nThese are just a few of many examples.\nIn early 2018, ILMxLAB, Epic Games and NVIDIA released a cinematic called Star Wars: Reflections. We revealed that the demo was rendered in real time using ray-traced reflections, area light shadows and ambient occlusion \u2014 all on a $70,000 NVIDIA DGX workstation packed with four NVIDIA Volta GPUs. This major advancement captured global attention, as real-time ray tracing with this level of fidelity could only be done offline on gigantic server farms.\n\nFast forward to August 2018, when we announced the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti at Gamescom and showed Reflections running on just one $1,200 GeForce RTX GPU, with the NVIDIA Turing architecture\u2019s RT Cores accelerating ray tracing performance in real time.\nToday, over 50 content creation and design applications, including 20 of the leading commercial renderers, have added support for NVIDIA RTX. Real-time ray tracing is more widely available, allowing professionals to have more time for iterating designs and capturing accurate lighting, shadows, reflections, translucence, scattering and ambient occlusion in their images.\n\nRTX Ray Tracing Continues to Change the Game\nFrom product and building designs to visual effects and animation, real-time ray tracing is revolutionizing content creation. RTX allows creative decisions to be made sooner, as designers no longer need to play the waiting game for renders to complete.\nImage courtesy of The Future Group.\nWhat was once considered impossible just two years ago has now become a reality for anyone with an RTX GPU \u2014 NVIDIA\u2019s Turing architecture delivers new capabilities that made real-time ray tracing achievable. Its RT Cores accelerate two of the most computationally intensive tasks: bounding volume hierarchy traversal and ray-triangle intersection testing. This allows the streaming multiprocessors, which perform the computations, to improve programmable shading instead of spending thousands of instruction slots for each ray cast.\nTuring\u2019s Tensor Cores enable users to leverage and enhance AI denoising for generating clean images quickly. All of these new features combined are what make real-time ray tracing possible. Creative teams can render images faster, complete more iterations and finish projects with cinematic, photorealistic graphics.\n\u201cRay tracing, especially real-time ray tracing, brings the ground truth to an image and allows the viewer to make immediate, sometimes subconscious decisions about the information,\u201d said Jon Peddie, president of Jon Peddie Research. \u201cIf it\u2019s entertainment, the viewer is not distracted and taken out of the story by artifacts and nagging suspension of belief. If it\u2019s engineering, the user knows the results are accurate and can move closer and more quickly to a solution.\u201d\n\nArtists can now use a single GPU for real-time ray tracing to create high-quality imagery, and they can harness the power of RTX through numerous ways. Popular game engines Unity and Unreal Engine are leveraging RTX. GPU renderers like V-Ray, Redshift and Octane are adopting OptiX for RTX acceleration. And workstation vendors like BOXX, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Supermicro offer real-time ray tracing-capable systems, allowing users to harness the power of RTX in a single, flexible desktop or mobile workstation.\nRTX GPUs also provide the memory required for handling massive datasets, whether it\u2019s complex geometry or large numbers of high-resolution textures. The NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 GPU provides a 48GB frame buffer, and with NVLink high-speed interconnect technology doubling that capacity, users can easily manipulate massive, complex scenes without spending time constantly decimating or optimizing their datasets.\n\u201cDNEG\u2019s virtual production department has taken on an ever increasing amount of work, particularly over recent months where practical shoots have become more difficult,\u201d said Stephen Willey, head of technology at DNEG. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s RTX and Quadro Sync solutions, coupled with Epic\u2019s Unreal Engine, have allowed us to create far larger and more realistic real-time scenes and assets. These advances help us offer exciting new possibilities to our clients.\u201d\nMore recently, NVIDIA introduced techniques to further improve ray tracing and rendering. With Deep Learning Super Sampling, users can enhance real-time rendering through AI-based super resolution. NVIDIA DLSS allows them to render fewer pixels and use AI to construct sharp, higher-resolution images.\nAt SIGGRAPH this month, one of our research papers dives deep into how to render dynamic direct lighting and shadows from millions of area lights in real time using a new technique called reservoir-based spatiotemporal importance resampling, or ReSTIR.\nImage courtesy of Digital Domain.\nReal-Time Ray Tracing Opens New Possibilities for Graphics\nRTX ray tracing is transforming design across industries today.\nIn gaming, the quality of RTX ray tracing creates new dynamics and environments in gameplay, allowing players to use reflective surfaces strategically. For virtual reality, RTX ray tracing brings new levels of realism and immersiveness for professionals in healthcare, AEC and automotive design. And in animation, ray tracing is changing the pipeline completely, enabling artists to easily manage and manipulate light geometry in real time.\nReal-time ray tracing is also paving the way for virtual productions and believable digital humans in film, television and immersive experiences like VR and AR.\nAnd with NVIDIA Omniverse \u2014 the first real-time ray tracer that can scale to any number of GPUs \u2014 creatives can simplify collaborative studio workflows with their favorite applications like Unreal Engine, Autodesk Maya and 3ds Max, Substance Painter by Adobe, Unity, SideFX Houdini, and many others. Omniverse is pushing ray tracing forward, enabling users to create visual effects, architectural visualizations and manufacturing designs with dynamic lighting and physically based materials.\n\nExplore the Latest in Ray Tracing and Graphics\nJoin us at the SIGGRAPH virtual conference to learn more about the latest advances in graphics, and get an exclusive look at some of our most exciting work.\nBe part of the NVIDIA community and show us what you can create by participating in our Real-Time Ray Tracing with RTX On contest.

It took 13 years to reach 1 million registered developers, and less than two more to reach 2 million.\nMost recently, teams at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Scripps Research Institute and Oak Ridge National Laboratory have been among the NVIDIA developers at the forefront of efforts to combat COVID-19.\nEvery Country, Every Field\nNo surprise. Whether they\u2019re software programmers, data scientists or devops engineers, developers are problem solvers.\nThey write, debug and optimize code, often taking a set of software building blocks \u2014 frameworks, application programming interfaces and other tools \u2014 and putting them to work to do something new.\nThese developers include business and academic leaders from every region in the world.\nIn China, Alibaba and Baidu are among the most active GPU developers. In North America, those names include Microsoft, Amazon and Google. In Japan, it\u2019s Sony, Hitachi and Panasonic. In Europe, they include Bosch, Daimler and Siemens.\nAll the top technical universities are represented, including CalTech, MIT, Oxford, Cambridge, Stanford, Tsinghua University, the University of Tokyo, and IIT campuses throughout India.\u00a0\nLook beyond the big names \u2014 there are too many to drop here \u2014 and you\u2019ll find tens of thousands of entrepreneurs, hobbyists and enthusiasts.\nDevelopers are signing up for our developer program to put NVIDIA accelerated computing tools to work across fields such as scientific and high performance computing, graphics and professional visualization, robotics, AI and data science, networking, and autonomous vehicles.\nDevelopers are trained and equipped for success through our GTC conferences, online and in-person tutorials, our Deep Learning Institute training, and technical blogs. We provide them with software development kits such as CUDA, cuDNN, TensorRT and OptiX.\nRegistered developers account for 100,000 downloads a month, thousands participate each month in DLI training sessions, and thousands more engage in our online forums or attend conferences and webinars.\nNVIDIA\u2019s developer program, however, is just a piece of a much bigger developer story. There are now more than a billion CUDA GPUs in the world \u2014 each capable of running CUDA-accelerated software \u2014 giving developers, hackers and makers a vast installed base to work with.\nAs a result, the number of downloads of CUDA, which is free, without registration, is far higher than that of registered developers. On average, 39,000 developers sign up for memberships each month and 438,000 download CUDA each month.\nThat\u2019s an awful lot of problem solvers.\nBreakthroughs in Science and Research\nThe ranks of those who depend on such problem solvers include the team who won the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry \u2014 Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson \u2014 for their contribution to cryogenic electron microscopy.\nThey also include the team that won the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics \u2014 Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne \u2014 for their work detecting gravitational waves.\nMore scientific breakthroughs are coming, as developers attack new HPC problems and, increasingly, deep learning.\nWilliam Tang, principal research physicist at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory \u2014 one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on fusion energy \u2014 leads a team using deep learning and HPC to advance the quest for cheap, clean energy.\nMichael Kirk and Raphael Attie, scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center \u2014 are among the many active GPU developers at NASA \u2014 relying on Quadro RTX data science workstations to analyze the vast quantities of data streaming in from satellites monitoring the sun.\nAnd at UC Berkeley, astrophysics Ph.D. student Gerry Zhang uses GPU-accelerated deep learning to analyze signals from space for signs of intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations.\nTop Companies\nOutside of research and academia, developers at the world\u2019s top companies are tackling problems faced by every one of the world\u2019s industries.\nAt Intuit, Chief Data Officer Ashok Srivastava leads a team using GPU-accelerated machine learning to help consumers with taxes and help small businesses through the financial effects of COVID-19.\nAt health insurer Anthem, Chief Digital Officer Rajeev Ronanki uses GPU-accelerated AI to help patients personalize and better understand their healthcare information.\nArne Stoschek, head of autonomous systems at Acubed, the Silicon Valley-based advanced products and partnerships outpost of Airbus Group, is developing self-piloted air taxis powered by GPU-accelerated AI.\nNew Problems, New Businesses: Entrepreneurs Swell Developer Ranks\nOther developers \u2014 many supported by the NVIDIA Inception program \u2014 work at startups building businesses that solve new kinds of problems.\nLooking to invest in a genuine pair of vintage Air Jordans? Michael Hall, director of data at GOAT Group, uses GPU-accelerated AI to help the startup connect sneaker enthusiasts with Air Jordans, Yeezys and a variety of old-school kicks that they can be confident are authentic.\nDon\u2019t know what to wear? Brad Klingenberg, chief algorithms officer at fashion ecommerce startup Stitch Fix, leads a team that uses GPU-accelerated AI to help us all dress better.\nAnd Benjamin Schmidt, at Roadbotics, offers what might be the ultimate case study in how developers are solving concrete problems: his startup helps cities find and fix potholes.\nEntrepreneurs are also supported by NVIDIA\u2019s Inception program, which includes more than 6,000 startups in industries ranging from agriculture to healthcare to logistics to manufacturing.\nOf course, just because something\u2019s a problem, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t love solving it.\nLove beer? Eric Boucher, a home brewing enthusiast, is using AI to invent new kinds of suds.\nLove a critter-free lawn? Robert Bond has trained a system that can detect cats and gently shoo them from his grass by turning on his sprinklers to the amazement and delight of his grandchildren.\nFrancisco \u201cPaco\u201d Garcia has even trained an AI to help sort out his children\u2019s Lego pile.\nMost telling: stories from developers working at the cutting edge of the arts.\nPierre Barreau has created an AI, named AIVA, which uses mathematical models based on the work of great composers to create new music.\nAnd Raiders of the Lost Art \u2014 a collaboration between Anthony Bourached and George Cann, a pair of Ph.D. candidates at the University College, London \u2014 has used neural style transfer techniques to tease out hidden artwork in a Leonardo da Vinci painting.\nWherever you go, follow the computing power and you\u2019ll find developers delivering breakthroughs.\nHow big is the opportunity for problem solvers like these? However many problems there are in the world.\nWant more stories like these? No problem. Over the months to come, we\u2019ll be bringing as many to you as we can.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Deep LearningTags: CUDA | Deep Learning Institute | Developer Program \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

How AI Is Going Uptown Around the Globe\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\tExamples of what a smart city is can be found in metro IoT deployments from Singapore to Seat Pleasant, Maryland.\t\t\t\n\n\nAugust 6, 2020 by Rick Merritt \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  There are as many ways to define a smart city as there are cities on the road to being smart.\nFrom London and Singapore to Seat Pleasant, Maryland, they vary widely. Most share some common characteristics.\nEvery city wants to be smart about being a great place to live. So, many embrace broad initiatives for connecting their citizens to the latest 5G and fiber optic networks, expanding digital literacy and services.\nMost agree that a big part of being smart means using technology to make their cities more self-aware, automated and efficient.\nWhat is a Smart City?\nA smart city is typically a kind of municipal Internet of Things \u2014 a network of cameras and sensors that can see, hear and even smell. These sensors, especially video cameras, generate massive amounts of data that can serve many civic purposes like helping traffic flow smoothly.\nCities around the globe are turning to AI to sift through that data in real time for actionable insights. And, increasingly, smart cities build realistic 3D simulations of themselves, digital twins to test out ideas of what they might look like in the future.\n\u201cWe define a smart city as a place applying advanced technology to improve the quality of life for people who live in it,\u201d said Sokwoo Rhee, who\u2019s worked on more than 200 smart city projects in 25 countries as an associate director for cyber-physical systems innovation in the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology.\nU.S., London Issue Smart Cities Guidebooks\nAt NIST, Rhee oversees work on a guide for building smart cities. Eventually it will include reports on issues and case studies in more than two dozen areas from public safety to water management systems.\nAcross the pond, London describes its smart city efforts in a 60-page document that details many ambitious goals. Like smart cities from Dubai to San Jose in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s a metro-sized work in progress.\nAn image from the Smart London guide.\n\u201cWe are far from the ideal at the moment with a multitude of systems and a multitude of vendors making the smart city still somewhat complex and fragmented,\u201d said Andrew Hudson-Smith, who is chair of digital urban systems at The Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at University College London and sits on a board that oversees London\u2019s smart city efforts.\nLiving Labs for AI\nIn a way, smart cities are both kitchen sinks and living labs of technology.\nThey host everything from air-quality monitoring systems to repositories of data cleared for use in shared AI projects. The London Datastore, for example, already contains more than 700 publicly available datasets.\nOne market researcher tracks a basket of 13 broad areas that define a smart city from smart streetlights to connected garbage cans. A smart-parking vendor in Stockholm took into account 24 factors \u2014 including the number of Wi-Fi hotspots and electric-vehicle charging stations \u2014 in its 2019 ranking of the world\u2019s 100 smartest cities. (Its top five were all in Scandinavia.)\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to pin it down to a limited set of technologies because everything finds its way into smart cities,\u201d said Dominique Bonte, a managing director at market watcher ABI Research. Among popular use cases, he called out demand-response systems as \u201ca huge application for AI because handling fluctuating demand for electricity and other services is a complex problem.\u201d\nSweden\u2019s EasyPark lists 24 factors that define a smart city.\nBecause it\u2019s broad, it\u2019s also big. Market watchers at Navigant Research expect the global market for smart-city gear to grow from $97.4 billion in annual revenue in 2019 to $265.4 billion by 2028 at a compound annual growth rate of 11.8 percent.\nIt\u2019s still early days. In a January 2019 survey of nearly 40 U.S. local and state government managers, more than 80 percent thought a municipal Internet of Things will have significant impact for their operations, but most were still in a planning phase and less than 10 percent had active projects.\nMost smart cities are still under construction, according to a NIST survey.\n\u201cSmart cities mean many things to many people,\u201d said Saurabh Jain, product manager of Metropolis, NVIDIA\u2019s GPU software stack for vertical markets such as smart cities.\n\u201cOur focus is on building what we call the AI City with the real jobs that can be done today with deep learning, tapping into the massive video and sensor datasets cities generate,\u201d he said.\nFor example, Verizon deployed on existing streetlights in Boston and Sacramento video nodes using the NVIDIA Jetson TX1 to analyze and improve traffic flow, enhance pedestrian safety and optimize parking.\n\u201cRollout is happening fast across the globe and cities are expanding their lighting infrastructure to become a smart-city platform \u2026 helping to create efficiency savings and a new variety of citizen services,\u201d said David Tucker, head of product management in the Smart Communities Group at Verizon in a 2018 article.\nSmart Streetlights for Smart Cities\nStreetlights will be an important part of the furniture of tomorrow\u2019s smart city.\nSo far, only a few hundred are outfitted with various mixes of sensors and Wi-Fi and cellular base stations. The big wave is yet to come as the estimated 360 million posts around the world slowly upgrade to energy-saving LED lights.\nA European take on a smart streetlight.\nIn a related effort, the city of Bellevue, Washington, tested a computer vision system from Microsoft Research to improve traffic safety and reduce congestion. Researchers at the University of Wollongong recently described similar work using NVIDIA Jetson TX2 modules to track the flow of vehicles and pedestrians in Liverpool, Australia.\nAirports, retail stores and warehouses are already using smart cameras and AI to run operations more efficiently. They are defining a new class of edge computing networks that smart cities can leverage.\nFor example, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) will roll out an AI system from startup Assaia that uses NVIDIA GPUs to speed the time to turn around flights.\n\u201cVideo analytics is crucial in providing full visibility over turnaround activities as well as improving safety,\u201d said an SEA manager in a May report.\nNashville, Zurich Explore the Simulated City\nSome smart cities are building digital twins, 3D simulations that serve many purposes.\nFor example, both Zurich and Nashville will someday let citizens and city officials don goggles at virtual town halls to see simulated impacts of proposed developments.\n\u201cThe more immersive and fun an experience, the more you increase engagement,\u201d said Dominik Tarolli, director of smart cities at Esri, which is supplying simulation software that runs on NVIDIA GPUs for both cities.\nCities as far apart in geography and population as Singapore and Rennes, France, built digital twins using a service from Dassault Syst\u00e8mes.\n\u201cWe recently signed a partnership with Hong Kong and presented examples for a walkability study that required a 3D simulation of the city,\u201d said Simon Huffeteau, a vice president working on smart cities for Dassault.\nEurope Keeps an AI on Traffic\nMany smart cities get started with traffic control. London uses digital signs to post speed limits that change to optimize traffic flow. It also uses license-plate recognition to charge tolls for entering a low-emission zone in the city center.\nCities in Belgium and France are considering similar systems.\n\u201cWe think in the future cities will ban the most polluting vehicles to encourage people to use public transportation or buy electric vehicles,\u201d said Bonte of ABI Research. \u201cSingapore is testing autonomous shuttles on a 5.7-mile stretch of its streets,\u201d he added.\nNearby, Jakarta uses a traffic-monitoring system from Nodeflux, a member of NVIDIA\u2019s Inception program that nurtures AI startups. The software taps AI and the nearly 8,000 cameras already in place around Jakarta to recognize license plates of vehicles with unpaid taxes.\nThe system is one of more than 100 third-party applications that run on Metropolis, NVIDIA\u2019s application framework for the Internet of Things.\nUnsnarling Traffic in Israel and Kansas City\nTraffic was the seminal app for a smart-city effort in Kansas City that started in 2015 with a $15 million smart streetcar. Today, residents can call up digital dashboards detailing current traffic conditions around town.\nAnd in Israel, the city of Ashdod deployed AI software from viisights. It helps understand patterns in a traffic monitoring system powered by NVIDIA Metropolis to ensure safety for citizens.\nNVIDIA created the AI City Challenge to advance work on deep learning as a tool to unsnarl traffic. Now in its fourth year, it draws nearly 1,000 researchers competing in more than 300 teams that include members from multiple city and state traffic agencies.\nThe event spawned CityFlow, one of the world\u2019s largest datasets for applying AI to traffic management. It consists of more than three hours of synchronized high-definition videos from 40 cameras at 10 intersections, creating 200,000 annotated bounding boxes around vehicles captured from different angles under various conditions.\nDrones to the Rescue in Maryland\nYou don\u2019t have to be a big city with lots of money to be smart. Seat Pleasant, Maryland, a Washington, D.C., suburb of less than 5,000 people, launched a digital hub for city services in August 2017.\nSince then it installed intelligent lighting, connected waste cans, home health monitors and video analytics to save money, improve traffic safety and reduce crime. It\u2019s also become the first U.S. city to use drones for public safety, including plans for life-saving delivery of emergency medicines.\nThe idea got its start when Mayor Eugene Grant, searching for ways to recover from the 2008 economic downturn, attended an event on innovation villages.\n\u201cSeat Pleasant would like to be a voice for small cities in America where 80 percent have less than 10,000 residents,\u201d said Grant. \u201cLook at these cities as test beds of innovation \u2026 living labs,\u201d he added.\nMayor Grant of Seat Pleasant aims to set an example of how small towns can become smart cities.\nRhee of NIST agrees. \u201cI\u2019m seeing a lot of projects embracing a broadening set of emerging technologies, making smart cities like incubation programs for new businesses like air taxis and autonomous vehicles that can benefit citizens,\u201d he said, noting that even rural communities will get into the act.\nSimulating a New Generation of Smart Cities\nWhen the work is done, go to the movies. Hollywood might provide a picture of the next horizon in the same way it sparked some of the current work.\nEsri\u2019s tools are used to simulate cities for movies as well as the real world.\nFlicks including Blade Runner 2049, Cars, Guardians of the Galaxy and Zootopia used a program called City Engine from startup Procedural that enables a rule-based approach to constructing simulated cities.\nTheir work caught the eye of Esri, which acquired the company and bundled its program with its ArcGIS Urban planning tool, now a staple for hundreds of real cities worldwide.\n\u201cGames and movies make people expect more immersive experiences, and that requires more computing,\u201d said Tarolli, a co-founder of Procedural and now Esri\u2019s point person on smart cities.\nLearn more about computer vision on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: 3D | Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Customer Stories | GPU | Jetson | Machine Learning | Metropolis | New GPU Uses | Smart Spaces | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Others dream of beer. NVIDIA\u2019s Eric Boucher does both at once, and the result couldn\u2019t be more aptly named.\nFull Nerd #1 is a crisp, light-bodied blonde ale perfect for summertime quaffing.\nEric, an engineer in the GPU systems software kernel driver team, went to sleep one night in May wrestling with two problems.\nOne, he had to wring key information from the often cryptic logs for the systems he oversees to help his team respond to issues faster.\nThe other: the veteran home brewer wanted a way to brew new kinds of beer.\n\u201cI woke up in the morning and I knew just what to do,\u201d Boucher said. \u201cBasically I got both done on one night\u2019s broken sleep.\u201d\nBoth solutions involved putting deep learning to work on a NVIDIA TITAN V GPU. Such powerful gear tends to encourage this sort of parallel processing, it seems.\nEric, a native of France now based near Sacramento, Calif., began homebrewing two decades ago, inspired by a friend and mentor at Sun Microsystems. He took a break from it when his children were first born.\nNow that they\u2019re older, he\u2019s begun brewing again in earnest, using gear in both his garage and backyard, turning to AI for new recipes this spring.\nOf course, AI has been used in the past to help humans analyze beer flavors, and even create wild new craft beer names. Eric\u2019s project, however, is more ambitious, because it\u2019s relying on AI to create new beer recipes.\nYou\u2019ve Got Ale \u2014 GPU Speeds New Brew Ideas\nFor training data, Eric started with the all-grain ale recipes from MoreBeer, a hub for brewing enthusiasts, where he usually shops for recipe kits and ingredients.\nEric focused on ales because they\u2019re relatively easy and quick to brew, and encompass a broad range of different styles, from hearty Irish stout to tangy and refreshing K\u00f6lsch.\nHe used wget \u2014 an open source program that retrieves content from the web \u2014 to save four index pages of ale recipes.\nThen, using a Python script, he filtered the downloaded HTML pages and downloaded the linked recipe PDFs. He then converted the PDFs to plain text and used another Python script to interpret the text and generate recipes in a standardized format.\nHe fed these 108 recipes \u2014 including one for Russian River Brewing\u2019s legendary Pliny the Elder IPA \u2014 to Textgenrnn, a recurrent neural network, a type of neural network that can be applied to a sequence of data to help guess what should come next.\nAnd, because no one likes to wait for good beer, he ran it on an NVIDIA TITAN V GPU. Eric estimates it cuts the time to learn from the recipes database to seven minutes from one hour and 45 minutes using a CPU alone.\nAfter a little tuning, Eric generated 10 beer recipes. They ranged from dark stouts to yellowish ales, and in flavor from bitter to light.\nTo Eric\u2019s surprise, most looked reasonable (though a few were \u201cplain weird and impossible to brew\u201d like a recipe that instructed him to wait 45 days with hops in the wort, or unfermented beer, before adding the yeast).\nSpeed of Light (Beer)\nWith the approaching hot California summer in mind, Eric selected a blonde ale.\nHe was particularly intrigued because the recipe suggested adding Warrior, Cascade, and Amarillo hops \u2014 the flowers of the herbaceous perennial Humulus lupulus that gives good beer a range of flavors, from bitter to citrusy \u2014 an \u201cintriguing schedule.\u201d\nThe result, Eric reports, was refreshing, \u201cnot too sweet, not too bitter,\u201d with \u201ca nice, fresh hops smell and a long, complex finish.\u201d\nHe dubbed the result Full Nerd #1.\nThe AI-generated brew became the latest in a long line of brews with witty names Eric has produced, including a bourbon oak-infused beer named, appropriately enough, \u201cThe Groot Beer,\u201d in honor of the tree-like creature from Marvel\u2019s \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy.\u201d\nEric\u2019s next AI brewing project: perhaps a dark stout, for winter, or a lager, a light, crisp beer that requires months of cold storage to mature.\nFor now, however, there\u2019s plenty of good brew to drink.

It goes far beyond the addition of a powerful GPU, requiring engineers and experts skilled in the fields of thermal, mechanical, electrical and product design to come together to collaborate on a perfectly-balanced product.\nTo lift the shroud on this process, we spoke to some of NVIDIA\u2019s best and brightest, who detailed the art and science behind graphics card design today, with a look towards the possibilities of the future. In the video below, we offer a first glimpse at some of the strides we have made in designing graphics cards, so that they can reach their maximum potential while remaining cool and quiet. They include:\n\nThermal: A new, airflow-optimized cooling solution, redesigned to overcome existing constraints and move more air through the system for maximum cooling efficiency\nMechanical: A stronger mechanical structure, including a new low profile leaf spring that leaves room for a back cover\nElectrical: A compact electrical design, with a new 12-pin power connector that allows more space for components and cooling, and is compatible with existing power supplies via an included adapter\nProduct Design: A no-compromise, cohesive design that embraces the revolutionary thermal solution while beautifully harmonizing each element of the graphics card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more on NVIDIA\u2019s latest innovations in gaming and graphics, tune in to the GeForce Special Event broadcast, featuring NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang, starting 9am PT on September 1st.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Today, Codemasters\u2019 F1\u00ae 2020 gets an AI performance boost with NVIDIA DLSS, which enables gamers to maximize their graphics settings as well as play at even higher resolutions using NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs.\nNVIDIA DLSS is a deep learning neural network, powered by dedicated AI processors (Tensor Cores) in GeForce RTX GPUs, which boosts frame rates while generating beautiful, crisp game images. It gives gamers the performance headroom to maximize game settings and increase output resolutions, for a superior, higher-fidelity experience.\n\u201cWe wanted F1\u00ae 2020 to be the most authentic and immersive F1\u00ae game to date,\u201d said Lee Mather, F1 Franchise Game Director at Codemasters. \u201cThis required a laser focus on all aspects, from the My Team feature through to every pixel on the screen.\u00a0 NVIDIA DLSS gives users the performance headroom to maximise visual settings, resulting in realistic, immersive graphics.\u201d\nAnd as proven by the data below, DLSS delivers significant performance boosts to all GeForce RTX GPUs, unlocking 4K 60 FPS for GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER and higher GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF1\u00ae 2020 is a very popular racing franchise with a longstanding history and dedicated fan base. DLSS in F1\u00ae 2020 boosts performance up to 1.5X and delivers 4K 60FPS on a RTX 2060 SUPER and above. Having yet another flagship franchise on the DLSS roster demonstrates the confidence game developers have in the technology.\nFor word of DLSS\u2019s addition to other games, stay tuned to GeForce.com, where you\u2019ll also get updates on our latest hardware releases, driver updates, and ray tracing announcements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(Image Credits: Reddit u/dertpert88)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 series Ampere Gaming graphics cards are almost here and we have got new information regarding the announcement date for the next-generation gaming powerhouses by GamersNexus. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 'Ampere' Gaming graphics cards will replace the RTX 20 'Turing' lineup which launched all the way back in 2018.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 'Ampere' Gaming Graphics Cards To Be Announced on 9th September, To Include High-End\u00a0 GeForce RTX 3080 Ti & RTX 3080 4K Gaming Cards\nGamersNexus reports that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards based on the Ampere gaming architecture is all set to be announced on 9th September. We have previously heard about 17th September in rumors but one thing is confirmed that Ampere is indeed headed for launch in the coming month.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSA possibility is that NVIDIA could announce the cards at a digital event on 9th September followed by an official retail launch on 17th September. Of course, this is just mere speculation from my end but we have seen similar schedules formed for the previous generation lineup. The NVIDIA Ampere GeForce RTX 30 series gaming graphics cards are likely to go on pre-order the same day on which they will be announced.\n\nSteve Burke from GamersNexus (via Videocardz) reports that NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 'Ampere' gaming graphics cards are expected to be announced on 9th September.\nGamers who are planning to buy the graphics cards will receive info such as specifications & prices officially by NVIDIA independent reviews can only be expected after the launch embargo lifts which is likely a few weeks (1-2 weeks max) after the launch. The Founders Edition graphics cards will be the first products that gamers will have access to, including pre-orders but we can expect custom AIB variants by the end of September or early October. We have got word from our sources that several AIBs have already started scheduling their press sample allocation with the cards shipping out in a few weeks.\nThere will be many users who would definitely be waiting for custom variants over the Founders Edition cards unless the new design offers a super good reason to go the reference/stock route. Judging by the design of the leaked coolers, the Founders Edition cards this time around seem to offer even more premium components and a unique cooling design which we would definitely be testing once we get our own hands on the cards themselves.\n\nAs for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Ampere gaming graphics cards, it is stated that the lineup will consist of four graphics cards for 2020, these include:\n\nNVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti\nNVIDIA RTX 3080\nNVIDIA RTX 3070\nNVIDIA RTX 3060\n\nAll four graphics cards are rumored for launch in 2020 but will have different launch schedules. The high-end cards will be prioritized first with the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and GeForce RTX 3080 slated to launch in September which is just about a month away from now. The GeForce RTX 3070 will be launch a month later in October while the GeForce RTX 3060 mainstream graphics card will hop on the retail shelves in November.\nAs for what we can expect from NVIDIA's high-end GeForce RTX 30 series Ampere gaming graphics cards, we have speculated/rumored information provided below:\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti - The Fastest Ampere Gaming Graphics Card\nAccording to the details, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will feature the GA102-300-A1 GPU. The GA102-300-A1 GPU is said to be comprised of 5248 CUDA cores or 82 SMs. In total, that's a 20% increase in cores over the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. No details such as clock speeds, TMU/ROP counts are provided and we can't take the Ampere A100 die as a reference since gaming & HPC parts share a different configuration hierarchy.\n\nMoving on to the memory side, things start to look interesting as it is stated that the card will get up to 12 GB memory with faster GDDR6 pin speeds. Since that's a 384-bit bus we are looking at, it will be able to offer nearly 1 TB/s bandwidth. There's also talks about an enhanced version of the GDDR6 DRAM known as GDDR6X however there's no information available yet by any graphics DRAM vendor, unlike the previous GDDR6 DRAM which was officially reported months before its integration on the Turing graphics cards.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 - GA102 For High-End Gaming\nMoving on to the GeForce RTX 3080, the rumor reports that the card will be featuring the GA102-200-KD-A1 SKU. This cut down SKU will feature the same 4352 CUDA cores as the RTX 2080 Ti that will be arranged in a total of 68 SMs. The card is reportedly going to feature 10 GB of memory that is also going to be GDDR6X, running at 19 Gbps across a 320-bit bus interface with a bandwidth of 760 GB/s.\n\nThe switch to GA102 from TU104 on the RTX 2080 is definitely an interesting one. A high-end SKU would also result in higher wattage and thermals but I believe this could be done to raise the bar up on the sub $500 segment which should comprise of GA104 based RTX 3070 and RTX 3060. The latest performance leaks also show a considerable performance improvement over the RTX 2080 and even the RTX 2080 Ti in synthetic benchmarks. If the same could translate over to the gaming performance, then Ampere does look like a super enticing product for gamers who have waited for almost 2 years now.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 \"Ampere' Graphics Card Rumored Lineup:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameGPU NameCUDA Cores / SMsMemory CapacityMemory BusBandwidthTDPLaunch Timeframe\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX RTX 3090Ampere GA102-30010496 (82)24 GB GDDR6X384-bit936 Gbps (19.5 Gbps)350WSeptember 2020\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti/SUPER?Ampere GA102-250?TBD20 GB GDDR6X320-bitTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080Ampere GA102-2008704 (68)10 GB GDDR6X320-bit760 Gbps (19 Gbps)320WSeptember 2020\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti/SUPER?Ampere GA104-400?6144 (48)?16 GB GDDR6X256-bitTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070Ampere GA104-3005888 (46)8 GB GDDR6256-bit512 Gbps (16 Gbps)220WOctober 2020\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti/SUPER?Ampere GA104-200?4864 (38)?8 GB GDDR6?256-bit?TBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060Ampere GA106-300?TBD6 GB GDDR6?192-bit?TBDTBDNovember 2020?\n\n\n\n\nRecent reports have\u00a0suggested\u00a0that NVIDIA has halted the production of its higher-end GeForce RTX GPU lineup to prepare for the Ampere GeForce RTX launch. Only small quantities of the said GPUs are left in the retail channel thus suggesting that we are getting closer to the launch. There's definitely a lot more to talk about regarding the Ampere GPUs but we will have to wait until more information comes our way.\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA GeForce 'Ampere' GPU are you waiting for the most?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n110\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n91\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n47\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n24\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n22\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1480\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1157\nComments\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n1035\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090 (Image credit: GarnetSunset/Twitter)Twitter user @GarnetSunset has shared two photographs of one of Nvidia's looming Ampere graphics cards. The markings on the backplate are barely visible, but the mysterious graphics card appears to be the GeForce RTX 3090.It's not the first time that we've seen the peculiar design, but the graphics card is simply massive when compared to the GeForce RTX 2080. According to the images, the GeForce RTX 3090 occupies up to three PCI slots as evidenced by the I/O bracket.\u00a0It remains to be seen whether aftermarket models will follow suit though. If so, we can see graphic cards with included AIO liquid cooler getting more popular or enthusiasts simply slapping a waterblock on the graphics card and roll with a full liquid cooling system.The triple-slot design certainly raises the question to whether Ampere will pull a lot of power and, thus, if that's why it has such a beefy heatsink. Early rumors were already floating around that the flagship Ampere graphics card could debut with a 350W TDP (thermal design power). Then the subject of the new 12-pin PCIe power connector emerged and added more fuel to the fire.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 (Image credit: GarnetSunset/Twitter)The specifications for the GeForce RTX 3090 aren't clear yet, but we might be looking at a graphics card that could feature 5,376 to 7,552 CUDA cores and up to 24GB of GDDR6X memory. The GA102 silicon is the rumored die to come inside the GeForce RTX 3090. And unless Micron is pulling our leg, the GeForce RTX 3090's GDDR6X memory will clock up to 21 Gbps. If that's the case, we would be expecting a 384-bit memory interface to go along with the memory.The leaker who brought us the photographs also shared the alleged pricing for Nvidia's Ampere product stack. We would exercise caution with the prices as manufacturers have gotten smarter over the last few years and would often establish false pricing only to change them just before the product launch. According to the leaker, the GeForce RTX 3090 will reportedly retail for $1,400 while the GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 purportedly sell for $800, $600 and $400, respectively. Again, take those numbers with a huge shovelful of salt.\u00a0Looking back at Nvidia's previous flagships, the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti launched at $699. The GeForce RTX 2080 Ti eventually replaced it at $999. The price increased by up to 42.9%, considering Turing's bigger die and the addition of the Tensor and RT cores and whatnot. If the GeForce RTX 3090's $1,400 price tag is legit, the Ampere-based flagship would cost approximately 40.1% more than the existing GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. It's basically the same premium that consumers paid for the Turing flagship.Nvidia's pricing strategy has never been lenient, and when there's no formidable competition up top, the chipmaker probably could get away selling the GeForce RTX 3090 for whatever its heart desires.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nGeForce RTX 3090\nTwitter\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (24)\n\n\n\nZhiye LiuSocial Links NavigationNews Editor and Memory ReviewerZhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

This means that in reality you should be expecting $200 more for the founders and pretty much all the good AIB cards (except from the \"entry-level\" ones with the worst coolers) . And higher-end models even more. So we are really looking for $1600.\nThe 3090 will definitely not have more CUDA cores than what is currently available with the A100. Yes the A100 WILL have 8192 but at the moment the maximum available configuration is with 6912. So 6912 CUDA cores is the absolute maximum for the 3090.\nThe 3080 will have at least half of the 3090\u2019s CUDA cores (i.e. 3456 in case the 3090 sports 6912 CUDA cores) and will cost half the money ($800).\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njkflipflop98\n\n\nDang that's a BIG card.

RIP SFF gamers.If the leaks are true, this is the FE version which is so large because the pentagon surrounding the fan on the right side has no PCB under it. The PCB only goes from the back plate up to the triangle cutout bordering the right pentagon. Because the PCB is so short, it had to be doubled sided and much taller. There will also reportedly be a traditionally shaped rectangular PCB reference design for AIB's which should work fine in SFF's.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDookieDraws\n\n\njkflipflop98 said:Dang that's a BIG card.

Every current leak says 24GB. The $200 price hike would suck, but if you actually need 24GB of RAM (ie, not gamers), $1400 is a pretty decent deal. What's the cheapest video card up until now that has 24GB RAM?\n\nhttps://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-3000-series-rumored-pricing-rtx-3090-for-1399-rtx-3080-for-799-rtx-3070-for-599-and-rtx-3060-for-399/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter\nBoard IDReplacement ClassvRAMBus WidthLaunch SchedulePG132-102080 Ti24 GB384 bit2H Sept.PG132-202080 Super20 GB320 bit1H Oct.PG132-302080 Super10 GB320 bitMid.

Is that some kind of push-pull wind chamber design?The rear part of the card is likely a straight-through heatsink with some heatpipes, which should be far more effective at dissipating heat than blowing air at the PCB and PCIe slot. With a card likely going to draw over 300W based on Nvidia feeling compelled to come up with something beyond dual AUX8/150W for power, it'll need all the cooling efficiency it can get.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncstokesrodriguez\n\n\nI like how the dude says 2080ti released for 999.99, when in reality you could not find the card for less than 1200 anywhere for what, 8 months? Small gripe but I really hate when articles do this, be honest please. There was no 999.99 version at release, if you wanted the card you paid 1200 or more.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nanonymuos\n\n\nI hope and wish it has at least AV1 accelerated decoding so the next gen can have AV1 encoding\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 24 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk and OpenAI to fast-track trial to December \u2014 suit aims to stop OpenAI's transition to a for-profit company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Atari parts store still open after 41 years, has spent $100K+ designing new parts \u2014 last original Atari hardware launched 32 years ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Huawei Kirin X90 chip revealed in state report \u2014 possible server and PC chip set to replace the aging Kunpeng 920 design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoolIT unleashes 4kW single-phase DLC Cold Plate \u2014 Seemingly timed for Nvidia Blackwell Ultra chips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkira ransomware can be cracked with sixteen RTX 4090 GPUs in around ten hours \u2014 new counterattack breaks encryption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Flower\u2019s beastly 2800W power supply lands at $899 \u2014 enough juice to power a couple of RTX 5090 GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei's Microsoft Windows license for PCs expires this month, company launching PCs with Harmony OS: Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 50-series GPU scalping extends to system integrators \u2014 over $3,000 for a RTX 5090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO gets a $1 million salary plus $68 million in bonuses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNES consoles appear to run faster with age \u2014 APU frequency increased by up to 182 Hz after 35 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Temasek has Walked Away From its Keppel Offer: What Happens Now? \u00b7 The Smart Investor     Royston Yang  Updated 12 August 2020 5 min read       In this article:  BN4.SI         Temasek Holdings has just dropped a bombshell on shareholders of Keppel Corporation Limited (SGX: BN4). In an announcement released over the National Day weekend, the state-owned investment firm has decided that it will not proceed with the partial offer of the oil and gas conglomerate. As a recap, Temasek first announced that it intended to acquire an additional 30.55% of Keppel back in late October 2019.  The offer price was S$7.35 and the intention was for Keppel to remain listed on the local bourse. There were, however, a set of pre-conditions that had to be fulfilled before the offer could take place. Early last month, we had written about whether the Temasek offer may be in jeopardy. The main bugbear, known as \u201cmaterial adverse change\u201d (MAC) clauses, requires Keppel to maintain a certain level of net profit and net asset value for the acquisition to proceed. When Keppel released its second-quarter 2020 earnings on July 30, it reported a massive impairment of S$930 million that caused it to report a net loss of S$537 million for the first half. CEO Loh Chin Hua of Keppel noted, in an analysts Q&A session, that the MAC clause in respect of net profit after tax has not been fulfilled. Now that Temasek has formally withdrawn its offer, Keppel\u2019s share price has slumped 11% to close at S$4.79, a ten-year low. So, what\u2019s next for Keppel? Can it pick itself back up again? Non-cash adjustments First off, investors need to understand that the aforementioned S$930 million impairment is a non-cash item within the profit and loss statement. In simple terms, a non-cash item has no impact on cash flow, which represents the lifeblood of any business. If these impairments are excluded, Keppel would have made a core net profit of S$393 million, which is around 5% higher year on year. Taken in this light, it can be seen that Keppel, as a group, is suffering mainly due to its offshore and marine division. The rest of its divisions are still profitable, which brings us to our next point. Diverse revenue streams Apart from offshore and marine, Keppel also has other divisions such as property, infrastructure and investments. Together, these other divisions have all reported net profits for the second quarter. Being a conglomerate has its advantages \u2013 the different divisions help to cushion against a downturn in any one specific industry. That said the property division is also facing tough conditions due to slower residential sales at Keppel Land. However, other major markets in China and Vietnam have done well. Keppel Land\u2019s commercial property portfolio has also remained resilient despite the pandemic.   Story continues With a residential land bank of around 45,000 units and a commercial portfolio with 1.7 million square metres (half of which are under development), Keppel\u2019s property division looks poised to continue contributing positively to the group for many more years.Infrastructure division has also reported a higher year on year net profit, though part of this came from a reclassification for Keppel Infrastructure Trust (SGX: A7RU).Keppel also managed to raise additional cash through the selling of units in Keppel DC REIT (SGX: AJBU).Vision 2030Keppel\u2019s management has announced its Vision 2030 plan back in late-May that will guide the long-term strategy and transformation of the group.The plan will allow Keppel to evolve into one integrated business and a market leader for sustainable solutions.The group\u2019s business focus will shift to a more asset-light model, and capital allocation will take on a more disciplined approach based on four key criteria.Prospective investments will have to contribute towards Keppel\u2019s long-term 15% return on equity target, possess scalability, be synergistic, and have an alignment with the group\u2019s mission, vision and environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals.The aim is to focus more on renewables and sustainable solutions as oil and gas\u2019 role in the global economy diminish over time.Other promising areas include green data centres and integrated smart district development.The idea is to slowly but steadily grow Keppel\u2019s recurring income while shifting away from lumpy, project-based earnings.Get Smart: A bold vision, but a long wait neededThe withdrawal of the offer by Temasek is a stumbling block for Keppel.However, the group has already set in motion plans to transform the organisation.Management has identified and singled out macro trends such as technology proliferation, ageing populations and rapid urbanisation.The group is ready to identify opportunities arising from a post-COVID-19 world, which will see a changed landscape in the way we work, learn and live.Keppel should be lauded for its bold vision, but investors must brace for a long wait as the group steers itself away from its legacy strengths and embraces new goals.The group still has latent value within it, but it will take time and patience for this value to be eventually realised.With share prices battered to multi-year lows, many attractive investment opportunities have emerged.

Head to play.geforcenow.com and log in with your GeForce NOW account. Signing up is easy, just choose either a paid Founders membership or a free account.\nRight now is a great time to join. We just launched a six-month Founders membership that includes a Hyper Scape Season One Battle Pass token and exclusive Hyper Scape in-game content for $24.95. That\u2019s a $64.94 value.\nOnce logged in, you\u2019re only a couple clicks away from streaming a massive catalog of games. For the best experience, you\u2019ll want to make those clicks with a USB mouse.\nDistance Learning by Day, Distance Gaming by Night\nSome students are heading back to school. Others are distance learning from home. However they\u2019re learning, more students than ever rely on Chromebooks.\nThat\u2019s because Chromebooks are great computers for studying. They\u2019re fast, simple and secure devices that help you stay productive and connected.\nNow, those same Chromebooks transform, instantly, into GeForce-powered distance gaming rigs, thanks to GeForce NOW.\nYour Games on All Your Devices\nMillions of GeForce NOW members play with and against their friends \u2014 no matter which platform they\u2019re streaming on, whether that\u2019s PC, Mac, Android or, now, Chromebooks.\nThat\u2019s because when you stream games using GeForce NOW, you\u2019re playing the PC version from digital stores like Steam, Epic Games Store and Ubisoft Uplay.\nThis is great for developers, who can bring their games to the cloud at launch, without adding development cycles.\nAnd it\u2019s great for the millions of GeForce NOW members. They\u2019re tapping into an existing ecosystem anytime they stream one of more than 650 games instantly. That includes over 70 of the most-played free-to-play games.\nWhen games like CD Projekt Red\u2019s Cyberpunk 2077 come out later this year, members will be able to play using GeForce NOW servers the same day on their Chromebook.\nAnywhere You Go\nChromebooks, of course, are lightweight devices that go where you do. From home to work to school. Or from your bedroom to the living room.\nGeForce NOW is the perfect Chromebook companion. Simply plug in a mouse and go. Our beta release gives Chromebook owners the power to play their favorite PC games.\nNew to GeForce NOW? Check out our GeForce NOW Quick Start Guide to get gaming instantly.\nTake game progress or character level-ups from a desktop to a phone and then onto Chromebook. You\u2019re playing the games you own from your digital game store accounts. So your progress goes with you.\nMore PC Gaming Features Heading to the Cloud\u00a0\nThe heart of GeForce NOW is PC gaming. We continue to tap into the PC ecosystem to bring more PC features to the cloud.\nPC gamers are intimately familiar with Steam. Many have massive libraries from the popular PC game store. To support them, we just launched Steam Game Sync so they can sync games from their Steam library with their library in GeForce NOW. It\u2019s quickly become one of our most popular features for members playing on PC and Mac.\nSoon, Chromebook owners will be able to take advantage of the feature, too.\nOver the past few months, we\u2019ve added two GeForce Experience features. Highlights delivers automatic video capture so you can share your best moments, and Freestyle provides gamers the ability to customize a game\u2019s look. In the weeks ahead, we\u2019ll add support for Ansel \u2014 a powerful in-game camera that lets gamers capture professional-grade screenshots. These features are currently only available on PC and Mac. Look for them to come to Chromebooks in future updates.\nMore games. More platforms. Legendary GeForce performance. And now on Chromebooks. That\u2019s the power to play that only GeForce NOW can deliver.\n\n\nCategories: GamingTags: Cloud Gaming | GeForce NOW \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The state-owned investor was one of several players that bought BlackRock shares when PNC Financial Services Group Inc. sold a US$14 billion stake this year, according to people familiar with the matter. Temasek added 5.95 million shares in the second quarter, according to its 13F filings Friday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The investment has already paid dividends for Temasek, with BlackRock rising 8.4% since June 30, closing Thursday at US$589.56 in New York. Temasek is now the fifth-largest shareholder, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The two companies have worked together in the past, with talks underway for a joint venture in China. Temasek last month reported its worst year since 2016 after the coronavirus pandemic hammered global stocks in March. The firm posted a preliminary portfolio value of S$306 billion (US$223 billion) as of March 31. Temasek held onto gains in its portfolio amid global trade uncertainties after selling S$28 billion (US$20.6 billion) of holdings as U.S. equity markets hit record highs and its unlisted assets outperformed. Temasek Adds BlackRock, Exits BioMarin, Cuts Alibaba: 13F The investor trimmed its U.S. holdings of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. by half in the period, to 12.1 million shares worth $2.6 billion. It added shares of BeiGene Ltd. and China Biologic Products Holdings Inc., according to the filing. Temasek representatives declined to comment. \u00a9 2020 Bloomberg L.P.

Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Earlier, Cliff took us through how NVIDIA built its Selene supercomputer, currently #7 in the world, during the pandemic in 0 to Supercomputer NVIDIA Selene Deployment. Now, we are going to look more at what goes into that type of machine. Note we are going to update this as the talk continues.\nNVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPod Nodes\nWe previously covered the NVIDIA DGX A100 so you can see a bit more about the solution there. The key is that each system has 8x NVIDIA A100 GPUs (no longer a \u201cTesla\u201d brand\u201d.) NVIDIA detailed a bit more about what is behind the system.\nHC32 NVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPOD DGX A100 System Overview\nSome of the interesting facts, we see that NVIDIA is indeed using AMD EPYC 7742 SKUs, not a custom SKU. The system also has a few options. For example, one can have a second dual-port Mellanox ConnectX-6 card for the storage network and optionally use for Ethernet.\nIn terms of topology, the new DGX A100 now uses a 1:1 GPU to NIC ratio. In the previous generation, we generally saw 2:1 ratios. Along with that, the NICs have doubled in speed. Instead of a 100Gbps EDR adapter per two GPUs we now get 2x 200Gbps HDR IB adapters for two GPUs.\nHC32 NVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPOD DGX A100 System Topology\nThere are four PCIe switches and six NVSwitches onboard. The NVSwitch in the image should be \u201cNVSwitch fabric.\u201d In terms of networking, we get a data plane that can be Infiniband or Ethernet. Each CPU gets its own NIC so the system does not need to cross NUMA nodes. If you want to see the previous generation where we take a look at the NVIDIA V100 NVSwitch solution, check out our Inspur NF5488M5 Review.\nNVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPod Design and Topology\nHere is how NVIDIA DGX A100 is designed with modularity. As one can see there are racks for local networking, compute, the centralized fabric and management, and storage racks. NVIDIA is using this model to both allow for upgrades but also to make the solution modular so one can deploy many of these SuperPods quickly.\nHC32 NVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPOD Modularity For Rapid Deployment\nEach SuperPod cluster has 140x DGX A100 machines. 140x 8GPUs each = 1120 GPus in the cluster. We are going to discuss storage later, but the DDN AI400x with Lustre is the primary storage. NVIDIA is also focused on the networking side using a fat-tree topology.\nHC32 NVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPOD Modular Model\nNVIDIA also designed the SuperPod to scale to multiple SuperPods. Here, NVIDIA is using Fat-tree or DragonFly+. Some of the 3D torus topologies are less efficient when it comes to cabling.\nHC32 NVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPOD Extensible Model\nEach DGX A100 gets 8x HDR 200Gbps Infiniband links for compute and two for storage.\nHC32 NVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPOD Multi Node IB Compute\nHere we can see what the networking looks like. On each side of the system we have the compute HDR IB cards.\nHC32 NVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPOD Mellanox 200Gbps HDR Switches\nThere are two storage cards with another port being used for in-band management on one of the storage NICs. There is an additional IPMI OOB management NIC.\nHC32 NVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPOD Design For Performance Radix\nAs part of what NVIDIA is doing with SHARP is that the Mellanox switches are actually doing some of the allreduce overhead computation which offloads this work from the expensive NVIDIA A100\u2019s.\nNVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPod Storage\nEach SuperPod has a Lustre-based parallel filesystem at 2.5PB. These are based on DDN AI400X\u00a0nodes and with ten of them, one gets 490GB/s read and 250GB/s write speeds at 16.6kW.\nHC32 NVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPOD Storage 3\nOne also needs 80x network ports to power this storage. One can clearly see why NVIDIA was interested in Mellanox.\nHC32 NVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPOD Storage 1\nThe remainder of the storage hierarchy, one has memory, NVMe Cache, this Lustre cache, and then object storage. We were told that this 100PB+ and 100GB/s object store is based on Ceph which we covered in our earlier piece.\nHC32 NVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPOD Storage 2\nWhere NVIDIA is clearly going here is moving from making GPUs to making complete solutions. The big question is how long the DDN machines last in future solutions before NVIDIA decides it can build or acquire the best clustered storage for AI and HPC workloads as well. NVIDIA has been working on the interconnect and software, so this is getting closer to becoming a reality.\nBuilding a Multi-SuperPod Solution\nWe covered this more in\u00a00 to Supercomputer NVIDIA Selene Deployment but NVIDIA optimized the in-data center deployment to require a minimum number of employees on-site. It even used a \u201cTrip\u201d robot to have its team remotely check LED status lights. That is a bit strange in some ways. One would expect those LED status lights to be remotely read on a system of this scale/ complexity.\nHC32 NVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPOD Selene Build 1\nNVIDIA shared some of its cabling. By making a standard SuperPod deployment, it was able to standardize much of the cabling which means that cables could be bundled off-site and quickly deployed.\nHC32 NVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPOD Selene Build 2 Cables\nCabling may not seem too exciting, but it takes an enormous amount of time in many supercomputer scale deployments. With this standardization, it makes on-site deployment significantly faster. NVIDIA also told STH that they leave a little bit of extra slack in each line to allow for future upgrades. This slack is needed in the event that ports move on future generations. Re-cabling a system this complex can be extremely costly so this is a way to reduce costs. We should also mention that Mellanox (now part of NVIDIA) can also supply the cables.\nFinal Words\nOverall, one can see the clear direction that NVIDIA is taking here. The big question is how long until we get some of these features broken out further. With the NVIDIA EGX A100 NVIDIA can put the NVIDIA A100\u2019s directly on the fabric. NVIDIA is pushing its software into the storage stack and other products such as\u00a0Mellanox Bluefield-2 IPU SmartNIC can help change the storage paradigm. It seems like the next move here for NVIDIA is to tackle either the CPU side (with Arm?) and/or to start providing storage solutions that are accelerated by the company\u2019s Infiniband and Ethernet fabric.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSDDNDGXDGX A100InfinibandMellanoxNVIDIASuperPod \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleBuilding a Proxmox VE Lab Part 1 PlanningNext articleIBM POWER10 Searching for the Holy Grail of Compute Patrick Kennedyhttps://www.servethehome.comPatrick has been running STH since 2009 and covers a wide variety of SME, SMB, and SOHO IT topics.

For anyone who has built a good looking gaming PC with careful cable management, adding an adaptor into the mix could make things look untidy.It also raises concerns that Nvidia\u2019s new graphics cards, especially the high-end ones, will be seriously power hungry. If this is the case, then not only will people need to use the power adaptor, but they may need to buy a new, more powerful PSU as well.Swapping out a PSU is a big undertaking (we even suggested that it could require upgraders to rip out most of their PC), as well as adding extra expense onto what will already be a very expensive upgrade.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Quasar Zone)(Image credit: Quasar Zone)(Image credit: Quasar Zone)Good newsThere is some good news with these images, however. First, they show the new 12-pin PCIe connector next to an existing eight-pin connector, and there\u2019s not much size difference between the two. This should make installing the connector easier.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Many people were worried that if the 12-pin connector has to be inserted vertically into the top of the GPU, a large connector or adaptor would make that tricky \u2013 but that seems to not be the case.We also heard that Nvidia, and some PSU makers, will be bundling the adaptor, so it shouldn\u2019t cost you anything extra.Still, this all proves that Nvidia\u2019s new GPUs will be very powerful \u2013 and ambitious \u2013 components, and we\u2019re very excited to see more. Luckily, the company has an event on September 1, so we shouldn\u2019t have long to wait at all.Today's best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $38.99View $63ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\u00a0These are the best GPUs of 2020\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nMatt HansonSocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, Core TechMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Core Tech, looking after computing and mobile technology.

The GeForce MX 450 is aimed at entry-level notebooks with a focus on performance faster than integrated graphics solutions while delivering increased efficiency in a range of workloads.\nNVIDIA GeForce MX 450 Dedicated Discrete GPU Brings Turing To Entry-Tier Notebooks - GDDR6 & PCIe 4.0 Support\nWhile the official product page for the GeForce MX450 at NVIDIA's official webpage doesn't say a lot regarding the specifications, there are some details such as the features supported by the GeForce MX class GPUs.\nRelated Story NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDPThe NVIDIA GeForce MX450 is going to be based on the Turing GPU architecture. This is at least what the leaks have indicated. There are a list of technologies that the GeForce MX450 GPU will support such as (via Computerbase):\n\nNVIDIA Optimus technology\nNVIDIA GPU Boost\nNVIDIA Game Ready driver\nNVIDIA CUDA technology\nPCI Express 4.0\nMicrosoft DirectX 12\nSupports Vulkan 1.2\nOpenGL 4.6 support\nOpenCL 1.2 support\n\nIn terms of technical specifications, the NVIDIA GeForce MX450 is listed to feature both GDDR5 and GDDR6 memory. Previously leaked information from NotebookCheck suggests that the MX450 will utilize the Turing TU117 GPU core which is based on the 12nm FinFET process node. The MX450 is said to feature up to 896 CUDA cores and a base clock of 540 MHz. The memory is supposed to be running at 10 Gbps across a 64-bit bus which should deliver 80 GB/s bandwidth to the GPU. The G5 memory runs at a slower clock rate of 7 Gbps and should deliver 56 GB/s bandwidth to the GPU.\n\nAs for the TDP, the NVIDIA GeForce MX450 will feature a 25W configuration but we cannot confirm if that's the base variant with GDDR5 memory or the faster GDDR6 variant. The NVIDIA GeForce MX 430 is also expected to launch soon and could feature 768-896 CUDA cores. The addition of PCIe 4 isn't a big deal as it doesn't contribute to extra performance. The standard GeForce RTX & GeForce GTX Turing offers still utilize the PCIe 3.0 protocol on mobile platforms.\nNVIDIA GeForce MX Series GPU Family Specifications:\n\n\n\nGPU NameGPU ArchitectureCUDA CoresGPU ClockMemory SpeedMemory BusTDP\n\n\n\n\nGeForce MX570Ampere GA1072048TBA - 1155 MHz12 Gbps GDDR664-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX550Turing TU1171024TBA - 1320 MHz12 Gbps GDDR664-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 450Turing TU117896540 - 1575 MHz10 Gbps GDDR664-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 430Turing TU117896TBA - TBA MHz10 Gbps GDDR6\n7 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 350Pascal GP1076401354-1468 MHz7 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 350Pascal GP107640746-937 MHz7 Gbps GDDR564-bit15W\n\n\nGeForce MX 330Pascal GP1083841531-1594 MHz6/7 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 310Pascal GP1082561341-1379 MHz6/7 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 250Pascal GP1083841518-1582 MHz6/7 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 250Pascal GP108384937-1038 MHz6 Gbps GDDR564-bit10.5W\n\n\nGeForce MX 230Pascal GP1082561518-1531 MHz6/7 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 150Pascal GP1083841468-1531 MHz6 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 150Pascal GP108384937-1038 MHz5 Gbps GDDR564-bit10W\n\n\nGeForce MX 130Maxwell GM1083841122-1242 MHz6 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 110Maxwell GM108256963-993 MHz1.8 Gbps DDR364-bit10W\n\n\n\nBased on the numbers, we can expect anywhere between 80-90% performance of the GeForce GTX 1650 which would be amazing for an entry-level 25W laptop chip. A leaked Tiger Lake laptop with a GeForce MX450 graphics option leaked out a while ago from Lenovo. It looks like the MX450 will be primarily featured on Intel Tiger Lake-based laptops since the 11th Gen Intel lineup is the only note book family that is compliant with the PCIe Gen 4.0 protocol. It's also noteworthy that Intel's Tiger Lake Xe GPUs featured on the same laptops are also NVIDIA's main competitor in this segment.\nIt will definitely be an interesting comparison between the new GeForce MX Turing based GPUs and the integrated parts from AMD and Intel in the second half of 2020 as all three vendors try to offer extra graphics performance in entry-level notebook designs.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Rolls Out GeForce Driver 572.60 To Fix Black Screen Issues Related To RTX 50 Series GPUs\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n160\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Before you read\nthis, however, keep in mind that this is a rumor. We were not able to verify the authenticity of the source and you are reading this post at your own risk. If unverified posts that could turn out to be fake aren't your piece of cake, stop reading now. The only reason we are covering this rumor is that it coincides with something Kopite (a very well known leaker) posted and Cyberpunkcat has correctly leaked HBM details in the past. It could very well turn out to be a fake. You have been warned.\nRelated Story NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 SUPER Founders Edition Graphics Card Pictured Once AgainAlleged NVIDIA RTX 3090 Performance Benchmark Slides Leak Out\nSince you have decided to continue reading despite the warnings, let's dig into it. The slides are allegedly draft slides being prepared for the announcement. The first slide is a simple mockup of the RTX 3090 with the basic specs: 5248 cores, 24GB of GDDR6 memory and 19.5 Gbps memory clock. I have to note here that these slides (if they are legit) are likely the draft versions and unlikely to be the final polished presentation we usually see from NVIDIA.\n\nThe benchmark slides on the other hand showcase three gaming titles with the latest version of DLSS and over 2 times the performance of the RTX 2080 Ti. The RTX 3090 will apparently yield more than 2x the performance in Control, exactly twice the performance in Minecraft RTX and slightly less than twice the performance in Wolfenstien: Youngblood. These are all titles that support NVIDIA's RTX tech and with DLSS enabled you can actually play these in glorious 4K resolution.\nThe leak itself was posted by an unknown twitter account that was vouched for and vetted by CyberPunkCat:\n\nCredit @yuten0x pic.twitter.com/T4YRTNVir4\n\u2014 CyberPunkCat (@CyberCatPunk) August 31, 2020\n\nInterestingly, just a few moments before, Kopite (a very well known leaker that has been spot on about everything) had posted the exact same benchmark names which lends credence to this rumor. While it is possible to fake these slides in 5 minutes, combined with CyberPunkCat's vouch for the leaker, it did at least merit coverage as a rumor.\n\nControl, Minecraft RTX, Wolfenstein: Youngblood.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) August 31, 2020\n\nIn any case, we will know in just over a day whether this is true or not. In case it turns out to be false, we will update the post with the debunked tag.\nWhat we know about NVIDIA SKUs:\nSince we do not know the confirmed naming schemes yet, I will refer to these boards according to their board numbers and the RTX 2000 series card they are intended to replace.\n\nThe crown jewel of NVIDIA's lineup is the PG132-10 board with 24GB of vRAM. It is going to be replacing the RTX 2080 Ti and is currently scheduled to launch in the second half of September.\nWe then have the PG132-20 and PG132-30 boards, both of which are replacing the RTX 2080 SUPER graphics card and will have 20GB and 10GB worth of vRAM respectively. The PG132-20 board is going to be launching in the first half of October while the PG132-30 board is going to be launching in mid-September. It is worth adding here that these three parts are likely the SKU10, 20 and 30 we have been hearing about and the SKU20 is going to be targetted dead center at AMD's Big Navi offering (and hence the staggered launch schedule). Since AMD's Big Navi will *probably* have 16GB worth of vRAM, it also explains why NVIDIA wants to go with 20GB.\nThe PG142-0 and PG142-10 are both going to be replacing the RTX 2070 SUPER and will feature 16GB and 8GB worth of vRAM respectively. While the PG142-10 has a known launch schedule in the second half of September, the PG142-0 board has no confirmed launch date yet.\nFinally, we have the PG190-10 board which is going to be replacing the RTX 2060 SUPER graphics card and will have 8GB of vRAM as well. The launch schedule for this board has not been decided yet either.\n\nNVIDIA Ampere GPUs Partial Specs And Launch Dates\n\n\n\nBoard ID Replacement ClassvRAMBus WidthLaunch Schedule \n\n\n\n\nPG132-102080 Ti 24 GB384 bit2H Sept. \n\n\nPG132-202080 Super20 GB320 bit1H Oct. \n\n\nPG132-302080 Super10 GB320 bitMid.

But please keep in mind that NVIDIA has previously skipped nomenclature tiers just to discredit the leak scene and may do so again. The shrouds we saw were only in the validation phase and it would be trivial for NVIDIA to change the naming scheme. The board numbers, however, would stay the same. Regardless of what NVIDIA decides to call it, this is shaping up to be one hell of a generation.\nNVIDIA GeForce #UltimateCountdownCountdown\n\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA GeForce 'Ampere' GPU are you waiting for the most?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080/3090 GPU, Laptop, and Desktop Purchases Come Bundled with Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man Remastered for a Limited Time\n\nUle Lopez\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Almost Launched As The RTX 3090 SUPER As Leak Reveals\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Compares GeForce RTX 3090 Rendering Performance To An AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X 64 Core CPU, Cuts An Hour of Render Time\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Behemoth Graphics Card Up To 10% Faster Than RTX 3090 & Clocks Around 2 GHz\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n219\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n115\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n103\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n55\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n40\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1151\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

According to a new report, team green has seen its dGPU market share jump from 75% in Q1 2020 to 80% in the second quarter. \nJon Peddie Research's Q2 2020 \"Market Watch\" report shows that desktop graphics add-in board sales increased 6.55% from Q1 2020. Intel doesn't (yet) have any product in this field, so Nvidia's 5% quarterly increase has come from AMD, which drops to 20%.\n\nIt's a different story when it comes to overall graphics, which Intel rules because of the integrated GPUs it offers in many of its CPUs. Chipzilla takes 64% of this sector---down 3%---while Nvidia's share jumped from 16% to 19%, and AMD was up 1% to 18% QoQ.\nIt was good news for both gaming giants, as AMD's overall unit shipments were up 8.4% QoQ while Nvidia's jumped 17.8%. Intel, however, was down 2.7%.\n\nJon Peddie notes that the second quarter is usually down compared to Q1, but the increase in people working from home and gaming---both a result of the pandemic---meant this quarter was up.\n\"The pandemic has been disruptive and had varying effects on the market. Some sales that might have occurred in Q3 (such as notebooks for the back-to-school season) have been pulled in to Q2 while desktop sales declined. Intel's manufacturing challenges have also negatively affected desktop sales,\" wrote Jon Peddie, President of JPR.\n\"We believe the stay at home orders have continued to increase demand in spite of the record-setting unemployment levels. As economies open up, consumer confidence will be an important metric to watch.\" \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Asus raises RTX 5090 and RX 9070 prices, making graphics cards even more expensive \n\n\n\n Intel's new CEO lands $66M pay deal, with stock performance conditions \n\n\n\nAmpere already looks exciting, but Nvidia will have to contend with AMD's Big Navi release this year, while 2021 sees the launch of Intel's Xe HPG Gaming GPUs.

Now that we are in the home stretch, leaks have shifted to what look like official press renders, from a pair of upcoming Gainward Phoenix Golden Sample cards, with specifications listed for the GeForce RTX 3090 and GeForce RTX 3080.\n\n\nAssuming these renders are the real deal\u2014and they certainly look like it\u2014they pretty much confirm what the specifications will be on those SKUs, and that NVIDIA will in fact be rolling into next-gen territory with the 'GeForce RTX 3000 series' nomenclature (past rumors had called this into question). So, what do we have here? Let's have a look...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the back of the retail packaging, the GeForce RTX 3090 sports 5,248 CUDA cores and 24GB of GDDR6X memory (19.5Gbps) on a 384-bit bus, yielding 936GB/s of memory bandwidth. Gainward also lists the card as having a 1,725MHz boost clock and a 350W TDP.\n\n\nFor the GeForce RTX 3080, the packaging shows 4,352 CUDA cores and 10GB of GDDR6X memory (19Gbps) on a 320-bit bus, for 760GB/s of memory bandwidth, along with a 1,740MHz boost clock and 320W TDP.\nGainward GeForce RTX 3080 Ampere Card - Credit: Videocardz\n\nNote that both of these cards are Phoenix Golden Sample editions with factory overclocks. According to previous leaks and rumors, the boost clocks will be 1,695MHz on the GeForce RTX 3090 and 1,710MHz on the GeForce RTX 3080. So we are looking at modest bumps on Gainward's overclocked models.\n\n\nThe packaging also specifically references 7-nanometer manufacturing, along with second-generating ray tracing cores, third-generation Tensor cores, DirectX 12 Ultimate support, NVLink (SLI) on the GeForce RTX 3090 only, three DisplayPort 1.4a connectors, and HDMI 2.1 connectivity.\n\n\nNVIDIA is expected to formally introduce the GeForce RTX 3090, GeForce RTX 3080, and GeForce RTX 3070 during a scheduled GeForce Special Event on Tuesday, September 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, (nasdaq:nvda), gainward, geforce rtx 3080, geforce rtx 3090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

The video ostensibly recaps 20 years of graphics card design technology. It specifically considers the challenges engineers and designers face in keeping the GPUs running cool, so they can do their job without combusting, or more reasonably, throttling.\nThe information presented starts with fundamental concepts such as the conservation of energy, and looks at the three ways that the heat generated by the billions of GPU transistors switching millions of times per second can be removed from the system (thermal radiation, conduction, and convection).\n\nWhile we mull these concepts the video flashes progress made in Nvidia graphics card designs over the years and you can see familiar models and their cooling assemblies at various angles and in exploded views. With the talking heads discussing the increasing problem of power density and cooling, one starts to get the idea that Nvidia's upcoming graphics cards have been a bit of a challenge to cool.\nSome sections of the Nvidia video turn more precisely to ponder over 'modern challenges' - thermal issues that the engineers and designers are facing now, or have faced recently with Ampere GPUs. In a section starting at about 6 minutes we are then treated to a view of the new 12-pin power connector which will replace the typical 2x 8 pin connectors on high-end boards.\n\nThe animation showing the power connector replacement, which we know arrives with the introduction of the GeForce RTX30 series of consumer graphics cards, clearly shows the unusual shape of the PCB that features in this design.\nBack in June we first heard about this pennant shaped PCB dubbed PG133. This unusually shaped PCB complements the double sided fan design of the RTX 30 Founders Editions. There is also supposed to be a more standard rectangular PCB dubbed PG132 for board partners to utilise versions of their typical cooling shrouds we have seen on previous gen graphics cards.\n\nIn its accompanying blog post Nvidia says that its engineers and designers have pondered over the following points to create cool and quiet GPUs that can reach their maximum potential:\n\n\nThermal: A new, airflow-optimized cooling solution, redesigned to overcome existing constraints and move more air through the system for maximum cooling efficiency\nMechanical: A stronger mechanical structure, including a new low profile leaf spring that leaves room for a back cover\nElectrical: A compact electrical design, with a new 12-pin power connector that allows more space for components and cooling, and is compatible with existing power supplies via an included adapter\nProduct Design: A no-compromise, cohesive design that embraces the revolutionary thermal solution while beautifully harmonizing each element of the graphics card\n\n\nAs a reminder, Nvidia's GeForce Special Event will be live next Tuesday, 1st Sept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 30 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

That's why the Nvidia Shield TV Pro caught my attention, as it offers some impressive features and controls that should please even those with the highest standards.\n\n\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused lots of us to spend more time at home than ever, and that has meant a lot of us are streaming television and movies more than ever. While image quality does not matter that much to most people, for photographers and videographers with more discerning eyes, image quality can make a huge difference in our enjoyment of content.\u00a0\nWhen I moved a few years ago, I was pretty insistent on getting a top-of-the-line television. I watch a lot of movies, and using cheaper panels can adversely affect your ability to watch a movie more than you might think, especially when it comes to dynamic range. The television was my personal splurge for my new place. So, I needed up getting a 65-inch LG E8. The E8 uses an OLED panel, which is the key to its image quality. The beauty of OLED panels is that there is no separate backlight, meaning every pixel can be turned on and off individually. This gives them an infinite contrast range, which in practical purposes, translates to very rich and natural dynamic range that far surpasses any other panel type. They also offer huge viewing angles with no loss of quality. Lastly, like most modern televisions, this model had 4K resolution.\nSo far, the OLED television, though expensive, has absolutely been worth the price. I remember my girlfriend remarking on how the infamously dark eighth season of Game of Thrones was suddenly perfectly viewable using our new television. So, what was the problem? The resolution. While 4K content is starting to become more common, the vast majority of streaming content is 1080p or even 720p, while streaming compression also reduces image quality.\u00a0\nI've used an Apple TV 4K for all my content consumption for the past few years. It's a fantastic device that offers access to all the popular streaming services all wrapped up in a straightforward and reliable interface. The only issue I had, which is no fault of the Apple TV's, is that so much content is not in 4K. In fact, I would estimate that greater than 95% of what I watch is 1080p or less. Classic binge-able shows like The Office, Parks and Rec, and Arrested Development are typically in 720p, with some later seasons in 1080p. The science documentaries I love range from 480i\u00a0to 1080p. Most movies made before the last few years top out at 1080p.\u00a0\nThis is why the Nvidia Shield TV Pro caught my attention. It's a top of the line streaming box, but its real claim to fame is its AI upscaling, which claims to take lower-resolution video and intelligently upscale it for consumption on a 4K screen. Nvidia used a deep learning model trained offline on a range of popular television shows and movies. The model then makes real-time predictions of what content would look like at 4K based on its lower resolution and automatically upscales it, delivering it at 4K and up to 30 fps. So long as the video resolution is not less than 480p, the frame rate isn't higher than 30 fps, or the color space isn't RGB, the AI upscaling feature will work, regardless of whether it's Netflix, HBO, YouTube, or some other source. For those who are discerning about image quality, it sounds like a fantastic step into the future, not unlike many of the AI image-editing applications and features we've seen begin to take hold. Before we talk about that feature, let's look at the entire device.\nSpecs\n\nSupports playback at up to 4K resolution\u00a0\nHDR10 and Dolby Vision support\n3 GB of RAM, 16 GB of storage, expandable via USB\nAndroid TV interface\nWi-Fi 5 and Ethernet connection\nBacklit remote with built-in microphone with\u00a0support for\u00a0Google Assistant and Alexa\nTegra X1+ processor\nPlex media server built in\nDolby Atmos support\nLost remote finder\nBluetooth 5.0 + LE\nCEC over HDMI support\nNVIDIA GeForce NOW game streaming service support\nChromecast support\n\nDesign and Setup\nThe Shield TV Pro is an attractive device. It is actually quite small, about the size of a paperback, with angled lines etched across it and a green LED (its brightness can be adjusted or it can be turned off entirely\u00a0if you would prefer). On the back are two USB 3.0 expansion ports, a 4K HDR HDMI port, Ethernet port, and power port. Wi-Fi is 802.11ac. It does not come with an HDMI cord.\u00a0\n\nSetup was very easy. I plugged in the power and HDMI cables and followed the on-screen guide. If you have an Android phone, you can simply log in with your phone and the device will populate your apps. I don't, so I had to download my apps manually, but the process was\u00a0perfectly fine. The Google Play store has all the major streaming platforms as well as many niche options, and I had no problem finding everything I like to watch. The only thing you won't be able to access is an iTunes library if you have one.\u00a0The Shield TV Pro uses the stock Android TV OS. The design and user experience is definitely not as slick and straightforward as Apple's\u00a0tvOS, but it is workable, and it does not take too long to get your bearings using it. The remote is comfortable to use and features motion-activated backlighting and the ability to make it\u00a0beep if you've lost it, both nice touches.\nImage Quality Features\nThat's really why you're here. If this was just any other streaming device, there wouldn't be much point in discussing it at all, at least not here. But the Shield TV Pro offers features that promise to give the best possible image quality for those who have the highest standards.\u00a0\nThe Nvidia Shield TV Pro offers a wider range of display options than most devices, giving a range of 89 selectable display profiles that feature different resolutions, display refresh rates, color encoding systems, etc., though it normally defaults to the proper setting that maximizes the capabilities of your television. You can also switch between Rec. 709 and 2020 manually or automatically depending on the source content. Altogether, this gives a wide range of customizable profiles.\nA Nvidia demonstration of the AI upscaling\n\nThe marquee feature, the AI upscaling, promises to make content below 4K look sharper, helping 4K users to get the most from their devices. Nvidia\u00a0trained it by feeding a neural network thousands of hours of footage.\nHow does it work in practice? Extremely well. Results are natural, with no artifacts or oversharpening, but the difference is highly impressive. I left the feature on the default medium setting, though it offers low and high settings (or you can disable it entirely).\u00a0Watching an episode from season three of Arrested Development that streams at 720p,\u00a0there was a scene in which Gob is wearing a button-down shirt with an intricately woven pattern. With the AI upscaling turned off, there just isn't enough resolution to see much of the pattern beyond vague areas of light and dark caused by the shadows cast by the weaving. Turning on the AI upscaling\u00a0instantly brings the shirt's pattern into perfect clarity, noticeably improving the picture quality.\nWhen watching an episode from season three of The Office on Netflix that streams at 720p, the talking heads interviews that are a staple of the show look passable, but you can't make out much of the skin texture on the character's faces. Turning on the AI upscaling\u00a0produced a marked difference, as every pore was suddenly visible (in a natural way), irises became vivid and crisp, and individual strands of hair were noticeable. It made things look more lifelike without looking overengineered. An episode from the first season of House, originally broadcast in 480i, looked particularly behind the times on a modern television. Sure, you can watch it and follow the story just fine, but reading things like the fine print on something like a medical monitor in a shot is difficult at best. Turning on the AI upscaling brings all those details into crisp relief.\u00a0\nWhat helps the AI upscaling\u00a0looks so organic is that it does a great job of only enhancing the areas that need it. It generally leaves large, uniform patches of color and texture alone, helping to avoid any artifacts or the appearance of oversharpening. There is also a demo mode that allows you to put a before/after slider on the screen in real-time to see the difference, though it's notable enough that you don't need it.\u00a0\nWhat I Liked\n\nGranular controls for power users\nBacklit remote\nAI upscaling is highly impressive and notably improves image quality\n\nWhat I Didn't Like\n\nInterface needs a bit more polish\nLow internal storage\n\nConclusion\nI have seen the future, and it is impressive. At $199, the Nvidia Shield Pro TV is absolutely on the high end of streaming devices and more than most people need, particularly when you can pick up something like a Roku stick for around $25 (which I use on my bedroom television and enjoy). But on the other hand, if you are someone who has a discerning eye and enjoys the best image quality (i.e.\u00a0you're a photographer), the Shield Pro TV is absolutely worth the improvement in image quality. It's important to remember, after all, that while a lot of televisions can display 4K, the majority of content is delivered in 1080p or less. The Shield Pro TV goes a long way to bridging\u00a0that gap. You can get yours here.\n \nTopics:\u00a0Fstoppers OriginalsGearReviews \n 1 Comment \n\n\n  \n\n\nAbout Alex Cooke\n\nFollow \n cookestudios.com \n\n\nAlex Cooke is a Cleveland-based portrait, events, and landscape photographer.

To assist in better and faster content creation, we\u2019ve worked with our software partners on a series of app releases and updates to Adobe Premiere Rush, Premiere Pro, Blender, V-Ray 5 for Maya, Flicker Free, and BorisFX Optics \u2014 all supported in the new August NVIDIA Studio Driver, available for download today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdobe Premiere Rush and Premiere Pro\nCreators have been in awe over Adobe\u2019s Auto Reframe feature in Premiere Pro, and now for the first time, Auto Reframe is available in Premiere Rush! Powered by Adobe Sensei AI, Auto Reframe automatically keeps the most important part of your shot in frame when reformatting aspect ratios for various social media sizes - saving video editors countless hours of manual adjustments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdobe has also recently introduced Scene Edit Detection in the Premiere Pro public beta, a new Sensei AI feature optimized by NVIDIA GPUs that quickly detects and\u00a0tags cuts in final video files. Editors will no longer have to undergo painstakingly long scrubbing sessions just to make manual edits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth updates save editors valuable time, offering greater flexibility to edit footage after AI has done the heavy lifting, leaving more time to focus on art and storytelling.\n\u201cWe work closely with NVIDIA to deliver GPU-enhanced features that help make Adobe applications more robust and powerful,\u201d says Sue Skidmore, head of partner relations, Adobe Creative Cloud Video. \u201cWith NVIDIA encode acceleration in Adobe Premiere Pro, editors can export high-resolution videos up to 500% faster than on CPU. And now, powerful new Adobe Sensei-enabled tools like Auto Reframe in Premiere Rush and Scene Edit Detection in Premiere Pro use NVIDIA GPUs to help creators dream up high-quality content faster than ever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlender Cycles\nPrevious work by Blender helped add support for NVIDIA\u2019s OptiX rendering engine, which utilizes RT Core accelerated ray tracing and Tensor Core accelerated AI denoising. It\u2019s a process that predicts final images from partially rendered results while they\u2019re designing in the viewport, allowing users to explore new ideas and quickly iterate on design choices. Until now, OptiX-accelerated rendering was only available on NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\nWith Blender 2.90 this game-changing advancement becomes available on all NVIDIA GPUs, offering greater accessibility for 3D designers and artists. Artists with older GPUs and systems with a mix of RTX and non-RTX GPUs can now render scenes with OptiX. For non-RTX GPUs, rendering runs on the CUDA Cores. On RTX GPUs, rendering gets big speedups from RT Cores and Tensor Cores.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe update also adds NVLink support so multiple GPUs can be connected in a single system, dramatically speeding up rendering in scenes larger than one GPU\u2019s memory capacity. Blender 2.90 will be released on August 26. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV-Ray 5 GPU for Maya\nChaos Group\u2019s V-Ray 5 release is now ready for Autodesk Maya users with out-of-core geometry support for rendering using NVIDIA CUDA, improving performance working with large scenes that aren\u2019t able to fit into the GPU\u2019s memory.\nWith this comes new GPU-accelerated features for lighting, materials and color management, such as LightMix to experiment with lighting changes after rendering and Layer Compositing to fine-tune and finish your images directly in the V-Ray frame buffer. This removes the need for a separate post-processing app.\nAdditional features include Light Path Expressions, Sun & Sky model, Expanded Materials, and ACEScg support. Finally, V-Ray GPU 5 adds a number of features that were previously only available on the CPU-only version, including 2D Displacement, OSL patterns, Phoenix Particle Shader, tyFlow support, improved shadow catching, and IBL ground projection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage courtesy of Chaos Group \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlicker Free\nPopular with video editors specializing in Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects, Flicker Free is a powerful plugin and a simple way to remove annoying flicker from video footage. Flicker Free will soon be offering greatly enhanced motion to detect and delineate independently moving objects, even in the presence of camera motion, eliminating flicker caused by out of sync cameras, time-lapse, or slow-motion video. The update adds CUDA support to Flicker Free, providing results up to 8x faster than a standalone CPU. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nImage courtesy of Digital Anarchy\nDigital Anarchy's testing shows that the CUDA update in Flicker Free 2.0 enables staggering speed increases across the board: 3x with HD footage and 10x with 4K.

Despite strong demand for 5G products driven by WFH and distance education needs, Qualcomm\u2019s upward momentum in 2Q20 was constrained due to the delayed release of Apple\u2019s latest iPhones. TrendForce analyst C.Y. Yao indicates that new product releases by Apple during third quarters had typically contributed to Qualcomm\u2019s second quarter revenues in the past. Delayed iPhone releases this year, however, led to a slowdown in Qualcomm\u2019s chip revenue growth. Qualcomm registered a modest 6.7% revenue growth YoY in 2Q20. On the other hand, although Broadcom retook first place in terms of quarterly revenue, escalating tensions between China and the U.S. had a negative effect on its semiconductor revenue performance, which declined by 6.8% YoY in 2Q20. Nvidia now includes revenue from Mellanox as part of its data center revenue after the former acquired the latter earlier this year. The addition of Mellanox was able to compensate for Nvidia\u2019s shortfall in professional visualization and automotive revenue. On the whole, Nvidia posted excellent revenue performance for 2Q20 and increased its revenue by 47.1% YoY, the highest percentage growth in the top 10 list. AMD scored the second highest YoY percentage growth in 2Q20, at 26.2%, behind Nvidia, due to the outstanding receptions of its Ryzen and EPYC processors in the notebook and server markets, respectively. Xilinx has traditionally counted the wired and wireless network equipment market as one of its main revenue drivers. However, the department responsible for those markets posted a 33.2% YoY decrease in quarterly revenue, and the COVID-19 pandemic took a heavy toll on the global automotive market, leading to a decline in Xilinx\u2019s automotive revenue. For the first time ever, Xilinx registered a double-digit YoY quarterly decline. Likewise, Dialog saw decreased revenue from its custom mixed-signal IC, leading to a YoY decrease of 10.1% in overall 2Q20 revenue. In the face of escalating sanctions by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Huawei subsidiary HiSilicon is unlikely to fulfill chip demand from Huawei\u2019s various product lines. Since U.S.-China tensions are yet to improve, HiSilicon\u2019s new Kirin processors to be released in 2H20 is expected to be the final mobile processor released by the company. Much like the Kirin, other chips from Huawei, including server CPUs, AI chips, and 5G chips, may face a similar fate. Taiwanese IC design companies MediaTek and Realtek maintained their excellent performances during the quarter, reaching YoY revenue growths of 14.2% and 18.8%, respectively. In particular, MediaTek was able to successfully deploy its products to the 5G mid-range smartphone market with its 7nm process technology and cost optimization measures, in turn raising its revenue and gross margins. C.Y. Yao believes that, on the whole, the outlook for the global IC design revenue in 2020 is relatively positive because of strong demand in 3Q20 for WFH- and distance education-related products, in addition to component demand from the data center, 5G infrastructure, and 5G smartphone markets. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\tContact TrendForce\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tFill out this form for contacting a  TrendForce  representative.\n\n\n\nYour Name:\n\nYour E-mail\n\t\t\taddress:\n\nYour Company\n\t\t\taddress:\n\nYour Phone Number:\n\nWrite your message:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Silicon IP\n\n16,000 IP Cores from 450 Vendors\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRelated News\n\n\n\n\nTotal Revenue of Global Top 10 IC Design Houses for 3Q22 Showed QoQ Drop of 5.3%; Broadcom Returned to No. 2 Spot in Revenue Ranking by Overtaking NVIDIA and AMD, Says TrendForce\n\nTotal Revenue of Top 10 Foundries Expected to Increase by 18% YoY in 4Q20 While UMC Overtakes GlobalFoundries for Third Place, Says TrendForce\n\nWorld's Top Ten IC Design Company Revenue Reached US$39.43 billion in 1Q22, Marvell Growth Rate Tops List, Says TrendForce\n\nNew iPhone Models Become Key to Qualcomm's Top Spot in 3Q20 Revenue Ranking of Global Top 10 IC Design (Fabless) Companies, Says TrendForce\n\nQualcomm Retakes Market Leadership in 1Q20 Revenue Ranking of Global Top 10 IC Design Companies, Says TrendForce\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee TrendForce Latest News >>\n\n\n\nBreaking News\n\n\n\n\nArteris Selected by Nextchip to Accelerate Chip Designs for Automotive Vision Technology\n\n\nCadence Joins Intel Foundry Accelerator Design Services Alliance\n\n\nChina Bets on Homegrown Chip Tech With RISC-V Push\n\n\nThe Case for Hardware-Assisted Verification in Complex SoCs\n\n\nSerDes Hard Macro IP in GlobalFoundries 22FDX - Available For Licensing and Implementation from Global IP Core\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee Latest News >>\n\n\n\nMost Popular \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tChina Bets on Homegrown Chip Tech With RISC-V Push\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tIntel's New CEO Called \"Strong Choice\" to Respin Company\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSerDes Hard Macro IP in GlobalFoundries 22FDX - Available For Licensing and Implementation from Global IP Core\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tThe Case for Hardware-Assisted Verification in Complex SoCs\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tCadence Joins Intel Foundry Accelerator Design Services Alliance\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee the Top 20 >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail This Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinter-Friendly Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 Design And Reuse All Rights Reserved.\nNo portion of this site may be copied, retransmitted, reposted, duplicated or otherwise used without the express written permission of Design And Reuse.\n\n\n\nPartner with us\n\n\n\n\nPartner with us\n\n\n\nList your Products\nSuppliers, list\n\tyour IPs for free.\n\nList your Products\n\n\n\nDesign-Reuse.com\n\nContact Us\nAbout us\nD&R Partner Program\nAdvertise with Us\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

If you need a fresh cable or power supply to run a new Ampere GPU, after all, that could push you toward the competition.\u00a0But in pictures revealed by German site Hardwareluxx.de, the 12-pin connector makes a pretty compelling case for why it might be preferred.\nHardwareluxx.de actually got a hold of a cable from power supply maker Seasonic (which also spilled the beans about these connectors on Chinese social site bilibili). Editor Andreas Schilling\u00a0posted a tweet showing the new 12-pin connector next to the standard dual 8-pin connectors used on high-end graphics cards.\n\nAs you can see, the new Nvidia connector is tiny. Really tiny. It was always expected to be smaller than a standard connector, but seeing the new Nvidia 12-pin next to a standard connector now puts it all in perspective.\n[ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ]\n Twitter\n\nA comparison photo posted by Hardwareluxx.de\u2019s Andreas Schilling shows just how tiny Nvidia\u2019s apparent 12-pin power plug is next to a conventional 8-pin connector.\n\n\nWhen Nvidia\u2019s 12-pin connector broke cover last month as a rumor, it was mostly pitched as an OEM-only part. PC OEMs often break standards to improve production line speed or to improve on a specification they believe is holding back PCs.\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s tiny 12-pin connector is also expected to supply a beefy dose of wattage\u2014648 watts, according to Tom\u2019s Hardware. If true, that means a single cable plus the power from the PCIe slot should be plenty for Nvidia\u2019s new \u201cAmpere\u201d GPU-based GeForce RTX 30-series graphics cards.\nMoving to smaller connectors on a graphics card\u2019s PCB opens more room for a beefy heat sink. The cabling doesn\u2019t shrink much so there\u2019s still a lot of cord to wrangle, but a single 12-pin for the cards would mean no longer having to deal with figuring out the occasionally finicky combo plugs in use today.\nWith standard power cable designs, you have to convert 6+2 pins into 8 pin (or back) when installing the GPU. A single 12-pin eliminates the time wasted, and the potential for confusion among builders.\n Gordon Mah Ung\n\nNvidia\u2019s 12-pin connector should let board makers enable dual 12-pin connectors for designs that might need it.\u00a0\n\n\nThe 12-pin plug also means if a card required it\u2014and there\u2019s no evidence it does\u2014a dual 12-pin connector would occupy the same board space as a dual 8-pin connector. While there\u2019s no indication yet that Nvidia\u2019s upcoming boards will need a dual 12-pin configuration, such a design should be possible in theory. That paves the way for over the top designs such as this limited-edition ROG GeForce GTX 580 Asus Mars II that featured three 8-pin connectors.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Since PG132 is the board number that AIBs will use, this is likely the Founders Edition card that NVIDIA will ship themselves. Since it has just passed RRA certification, it is also likely that this card will be available shortly. We have previously seen the wacky new design from NVIDIA for the RTX 3080 and we believe this is it.\nNVIDIA RTX 3090 FE GPU board passes RRA certification\nKorea's RRA certification is required for every IC that is going to be made available to the public and usually one of the most prominent indicators of an imminent release (although it can show up anywhere from a month to 6 months before release). This particular PG number is in line with the part numbers that we know belong to the NVIDIA Ampere lineup.\nThe star of NVIDIA's lineup is the GA102 part with board number PG132 (in SKU 10, 20 and 30 variants) and according to kopite, this board number has been made exclusively for AIBs. The PG133 board number is for NVIDIA's own, inhouse founders edition. This means that you are looking at either the RTX 3090 Founders Edition or the RTX 3080 Founders Edition (or whatever NVIDIA decides to call the cards).\n\nWe have already revealed the identities of multiple PG branded boards and according to the nomenclature, the PG136 board would likely be the RTX 3080/3070 FE.\nNVIDIA Ampere GPUs Partial Specs And Launch Dates\n\n\n\nBoard ID Replacement ClassvRAMBus WidthLaunch Schedule \n\n\n\n\nPG132-102080 Ti 24 GB384 bit2H Sept. \n\n\nPG132-202080 Super20 GB320 bit1H Oct. \n\n\nPG132-302080 Super10 GB320 bitMid.

Turing, Turing the current generation that we're in, is the world's first ray tracing GPU.\nAnd it fuses -- the RTX technology fuses three fundamental technologies: the programmable shader that we introduced a long time ago that revolutionized computer graphics, and we added two new technologies. One technology is a ray tracing acceleration core that makes the tracing of rays and looking for intersections between the ray and the scene -- objects in scene super, super fast. And that's -- it's a complicated problem. It's a super complicated problem.\nWe want it to be running concurrently to shading so that the ray traversal and the shading of the pixels could be done independently and concurrently. The second thing is we invented this technology to bring AI, artificial intelligence, using this new type of algorithm called deep learning to computer graphics. And one example of its capability is the algorithm we introduced called DLSS, Deep Learning Super Sampling, which allows us to essentially synthesize by learning from previous examples, essentially learning from previous examples of images and remembering it, remembering what beautiful images look like so that when you take a low-resolution image, and you run it through the deep neural network, it synthesizes a high-resolution image that's really, really beautiful. And people have commented that it's even more beautiful than native rendered images at the native resolution.\nAnd the benefit is not only is it beautiful, it's also super fast. We essentially nearly doubled the performance of RTX as a result of doing that. So, you can have the benefit of ray tracing as well as very high resolution and very high speed. And so that's called RTX.\nAnd Turing is probably not even close, not even one-third of the total installed base of all of our GeForce GPUS, which is, as you know, the single-largest installed base of gaming platforms in the world. And so, we support this large installed base, and we're in the process of bringing them to the future with RTX. And now, with the new console generation coming, every single game developer on the planet is going to be doing ray tracing, and they're going to be creating much, much richer content. And because of multi-platform, cross-platform play, and because of the size of the gaming platform, PC gaming platform, it's really important that these game developers bring the latest generation content to PCs, which is great for us.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit By 2034\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s Entire iPhone 17 Lineup Once Again Reported To Ship With The Company\u2019s In-House Wi-Fi 7 Chip, iPhone 17 Air To Ship With Two Custom Wireless Solutions\n\nOmar Sohail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall of Duty Veteran Jason Blundell Is Founding a New PlayStation Studio Called Dark Outlaw Games\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\nEzza Ijaz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n41\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n37\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n36\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit By 2034\n\n\n\n34\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Japan Corp., is helping its customers get to market faster.\t\t\t\n\n\nAugust 28, 2020 by Ahana Dave \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Traditional machine learning and data science project cycles are time-consuming and repetitive. From data cleaning to model validation, almost every stage involves cumbersome, manual processes.\nBy automating its machine learning processes using NVIDIA GPUs, Actapio, Inc., a subsidiary of Yahoo! Japan Corp., is helping its customers get to market faster.\nBased in Washington state, Actapio offers consulting and computing services to help U.S.-based startups enter the Japanese market. Its customers offer a vast range of consumer applications, from advertising and ecommerce to speech recognition and data services.\nTo speed its processes, Actapio\u2019s AI research and development team has developed Hilbert, a framework that creates production-level AI models to bring deep learning capabilities to over 100 consumer services powered by Yahoo! Japan.\nFrom email to video streaming, the framework improves recommender systems, click-through rate prediction and search query analysis.\nHilbert also shortens turnaround times for trial and feedback when developing AI models. For example, model structure, input feature, data transformation and hyperparameter tuning settings are all defined within Hilbert\u2019s configuration files. This allows know-how to be easily shared between services by simply copying and pasting config files.\nIn addition, the knowledge gained from successful services and the new AI models developed by each service are incorporated into the framework. As a result, developers can take the good results from one service and immediately try them out on another. This helps data scientists and engineers more quickly understand the efficiency of these smart models.\u00a0\nBrowsing Challenges and Opportunities\nNot all of Actapio\u2019s data science teams have enough scientists, yet these applications required cutting-edge AI technology. That\u2019s why the company needed a framework that would automatically create efficient and working AI models. They also faced challenges in figuring out how to optimize AI models efficiently.\nUsing nearly 300 NVIDIA V100 GPUs at its new hydroelectric-based data center helped Actapio reduce model training time and optimize its performance daily. The team saw performance improvement of up to 65 percent across various Yahoo! services, including shopping, ebooks and travel.\nUsing the Hilbert framework, the team fully automated model optimization processes, such as model architecture search and hyperparameter tuning, and introduced them into actual services. This allows for day-to-day model optimization using the latest data.\n\u201cIn our experience, the fresher the data, the better the performance,\u201d said Norifumi Matsuya, CEO of Actapio. \u201cNVIDIA products offer high performance and stability, so we can use them with confidence.\u201d\nLooking ahead, AI, machine learning and deep learning are becoming integral parts of Actapio\u2019s services. The company believes there\u2019s still a lot of room for innovation in the area of recommendations and click-through rate prediction. It aims to further close the go-to-market gap between image, speech and translation with recommender and click-through rates to increase the relevancy of products that customers are searching for.\n\n\nCategories: Accelerated Analytics | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(Image reconstructed by @326powah)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alleged pictured of NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3090 graphics card's PCB has leaked over at the bilibili (Via harukaze5719 & Kopite7kimi). The GeForce RTX 3090 is rumored to be flagship offering in the Enthusiast Ampere gaming graphics card lineup which will be unveiled on the 1st of September during a digital event hosted by NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Graphics Card's PCB Leaks Out - Dual-Sided Next-Gen G6 Memory, Triple 8-Pin Connectors & A Secondary Chip\nUpdate: As per the proper source which is Yuki Anjou-YuuKi_AnS (BiliBili), the PCB is part of the GeForce RTX 3090 graphics card. Some new details suggest that one of the memory die has been blurred out which points a 24 GB GDDR6X memory layout with 12 DRAM chips on the front and 12 on the back.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS[Original Article] The leaker reports that the PCB is from a non-reference board by Colorful which would serve as its flagship iGame GeForce RTX 3090 Vulcan-X series graphics card. The leaker has blurred out lots of PCB area as he mentions that some of the details of the PCB are classified & cannot be mentioned by him.\nWith that said, there's a lot to talk about so let's start. Just looking at the PCB, we can see that we're looking at the backside of the board. The graphics card is powered by three 8-pin connectors which will supply power to all of the components on the PCB. This confirms that at least the custom cards won't be featuring the rumored 12-pin power connector that was reported a while back as it could just be a Founders Edition only design choice (that also hasn't been confirmed yet).\n\nLooking at the card itself, there are at least 11 memory modules on the backside which seems to indicate dual-sided memory. Historically, cards with dual-sided memory chips feature the same amount of dies on either side so this would indicate 22 memory modules on the card. Considering these are 1 GB modules, the card could end up with 22 GB of VRAM across a 352-bit bus interface. However, earlier rumors have indicated 20 GB for the RTX 3080 Ti and 24 GB of GDDR6X memory for the flagship variant.\nA recent rumor posted on Baidu forums suggests that NVIDIA is planning a 22 GB graphics card with a 352-bit bus interface so we might be looking at this right now. Again as far as core & VRAM specifications are concerned, nothing is confirmed so far. The other two interesting details is the interconnect which definitely doesn't look like the standard NVLINK design we have seen on the existing RTX 20 series cards but rather a new version.\nA render of NVIDIA's upcoming GeForce RTX 30 series Ampere gaming graphics cards in its reference Founders Edition design. (Image via Reddit User u/dertpert88)\nThere's also a secondary chip that seems to be featured right underneath the GPU itself. The leaker placed an Intel CPU on top of the chip so that it doesn't get exposed but it looks like NVIDIA may offer a secondary chip that is not a part of the GPU die itself that may handle a set of specific work loads which are yet to be detailed. Other features we can expect from the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards is a fully PCIe Gen 4 compliant design and enhanced power delivery to several components on the PCB.\nThe leak from yesterday also pointed out to several unique aspects of the GeForce RTX 30 series in regards to its PCB design. The details were more specific to the reference 'Founders Edition' cards but it looks like custom boards are going to take things up a notch considering this leak. There's also an alleged pictured of the ZOTAC GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card which seems to feature a triple-fan cooling solution in a standard 2.5 slot form factor. The card was leaked by the same user on Reddit but the post has also been removed.\nAn alleged picture of the ZOTAC GeForce RTX 3080 Ampere gaming graphics card has also leaked out over at Reddit.\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 'Ampere' Gaming graphics card lineup is expected to be announced on 1st September at a digital event which will be hosted by CEO of NVIDIA, Jensen Huang. We expect at the very least, three new graphics cards during the event which include the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (or RTX 3090), GeForce RTX 3080, and a next-generation Titan.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 \"Ampere' Graphics Card Rumored Lineup:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameGPU NameCUDA Cores / SMsMemory CapacityMemory BusBandwidthTDPLaunch Timeframe\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX RTX 3090Ampere GA102-30010496 (82)24 GB GDDR6X384-bit936 Gbps (19.5 Gbps)350WSeptember 2020\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti/SUPER?Ampere GA102-250?TBD20 GB GDDR6X320-bitTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080Ampere GA102-2008704 (68)10 GB GDDR6X320-bit760 Gbps (19 Gbps)320WSeptember 2020\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti/SUPER?Ampere GA104-400?6144 (48)?16 GB GDDR6X256-bitTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070Ampere GA104-3005888 (46)8 GB GDDR6256-bit512 Gbps (16 Gbps)220WOctober 2020\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti/SUPER?Ampere GA104-200?4864 (38)?8 GB GDDR6?256-bit?TBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060Ampere GA106-300?TBD6 GB GDDR6?192-bit?TBDTBDNovember 2020?\n\n\n\nThere's also a possibility that NVIDIA will announce its GeForce RTX 3070 graphics cards but that remains to be seen. The lineup will initially be available for pre-order in Founders Edition flavors only but recent rumors have pointed that we can also expect custom flavors as soon as the launch embargo ends a few weeks after the unveiling in September.\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA GeForce 'Ampere' GPU are you waiting for the most?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n132\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n62\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n61\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n61\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

After building multiple iterations of its DGX Pods, Nvidia learned valuable lessons about building a system with modular, scalable units. Then, the pandemic struck.\u00a0The COVID-19 outbreak brought new challenges for Nvidia, as it set out to build Selene, the fourth generation of its DGX SuperPODs. Reduced staff and building restrictions complicated the task, but Nvidia managed to go from bare racks in the data center to a fully operational system in just three-and-a-half weeks.\u00a0Selene is now a Top 10 supercomputer, the fastest industrial system in the US, and the fastest MLPerf machine that's commercially available.\u00a0Must read:Nvidia and Google claim bragging rights in MLPerf benchmarks as AI computers get bigger and bigger\u00a0'We are doing in a few months what would normally take a drug development process years to do': DoE's Argonne Labs battles COVID-19 with AIThe task of building Selene during the pandemic underscored the benefits of the design principles Nvidia has adopted, and it created a new sense of urgency to get the machine up and running.\u00a0\"The whole point initially was to enable deployment very, very quickly so that we could get our researchers up and on,\" Michael Houston, a chief architect who leads the Nvidia systems team, told reporters. \"Nvidia's the first customer for our machines -- so we prove everything out and make sure that the machines and how we specify the pod architectures are rock solid.\"But with the onset of the pandemic, he said, \"we wanted to get the machine ready to start doing COVID research, to enable some of our partners like Argonne National Labs, who also have SuperPODs.\"Selene sits in a standard data center next to Nvidia's Silicon Valley headquarters. It's comprised of 280 DGX A100 systems -- that's 2,240 Tensor Core GPUs all together. It has 494 Mellanox switches and seven petabytes of all-flash storage.\u00a0Since its Spring deployment, Selene has run thousands of jobs a week, often simultaneously. It runs AI data analytics, traditional machine learning, and HPC applications.\u00a0\"It's not just an AI machine,\" Houston said. \"It's one of the best HPC machines in the world, it's one of the best ML machines in the world, and it's one of the best AI machines.\"Typically, it takes dozens of engineers months to assemble and deploy a supercomputer-class system. Nvidia managed to do it with two-person teams -- isolated from each other as a form of social distancing -- to unbox and rack systems. Engineers racked up to 60 systems in a day, the maximum their loading dock could handle. Cabling was completed with six-foot distances between people, with virtual logins that let administrators validate cabling remotely.\u00a0   Trip the robot helps Nvidia staff virtually observe Selene. The systems team defined modules of 20 nodes connected by relatively simple \"thin switches.\" These scalable units could be laid down incrementally -- turned on and tested before the next one was added. Cables were cut at set lengths and bundled together with Velcro.\u00a0\"It's designed to be deployed very, very fast,\" Houston explained. \"Once you have the racks in and power in, the whole design and methodology of what we've done is to enable very rapid deployment. You're actually getting users on incrementally, so our average time from a racked machine to doing a full checkout and handing off to a user is four hours.\"\u00a0Selene is based on an open architecture Nvidia shares with its customers. In addition to the Argonne National Lab, the University of Florida plans to use the design to build the fastest AI computer in academia. Companies like Lockheed Martin and Microsoft are also using DGX SuperPODs.\u00a0The aim of Nvidia's design, Houston said, is to be able to deploy in any available data center -- all the way from telco data centers, which tend to use 7kW racks, up to HPC data centers.That said, \"the biggest pull that we've been seeing is in HPC facilities and in AI research companies that need to get machines up that are big and fast and proven,\" Houston said, \"without having to waste a lot of time trying to do custom builds and figure out all of the interconnect trade-offs, all the software to make it all work... Both from a software full stack point of view but also from a data center full-stack point of view, we're able to deliver very fast and enable their research.\"Nvidia targeted 28 kilowatts per rack, which is the most common high-density hyperscaler infrastructure. The team spent significant time on interconnect design to make the system easy to deploy and expandable.\u00a0\"We learned a lot of hard lessons on expandability on previous architectures,\" Houston said, \"we had to massively rewire it. So we wanted a very different approach as we went through this.\"\u00a0The team split up compute, storage, and management fabrics into independent planes, with two network-interface cards per GPU. With this SuperPOD, Nvidia also increased the capacity and throughput of memory and storage links. Four storage tiers span 100 terabyte/second memory links to 100 Gb/s storage pools.The system was built with layers of automation. For instance, Selene talks to Nvidia staff over a Slack channel as if it were a co-worker, reporting loose cables and isolating malfunctioning hardware so the system can keep running.Meanwhile, Nvidia uses a telepresence robot from Double Robotics -- named Trip -- to let staff virtually observe Selene via the robot's camera and microphone.Hardware    \n\n            The best photography drones: Capture stunning aerial footage\n           \n\n            Our favorite robot mowers: Hands-free lawn care\n           \n\n            The top 5 home batteries: Backup systems to keep you charged\n           \n\n            The best cheap vacuum cleaners: Affordable and reliable vacs\n              \n\n              The best photography drones: Capture stunning aerial footage\n             \n\n              Our favorite robot mowers: Hands-free lawn care\n             \n\n              The top 5 home batteries: Backup systems to keep you charged\n             \n\n              The best cheap vacuum cleaners: Affordable and reliable vacs\n             Editorial standards  Show Comments  \n          Log In to Comment\n         Community Guidelines     Related   \n      How Cisco, LangChain, and Galileo aim to contain 'a Cambrian explosion of AI agents'\n      \n      Will synthetic data derail generative AI's momentum or be the breakthrough we need?\n      \n      What happened at the Homebrew Computer Club 50 years ago: Apple was born, and a revolution began\n              ZDNET we equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at home.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nWatch On \nIf you've been following the hard-to-miss news about the upcoming Nvidia Ampere graphics cards, you'll know that the rumors point to a few unusual design choices. There is talk of a 12-pin power connector and a whole new PCB and cooler design that is radically different from before. Now, in a new video detailing the design philosophy, Nvidia has confirmed the new cooler and 12-pin power connector, subtly explaining why certain decisions have been made.The video starts off explaining the basics of thermodynamics, which is interesting but nothing new. But then it goes on to explain that to achieve more cooling, more air needs to be pushed through the card, and thus a radically different design was required, which is where things get interesting.Shrinking the PCB to make space for cooling\"Whenever we talk about GPU performance, it all comes from the more power you give, and you can dissipate, the more performance you get.\" says Gabriele Gorla, Director of Systems Engineering at Nvidia \"The biggest challenge, when you do a very high-end board and try to squeeze it into 6-7 inches, is that the power density becomes really really high\"So it looks like Nvidia had a handful of ambitions with the new cards, and challenges to solve in order to accomplish the goals. The team wanted to pump more power into the cards, and thus the cooler had to grow. But, this couldn't happen without shrinking the PCB to ensure the card in its entirety didn't grow too much, limiting the PCB itself to be 6-7 inches long.And then shrinking the power connector to make space on the PCB(Image credit: Nvidia)As it turns out, that's where the new 12-pin power connector comes in. It may not seem like much, but it's smaller than the dual 6-8 pin connectors Nvidia previously used. And that's not only because of its physical dimensions, but because it looks like Nvidia is planning on mounting the connector perpendicular to the board \u2014 this couldn't have been done with the old PCIe power connectors.\u00a0Nvidia didn't explicitly detail too much, but the images provided in the video confirm the rumors. The PCB will be quite short and have a triangular bite taken out at the end to make room for a fan in the cooler that can pull the air in through the bottom, and out the top end of the card, tapping into the airflow path to be exhausted by the rear case fan.\u00a0Given that the RTX 3090 is the first card to come from Nvidia with the **90 nomenclature since the GTX 690, we're expecting the halo GPU to pack an incredible punch \u2014 it's almost certainly going to be a card that Nvidia builds to show off what it can do, but will in practice be far too expensive for most consumers.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.No, you don't need a new PSU for Ampere(Image credit: Nvidia)Whether this new cooler design with the smaller PCB and new power connector will make it to the more mainstream models, such as the RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 remains to be seen. If it does though, there is no cause for concern as Nvidia also stated in this video that adapters will be provided \u2014 so no, you will not need a new power supply for the Ampere graphics cards, unless you're going for the halo card and need more watts.However, what must be noted either way is that these rumors are all about the Nvidia reference card, so it isn't necessarily telling anything about the custom cards that make up a large chunk of the market. Nvidia's board partners will undoubtedly have their own designs, possibly sticking to the classic card design with roomier PCBs and the old-style PCIe power connectors. As noted in Seasonic's power cable leak, the 12-pin cable from the PSU manufacturer was only meant to be used with PSUs of 850W and above, so I believe there's a good chance that the 12-pin connector is only a thing on the halo GPU.Nevertheless, there's elegance in this new connector. Not only is it smaller and now a single cable, but mounted perpendicular to the board, aimed 45-degrees to the rear would result in a very tidy looking power cable connection. For those concerned with aesthetics, it should will look much better than two cables sticking straight out to the side of the GPU.Nvidia will be announcing the new Ampere graphics cards on September 1st, when we'll finally get to know all the facts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce RTX 3090\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (38)\n\n\n\nNiels BroekhuijsenSocial Links NavigationNiels Broekhuijsen is a Contributing Writer for Tom's Hardware US.

Possibly less.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnofanneeded\n\n\nI dont see anything in that movie about RTX 3090 design at all , all are older cards ... and nothing new , Vapor chamber ? been used since forever . how we move heat? we know it for two hundreds of years already... sooo whats new? smaller PCB ? lol ...\n\nOMG Either show real innovation or stop trying to fool us Nvidia ... you will never invest in expensive cooling solution. and we know that.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthekillerx10\n\n\nI don't think the 3090 idea will succeed,it will suffer like their older brother Gtx 690\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGillerer\n\n\nthekillerx10 said:I don't think the 3090 idea will succeed,it will suffer like their older brother Gtx 690\nOne major reason the GTX 690 suffered was because it - like all x90 cards before it - was a dual-GPU card at a time when game developers were starting to ignore SLI/Crossfire. Like two GTX 680s on a single board. The then emerging - now common - deferred rendering techniques are largely incompatible with the traditional ways of doing multi-GPU.\n\nGame developers chose to not waste time supporting SLI since less than 1% of gamers would benefit from it. When you couldn't use SLI, the card offered performance similar to a single GTX 680.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njeffrs\n\n\nI'm hoping that a water cooled version is offered. I'm running a Cryovenom (which is still awesome). The Cryo was the first GPU where I didn't just toss the fan cooler into the garbage.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nddferrari\n\n\nI certainly think this will be a major upgrade to my 1080Ti, but I sure won't be buying the Founders (Flanders?) edition. It looks like an ugly, Soviet-era piece of tech. It's depressing just to look at it. I'll take a hard look at an EVGA water-cooled model, should one arise.\n\nAnd good luck keeping those exposed heatsink fins from bending.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEricLane\n\n\nThe way it is talked about, it seems they're are a 850W PSU WILL be required for a 3090, is that right? Because I bought a new 750W three weeks ago.... :(\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 38 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Flower\u2019s beastly 2800W power supply lands at $899 \u2014 enough juice to power a couple of RTX 5090 GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei's Microsoft Windows license for PCs expires this month, company launching PCs with Harmony OS: Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 50-series GPU scalping extends to system integrators \u2014 over $3,000 for a RTX 5090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO gets a $1 million salary plus $68 million in bonuses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNES consoles appear to run faster with age \u2014 APU frequency increased by up to 182 Hz after 35 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech giants call Trump tariffs 'big headache' \u2014 Foxconn CEO teases increased production in US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe week in chip news: Intel gets a new CEO, China chip smuggling, AMD dominates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi Pico powers $75 PicoCalc portable programming handheld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel's new CEO warns employees about 'tough decisions', but Wall Street cheers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI skips RDNA 4 and will not manufacture AMD Radeon 9000-series GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

If you have an Nvidia Shield TV, it's very simple to do. Here's how. \nThe option to take a screenshot on Nvidia Shield TV devices is part of the \"Nvidia Share\" toolbar, which is primarily for sharing gaming content. It can be used to stream your screen to Twitch, for example. We'll be using it to simply take a screenshot.\nFirst, we need to turn on the \"Nvidia Share\" toolbar because it's disabled by default. Open the \"Settings\" menu by clicking the \"Gear\" icon in the top-right corner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \"Device Preferences\" option from the \"Settings\" menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll down and select \"System.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \"Nvidia Share\" from the top of the menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect\u00a0\"On (Hold Home Button To Access)\" from the available options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can take a screenshot. Navigate to the screen you want to capture, then hold down the Home button on the physical Shield remote or remote app. This will bring up Nvidia Share.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll all the way over to the right and select the \"Screenshot\" option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA button that says \"Save to Photos\" will slide out from the bottom of the toolbar. Click the button to take the screenshot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's it! A little message that says \"Screenshot Saved\" will appear at the bottom of the Android TV interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots can be viewed in the \"Photos & Videos\" app that comes preinstalled on the set-top device. To move the screenshots from the Shield TV to another device, your best option is to upload the images to a cloud storage service with a file manager app, such as File Commander.\nRelated: What Is Android TV, and Which Android TV Box Should I Buy? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreaming\n\n\n\n\nHardware\n\n\n\n\nAndroid TV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 will be one of the several high-end and enthusiast gaming options that will be showcased on September 1st, utilizing the brand new Ampere GPU architecture.\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3080 Graphics Card Spotted With 2.1 GHz GPU Clocks & 19 Gbps GDDR6X Memory\nAccording to the leak, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 is still being evaluated internally as the entry on UserBenchmark is from 15th August. The listing shows the Ampere graphics card with a device ID of '10DE 2206'. In addition to the GeForce RTX 3080 specifications, it's PCI Id has been unveiled too which according to Videocardz is '2206'. Rogame also sheds some light over the PCI IDs & says that there are at least three IDs for three different cards.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSPreliminary specifications of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card have leaked out over at UserBenchmark. (Image Source: Rogame)\nMoving over to the specifications, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 was spotted with 10 GB of VRAM which was running 19 Gbps GDDR6X memory dies (4750 MHz QDR effective) across a 320-bit bus interface. This should deliver a memory bandwidth of 760 GB/s. This is almost a 53% jump in the memory bandwidth over the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER which is very impressive. As for the GPU clocks, the card has a BIOS limit set to 2100 MHz so we should be looking at clock speeds similar to the Turing GPUs which also peak around 2.1 GHz.\n\n[Nvidia Ampere]\ud83e\uddd0\nPCI IDs for GA102 GPUs\nGA102 12GB (RTX 3080 Ti ?)=> 0x2206 GA102 10GB (RTX 3080)=> 0x2206GA102 24GB (RTX 3090)=> 0x2204\n\u2014 _rogame \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8 (@_rogame) August 16, 2020\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series Ampere 'GDDR6X' Memory Specs (Preliminary):\n\n\n\nGPU NameVRAMMemory ClockMemory BusBandwidth\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 309024 GB GDDR6X21 Gbps384-bit1024 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 309024 GB GDDR6X20 Gbps384-bit960.0 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 309024 GB GDDR6X19 Gbps384-bit912.0 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 308010/20 GB GDDR6X21 Gbps320-bit840.0 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 308010/20 GB GDDR6X20 Gbps320-bit800.0 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 308010/20 GB GDDR6X19 Gbps320-bit760.0 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30708/16 GB GDDR6X21 Gbps256-bit672.0 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30708/16 GB GDDR6X20 Gbps256-bit640.0 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30708/16 GB GDDR6X19 Gbps256-bit608.0 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30606/12 GB GDDR6X21 Gbps192-bit504.0 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30606/12 GB GDDR6X20 Gbps192-bit480.0 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30606/12 GB GDDR6X19 Gbps192-bit456.0 GB/s\n\n\n\nThe average clock speeds of NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards, especially the GA102 GPU core are likely to be rated at around 1.7-1.8 GHz as seen in previous leaks. These will be the actual boost clocks for the cards while we can expect the standard operating range near 1.9 GHz. Custom cards will allow for higher clock speeds due to better power delivery and we can expect speeds to close in on the 2.1 GHz limit.\nWhat's interesting is that the graphics card was running on an unreleased 455.90 driver. The GPU performance isn't that great within the benchmark but it is likely that this is still an early design candidate for the GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card. There have been reports that the GeForce RTX 3080 will feature 20 GB of GDDR6X memory instead of 10 GB which was previously rumored.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 - GA102 For High-End Gaming\nMoving on to the GeForce RTX 3080, the rumor reports that the card will be featuring the GA102-200-KD-A1 SKU. This cut down SKU will feature the same 4352 CUDA cores as the RTX 2080 Ti that will be arranged in a total of 68 SMs. The card is reportedly going to feature up to 20 GB of memory that is also going to be GDDR6X. Assuming the memory is running at 19 Gbps across a 320-bit bus interface, we can expect a bandwidth of up to 760 GB/s.\n\nThe switch to GA102 from TU104 on the RTX 2080 is definitely an interesting one. A high-end SKU would also result in higher wattage and thermals but I believe this could be done to raise the bar up on the sub $500 segment which should comprise of GA104 based RTX 3070 and RTX 3060. The latest performance leaks also show a considerable performance improvement over the RTX 2080 and even the RTX 2080 Ti in synthetic benchmarks. If the same could translate over to the gaming performance, then Ampere does look like a super enticing product for gamers who have waited for almost 2 years now.\nIn addition to the GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card specifications leak, Chiphell has posted what seems to be an alleged performance chart of the GeForce RTX 30 series lineup which includes the GeForce RTX 3090, GeForce RTX 3080, GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, GeForce RTX 3070 & the GeForce RTX 3060. The chart claims to be an average performance measurement of the graphics cards purely in gaming benchmarks at various resolutions from 1080p and all the way up to 4K. It also showcases the performance per watt gains for each respective generation. Again, this chart should be taken with a grain of salt as the information on performance is yet to be verified.\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 'Ampere' Gaming graphics card lineup is expected to be announced on 1st September at a digital event which will be hosted by CEO of NVIDIA, Jensen Huang. We expect at the very least, three new graphics cards during the event which include the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (or RTX 3090), GeForce RTX 3080, and a next-generation Titan. There's definitely a lot more to talk about regarding the Ampere GPUs but we will have to wait until more information comes our way.\nNVIDIA GeForce #UltimateCountdownCountdown\n\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA GeForce 'Ampere' GPU are you waiting for the most?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n211\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n102\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Reaches 45% GPU Market Share In Japan, Achieving Peak Market Share And Is Even Aiming Higher\n\n\n\n72\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Targets NVIDIA\u2019s Grace & Intel Granite Rapids Xeon CPUs With New 5th Gen EPYC Performance Showcase, Up To 2.75x Power Efficiency\n\n\n\n67\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n62\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1472\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1157\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

It offers better performance for the price in these segments, though in reality, AMD is simply non-existent in the high-end sector. For the mid-range, it's a little closer with AMD's RX 5600 and RX 5700 series, comfortably matching NVIDIA offerings.But in reality, it could come down to which monitor you own.NVIDIA vs. AMD specsWe're using the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER, and AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT GPUs as examples from both camps.Swipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPERAMD Radeon RX 5700 XTArchitectureTuringrDNAVideo RAM8GB GDDR68GB GDDR6RAM speed15.5Gb/s14Gb/sClock speed1,650 MHz1,605MHzStream processors3,0722,560Price$827$400 at AmazonNVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs are simply betterWe're using the RTX 2080 SUPER, and RX 5700 XT for comparison and team NVIDIA wins on performance, but overall you could say the same for the NVIDIA line-up. The company nailed it with its RTX family of cards, and the SUPER versions are even better. The major feature of RTX GPUs is ray tracing.But there's another highlight in NVIDIA RTX GPUs, and that's deep learning super sampling (DLSS) 2.0, which effectively uses an AI to boost frame rates and render real-time without sacrificing quality. Pair that up with ray tracing, which can impact performance negatively, and you've got one excellent combined solution.That's the future of gaming, and we're just seeing the start of this trend take off. More games are looking to support ray tracing, and what we've seen with Minecraft is incredible. Still, a GPU is simply that, a graphics card. Luckily, NVIDIA hasn't sacrificed general performance chasing these next-gen features, and using any RTX GPU (SUPER or otherwise) with all PC games will leave you smiling.Source: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)The best GPUs for PC gamingThe GPU is a crucial decision to factor in when building your PC. It's what is responsible for handling the majority of processing for games, rendering frames that are delivered to your monitor. Choosing the best GPU money can buy is the best way to ensure you get a superior experience without having to fork out on an upgrade sooner.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Best Grahpics CardsThe Turing architecture is simply better at allowing you to enjoy your favorite games and is why NVIDIA GPUs remain the more popular option right now. Even NVIDIA's GTX series of GPUs were usually better than what AMD could muster. The GTX 1080 Ti was one of the best graphics cards money could buy before the RTX series was announced.AMD is down but not out yetCompetition is hot in the GPU space. Much like Intel and the processor market, NVIDIA feels AMD right on its heels with GPUs, and the current rDNA architecture has enabled AMD to launch the RX series, which offers exceptional value at the low- and mid-tier segments. Unfortunately, for team red, there aren't really any high-end GPUs from which to choose.AMD is on par with NVIDIA's current generation of GPUs, but one has to remember that NVIDIA has ampere architecture around the corner. Current RTX cards are all built on older tech, which just goes to show just how advanced NVIDIA's graphics cards are. It'll be interesting to see if AMD can keep up with ampere cards from NVIDIA with rDNA 2.For the price, AMD wins by a long shot. Looking at the RTX 2080 SUPER and RX 5700 XT, the price difference is around $400, which is substantial if you're looking for a better deal. The RTX 2080 SUPER wins outright in performance, but for value, it's team red. The RX 5700 XT can even do a little 4K gaming so you can save big with AMD if you know which card to pick.Choose NVIDIA for performanceNVIDIA is the better choice for gamers wanting to maximize the visual fidelity of what's displayed on-screen. Whether you choose an RTX 2060 SUPER or 2080 Ti, you'll be able to witness the power of DLSS and ray tracing. They're a little more pricey than AMD cards, especially at the high-end, but the end result is incredible.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER\n\n\n $1,130 at Walmart $1,269.99 at Amazon $1,289 at Amazon\nA super-powerful GPUThis GPU from NVIDIA may appear rather expensive, but it's not even the range-topper.

NVIDIA flagship gaming graphics cards will be making use of the GA102 GPU to deliver unprecedented performance gains over the Turing TU102 GPU core.\nNVIDIA Ampere GA102 GPU For High-End & Enthusiast Gaming GeForce RTX 3090 & RTX 3080 Graphics Cards Pictured\n[UPDATE 26/08/20] - Rogame has posted a more detailed analysis of the leaked GA102 GPU die. The die was mirrored to complete the entire package and it turns out that the GA102 GPU could measure around 628mm2 which is slightly smaller than the TU102 GPU die (754mm2). What is interesting about this die size projection is that it ends up near to what Kopite7kimi had reported back in July. The leaker reported a die size of GA102 to be exactly 627.12mm2.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nPosted by Chiphell user PolyMorph, the die seems for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 graphics card which is more or less confirmed to be the flagship gaming offering in the Ampere GeForce RTX 30 series lineup. The specific chip is the GA102-300-A1 and this SKU has previously been hinted to be utilized by the flagship GeForce RTX 3090 graphics card. The GA102-300-A1 chip pictured is in the qualification state but we also got to see pictures of Qual-Sample GPUs on several pre-productions PCBs.\nA render of NVIDIA's upcoming GeForce RTX 30 series Ampere gaming graphics cards in its reference Founders Edition design. (Image via Reddit User u/dertpert88)\nSeveral unique identifiers such as the date the chip was produced and the specific plant where it was fabricated have been blurred out. It's done to remove any traces that can get the leaker into trouble. We can expect different PCBs for the GeForce RTX 3090 and GeForce RTX 3080 based on the recent leaks. The GeForce RTX 3090 is going to feature a triple-slot design while the GeForce RTX 3080 will stick to a dual-slot cooler.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 - The Fastest Ampere Gaming Graphics Card\nAccording to leaked details, the GeForce RTX 3090\u00a0 will feature the GA102-300-A1 GPU. The GA102-300-A1 GPU is said to be comprised of 5248 CUDA cores or 82 SMs. In total, that's a 20% increase in cores over the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. No details such as clock speeds, TMU/ROP counts are provided and we can't take the Ampere A100 die as a reference since gaming & HPC parts share a different configuration hierarchy.\n\nMoving on to the memory side, things start to look interesting as it is stated that the card will get up to 24 GB memory with faster GDDR6X pin speeds. Since that's a 384-bit bus we are looking at, it will be able to offer nearly 1 TB/s bandwidth.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 - GA102 For High-End Gaming\nMoving on to the GeForce RTX 3080, the rumor reports that the card will be featuring the GA102-200-KD-A1 SKU. This cut down SKU will feature the same 4352 CUDA cores as the RTX 2080 Ti that will be arranged in a total of 68 SMs. The card is reportedly going to feature up to 20 GB of memory that is also going to be GDDR6X. Assuming the memory is running at 19 Gbps across a 320-bit bus interface, we can expect a bandwidth of up to 760 GB/s.\n\nThe switch to GA102 from TU104 on the RTX 2080 is definitely an interesting one. A high-end SKU would also result in higher wattage and thermals but I believe this could be done to raise the bar up on the sub $500 segment which should comprise of GA104 based RTX 3070 and RTX 3060. The latest performance leaks also show a considerable performance improvement over the RTX 2080 and even the RTX 2080 Ti in synthetic benchmarks. If the same could translate over to the gaming performance, then Ampere does look like a super enticing product for gamers who have waited for almost 2 years now.\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 'Ampere' Gaming graphics card lineup is expected to be announced on 1st September at a digital event which will be hosted by CEO of NVIDIA, Jensen Huang. We expect at the very least, three new graphics cards during the event which include the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (or RTX 3090), GeForce RTX 3080, and a next-generation Titan. There's definitely a lot more to talk about regarding the Ampere GPUs but we will have to wait until more information comes our way.\nNVIDIA GeForce #UltimateCountdownCountdown\n\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA GeForce 'Ampere' GPU are you waiting for the most?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n160\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

We are just 7 days to NVIDIA's announcement of their brand new gaming lineup and speculation and leaks are running rampant as we enter into the crunch time for their next generation of GPUs. The registry features the codenames of NVIDIAs upcoming cards and as decoded by WhyCry they translate to the RTX 3090, RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 respectively.\nMSI's RTX 3090, RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 graphics cards spotted getting their EEC certification\nAll integrated circuits are required to have EEC certification prior to launch and these are usually a very good indicator of foretelling and confirming various GPUs and launches. That said, while all GPUs that launch have to get an EEC certification not all GPUs that get an EEC certification actually end up on the shelves. With this particular leak, since we are fairly sure they refer to the RTX 3090, RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 respectively, we will be seeing these graphics cards fairly soon.\nNVIDIA is shaking things up with the Ampere architecture and we will be seeing what is expected to be a massive leap in performance (driven both by hardware and software) compared to the last generation. If the hype NVIDIA is generating with their ultimate countdown is to be trusted (and you can usually trust NVIDIA when they say it's going to be exciting) then we should have something concrete within just 7 days at the time of writing.\n\nA total of 29 different SKUs were spotted at EEC. These include 4x V390 variants (which we believe are the high-end RTX 3090), 11x v389 variants (RTX 3080) and 14x v388 variants (RTX 3070). To give you some more context, the RTX 2080 Ti, RTX 2080 SUPER and RTX 2070 SUPER had a V377, V372 and V373 code respectively. These SKUs could also include AMD's big navi cards since previous RX branded graphics cards have been spotted with similar nomenclature.\nWhat we know about NVIDIA SKUs so far:\nSince we do not know the confirmed naming schemes yet, I will refer to these boards according to their board numbers and the RTX 2000 series card they are intended to replace.\n\nThe crown jewel of NVIDIA's lineup is the PG132-10 board with 24GB of vRAM. It is going to be replacing the RTX 2080 Ti and is currently scheduled to launch in the second half of September.\nWe then have the PG132-20 and PG132-30 boards, both of which are replacing the RTX 2080 SUPER graphics card and will have 20GB and 10GB worth of vRAM respectively. The PG132-20 board is going to be launching in the first half of October while the PG132-30 board is going to be launching in mid-September. It is worth adding here that these three parts are likely the SKU10, 20 and 30 we have been hearing about and the SKU20 is going to be targetted dead center at AMD's Big Navi offering (and hence the staggered launch schedule). Since AMD's Big Navi will *probably* have 16GB worth of vRAM, it also explains why NVIDIA wants to go with 20GB.\nThe PG142-0 and PG142-10 are both going to be replacing the RTX 2070 SUPER and will feature 16GB and 8GB worth of vRAM respectively. While the PG142-10 has a known launch schedule in the second half of September, the PG142-0 board has no confirmed launch date yet.\nFinally, we have the PG190-10 board which is going to be replacing the RTX 2060 SUPER graphics card and will have 8GB of vRAM as well. The launch schedule for this board has not been decided yet either.\n\nNVIDIA Ampere GPUs Partial Specs And Launch Dates\n\n\n\nBoard ID Replacement ClassvRAMBus WidthLaunch Schedule \n\n\n\n\nPG132-102080 Ti 24 GB384 bit2H Sept. \n\n\nPG132-202080 Super20 GB320 bit1H Oct. \n\n\nPG132-302080 Super10 GB320 bitMid.

The Ampere series has had more leaks and rumors than any other series and as we enter into crunch time towards launch, many of these will be debunked or confirmed. We are also waiting to hear about more specifications from our sources and also a confirmation of the process node the Ampere series of GPUs will be manufactured at.\nRight now, the expected nomenclature of these cards is going to be the RTX 3000 series with a potential RTX 3090 in the mix for the first time as well. But please keep in mind that NVIDIA has previously skipped nomenclature tiers just to discredit the leak scene and may do so again. The shrouds we saw were only in the validation phase and it would be trivial for NVIDIA to change the naming scheme. The board numbers, however, would stay the same. Regardless of what NVIDIA decides to call it, this is shaping up to be one hell of a generation.\nNVIDIA GeForce #UltimateCountdownCountdown\n\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA GeForce 'Ampere' GPU are you waiting for the most?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nMSI MEG Ai1600T PCIe5 1600W Power Supply Impressions \u2013 Titanium, ATX 3.1, RGB, It Has It All!\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI MAG X870E Edge TI WIFI, X870E Tomahawk WIFI & X870 Tomahawk Motherboards Review \u2013 Great Designs For New Ryzen Builders\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI MEG Z890 GODLIKE Motherboard Review \u2013 GODLIKE Features At A GODLIKE Price\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI Prestige AI EVO 16 B2HMG \u201cIntel Core Ultra 9 285H\u201d Laptop Review \u2013 Arrow Lake Comes To Mobile\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n160\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, will host the special GeForce event which will be delivered in a digital and pre-recorded format, similar to the GTC 2020 Digital keynote.\nNVIDIA's GeForce Special Event All-Set For 1st September, Jensen Huang To Introduce Next-Gen GeForce RTX 'Ampere' Gaming Graphics Cards\nNVIDIA has also posted an official countdown timer which ends on September 1st at 9 a.m. Pacific Time. The official statement for the event is provided below:\nRelated Story NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDPNVIDIA will broadcast a GeForce Special Event, featuring an address by founder and CEO Jensen Huang, on Sept. 1, at 9 a.m. Pacific time.\nDuring the event, Huang will highlight the company\u2019s latest innovations in gaming and graphics. Tune in at https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/special-event/. via NVIDIA\n\nWhat's most exciting about this launch is the fact that it will take place a whole 21 years after the introduction of the iconic GeForce 256 which wasn't just NVIDIA's first commercial graphics card but also the first GPU ever produced. Keeping that in consideration, we can expect this specific gaming lineup to hold far more significance and importance than any previous GeForce RTX line.\nNVIDIA GeForce #UltimateCountdownCountdown\n\nHere's Everything We Know About The NVIDIA GeForce RTX Ampere Gaming Graphics Cards\nAs for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Ampere gaming graphics cards, it is stated that the lineup is expected to consist of four graphics cards for 2020, these include:\n\nNVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti\nNVIDIA RTX 3080\nNVIDIA RTX 3070\nNVIDIA RTX 3060\n\nAll four graphics cards are rumored for launch in 2020 but will have different launch schedules. The high-end cards will be prioritized first with the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and GeForce RTX 3080 slated to launch in September which is just about a month away from now. The GeForce RTX 3070 will be launch a month later in October while the GeForce RTX 3060 mainstream graphics card will hop on the retail shelves in November.\nAs for what we can expect from NVIDIA's high-end GeForce RTX 30 series Ampere gaming graphics cards, we have speculated/rumored information provided below:\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti - The Fastest Ampere Gaming Graphics Card\nAccording to the details, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will feature the GA102-300-A1 GPU. The GA102-300-A1 GPU is said to be comprised of 5248 CUDA cores or 82 SMs. In total, that's a 20% increase in cores over the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. No details such as clock speeds, TMU/ROP counts are provided and we can't take the Ampere A100 die as a reference since gaming & HPC parts share a different configuration hierarchy.\n\nMoving on to the memory side, things start to look interesting as it is stated that the card will get up to 12 GB memory with faster GDDR6 pin speeds. Since that's a 384-bit bus we are looking at, it will be able to offer nearly 1 TB/s bandwidth. There's also talks about an enhanced version of the GDDR6 DRAM known as GDDR6X however there's no information available yet by any graphics DRAM vendor, unlike the previous GDDR6 DRAM which was officially reported months before its integration on the Turing graphics cards.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 - GA102 For High-End Gaming\nMoving on to the GeForce RTX 3080, the rumor reports that the card will be featuring the GA102-200-KD-A1 SKU. This cut down SKU will feature the same 4352 CUDA cores as the RTX 2080 Ti that will be arranged in a total of 68 SMs. The card is reportedly going to feature 10 GB of memory that is also going to be GDDR6X, running at 19 Gbps across a 320-bit bus interface with a bandwidth of 760 GB/s.\n\nThe switch to GA102 from TU104 on the RTX 2080 is definitely an interesting one. A high-end SKU would also result in higher wattage and thermals but I believe this could be done to raise the bar up on the sub $500 segment which should comprise of GA104 based RTX 3070 and RTX 3060. The latest performance leaks also show a considerable performance improvement over the RTX 2080 and even the RTX 2080 Ti in synthetic benchmarks. If the same could translate over to the gaming performance, then Ampere does look like a super enticing product for gamers who have waited for almost 2 years now.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 \"Ampere' Graphics Card Rumored Lineup:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameGPU NameCUDA Cores / SMsMemory CapacityMemory BusBandwidthTDPLaunch Timeframe\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX RTX 3090Ampere GA102-30010496 (82)24 GB GDDR6X384-bit936 Gbps (19.5 Gbps)350WSeptember 2020\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti/SUPER?Ampere GA102-250?TBD20 GB GDDR6X320-bitTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080Ampere GA102-2008704 (68)10 GB GDDR6X320-bit760 Gbps (19 Gbps)320WSeptember 2020\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti/SUPER?Ampere GA104-400?6144 (48)?16 GB GDDR6X256-bitTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070Ampere GA104-3005888 (46)8 GB GDDR6256-bit512 Gbps (16 Gbps)220WOctober 2020\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti/SUPER?Ampere GA104-200?4864 (38)?8 GB GDDR6?256-bit?TBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060Ampere GA106-300?TBD6 GB GDDR6?192-bit?TBDTBDNovember 2020?\n\n\n\n\nRecent reports have\u00a0suggested\u00a0that NVIDIA has halted the production of its higher-end GeForce RTX GPU lineup to prepare for the Ampere GeForce RTX launch.

Why we'd recommend this is the RTX 2060 offers more performance for the money and would hold up longer over time before needing to be replaced. With the GTX 1660 Ti, you're likely to replace it sometime in the future if you wish to move up to 1440p and 4K gaming.While the GTX 1660 Ti is capable of 1440p gaming, it's not as powerful as the GTX 1070 (though it does match it in some games), which itself can sometimes struggle with more demanding games at this resolution. The RTX 2060 makes mine meat of games and it costs less than $100 for all this additional headroom. You also have ray tracing and Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) enabled on the card.Other advantages the RTX 2060 has over the GTX 1660 Ti include increased memory bandwidth. It's simply better in every way aside from the base and boost clock speeds, but you can overcome with this overclocking as RTX 2060 cards come with superior coolers.We'd recommend the RTX 2060 over the GTX 1660 Ti, but it's not the best option for everyone. If your budget simply cannot stretch to cover the GPU and you need the card now, the GTX 1660 Ti is a solid card for 1080p and some 1440p gaming.If you want a deeper dive on the differences between these two graphics cards, you can check out our comparison. As always, have a look at our roundup of the best graphics card picks for more options.\n\n\n\nOur pick\nZOTAC Gaming RTX 2060\n\n\n Check Amazon Check Walmart $350 at Amazon\nBetter value GPU for gamingThe GTX 1070 was a great mid-range GPU and the RTX 2060 is the spiritual successor with a few additional features, including ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS. You'll be able to play PC games at 1440p without issues.\n\n\nGet the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nNvidia\nHardware\nComputers Desktops\n\n\nRich EdmondsSocial Links NavigationSenior Editor, PC BuildRich Edmonds was formerly a Senior Editor of PC hardware at Windows Central, covering everything related to PC components and NAS.

The leaker, who said the images came from 4chan, described the card as the \"Titan\" of this generation and claims it'll retail for $1,400. \nThe photos in question come courtesy of Twitter user @GarnetSunset. In the first, we see the purported 3090 beside an RTX 2080, which it absolutely dwarfs in terms of sheer size. The triple-slot card features a single cooling fan on the front that's mounted to an impressive looking heatsink with no shortage of cooling fin arrays.\n\nAround back is an equally large fan positioned at the opposite end of the card. As you can see, most of the fins here are covered by a backplate. It also appears as if there is something written on the backplate but this looks to have been digitally masked - maybe RTX 3090?\nFor what it's worth, the leaker also said the 3080 will be priced at $800 followed by the 3070 at $600 and the 3060 at $400.\nThe heatsink design looks to be very similar to the leaked 3080 heatsinks we saw a few months back.\nAs always, one should take leaks like these with a grain of salt. It's fun to speculate but we won't know for certain until Nvidia shares official details at the end of the month. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\n Arm considers acquisition of data center chipmaker Ampere \n\n\n\nImages courtesy @GarnetSunset\n\n\n\n\n 40 comments\n \n624 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 GPUs \"unprecedented\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 specs and official performance benchmarks leaked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

The Nvidia boss said his company is \"expecting a really large second half for gaming,\" referring to the second half of 2020. \nSpeaking on a conference call after Nvidia posted its quarterly financial results (via VentureBeat), Huang highlighted how the pandemic has seen the number of people playing games, and the hours spent on them, skyrocket. Spending on titles also reached a record high earlier this year. He added that the industry is benefiting from all the different ways people can now play games, from traditional consoles and PCs to smartphones and streaming services.\nThe rest of the year will be a good one for gamers: there's the launch of AMD's Big Navi-based cards, the PlayStation 5, and the Xbox Series X. Nvidia, of course, will be releasing its consumer Ampere products, and leaks suggest the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 will both be beasts that pack plenty of GDDR6X memory, though the latter could be monstrously expensive.\n\"It's going to be the most amazing season ever,\" said Huang.\nWhile it's rival AMD who provides most of the hardware for the PS5 and XSX, Nvidia supplies chips for the Nintendo Switch. Huang noted how the hybrid machine is fast becoming one of the best-selling platforms in Nintendo history.\n\nNvidia beat expectations during its second fiscal quarter, with revenue up 50 percent year-over-year to $3.87 billion. Gaming revenues were up to $1.65 billion, a 26 percent jump from a year earlier.\n\n\n\n\n 20 comments\n \n279 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\n Nvidia transitions to advanced CoWoS-L chip packaging, signaling a major shift for TSMC \n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nGTA VI rumored to cost $100, sparking debate among gamers and analysts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGTA 6 release on track for this fall, console gamers rejoice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?
