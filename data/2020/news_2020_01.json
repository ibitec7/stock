The hotel, which is under construction, will be branded Pan Pacific Jakarta.    Thamrin Nine is a 5.2ha mixed-use development\u00a0located in the heart of Jakarta\u2019s financial district (Photo: UOL Group)\u00a0 Thamrin Nine is a 5.2ha mixed-use development by PWG, located in the heart of Jakarta\u2019s financial district. Given the scale of the development, it is constructed in phases, with Tower 2 scheduled to complete in 2022.   Tower 2 of Thamrin Nine has a direct underground link to Dukuh Atas MRT station, one of the 13 stations on Jakarta\u2019s first MRT line called the North South Line. 2 In July 2018, UOL had acquired 180 apartments in Tower 2 of Thamrin Nine to be developed into a 180-suite Parkroyal Serviced Suites Jakarta. It had concurrently entered into a hotel management agreement to operate a 185-key Parkroyal Jakarta in the same tower. Twelve months before, on July 2017, Pan Pacific Hotels Group signed a management contract with PT China Sonangol Media Investment to operate a 179-unit Pan Pacific Serviced Suites Jakarta in the North Tower of Indonesia 1. The development is located along Jalan Thamrin, one of the main avenues running through the CBD, and is slated to open by 2020. This latest acquisition will see UOL owning or managing four hotels and serviced suites in Jakarta, with a total of about 700 rooms, says Jesline Goh, UOL chief investment and asset officer. \u201cThis acquisition further strengthens our hospitality footprint and completes our brand presence in Jakarta,\u201d she adds.

The sale & purchase agreement of Veolia ES Singapore Industrial (VESSI) was signed between Sembcorp's wholly owned subsidiary SembWaste and Veolia Environmental Services Asia.  VESSI holds contracts for public and commercial waste and recyclable collections covering recovery and recycling, public and commercial cleaning services, as well as associated properties which include a materials recovery facility. Sembcorp says the acquisition is in line with the group's strategy of deepening its presence as an integrated energy and urban solutions player providing green and more efficient solutions to enable sustainable development in its key markets. \"The acquisition will further strengthen Sembcorp\u2019s waste management and recycling business as the nation\u2019s premier integrated environmental services provider,\" says Sembcorp. Neo Hong Keat, senior vice-president (waste management), Sembcorp, says sustainability in the environmental business also needed scale. \"SembWaste\u2019s fleet of vehicles would have doubled to close to 400. Such scale will enable the business to invest in a more efficient trucking fleet using cleaner fuels. In addition, we would also be better placed to move towards automation as well as skills upgrading for a fast-changing industry that is critical to the sustainability ecosystem in Singapore,\" says Neo. Year to date, shares in Sembcorp are down 2 cents at $2.29, giving it a market cap of $4.08 billion.

Marco Chiappetta is a technologist who covers semiconductors and AI.Follow AuthorJan 22, 2020, 04:22pm ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 5 years old.A Matrox Parhelia 256 AGP Graphics Card.Matrox\nLong time PC enthusiasts that were around in the early days of 3D acceleration, when products from 3Dfx, S3, and ATI were all the rage, will no doubt be familiar with Matrox. Back in the early days 3D accelerated PC gaming, Matrox was well known for having some of the best 2D cards (which were often paired to 3Dfx Voodoo cards, which handled 3D workloads). Later, Matrox introduced some interesting contenders in the 3D accelerator space as well. Matrox\u2019s long, storied line-up of graphics cards include legends like the Matrox Mystique, G200, G400 MAX, and the Parhelia, which was one of the first graphics cards to accelerate 3D games across multiple displays.\n\n\nEventually, NVIDIA and AMD (after acquiring ATI) ended up dominating what became today\u2019s GPU market, and tertiary players like Matrox couldn\u2019t keep up. Matrox, however, pivoted somewhat and leveraged their display expertise to entrench the company into specialized markets, like display walls and medical imaging to name a few, with product purpose-built for their respective user base. Through it all, Matrox used its own graphics chips, but today the company announced a new partnership with NVIDIA for the development of a new range of multi-display embedded graphics cards purpose-built for high-density video walls.\nMatrox Will Use NVIDIA GPUs On A New Range Of Embedded Graphics Cards.Matrox\n\n\u201cMatrox is thrilled to work alongside NVIDIA, the leader in GPU computing, to bring to market a new standard of high-density video walls,\u201d said David Chiappini, executive vice president of research and development at Matrox. \u201cThis collaboration is yet another example of our commitment to expanding our video wall portfolio while customers continue to benefit from our graphics expertise, world-class engineering, dedicated technical support, and long product life cycles.\u201d\n\nThe new range of cards will feature single-slot form factors, and leverage custom NVIDIA Quadro embedded GPUs designed for commercial and 24/7 critical environments. The cards will support up to four synchronized 4K displays per card, though multiple cards can be used to drive up to 16 displays from a single system.\n\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\n\n\nPricing and availability wasn\u2019t mentioned, but the card will work with Matrox\u2019s PowerDesk software for easy management of the display configurations and video wall setup.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Zack Fragoso\u2019s passion is for pizza with plenty of data.\nFragoso, a data science and AI manager at pizza giant Domino\u2019s, got his Ph.D. in occupational psychology, a field that employs statistics to sort through the vagaries of human behavior.\n\u201cI realized I liked the quant part of it,\u201d said Fragoso, whose nimbleness with numbers led to consulting jobs in analytics for the police department and symphony orchestra in his hometown of Detroit before landing a management job on Domino\u2019s expanding AI team.\nThe pizza maker \u201chas grown our data science team exponentially over the last few years, driven by the impact we\u2019ve had on translating analytics insights into action items for the business team.\u201d\nMaking quick decisions is important when you need to deliver more than 3 billion pizzas a year \u2014 fast. So, Domino\u2019s is exploring the use of AI for a host of applications, including more accurately predicting when an order will be ready.\nPoints for Pie, launched at last year\u2019s Super Bowl, has been Domino\u2019s highest profile AI project to date. Snap a smartphone picture of whatever pizza you\u2019re eating and the company gave the customer loyalty points toward a free pizza.\n\u201cThere was a lot of excitement for it in the organization, but no one was sure how to recognize purchases and award points,\u201d Fragoso recalled.\n\u201cThe data science team said this is a great AI application, so we built a model that classified pizza images. The response was overwhelmingly positive. We got a lot of press and massive redemptions, so people were using it,\u201d he added.\nDomino\u2019s trained its model on an NVIDIA DGX system equipped with eight V100 Tensor Core GPUs using more than 5,000 images, including pictures some customers sent in of plastic pizza dog toys. A survey sent in response to the pictures helped automate some of the job of labeling the unique dataset now considered a strategic corporate asset.\nAI Knows When the Order Will Be Ready\nMore recently, Fragoso\u2019s team hit another milestone, boosting accuracy from 75% to 95% for predictions of when an order will be ready. The so-called load-time model factors in variables such as how many managers and employees are working, the number and complexity of orders in the pipeline and current traffic conditions.\nThe improvement has been well received and could be the basis for future ways to advance operator efficiencies and customer experiences, thanks in part to NVIDIA GPUs.\n\u201cDomino\u2019s does a very good job cataloging data in the stores, but until recently we lacked the hardware to build such a large model,\u201d said Fragoso.\nAt first, it took three days to train the load-time model, too long to make its use practical.\n\u201cOnce we had our DGX server, we could train an even more complicated model in less than an hour,\u201d he said of the 72x speed-up. \u201cThat let us iterate very quickly, adding new data and improving the model, which is now in production in a version 3.0,\u201d he added.\nMore AI in the Oven\nThe next big step for Fragoso\u2019s team is tapping a bank of NVIDIA Turing T4 GPUs to accelerate AI inferencing for all Domino\u2019s tasks that involve real-time predictions.\nSome emerging use cases in the works are still considered secret ingredients at Domino\u2019s. However, the data science team is exploring computer vision applications to make getting customers their pizza as quick and easy as possible.\n\u201cModel latency is extremely important, so we are building out an inference stack using T4s to host our AI models in production. We\u2019ve already seen pretty extreme improvements with latency down from 50 milliseconds to sub-10ms,\u201d he reported.\nSeparately, Domino\u2019s recently tapped BlazingSQL, open-source software to run data-science queries on GPUs. NVIDIA RAPIDS software eased the transition, supporting the APIs from a prior CPU-based tool while delivering better performance.\nIt\u2019s delivering an average 10x speed-up across all use cases in the part of the AI process that involves building datasets.\n\u201cIn the past some of the data-cleaning and feature-engineering operations might have taken 24 hours, but now we do them in less than an hour,\u201d he said.\nTry Out AI at NRF 2020\nDomino\u2019s is one of many forward-thinking companies using GPUs to bring AI to retail.\nNVIDIA GPUs helped power Alibaba to $38 billion in revenue on Singles Day, the world\u2019s largest shopping event. And the world\u2019s largest retailer, Walmart, talked about its use of GPUs and NVIDIA RAPIDS at an event earlier this year.\nSeparately, IKEA uses AI software from NVIDIA partner Winnow to reduce food waste in its cafeterias.\nYou can learn more about best practices of using AI in retail at this week\u2019s NRF 2020, the National Retail Federation\u2019s annual event. NVIDIA and some of its 100+ retail partners will be on hand demonstrating our EGX edge computing platform, which scales AI to local environments where data is gathered \u2014 store aisles, checkout counters and warehouses.\nThe EGX platform\u2019s real-time edge compute abilities can notify store associates to intervene during shrinkage, open new checkout counters when lines are getting long and deliver the best customer shopping experiences.\nBook a meeting with NVIDIA at NRF here.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Data Science | NVIDIA DGX | Retail | Turing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

So, with CNY just around the corner, apparel-buying may be on your to-do list. Given how much you've already spent for CNY, however, you may be worried about your thinning wallet. You're not alone. According to a poll held by the United Overseas Bank (UOB), an average Singaporean intends to spend an average of S$2,503 during the festive period. A budget in the thousands is a hefty amount for many. To help alleviate the pressure so you can focus on celebrating, here are ways to save on CNY clothes shopping. Take Advantage Of Online CNY Sales Many online retailers such as Zalora, Lazada, Shopee are now running aggressive promotions in light of the upcoming festive period. Take Zalora, for example. Their current promotion 'Shop More, Spend Less' allows you to enjoy higher discounts the more pieces of clothing you buy. With 5 pieces costing S$59.9, each will only set you back by ~S$12 instead of the S$19.9 cost if you only purchased 1 item. That's S$7.9 of additional savings on top of the existing discount. Of course, if you don't need this much new clothing, you can always pool purchases together with friends and family.   Table of current Chinese New Year sales   There\u2019s also an additional advantage to shopping online instead of in-store\u2013you'll never be short on inspiration for what to wear for CNY. Many online retailers feature fashion edits that highlight outfits suitable for CNY. Some local blogshops, like the MGP label, The Closet Lover, and Anticlockwise even go the extra mile to launch CNY-themed collections. Many blogshops also offer 10% off your first purchase, so be sure to make use of available first-timer voucher codes where possible. Finally, to further maximise your savings from shopping during the CNY season, you can also make use of credit cards that specifically reward online shopping. For example, the new Citi Lazada Card offers up to 4.8 miles per S$1 spend with Lazada, plus store-specific discounts and shipping rebates. Buy Pieces That Will Work in a Capsule Collection If you're a female looking for a suitable CNY dress, you may wish to reconsider opting for a cheongsam\u2013a one-piece, traditional ethnic clothing. As classy as they are, cheongsams are rarely worn for everyday occasions and will most likely languish in the back of your closet after CNY. Besides, with most retailing at about S$30 per piece, they're pretty expensive for a 'one-time use' fashion piece.   Capsule collections increase the number of outfits possible with the same number of garments   So, if you\u2019re investing money into new clothing, be thoughtful about what you buy. Make sure that you can continue wearing the piece for the rest of the year. Even better, as you\u2019re looking through your existing wardrobe, spend some time to optimise your wardrobe for a capsule collection. A capsule collection is a selection of essentials that can easily be mixed and matched to create multiple looks. New CNY clothing that fits into this collection can add value and save precious space in your wardrobe.   Story continues If You Want To Stand Out, Get Quirky CNY Themed ShirtsIf you really want to stand out and be remembered for your choice of clothing this CNY, why not consider getting a quirky CNY-themed shirt? You don\u2019t have to be dressed head-to-toe in new apparel; a new T-shirt holds the same lucky symbolism, after all. These T-shirts can also be a fantastic conversation starter, perfect for relieving any awkwardness from meeting up with relatives you haven\u2019t seen in a long time. Perhaps more crucially, by skipping the branded outlets like Zara, Topshop, and A&F\u2013where a T-shirt will likely cost over S$40\u2013you can potentially enjoy savings of S$20+.  Table of prices for CNY T-shirts from popular Singaporean designers  Homegrown brands like Naiise and Temasek Clothings feature on-theme CNY clothes from local designers for less than S$35 per piece. If those don\u2019t appeal to you, you can also consider designs from other websites, like Zazzle and Spreadshirt, too. Better yet, if you have an artistic flair, why not try your hand at designing your CNY shirt? At S$12 per T-shirt, this is the cheapest option.Think About Your CNY Budget OverallFrom hosting reunion dinners to buying symbolic new clothing, it's easy to overspend without realising it until it's too late. As you plan out your holiday shopping and fun, consider thinking through your spending ahead of time and making yourself a budget. By comparing what you want and need to spend with what you can comfortably pay for, you can set expectations and consider ways to save ahead of time. This is a great way to start the new year fresh without worrying too much about overextending your finances. And, if you have enough to spare, you can jump-start your new beginning with a savings account, which can help you to save up for your next CNY expenses while also earning interest year-round.The article 3 Ways to Make CNY Fashion More Affordable originally appeared on ValueChampion.

REUTERS/Cheryl Ravelo   By Claire Jiao One of the world\u2019s top plastic polluters is giving its garbage a second life by using it to construct much-needed infrastructure. Philippine companies like San Miguel Corp. and Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc. are using discarded shopping bags, sachet wrappers and plastic packaging to fire cement plants and build roads as the country embarks on an 8 trillion-peso ($157 billion) infrastructure push through 2022.  San Miguel has laid down its first road combining plastic scraps with asphalt, it said in November. The surface material, developed with Dow Chemical Co., used 900 kilograms (1,984 pounds) of plastic to pave a 1,500-square meter (16,145-square foot) test site near the capital. For Aboitiz\u2019s Republic Cement & Building Materials Inc., plastic serves as an alternative to coal for heating kilns used in making cement. The company is sourcing waste from consumer giants like Nestl\u00e9 Philippines Inc. and Unilever Philippines Inc. as it processes at least 25,000 tons of plastic annually, director Angela Edralin-Valencia said in an interview. The two initiatives target soft plastics that are hard to recycle and make up a significant chunk of the trash piling up in Philippine landfills and clogging waterways. Waste management systems have failed to keep up with a growing population and robust consumption in the Southeast Asian nation, which uses 48 million shopping bags and 164 million plastic sachets every day, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, or GAIA.  It\u2019s a similar story across Asia\u2019s emerging markets, where rising incomes and burgeoning middle classes have spurred greater plastic use. China, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam are the top sources of plastic waste in the world\u2019s oceans, according to Ocean Conservancy Inc. and McKinsey & Co. With the Philippine government planning a construction spree of airports, highways, rails, bridges and dams over the next three years, San Miguel and Republic Cement hope to tap the expected spike in activity to make a dent in the country\u2019s plastic problem. The \u201cBuild, Build, Build\u201d program is the centerpiece of President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s blueprint for the Philippines, one of Asia\u2019s fastest-growing economies. Gross domestic product is expected to grow 6.5%-7.5% a year through the end of 2022, driven by infrastructure spending. San Miguel, the Philippines\u2019 largest company, is building more than 900 billion pesos worth of the government\u2019s flagship projects, including several toll roads around the capital and a 2,400-hectare complex north of Manila that will be the country\u2019s biggest airport.   Story continues According to San Miguel\u2019s initial findings, roads using plastic scraps exceed government standards and are stronger and more durable than those made with conventional asphalt.Garbage Collection  File Photo: A man washes plastic for recycling in a murky pond at Payatas district, Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines January 21, 2018. REUTERS/Dondi Tawatao TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY  Republic Cement likewise expects to \u201ccomfortably meet\u201d market demand for cement, while using plastic to replace as much as 10% of its coal requirements, Valencia said.The company could process as much as four times more plastic waste, but limited garbage collection and poor segregation by households and at landfills make it difficult to sift for usable scraps, Valencia said.Nestl\u00e9 and Unilever have launched their own collection programs, offering cash and free products like shampoo and laundry detergent -- also packaged in sachets -- for plastic scraps that are properly cleaned and cut. Both companies aim to collect and process more plastic than they produce, and make 100% of their packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025, they said in separate statements.\u201cNestl\u00e9 is aiming for plastic neutrality, which is essentially recovering plastics equal to what we produce,\u201d Kais Marzouki, chairman and chief executive officer of the Philippine unit, said in a statement.Initiatives to address the issue can have unforeseen consequences. Shredding plastic for asphalt and cement production breaks down waste to microplastics that are even more difficult to collect and reuse, said Beau Baconguis, GAIA\u2019s regional plastic campaigner for Asia-Pacific. Feeding plastic into cement kilns releases toxic fumes, she added.\u201cIt\u2019s garbage in, garbage out,\u201d she said.Republic Cement\u2019s Valencia says plastic-derived fuel involves less carbon emission than coal, while other fumes are subject to regular government monitoring. Unlike incineration, which is banned in the Philippines, the higher temperatures in cement kilns leave behind no plastic ash, Valencia said.As the Philippines mulls regulations on the import and use of single-use plastic, GAIA\u2019s Baconguis said companies should also rethink how they package and market their products.\u201cCompanies need to create an entire closed-loop system to address the plastic waste they\u2019re generating,\u201d she said. Until then, corporate initiatives are \u201cjust a band-aid solution to the problem.\u201d\u00a9 2020 Bloomberg L.P.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

The rumored details come from various sources who have shared the same series of specifications for NVIDIA's upcoming GeForce GPUs.\nNVIDIA Ampere GPU Based GeForce RTX 3080 20 GB & GeForce RTX 3070 16 GB Ampere Graphics Cards Alleged Specifications Detailed\nFrom the details by MyDrivers and Twitter user 'KittyCorgi', it seems like NVIDIA is prepping up at least two Ampere GPUs which would go on to power the GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3070 graphics cards. The details cover the full specifications, including core counts and even images of complete block diagrams for NVIDIA's next-generation Ampere powerhouse GPUs.\nRelated Story CS: Legacy, a Fan-Made Standalone Remake of Counter-Strike, Is in the WorksThe NVIDIA GA102, GA103 & GA104 GPUs, Powered by Ampere\nFirst up, it is reported that there are two gaming derived GPUs based on the Ampere architecture, these include the GA103 and the GA104. There's also a GA102 GPU mentioned but there's no card mentioned that would make use of it. It is possible NVIDIA could keep the chip under wraps for a more powerful graphics card.\n\nLike Pascal and Volta, which kept the top tier chips exclusive to HPC / AI / DNN markets, it is also likely that the GA100 GPU would exist but would be developed specifically for the compute GPU market with the more gaming-optimized chips being derived into the GA102/GA103/GA104 tiers. The original Ampere GPU lineup leak goes far back to May of 2019 where a series of NVIDIA GPUs based on the Ampere architecture was hinted (not confirmed), these include (credits: kopite7kimi):\n\nGA100 8GPC*8TPC*2SM 6144bit\nGA102 7GPC*6TPC*2SM 384bit\nGA103 6GPC*5TPC*2SM 320bit\nGA104 6GPC*4TPC*2SM 256bit\nGA106 3GPC*5TPC*2SM 192bit\nGA107 2GPC*5TPC*2SM 128bit\n\nNow, none of these GPUs have officially been confirmed but we have seen references of NVIDIA's Ampere GA104 GPU popping up in recent ECC listings and this is what these GPU configurations were based on. Like the current Turing and the previous Pascal lineup, the GA102 and the GA104 GPU will make up the higher-end market with GA106 making up the mainstream and GA107 targetted at the entry-level segment. What's interesting is that this leak indicates that the green team might be deciding to base the RTX **70 tier graphics card on the higher tier G**04 chips rather than G**06.\nWe know that the Turing based GeForce RTX 2070 makes use of the TU106 chip and not the upper-tier TU104 chip like the RTX 2080. At the same time, the RTX **80 tier graphics card would not be using the G**04 chip but rather an even higher tier GPU known as the GA103 which would allow for a wider bus and higher memory configuration alongside more CUDA cores. There's no mention of what fabrication process Ampere GPUs will be based upon, but NVIDIA's CEO stated that the majority of orders would be handled by TSMC for their next-generation 7nm GPUs while Samsung would get a small number of orders. We also know that NVIDIA's Orin SOC which makes use of its next-generation GPU architecture (Ampere) is based upon Samsung's 8nm LPP process node which makes it clear where the smaller numbers of orders are going to. With that said, let's talk about the graphics cards themselves.\nOLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\nThe Ampere GPU wouldn't only\u00a0improve the rasterization and shading performance\u00a0but also deliver huge uplifts over Turing in ray tracing performance. Since Turing was the 1st generation implementation of ray tracing on NVIDIA graphics cards, Ampere will further optimize it and is expected to offer more ray-tracing hardware onboard in the form of RT and Tensor cores. The Ampere GPUs are also mentioned to leverage performance from PCIe Gen 4.0 which is a given since this is a next-generation GPU architecture tuned for next-generation gaming platforms and the higher bandwidth from the Gen 4.0 protocol, plus NVLINK would be an essential feature.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Graphics Card - Up To 20 GB GDDR6, 320-bit Bus, GA103 GPU\nAs mentioned above, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 will be the successor to the GeForce RTX 2080. It will feature a total of 60 SMs with 64 CUDA cores each making 3840 CUDA cores. This would be a big leap over the RTX 2080's CUDA core count which was set at 3072 and we aren't even factoring in the clock speeds which NVIDIA will be able to churn up with an advanced 7nm process node.\nThe card is also said to feature a 320-bit bus interface which means that it could support either 10 or 20 GB of GDDR6 memory. If NVIDIA really wants to blow the audience away with Ampere, then 20 GB would be a perfect choice. However, we have to take into consideration the high costs that are associated with GDDR6 memory and the looming rumors of a memory shortage due to higher demand from the console market.\n\nSo let's be conservative and say 10 GB of GDDR6, which would still be 2 GB more than the current GeForce RTX 2080. If we are looking at 16 Gbps modules on the upcoming RTX 3080, it would give us 640 GB/s bandwidth which would be insane over the 496 GB/s of the RTX 2080 SUPER which features 15.5 Gbps memory alongside a 256-bit bus interface.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Graphics Card - Up To 16 GB GDDR6, 256-bit Bus, GA104 GPU\nThe second card is the GeForce RTX 3070 and as stated above, it will feature the GA104 GPU. The successor to the TU106 based GeForce RTX 2070 is suggested to feature the same CUDA core count as the RTX 2080, at 3072, all rounded up in its 48 streaming multiprocessor units. The card is expected to feature a 256-bit bus interface which once again would allow for 8 GB or up to 16 GB GDDR6 memory, but you have to take into consideration what I just said above about the GDDR6 supply and cost factor.\n\nNVIDIA Ampere GPU 'GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, RTX 3080, RTX 3070' Rumored Specs Comparison:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n\n\n\n\nGPU ArchitectureTuring TU106Turing TU104Ampere GA104Ampere GA103Turing TU102Ampere GA102\n\n\nProcess12nm FinFET NVIDIA (TSMC)12nm FinFET NVIDIA (TSMC)Samsung 10nm (8LPP)?Samsung 10nm (8LPP)?12nm FinFET NVIDIA (TSMC)Samsung 10nm (8LPP)?\n\n\nSMs364848607284\n\n\nCUDA Cores2304 CCs3072 CCs3072 CCs3840 CCs4608 CCs5376 CCs\n\n\nMemory8 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68/16 GB GDDR610/20 GB GDDR611 GB GDDR612 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus256-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit320-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed14 Gbps14 Gbps16 Gbps?16 Gbps?14 Gbps16 Gbps?\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth448 GB/s448 GB/s512 GB/s640 GB/s640 GB/s768 GB/s\n\n\nLaunch201820182020202020182020\n\n\n\nWhat's interesting is that these two cards leave so much room open for a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti to just blow away the enthusiast market segment again. If the reports of NVIDIA's overall Ampere architecture gaining 50% higher performance than Turing while offering twice the efficiency are correct, than given those specs, an RTX 3070 would be able to deliver the performance or even outperform the RTX 2080 Ti at a much lower price point.\nAccording to the Taipei Times, NVIDIA's Ampere GPU is going to deliver seriously impressive figures in both performance and efficiency.\u00a0The overall performance gain is expected to be 50% higher than existing Turing GPUs while offering twice the power efficiency.\u00a0It is clearly mentioned that Ampere would halve the power consumption compared to existing Turing GPUs. This means that a GPU with a lower TDP figure than the RTX 2060 (125-150W) would be able to outperform the 2080 Ti which is seriously impressive. One can only expect the kind of performance which a high-end GPU based on the Ampere architecture would offer as we can definitely expect true 4K 60 FPS ray-traced gaming from the updated architecture.\n\nWe were told NVIDIA will launch a new GPU in the second quarter. AMD is also expected to have Big Navi around Computex.\nInfo from board partners.\n\u2014 VideoCardz.com (@VideoCardz) January 20, 2020\n\nThere's no word on an exact launch plan for Ampere based GeForce GPUs, but rumors have hinted at a 2H 2020 launch, however, it could be much earlier than that. NVIDIA is expected to host their annual GTC 2020 conference in March, which would mean that we could finally get to hear more about the next-generation green team powerhouse chip, even if it's an HPC card announcement first. This was the case with Turing, which got to see its first public appearance in the form of a workstation card or Pascal which was first unveiled as an HPC oriented compute chip. We will definitely keep you updated in case we hear more about NVIDIA's next-generation GPUs.\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA Ampere based graphics card are you interested for the most?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\nOmar Sohail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple Considered Launching The iPhone 17 Air Without A USB-C Port, Aiming For A Portless Future With An Ultra-Thin Design And Wireless-First Approach\n\nAli Salman\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPhone 17 Air Pricing Details Suggest It Will Occupy The Same Bracket As Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 Plus, And Will Arrive With Better Battery Life, But At The Cost Of Extra Features\n\nOmar Sohail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n117\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n100\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n30\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nA Mac Studio Cluster Of Four Units, All Featuring Apple\u2019s Latest M3 Ultra, Consume Less Than Half The Power Of A Network Switch When Running At Idle\n\n\n\n27\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1480\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1157\nComments\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n1035\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Major PC GPU players, AMD and Nvidia, have both released updated drivers to implement Vulkan 1.2 support.\n\nKey features introduced in Vulkan 1.2 include the following:\n\ntimeline semaphores for easily managed synchronization\na formal memory model to precisely define the semantics of synchronization and memory operations in different threads\ndescriptor indexing to enable reuse of descriptor layouts by multiple shaders\ndeeper support for shaders written in HLSL\nover 20 new high-priority features in total\n\n\nImportantly Khronos and the Vulkan community will support Vulkan 1.2 in a wide range of open source compilers, tools, and debuggers before the current month is over. The tools will include the RenderDoc frame capture and debugging tool, the Vulkan conformance test suite, and the Vulkan SDK.\n\nKhronos notes that any GPU that supported previous versions of Vulkan will be capable of supporting version 1.2. Straight off the bat AMD, Arm, Imagination Technologies, Intel, and Nvidia all have Vulkan 1.2 implementations passing the Khronos conformance tests.\nAt the time of the publishing of the Vulkan 1.2 blog post, Nvidia already had beta drivers available will full support for v1.2 for both Windows and Linux. Nvidia's GeForce 441.99 Beta Drivers support all Nvidia GPUs as far back as Kepler.\n\nAMD has been pretty quick off the mark too. It has now released Radeon Software Adrenalin 2020 Edition 20.1.2 with full support for Vulkan 1.2 and Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot. AMD's driver also fixes some UE4 based titles and Radeon RX 5700 Series rebooting when idle issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nAMD sales up 54 per cent, beats analyst expectations\nAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT Halo Infinite graphics card revealed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 2 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

It is our intention and hope that Eyal [Waldman] will lead Mellanox Israel,\u201d Huang added, emphasizing that the acquisition will not lead to any layoffs of company employees.  Mellanox, headquartered in Yokne\u2019am, was founded in 1999 and is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. It supplies end-to-end interconnect solutions and networking services for many of the world\u2019s largest data center servers and storage systems.Nvidia\u2019s purchase of the company, acquiring all issued and outstanding common shares for $125 per share in cash, brought to an end the months of reported takeover attempts by some of the world\u2019s biggest hi-tech firms, including Intel, Microsoft and Xilinx.While reluctant to enter into the details of negotiations between the companies and rival bids, Huang said the process \u201cwas supremely competitive, but we had the best final offer so we won this privilege of building this great company together with Mellanox.\u201dExpressing his pride in building Mellanox over two decades, exceeding $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2018, Waldman added his belief that he has \u201cfound a great house\u201d for Mellanox.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be an independent company anymore but it\u2019s going to be Mellanox within Nvidia, which I think is a great achievement,\u201d said Waldman. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019ll find the right way to continue building this entity called Mellanox.\u201dThe transaction, the third largest \u201cexit\u201d of an Israeli company to date, has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is expected to close by the end of the calendar year. Advertisement\u201cWe see the future of the combined company as very synergistic. We\u2019ve been working for many years together and this is the climax of getting the teams, two technologies and strategies together,\u201d said Waldman.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Since its establishment two decades ago, Mellanox has been dual-headquartered in Israel and in the United States. Today, it boasts operations from Israel\u2019s South to the North, with offices in Yokne\u2019am, Tel Aviv, Beersheba, Ra\u2019anana and Tel Hai.\u201cNvidia is 26 years old and we rarely make acquisitions, because generally we like to build, create new markets and develop new technologies for markets that have never been explored. We tend to build from scratch and tend to innovate from within,\u201d said Huang.\u201cHowever, Mellanox is a one-of-a-kind treasure that is not possible to rebuild. That\u2019s one of the reasons why we did something quite extraordinary for our company, to make such a large acquisition.\u201dSign up for the Business & Innovation Newsletter >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Tags\n\n\n\nisrael business\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nMellanox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nInformation\t\t\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nContact us\n\n\nFeedback\n\n\nTerms Of Service\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nSubscriber Agreement\n\n\nJPost Jobs\n\n\nCancel Subscription\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\nCustomer Service\n\n\nJP Store\n\n\nAdvertise with Us\n\n\n\u05e4\u05e8\u05e1\u05d5\u05dd \u05d1\u05d2'\u05e8\u05d5\u05d6\u05dc\u05dd \u05e4\u05d5\u05e1\u05d8\n\n\n\n\r\nThe Jerusalem Post Group\t\t\n\nBreaking News\n\n\nWorld News\n\n\nIran News\n\n\nMDA Heroes\n\n\nThe Jerusalem Report\n\n\nJerusalem Post Lite\n\n\nReal Estate Listings\n\n\nServices\n\n\nPrecious Metals\n\n\nAstrology\n\n\nConsumerism\n\n\n\n\r\nTools and services\t\t\n\nJPost Premium\n\n\nJPost Newsletter\n\n\nIvrit Talk\n\n\nRSS feed\n\n\nJPost.com Archive\n\n\nDigital Library\n\n\nLists of Jewish holidays\n\n\n\u05dc\u05d5\u05d7 \u05d7\u05d2\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd 2024\n\n\n\u05d6\u05de\u05e0\u05d9 \u05db\u05e0\u05d9\u05e1\u05ea \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\n\n\n\u05d7\u05d3\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05d9\u05d1 \n\n\n\n\r\nSites Of Interest\t\t\n\nPoalim Online\n\n\nJNF-USA\n\n\n\n\r\n            The Jerusalem Post Customer Service Center can be contacted with any questions or requests:\r\n            \r\n            Telephone: *2421 * Extension 4 Jerusalem Post or 03-7619056\r\n            Fax: 03-5613699\r\n            E-mail: subs@jpost.com\r\n            \r\n            The center is staffed and provides answers on Sundays through Thursdays between 07:00 AM and 14:00 PM and Fridays only handles distribution requests between 7:00 AM and 12:30 PM\r\n            \r\n            For international customers: The center is staffed and provides answers on Sundays through Thursdays between 7AM and 14PM Israel time Toll\r\n            Free number 1-800-448-9291\r\n            Telephone +972-3-761-9056\r\n            Fax: 972-3-561-3699\r\n            E-mail: subs@jpost.com\r\n        \n\n\r\n                Copyright \u00a9 2025 Jpost Inc.

The new driver adds supports for a range of new features while improving performance in major AAA releases.\nNVIDIA's CES 2020 Game Ready Driver Launched - Adds Ray Tracing in Wolfenstein: Youngblood, Supports Variable Rate Super Sampling, 8 New G-SYNC Compatible Monitors & More\nReleasing today, the new game ready driver adds supports for new technologies for both, gamers and VR enthusiasts. There's a large feature list that expands upon the existing technologies which are part of the NVIDIA Game Ready Drivers. Following are a few key features of the new CES 2020 Game Ready Driver:\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\nA new Max Frame Rate setting in the NVIDIA Control Panel to help save power, reduce system latency, and more.\nVRSS feature that uses Turing\u2019s Variable Rate Shading to improve image quality in VR games\nA new Freestyle split-screen filter lets you showcase screenshots or videos in a side-by-side or even a blended fashion.\nAn update to the Image Sharpening filter that lets users enable GPU scaling without image sharpening, and even supports custom resolutions.\nAdds support for an additional 8 G-SYNC Compatible displays. Adding these to the previously mentioned 2020 LG OLED TVs brings the total number of\u00a0 G-SYNC Compatible displays to 90.\nAnd more\n\nYou can download the new CES Game Ready Drivers from the following links:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce Game Ready 441.87 WHQL Driver Download Link (Windows 10 64-bit)\nNVIDIA GeForce Game Ready 441.87 WHQL Driver Download Link (Windows 7 64-bit)\n\nRTX ON! Wolfenstein: Youngblood Gets Ray Tracing and DLSS Support\nThe first key highlight is that Wolfenstein: Youngblood is getting support for NVIDIA's RTX including Ray Tracing and DLSS at CES 2020. Added as a part of a free downloadable patch, the game will let you enjoy better quality visuals with RTX on while DLSS would help improve performance without compromising on image quality.\n\nYou can see a side by side comparison of ray tracing enabled and disabled in the images below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe game would be utilizing ray tracing reflections so that reflections are highlighted in various surfaces in real-time. In the image comparison above, you can note that with RTX enabled, the building is accurately being reflected in the pool of water down in the streets. There would be other reflective surfaces such as the body armor and mirrors that would display reflections in real-time and we will have a more detailed analysis of the ray tracing implementation and the overall performance of the game with RTX and DLSS enabled coming out soon.\n\nNVIDIA has shared its own performance metrics of Wolfenstein: Youngblood with RTX features enabled. With DLSS off,1440p Ray Tracing, and RTX 2060 is shown to deliver 85 FPS but as soon as DLSS is turned on with the quality mode preset, the frames boost to 117 FPS, representing a 1.4x performance jump. This is definitely not an average performance measurement so some places may have major or no differences in FPS at all. With performance mode, you can get even higher frame rates out of the game. The driver is set to release later today so stay tuned.\n\nVariable Rate Super Sampling Comes To GeForce Turing GPUs For VR Enthusiasts\nNVIDIA has also introduced a brand new technology for their Turing GPU architecture known as VRSS (Variable Rate Super Sampling). VRSS helps by improving image quality in the center of the frame, offering up to 8x shading rate where it matters the most while the borders are shaded at a normal rate.\n\nVRSS leverages Variable Rate Shading (VRS), which is one of the key advancements of the Turing architecture.\u00a0 VRS decouples shading rate from resolution, and one is able to increase/decrease the image quality in different regions of the frame. VRSS uses fixed foveated super sampling where the image quality in the center mask region can be improved for VR games with a higher shading rate compared to the peripheral region in a frame, resulting in better image quality.\n\nYou can not only boost image quality in more than 24 supported DX11 VR gamers but VRSS can also improve performance over regular 4x supersampling, delivering unconstrained FPS of over 100 FPS in many VR titles. Turing's VRSS (Variable Rate Super Sampling) and VRS (Variable Rate Shading) currently provide the best performance and image quality rendering in several VR titles. Following is a list of all the VR titles that support VRSS:\n\n\n\nBattlewake\nBoneworks\nEternity WarriorsTM VR\nHot Dogs, Horseshoes and Hand Grenades\nIn Death\nJob Simulator\nKilling Floor: Incursion\nL.A. Noire: The VR Case Files\nLone Echo\nMercenary 2: Silicon Rising\nPavlov VR\nRaw Data\nRec Room\nRick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality\nRobo Recall\nSairentoVR\nSerious Sam VR: The Last Hope\nSkeet: VR Target Shooting\nSpace Pirate Trainer\nSpecial Force VR: Infinity War\nSpiderman: Far from Home\nSpiderman: Homecoming \u2013 Virtual Reality Experience\nTalos Principle VR\nThe Soulkeeper VR\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nCES 2020 Game Ready Driver Packs Max Frame Rate Setting, New Freestyle Filters, Support For 8 New G-SYNC Compatible Monitors and More\nIt doesn't end here, the new Game Ready Drivers also support other features so let's talk a little about them too.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s chief executive has confirmed that a high-end Navi graphics card will be released this year.In a video interview entitled \u2018The Bring Up\u2019 posted on YouTube by AMD (see below), Lisa Su noted that people were wondering about Big Navi \u2013 said high-end GPU, which has previously been referred to as the \u2018Nvidia killer\u2019 in terms of how it will take on the top-end RTX cards.The CEO then said: \u201cI can say you\u2019re going to see Big Navi in 2020.\u201dAMD vs Nvidia: which should be your next graphics card?Check out our Radeon RX 5700 vs RX 5700 XT shoot-outThese are all the best graphics cards of 2020This is the first concrete confirmation we\u2019ve had that AMD will definitely be unleashing its big graphics firepower this year, although rumors have always pointed to this, and indeed comments that Su made in a recent roundtable Q&A session at CES 2020.At CES, the CEO stressed how important a top-end GPU was to AMD, and said that \u201cyou should expect that we will have a high-end Navi, although I don\u2019t usually comment on unannounced products\u201d.The hint was certainly that this GPU would arrive in 2020, but she didn\u2019t actually say that. So at least now we have a confirmation, even if that really isn\u2019t a surprise to anyone who\u2019s been following AMD\u2019s rumored progress in the graphics card arena lately.Battle of the flagshipsThere has been no shortage of speculation around all this, including that the high-end graphics card could be 30% faster than Nvidia\u2019s RTX 2080 Ti (if the unknown GPU which is the subject of that leak is indeed Big Navi, and that\u2019s a fairly sizeable if).Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Of course, AMD needs to move quickly enough with the release to make sure it isn\u2019t competing against the RTX 3080 Ti (which might be up to 50% faster than its Turing predecessor, so the rumor mill reckons \u2013 although that might be just with ray tracing).Nvidia\u2019s next-gen Ampere GPUs are expected to launch in the latter half of 2020, in case you were wondering.Another potential sign that we might see the high-end Navi graphics cards sooner rather than later is that an EEC filing has just been made for the Radeon RX 5950XT. And a GPU with the same name has been filed previously (back in June 2019), indicating that the 5950XT could be the flagship model for 2020. As ever, we need to take such speculation with a good degree of caution, though.Check out all the best gaming PCs of 2020Via Wccftech\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nAMD\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

Including dividends, the graphics-processing unit (GPU) specialist and artificial intelligence (AI) leader returned 76.9%.\u00a0For context, the S&P 500 returned 31.5% in 2019.\nThis\u00a0tech stock\u00a0has made a commendable comeback after losing about half of its value in the last quarter of 2018. The\u00a0reasons for the market's ire\u00a0were the company's\u00a0struggles in its gaming business due to the cryptocurrency bust and slowing growth in its data center platform. As of Jan. 7, NVIDIA stock is just 17% off its\u00a0all-time closing high, set on Oct. 1, 2018.\u00a0\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nSo what\nWe can attribute NVIDIA stock's powerful performance in 2019 to the company's improving financial performance in its most recent two quarters. While year-over-year revenue and earnings have declined in the last four quarters due to the previously noted issues, they have improved sequentially in the fiscal second and third quarters.\u00a0\nIn the third quarter, reported in mid-November, NVIDIA's revenue\u00a0slipped 5% year over year to $3.01 billion and earnings per share (EPS), adjusted for one-time items, edged down 3% to $1.78. In the second quarter, revenue and adjusted EPS fell 17% and 36%, respectively.\nNow what\nInvestors don't have that long to wait for material news, as NVIDIA should be reporting its fourth-quarter and full-year results for fiscal 2020 in mid-February.\n\n\n\n\n\nWall Street expects NVIDIA to resume growth on its top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter. Analysts are\u00a0looking for adjusted EPS of $1.66 on revenue of $2.96 billion, representing growth of 108% and 34%, respectively, year over year.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBeth McKenna owns shares of NVIDIA.

Along with a couple of monitor announcements, NVIDIA is also releasing a new video driver today, which they\u2019re calling the CES Game Ready Driver, which will be introducing a few new quality of life improvements for GeForce users.\nThe marquee addition for the latest driver is what NVIDIA is calling Variable Rate Supersampling (VRSS) for Virtual Reality. Based on the Variable Rate Shading technology found in NVIDIA\u2019s Turing GPU architecture, VRSS invokes the same concept, but in reverse. Rather than shading a section of the screen at a fraction of the normal rate (100%/1:1), as is normally done with VRS, VRSS can shade that section at a rate over 100%. This technique, in turn, is being deployed for use in VR headsets as a means to offer a mid-grade option between running without any kind of supersampling, and using relatively expensive full screen supersampling.\nIt\u2019s this sectionality, in turn, that truly drives the utility of VRSS. As it\u2019s based on NVIDIA\u2019s variable rate shading technology, the company can do VRSS in a foveated manner, running it only towards the center of the VR user\u2019s field of view, where they are most likely to see this difference. This way the outer edges of the screen don\u2019t receive any supersampling, conserving resources in an area where the user isn\u2019t likely to notice the benefit. We\u2019ve been seeing NVIDIA talk about foveated rendering for some time now, and VRSS is a very practical application of that idea.\n\nDiving a bit under the hood, the maximum image quality boost from VRSS should be fairly close to full screen supersampling, though based on NVIDIA\u2019s announcement there seems to be a few differences. The outstanding question is whether VRSS can supersample geometry as well as shaders/textures. VRS, for reference, only dials down the sampling rate of the latter, while leaving geometry untouched. So if VRSS similarly doesn\u2019t deal with geometry, then that would mean there would still be some geometry aliasing.\nFinally, along with allowing foveated supersampling, NVIDIA will also support dynamically adjusting the VRSS sampling ratio. This means that the amount of supersampling can be dialed up or down as needed. Similar to dynamic resolution scaling, this is designed to allow games to hold to a (relatively) fixed framerate, while the complexity of the world changes around the user. Which for VR headsets means that NVIDIA can hold the framerate to 90fps, and do as much (or as little) VRSS as the remaining GPU resources allow.\nVRSS is launching today, and is initially supported in 24 DirectX 11 VR games.\nMax Frame Rate Cap, Freestyle Updates, & Image Sharpening Updates\nMoving on, today\u2019s driver is also introducing a couple of more minor changes to NVIDIA\u2019s software stack. First off, NVIDIA has finally added support for a maximum framerate cap. Long available via third party utilities like MSI Afterburner \u2013 as well as in competitor AMD\u2019s drivers \u2013 a frame rate cap does exactly what\u2019s in the name: it allows a user to cap the maximum framerate of a give to a specific value. The uses for a framerate cap outside of the maximum refresh rate are a bit on the niche side of matters, but some G-Sync users swear by keeping a game capped just below the monitor\u2019s maximum refresh rate. As well, frame rate caps can be used to reduce the overall rendering performance required for a game, thereby saving battery life. That use is conceptually similar to (but less advanced than) AMD\u2019s Radeon Chill technology.\n\nThe new driver is also introducing some changes to NVIDIA\u2019s ever-evolving image sharpening option. Image sharpening can now be used with custom resolutions, and the feature is being tweaked to allow for GPU resolution scaling to be enabled/disabled independently when using image sharpening.\nFinally, the CES driver is delivering a small update to NVIDIA\u2019s Freestyle filters to enable more options to use multiple filters at once. A new filter has been added that allows for multiple filters to be used in a split screen fashion, allowing for filters to be split or blended across the screen.\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n5 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nRayJayS1986 - Monday, January 6, 2020 - link\n\"The uses for a framerate cap outside of the maximum refresh rate are a bit on the niche side of matters, but some G-Sync users swear by keeping a game capped just below the monitor\u2019s maximum refresh rate\"That is if you are running close to the monitor's refresh rate. Proper G-Sync setup requires V-Sync be set to On as well (Check BlurBusters, G-Sync 101 article), and once the game is being rendered above the screens refresh rate, you're basically running V-Sync, which adds latency. If it's right around the max refresh, and your bouncing above and below, well, that is quite the nightmare as you can see/feel the game be \"stutter\" as it bounces back n forth between G-Sync and V-Sync as your FPS goes back and forth between G-Sync range. So yes, it's useful to cap it at 1 or 2 FPS below your max FPS, IF your GPU is rendering the game that high. If you're on 144Hz and you're playing maxed out settings and getting 80-100 fps then it's fine, cap is unnecessary, but for those who like to tune settings for maximum FPS, then the cap can help (like for competitive players, who like no V-sync for the lowest amount of latency possible, but then again, even they would probably not use G-sync, it adds latency too, just less than V-Sync lol). But then they've added the G-sync+Ultra low latency mode option, so there are no pre-rendered frames, so that's perfect for those who want to use G-sync w/out latency. So yeah, the cap is not that niche really, a lot of players prefer higher refresh to maxed out settings and 60 fps, so it's quite useful in a lot of scenarios. I'm honestly surprised it took them THIS LONG to add that option lol. You can do it w/ Nvidia Profile Inspector and all that anyway, but I always just used the GPU software like Afterburner or whatever to do it. Hmmm, let's see how this driver works, will check it out today :P\n\n\n\nRayJayS1986 - Monday, January 6, 2020 - link\nI meant to say you can see/feel the game be \"stuttery\" stupid auto-correct lol\n\n\n\nRayJayS1986 - Monday, January 6, 2020 - link\nOh, and for those interested in learning A TON about G-Sync, this guy really knows what's up and has done lots of testing. You can even post questions you have and he'll either answer if he knows or test it out and give you his results and opinions on what should or shouldn't be done settings wise. This dude is awesome, so is this article:https://www.blurbusters.com/gsync/gsync101-input-l...\n\n\n\nEliadbu - Monday, January 6, 2020 - link\nAlso capping the fps to lower where your GPU capable is every game (utilization should be around 90-95%) will drastically reduce the input latency of the game much more than AMD anti lag and Nvidia Ultra low latency. If your GPU exceed the refresh rate of your monitor than you're best at setting the cap bit lower of your monitor refresh rate. \n\n\n\nRailander - Monday, January 6, 2020 - link\ng-sync does not actually add any latency at all.you might be confusing it since it is often compared to uncapped FPS numbers, which will give you the lowest input lag possible (due to rendering and pushing frames as early as possible in the pipeline, even though the monitor can't display as many).if you compare g-sync on vs off with the same FPS cap, there is no latency difference outside of margin of error.this was tested a few times before by battlenonsense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

G-SYNC ULTIMATE gaming monitors and Big Format Gaming Displays (BFGD) give users stunning best-in-class HDR gaming, with the latest panels and display technologies. G-SYNC gaming monitors are available with excellent features and technology in virtually every resolution, size and refresh rate. And G-SYNC Compatible gaming monitors are validated to ensure GeForce users receive a flawless baseline variable refresh rate experience, so when you buy a G-SYNC Compatible display you know it\u2019ll work straight out of the box.\nNow, at CES 2020, we\u2019re expanding the range of G-SYNC and G-SYNC Compatible monitors, enhancing our technology to deliver newer and better experiences, and introducing new world firsts, such as the first 360Hz gaming monitor, and the first 32\u201d Mini-LED 4K gaming monitors, all enhanced with G-SYNC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 360Hz Esports Gaming Monitors, For Faster, Smoother, Better Performance\nCompetitive gamers, esports players and esports tournaments already rely on 144Hz and 240Hz G-SYNC gaming monitors for the highest refresh rates, fastest response times, and clearest visuals. Now though, we\u2019re making a major new advancement with the creation of 360Hz, custom-tuned G-SYNC esports monitors that make gaming even more responsive and even clearer, for a competitive edge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur partners at ASUS have implemented this technology, together with AU Optronics\u2019s panel, in the ASUS ROG Swift 360Hz esports display. To get the complete lowdown, check out our dedicated 360Hz monitor article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n LG 2020 OLED TVs Are Also G-SYNC Compatible Big Format Gaming Displays\nIn November, LG became the first TV manufacturer to add G-SYNC Compatible support for their big-screen TVs, enabling GeForce gamers to enjoy stunning visuals and smooth variable refresh rate gaming on LG\u2019s spectacular OLEDs.\nAt CES 2020, LG has unveiled a suite of new big-screen OLED TVs, all 12 of which will be G-SYNC Compatible, with models ranging in size from 48 inches to a whopping 88 inches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith G-SYNC and LG\u2019s technology delivering low latency and smooth, responsive gaming, and their TVs getting ever larger, we\u2019re classifying LG\u2019s new 2020 TVs as Big Format Gaming Displays (BFGDs), giving gamers more options for smooth, high-quality VRR living room gaming.\nSo, if you buy one of LG\u2019s new 2020 G-SYNC Compatible BFGDs, you can be assured to receive an amazing experience, with stunning OLED-powered visuals, ultra low latency courtesy of LG\u2019s latest gaming innovations, and super smooth variable refresh rate gaming, free from tearing or V-SYNC-induced input lag.\nFor info about the release of LG\u2019s new 2020 TVs, stay tuned to their social media channels and websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG-SYNC ULTIMATE Mini-LED Gaming Monitors Make 4K HDR PC Gaming Even Better\nIn 2019, we announced that we were working on next-gen Mini-LED G-SYNC ULTIMATE gaming monitors, which would improve every aspect of previously-released G-SYNC ULTIMATE monitors, delivering an even better experience.\nThis week at CES 2020, our partners at ACER and ASUS are showing the latest version of this display technology, which has been enhanced and improved since its announcement. Previously, Mini-LED was to feature 576 local dimming zones for HDR, improving contrast, minimising haloing, and improving colour accuracy and overall picture quality.\nThis was a 50% improvement over the 384 zones offered by our first G-SYNC ULTIMATE monitors, which were themselves a massive leap over previously-released HDR PC displays. But now, there are an unprecedented 1152 local dimming zones on the ASUS and ACER 32\u201d 144Hz 4K G-SYNC ULTIMATE gaming monitors, vastly improving picture quality.\nFurthermore, we\u2019ve tweaked and improved contrast, boosted HDR brightness to a peak of 1400 nits, and enhanced our DCI-P3 colour accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook for coverage of the new ASUS PG32UQX and Acer X32 Mini-LED 4K G-SYNC ULTIMATE gaming monitors on your favourite tech channels and websites this week. And stay tuned to GeForce.com for word on the release of these best-in-class displays, which improve every aspect of the G-SYNC ULTIMATE experience that press and gamers rate so highly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25 New G-SYNC Compatible Displays Announced and Supported\nThis time last year, we unveiled G-SYNC Compatible, a new category of gaming monitors that offered a baseline variable refresh rate (VRR) experience with a sufficiently-wide VRR range, and were guaranteed to deliver a flawless G-SYNC experience straight out of the box. By introducing G-SYNC Compatible, we ensured that gamers could easily find and buy a good gaming monitor with the knowledge that it\u2019ll work well, improving their gaming.\nSince then, we've introduced support for more and more monitors via our Game Ready Drivers, across all major resolutions, on monitors big and small, with refresh rates of up to 240Hz. And now, we\u2019re announcing support for a further 25 G-SYNC Compatible gaming monitors and displays, taking us to 90 displays total.\nOf the 25, 7 gaming monitors are enabled in today\u2019s new Game Ready Driver, along with support for the 2019 LG Z9 88\u201d BFGD, which users will also need to install a new firmware for via LG\u2019s website or the TV\u2019s built-in firmware update tool.\nSupport for the LG 2020 OLED Big Format Gaming Displays and other G-SYNC Compatible gaming monitors will follow later in the year, so keep your eye on our driver article news feed for word of their release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew G-SYNC Compatible Gaming Monitors, TVs and BFGDs\n\n\nGaming Monitors\n\n\nModel\nSize\nResolution\nGame Ready Driver Support\n\n\nAcer VG252QX\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nAcer XB253Q GX\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nAcer XV253QX\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nASUS VG259QM\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nComing soon\n\n\nASUS VG279QM\n27\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nASUS PG43UQ\n43\u201d\n3840x2160\nComing soon\n\n\nDell AW2521HF\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nComing soon\n\n\nDell AW2521HFL\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nComing soon\n\n\nLG 38WN95C\n37.5\u201d\n3840x1600\nAvailable now\n\n\nLG 28GN950\n37.5\u201d\n3840x1600\nAvailable now\n\n\nLG 34GN850\n34\u201d\n3440x1440\nComing soon\n\n\nView Sonic XG270\n27\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nBig Format Gaming Displays (BFGDs)\n\n\nLG 2020 BX\n55\u201d 65\u201d and 77\u201d\n3840x2160 \nLater this year\n\n\nLG 2020 CX\n48\u201d 55\u201d 65\u201d and 77\u201d\n3840x2160\nLater this year\n\n\nLG 2020 GX\n55\u201d 65\u201d and 77\u201d\n3840x2160\nLater this year\n\n\nLG 2020 ZX\n77\u201d and 88\u201d\n7680x4320 \nLater this year\n\n\nLG 2019 Z9\n88\u201d\n7680x4320\nAvailable now (TV firmware update required)\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor a complete list of all supported G-SYNC, G-SYNC ULTIMATE and G-SYNC Compatible gaming monitors, head to our handy webpage, with filters and options for sorting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG-SYNC In 2020: More Options, Even-Better Tech, and New Innovations\nThere are now 164 G-SYNC, G-SYNC Compatible, G-SYNC ULTIMATE and G-SYNC ULTIMATE BFGD gaming monitors and TVs, giving gamers seeking smooth, superior gaming enough choice to find the perfect display for their den, office or living room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the upcoming launch of our 360Hz and Mini-LED gaming monitors, even better displays will soon be available, and we continue to work with partners around the world to develop and launch even more G-SYNC monitors in each category, using the latest optimisations, enhancements and innovations.\nFor more on these and other NVIDIA advancements and developments, stay tuned to GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\n#SHOTWITHGEFORCE\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United Kingdom\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia and Asus have unveiled what is apparently the world's first 360Hz G-Sync monitor, the Asus ROG 360, ahead of CES. Not surprisingly, a display with this high a refresh rate is designed primarily with competitive gaming in mind, and you'll need a beefy GPU to take advantage of it.\u00a0360Hz seems a bit like overkill, but there was also a time when people thought anything higher than 60 fps was pointless. You might not get much use out of it in singleplayer games, but it could give you a leg up when it comes to MOBAs or competitive shooters.With the upcoming monitor, Nvidia says that frames will be displayed every 2.8ms, which makes the game clearer and more responsive to superhuman reflexes. Thanks to G-Sync, esports pros won't need to worry about screen tearing, either. \u00a0It's a 24.5\", 1080p monitor, but even with the bog standard resolution you're only going to be able to get the most out of the display on less demanding games, like CS:GO, and a high-end GPU. Nvidia, not surprisingly, recommends its RTX range.Unfortunately, I don't think even the world's fastest monitor will be able to overcome the fact that I'm a sluggish guy in his mid-30s, but if you feel like your Overwatch performance is being held back by your old monitor, this one might be worth keeping an eye on.There's no word on the price yet\u2014given that it's aiming at the competitive crowd, don't expect it to be cheap\u2014but it's due out this year and is being shown off at CES this week.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nASUS\n\n\nFraser BrownSocial Links NavigationOnline EditorFraser is the UK online editor and has actually met The Internet in person.

Or in other words, the GeForce 8 series through GeForce 300 series. Moving forward though they will still be maintaining the NVIDIA 390 driver series that is their legacy driver for the Fermi GPUs.\r\n\nThe GeForce 8 series was introduced all the way back in 2006 and thus nearly a decade and a half later it's time to phase out the software support. The GeForce 200 series is even 11+ years old and thus time for its retirement.\r\n\nThe final 340 Linux driver does have X.Org Server 1.20 and Linux 5.4 kernel compatibility so it should be good enough for running on existing Linux distributions for some time. There is also the open-source Nouveau driver that offers support for these graphics cards over a decade old.\r\n\nIn NVIDIA's updated bulletin they commit to maintaining the 390 driver series for Fermi through the end of 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n66 Comments \n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\nRelated News\nNVIDIA RTX Remix 1.0 Released With DXVK DLSS4 & Neural Radiance CacheThe New Rust-Written NVIDIA \"NOVA\" Driver Submitted Ahead Of Linux 6.15NVIDIA Is Finding Great Success With Vulkan Machine Learning - Competitive With CUDANVIDIA Vulkan Beta Driver Updated For Blackwell & New ExtensionsNVIDIA 570.124.04 Linux Driver Brings Additional FixesNVIDIA Publishes RTX Neural Texture Compression \"RTXNTC\" Beta\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Over time, GPUs became more capable, evolving to the point where they were not just useful in creative design, but vital. Last summer, the entire creative industry got a shot in the arm with the launch of NVIDIA\u2019s RTX family of GPUs and features. In this article, we\u2019re going to explore why that is.\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA sponsored our time to deep-dive RTX so that we could produce this article.\nWhen we look back on the last couple of years of articles we\u2019ve written centered on media and entertainment, we see that changes made over time have been staggering. We\u2019ve seen the introduction of Tensor cores and the explosion of AI, with research gained being applied to mainstream software we all use. We\u2019ve also seen the introduction of ray tracing APIs, as well as NVIDIA\u2019s real-time ray tracing hardware, falling into the RTX family.\nAt Computex 2019, we saw the introduction of NVIDIA\u2019s Studio platform, hardware and software dedicated to creative workloads. NVIDIA Studio combines GeForce and Quadro-powered systems with the NVIDIA Studio Stack of specialized SDKs and dedicated Studio Drivers. This all goes through extensive and rigorous hardware and software testing for creative applications and workloads. There\u2019s also NVIDIA\u2019s RTX Studio range, which are dedicated workstations and laptops with all the real-time ray tracing, AI acceleration, and high-quality video editing features in a single package to help artists create content in record time.\nWe previously covered ray tracing in gaming, and the industry\u2019s move to inch closer towards photorealism with realistic shadows, reflections, caustics, and so on. This article is concentrating on the creative aspect \u2013 the businesses and people who make the games, movies, and even products.\n\nAutodesk\u2019s Arnold is one of the latest design tools to adopt NVIDIA RTX\nFor nearly 10 years, NVIDIA has worked on its own programming language, CUDA, to leverage the power of its GPUs in more general-purpose applications. As this matured, and more features were added, it gave rise to new hardware acceleration to improve these workflows. Then, a few years ago, we saw the first steps of a new industry based around neural networks, machine-learning, and AI. What took everyone by surprise was the speed at which these industries took off.\nIn May 2017, we saw the launch of a new wave of hardware, purpose-built around AI. One such offering was NVIDIA\u2019s Volta architecture, with the debut of the V100 GPU. This graphics chip includes AI-centered Tensor cores that have become one of the key building blocks in not just AI development and inferencing, but also NVIDIA\u2019s RTX platform. Just one year later, in March 2018, we saw one of the most impressive technical launches for a new feature. Everyone went ray tracing crazy with the now iconic Star Wars Reflections demo, utilizing DirectX ray tracing (DXR) and NVIDIA\u2019s RTX.\nWhile the Star Wars demo was impressive, it did come with a steep hardware requirement: four GV100 GPUs working in unison. Little did we know at the time that dedicated hardware for ray tracing was on the way. A few months later in August, just before SIGGRAPH 2018, we had the privilege of interviewing the creator of computer-aided recursive ray tracing, J. Turner Whitted. A few days later, NVIDIA announced its very first real-time ray tracing GPUs with the Quadro RTX launch, and just a week later, we saw the\u00a0GeForce RTX launch at Gamescom.\nDXR, RTX, And Tensor Cores\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out that ray tracing is not specific to NVIDIA with RTX;\u00a0it\u2019s part of the DirectX ray tracing API (DXR), as well as Vulkan RT. NVIDIA is one of the first to implement hardware acceleration of these ray tracing APIs with the help of its RT and Tensor cores. It\u2019s the RT cores that allow for real-time ray tracing by doing Bounding Volumetric Hierarchy (BVH) traversal calculations.\nThe job of these RT cores is simple, but tedious. BVH is the equivalent of collision detection for ray traces. It figures out where in a scene a ray strikes an object. Each one of these objects has a boundary, a volume of space surrounding it that is used to roughly determine its location. When a ray of light is cast, and hits one of these boundaries, the volume shrinks and the ray continues. This is done progressively with smaller boxes, until either the ray hits the smallest boundary and a pixel value is calculated, or the ray flies past without hitting anything. The RT cores quickly figure out where light hits an object, but then passes off the collision to a shader that does the final rendering. All of this can be done with normal shaders, but it takes a very long time, and that\u2019s the crucial element here: RT cores allow for this to be done in real-time.\nAs powerful as these RT cores are, they still need a little help, and that\u2019s where the Tensor cores come in. Ray tracing is very computationally expensive, and 3D designers have used all kinds of tricks to speed up the process. One example was to limit the number of rays cast to get a rough idea of where things are, and then use a denoise filter to smooth out any rough patches.\n\nWith several years of training with deep learning and neural networks, these ray traced noise patterns can be used to help fill in the blank spots in a rendered image. The Tensor cores on RTX cards can very effectively \u2018guess\u2019 the adjacent pixels and fill in the render. It\u2019s more than a simple post-process blur filter, as it takes into account the depth of each object, proximity to others, environmental lighting, the normal map, and so on, producing some very accurate and surprising results, very quickly. Use of these denoise filters were one of the first examples used to illustrate the Tensor cores.\nRTX In Software\nIt didn\u2019t take long for 3D design software to catch onto the tangible speed increases in rendering that NVIDIA\u2019s RT cores can provide. GPU rendering has been a thing for a number of years. In the early stages, it couldn\u2019t match the complexity in render options that CPU rendering could provide, but it didn\u2019t take long to catch up. Even long-standing CPU only renderers like Arnold have since enabled GPU render support, retaining the full feature set.\nWhen NVIDIA showed off what its RT and Tensor cores could do, nearly every 3D design suite started development on supporting these RTX features. It\u2019s not just 3D work that\u2019s on the table, but video editors, too, such as Adobe Premiere Pro. DaVinci Resolve is another notable adopter, using Tensor cores for various AI assisted effects, such as upscaling, stylizing, object detection and tracking, and various composite effects.\n\nWhile not strictly related to RTX, but still immensely important and one of the big surprises of the year, NVIDIA enabled 30-bit OpenGL color support on GeForce and TITAN graphics cards, no longer confining it to its Quadro line of professional GPUs. Color grading and video editing applications from Adobe and DaVinci can now do full 10-bit per channel color authoring on mainstreaming hardware with a compatible monitor. Currently, the competition only offers this feature on its professional GPUs.\nThe 10-bit addition to mainstream GPUs stems from an increase in HDR content. Movies are no longer only produced by large production studios, and video games are now enabling HDR rendering, so it all seems fitting to allow content creators to make use of the extended color palette, be they professionals, streamers, or gamers.\nThe list of companies that have either integrated RTX support, or have it planned, is astonishing. Adobe\u2019s Dimension, Photoshop, Lightroom, Substance, Autodesk\u2019s Arnold, Blender, Davinci Resolve, finalRender, Dassault\u2019s CATIA, SolidWorks Visualize, Daz 3D, Unreal Engine, Luxion\u2019s Keyshot, Maxon\u2019s Redshift, OTOY\u2019s OctaneRender, RenderMan, Siemens NX RT Studio, Unity, and many others.\nWe can\u2019t look at all of them, but we do have first-hand experience with some, and plenty of examples of what RTX can do in the real world, beyond gaming.\nBlender 2.81 OptiX And Octane\nAs part of the new wave of software announcements that included RTX support, Blender was high up on the list of design suites we wanted to test out. Blender 2.81 can now make use of OptiX as a rendering engine when using Cycles. While there is an AI-denoiser that\u2019s part of OptiX, this is not included with Blender by default, however, there are plugins available that can add this, such as Remington\u2019s D-NOISE which is available over at GitHub.\nBlender\u2019s render engine, Cycles, is actually the perfect showpiece for the benefits of what RTX can do. It\u2019s an unbiased renderer that can use the CPU, GPU, mixed mode rendering using both CPU and GPU, and now RTX using the OptiX engine. This effectively gives us the opportunity to see how all the hardware can be used in different ways within the same application, with the same projects. A real apples-to-apples test suite.\n\n\n\n\nWe did some thorough testing of Blender 2.81\u2019s alpha build that had a near-full implementation of the OptiX engine. The charts show some really impressive performance boosts from the RT cores doing some heavy lifting, cutting render times down by as much as half in some cases. You can read our full testing in the article, but keep in mind that many of the issues we encountered have since been fixed. Actual performance remains the same in the official 2.81 release, and is very impressive.\n\nLuxion announced plans to add GPU support to its Keyshot render engine at SIGGRAPH 2019. Not only was it adding GPU support, but it went head first into RTX support too. Just last month we saw the official release of Keyshot 9, bringing with it the new rendering engine, a bunch of new features, as well as denoising and accelerated rendering using those Tensor and RT cores. We haven\u2019t had a chance to dive into testing yet, but it\u2019s in the works.\nOTOY\u2019s OctaneRender was another of the big render engines that enabled support for RTX. While only announced shortly after NVIDIA\u2019s GTC event earlier this year, we managed to get a sneak peek of a beta version of the new OctaneBench which can test the RTX rendering features. This is the same rendering engine that will be built into the official renderer, but in a more convenient format for benchmarking. We put a bunch of GPUs through and were astounded at the difference those RT cores could make.\n\nThis chart compares the normal GPU scores with RTX turned on and off for each GPU. From the mid-range GeForce RTX 2060, up to the 2080 Ti, there was a 2.5x increase in performance averaged over three tests, for each GPU. While this is a score-based metric, real render times will be affected to at least a similar degree.\nV-Ray, Adobe, And More\nV-Ray is another popular rendering engine where its plugin was recently updated (as part of the 3ds Max and Maya update), enabling RTX features as part of its workflow. V-Ray is something we test frequently here, and we plan on doing a deep dive into the performance benefits later. Same can be said for Maxon\u2019s Redshift. Autodesk\u2019s Maya 3D design suite and Arnold Renderer have now enabled RTX features for rapid rendering and AI denoising\n\nAdobe has its own 3D applications like Dimension and Substance using RTX features. Dimension allows for interactive editing of full renders, changing colors and lighting within a scene, accelerated with RTX hardware. Substance has multiple applications under its suite. Alchemist makes use of the Tensor cores to break 2D images down and convert them to 3D textures. This process uses the Tensor cores and AI to quickly mask areas of interest automatically, and adjust lighting effects in select areas. This potentially saves hours of masking and editing time for the artist. Substance Painter and Designer make use of RTX to accelerate map baking (saving high poly-count 3D geometry as a texture), and you don\u2019t need a Turing GPU for this, since GeForce 10-series GPUs can speed up this process using DXR.\nDaVinci Resolve\u2019s Neural Engine makes use of NVIDIA AI libraries and Tensor cores for things such as speed warp, which is used to interpolate new frames when slowing down footage. There is Super Scaling for upscaling low resolution footage to 4K without making everything seem blurry (a feature used in games as well, as part of DLSS). There are various automated color matching and stylizing effects that takes a lot of the hard work out of manual adjustments. There is even facial recognition that can be used to automate tagging, or track characters in a composition.\nAll of these AI and ray tracing benefits come in addition to NVIDIA\u2019s widely supported CUDA language that countless applications use, plus the NVENC dedicated video encoding and decoding hardware capabilities. This is all on GeForce hardware, and not just professional series graphics cards, like the Quadro RTX GPUs.\nNow And The Future Of RTX\nThis last year has been surprising on many levels with just how far NVIDIA\u2019s RTX platform has come. Even the last few months alone have seen announcement after announcement centered on new and exciting ways the creative industry has not just latched onto, but embraced RTX. The biggest surprise isn\u2019t just the 2-3x performance increases we\u2019re seeing in applications, or the ingenuity behind the AI research \u2013 it\u2019s the sheer scale of the industry\u2019s support.\nThese ray tracing and AI inferencing engines are not restricted to NVIDIA\u2019s Turing architecture. Blender will work great with any GPU, but the addition of those RT cores can really speed up the process. Adobe has experimented with AI in its applications in the background for a few years, the Tensor cores on Volta and Turing cards just speed up the process.\nIn an industry where time is money, every single advantage that can be leveraged, should be utilized. Real-time interactive renders of ray traced scenes with AI-assisted denoising allows creatives to not just rapidly change and adapt projects, but actually experiment with new ideas and methods without feeling guilty about wasting an hour on a bad render with old hardware.\nWith all that we\u2019ve seen this last year, and the support the industry has shown, we can\u2019t wait to see what next year, and the next decade bring.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport our efforts!

It\u2019s been a solid performance option in the $350 range, but its pricing relative to the GTX 1060 6GB left some space for NVIDIA to fill to complete their Turing product stack. Over the following months NVIDIA released the lower-cost GTX 16-series cards, removing hardware ray tracing support and hitting important $149 \u2013 $279 price points.\nIt took AMD until July to release the first graphics cards based on their new 7nm Navi GPU, with the Radeon RX 5700 and RX 5700 XT. NVIDIA pre-empted this launch with the first of the \u201cSUPER\u201d cards, seemingly forcing AMD to lower prices before the launch of these new Radeon cards. Or did it? Regardless of AMD\u2019s true pricing plans, the RX 5700 XT did in fact drop $50 from its originally announced $449 price point after the $399 RTX 2060 SUPER launched, with the RX 5700 moving from $379 to $349 at the same time.\nNVIDIA kept the original RTX 2060 on the market after the RTX 2060 SUPER was released \u2013 presumably as a direct RX 5700 competitor, and by the end of the year we saw RX 5700 prices fall to their current lows of $299 \u2013 $319, with RTX 2060 cards often found in the $319 \u2013 $339 range. NVIDIA\u2019s $279 GTX 1660 Ti enjoyed a favorable position with only older Vega 56 and RX 590 cards to compete with, though this card became somewhat overshadowed by NVIDIA\u2019s own $229 GTX 1660 SUPER later on. And the competition still hasn\u2019t cooled off.\nWith today\u2019s announcement of a $279 RTX 2060 (available January 13), long-time NVIDIA partner EVGA has produced a card that not only puts AMD\u2019s just-announced RX 5600 XT on notice, but the NVIDIA GTX 1660 Ti ($279) as well. Naturally this price conflict isn\u2019t viable, and already EVGA\u2019s GTX 1660 Ti cards are being offered with $20 rebates, taking the starting prices down to $259+:\n \n\n\n Will $259 become the new GTX 1660 Ti price? Will AMD respond again with another pre-launch price drop, with the RX 5600 XT moving down to match a ~$259 GTX 1660 Ti? We will have to wait and see. The next week or two could be very interesting.\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousEVGA\u2019s Brand NU Audio Pro 7.1 Premium Sound Card \n\nNextAGDQ 2020 Sets Another New Record: $3.13 Million \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nSebastian Peak\nEditor-in-Chief at PC Perspective.

As much as AMD wants to compare it to the it to the 1660 ti, it will then be undercut by the much cheaper 1660 Super, which can be had for $230-240, and performs as close as makes no difference to the 1660 ti. Only if the 5600 XT can compete with the 2060 will it be a viable option at $279. I love the value of the 5700 and 5700 XT, but the 5500 XT and 5600 XT are duds.\nReply  \n \n \n\n\n\nLeave a reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

The two companies have been working on a new high-performance 1080p display aimed at competitive gaming that offers a blistering 360Hz maximum refresh rate, \u00a050% faster than the current crop of 240Hz market leaders. The new monitor will be sold by ASUS as the ROG Swift 360, and is set to be available later this year.\nLike other G-Sync projects, NVIDIA\u2019s latest display endeavor looks to be an effort for the company to differentiate itself and its technology in a crowded market, this time by offering an LCD monitor with a rather absurd refresh rate.\nThe ROG Swift 360 itself is based on a 24.5-inch panel being supplied by AU Optronics, and which is capable of running at up to 360Hz. This is 120Hz faster than the current generation of high-end gaming monitors, which top out at 240Hz, and is an uncommonly large jump to make in a single generation. Unfortunately NVIDIA isn\u2019t disclosing what type of panel is being used here, however all of the 24.5-inch 240Hz G-Sync monitors that have been released to date have been TN, so that\u2019s a safe bet, especially with the kind of refresh rate NVIDIA and ASUS are looking to hit. The bigger question is whether this is a new panel from AUO, or if it\u2019s a further overclocked version of their popular M250HTN01 panel.\nNVIDIA and ASUS have not released much else with regards to technical details at this time. The monitor isn\u2019t set to ship until later this year \u2013 which as we\u2019re at the very start of the year, likely means it\u2019s still several months off \u2013 so the companies undoubtedly still have some technical details to hammer out. Though as most of the work is in the panel and controller, it shouldn\u2019t be too different from ASUS\u2019s 240Hz ROG Swift PG258Q.\n\nASUS 360 Hz on left, 240 Hz on right. It is a TN Panel\nOne thing that NVIDIA has confirmed, however, is that this will be a true G-Sync monitor, with NVIDIA supplying the monitor\u2019s display controller. This is an important distinction not only for compatibility purposes, but because it means that the monitor supports full variable overdrive functionality, which will become increasingly important with such a wide refresh rate range. Even fast TN monitors still need to overdrive their pixels to hit high refresh rates, so the overdrive logic is practically as important as the panel itself in order to minimize ghosting. Though it goes without saying that with NVIDIA aiming to beat current generation monitors by 50%, it\u2019ll be interesting to see just how well 360Hz works in practice, and if the monitor really is fast enough to make a 360Hz refresh rate useful.\nThe target market for the ROG Swift 360, in turn, is competitive gaming, as well as anyone who wants a competition-grade monitor. The benefits of higher refresh rates are pretty well known at this point \u2013 higher refresh rates make for smoother experiences and reduce rendering latency \u2013 and NVIDIA thinks that there\u2019s still enough benefit to justify a 360Hz monitor. That said, with 240Hz monitors offering an already tiny 4.16ms frame time, the absolute benefit of 360Hz is small: that 50% jump in refresh rate only shaves off a further ~1.4ms at the monitor level (for a total of 2.77ms), which isn\u2019t nearly as great as the jump from 60Hz to 120Hz, for example.\n\nStill, NVIDIA has done their own research around the new monitor and player performance, finding that even with the diminishing returns, a 360Hz monitor did improve flick shot performance in Overwatch. As well, they measured a 14.5ms reduction in total (end-to-end) latency, going from 34.5ms at 240Hz to 20ms at 360Hz.\nNVIDIA and ASUS will have the ROG Swift 360 on display this week at CES. So while the monitor won\u2019t be on sale for a while yet, we should be able to get a first-hand look at how well NVIDIA\u2019s future gaming monitor is set to perform.\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n38 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nSychonut - Sunday, January 5, 2020 - link\n360Hz?  Who cares dawg, who cares?  Another unnecessary \"need\" created to drive up sales. \n\n\n\nwillis936 - Sunday, January 5, 2020 - link\nIt\u2019s important and it\u2019s nice to see progress in temporal resolution pushed.  Refresh rates already push past what LCDs can handle.  360 Hz is well into OLED territory.  A 360 Hz consumer OLED: now that would be cause to sit up in one\u2019s seat.\n\n\n\nsurt - Sunday, January 5, 2020 - link\nWho cares?  High end gamers looking for an edge.  Every ms in end-to-end latency matters.\n\n\n\nA5 - Monday, January 6, 2020 - link\nThere are probably a handful of people in the world that can tell the difference between 240 and 360 once they're in-game. \n\n\n\nJoeyJoJo123 - Monday, January 6, 2020 - link\n240hz is already a subtle difference to 120/144. Also, it's not about whether you can \"tell\" the difference or not, because ultimately, you need to practice with your mouse, your keyboard, your desk, your monitor -- your entire setup, and often any change to anything involves some personal retraining to get used to the new change. Ordinarily you could just people in a double-blind study (and have them guess which monitor is 240hz and which is 360hz), but really you need way more time to get attuned with the peripheral.Often times, pros are pros because they're highly attuned to their setup and can minimize the human element of ingesting information (time taken to digest what's happening on the monitor/sounds heard from headphones) and especially minimizing the human element of interacting with input elements (controller/mouse/keyboard/arcade stick/wheel+pedals/etc).It's as naive of an idea as just going up to a fighting game pro like Daigo Umehara, taking their arcade stick and giving them a 3rd party MadCatz controller and saying \"Hey, if you're so pro, then you should be able to win with this.\" No, it doesn't work like that, you need to actually get used to it before you can really start noticing any differences.By the same token having 5 minutes to try to compare the two monitors really isn't enough time. You need to let it sit and boil for like a month and see if they prefer the new 360hz monitor over the old one.Additionally, as refresh rates (and brightness) increase ever higher, you can start implementing black frame insertion on every other frame through software, while still keeping a good enough effective refresh rate. Losing every other frame at 360hz = 180hz + low display persistence (diminished ghosting/motion blur), and that lowered motion blur may help a bit more than the additional slight smoothness from 240hz->360hz.So there's a lot of stuff to consider before we go about dismissing 360hz just because \"the human eye can't see past 23.998 fps cinema movies\" memes.\n\n\n\ncrimsonson - Monday, January 6, 2020 - link\nDaigo can pick the stick he uses in a tournament. Monitors are something the organizers pick because sponsors pay for them.It is not an apt analogy.\n\n\n\nmdrejhon - Tuesday, January 7, 2020 - link\nOne wants to jump up the Hz curve geometrically.60Hz->144Hz and 144Hz->360Hz are similar percentage jumps.Benefits are most noticeable this way in the curve of diminishing returns.  Tests have shown that the diminishing curve still has benefits to well beyond 1000Hz.\n\n\n\nPeachNCream - Monday, January 6, 2020 - link\nTrue statement.  Within a product category there is a need to fight a specifications war to land sales and the current specifications battle has settled around refresh rate.  Manufacturers NEED to create a reason behind the specifications or no one will care.  In this case the industry consensus is to impress upon gullible customers that a higher refresh rate will improve their competitive gameplay so that they crawl out of their parents' basement to beg their parents to spot them a few hundred dollars for a new monitor just until they can get a few more Grubhub deliveries done and can pay them back or finally win that one vidja games tournament with said monitor.\n\n\n\nSpunjji - Monday, January 6, 2020 - link\nThere's some interesting information on this topic available on specialist sites covering motion blurring in displays... In short, the closer we get to ~1000Hz, the less motion blur is visible on sample-and-hold displays - all while avoiding the brightness reduction of blank-frame-insertion.\n\n\n\nwillis936 - Monday, January 6, 2020 - link\nNo reason to cover up information.  The site is tft central.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

An upgraded model was released in mid-2019 for $400, the RTX 2060 Super, and now Nvidia has officially lowered the price of the regular RTX 2060 to $299.The first evidence of the price drop came last week, when EVGA released two new RTX 2060 cards at CES, one of which was priced at just $280. Now Nvidia has made it official, with the stock Founders Edition model now going for $299 on the company's online store. Most other variations of the 2060 are still priced around $330-350 for the time being.This seems to be a response to AMD's upcoming Radeon RX 5600 XT, which will have an MSRP of $279 while offering performance somewhere between a GTX 1660 Ti and RTX 2060. Regardless if that's the reason or not, it's nice to see ray tracing become slightly more accessible. I think we can all agree lower graphics card prices are nothing to complain about.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\nCorbin DavenportSocial Links NavigationCorbin is a tech journalist, software developer, and longtime PC Gamer freelance writer, currently based in North Carolina.

And while suitable machines need to be fairly fast, few of need to be an expensive machine with a professional-grade GPU; moderately-priced machines are increasingly powerful enough to do the job. So, aiming for this audience, Lenovo is introducing its Yoga Creator 7, a 15.6-inch laptop that promises to meet performance needs of mobile digital content creators.\nThe Lenovo Yoga Creator 7 is equipped with a 15.6-inch display panel that covers 100% of the sRGB color gamut, which remains the web standard. The notebook is based on Intel\u2019s 10th Generation Core processors (presumably Comet Lake, though Lenovo does not specify) that is accompanied by NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce GPU with NVIDIA Studio drivers certified by select ISVs for their applications. The system supports Lenovo\u2019s Q-Control technology to boost performance when it is needed most as well as Lenovo\u2019s Intelligent Cooling that automatically adjust fan speed depending on the workload to optimize battery life. Speaking of the latter, Lenovo says that the mobile PC can last for 13 hours on one charge and supports its Rapid Charge capability.\n\nBeing a performance-mainstream notebook, the Yoga Creator 7 comes with a Windows Hello-compliant IR-enabled webcam, a fingerprint scanner, an optional Wi-Fi 6 adapter, Dolby Atmos-certified speakers, and far-field microphones compatible with Amazon Alexa and Microsoft Cortana.\n\nThe 15.6-inch Lenovo Yoga Creator 7 weighs 1.9 kilograms and is 16.4 mm thick, which is lower than that of mainstream 15.6-inch notebook, which will make it more attractive for the modern audience.\n\nIn addition to the Yoga Creator 6, Lenovo also announced its IdeaPad Creator 5 15.6-inch mainstream laptop. The IdeaPad features an IPS display, Intel\u2019s 10th Gen Core processors, an NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce GPU with Studio Drivers, up to 16 GB DDR4 DRAM, and up to 1 TB PCIe SSD. The machine weighs 2.2 kilograms and promises up to 8 hours of battery life, which is in line with other mainstream 15.6-inch-class machines.\n\nFor now, Lenovo plans to make its Yoga Creator 7 and IdeaPad Creator 5 available on select markets and has no plans to bring them to North America.\nRelated Reading:\n\nLenovo\u2019s Yoga C940 15.6-Inch: Eight Cores and GTX 1650\nLenovo Unveils Yoga C940 14-Inch: Ice Lake, 4K, Dolby Vision\nLenovo Unveils ThinkPad P1 Gen 2: New 15.6-Inch Carbon Fiber Chassis\nAcer\u2019s Predator Triton 300: Thin Laptop w/ Core i7, GeForce GTX 1650, PowerGem\nAcer Unveils ConceptD 7 Pro: Core i7, Quadro RTX 5000, 4K Calibrated Monitor\n\nLenovo\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n3 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\ns.yu - Monday, January 6, 2020 - link\n\"an NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce GPU\"That inspires confidence.

If you\u2019re tired of setting this limit in every individual game you play, this will save a you a bit of time\u2014and since the feature is somewhat buried in Nvidia\u2019s Control Panel, and arrived with little fanfare, here\u2019s how to find it (and what it does).To get started, make sure you\u2019ve updated to the latest GeForce drivers. For most people, that\u2019s as simple as checking GeForce Experience for an update:\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: David Murphy\n\n\nYou can also use Nvidia\u2019s website to download the latest drivers directly\u2014version 441.87, as of when we wrote this article. Once you\u2019ve installed the new drivers, pull up your Nvidia Control Panel by right-clicking on your desktop and selecting that option. You\u2019ll then want to click on \u201cManage 3D settings\u201d and scroll down a bit until you see the new \u201cMax Frame Rate\u201d option. Click on it to pull up a little slider:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should you set this value to? I recommend starting by matching your display\u2019s refresh rate, if you even want to enable it. Sure, you\u2019ll enjoy less input lag if you just let the frames fly with no cap, but regular people will probably notice the image tearing that comes with this more than they\u2019ll be able to perceive milliseconds of difference when shooting their friends in Fortnite.Also, if you\u2019re gaming on a laptop, limiting your frame rate ensures that your graphics card isn\u2019t working its ass off\u2014creating unnecessary noise and heat, and burning through your battery\u2014to crank out extra frames that might cause tearing or other annoyances for your games.If you find that limiting your frame rates (in combination with enabling or disabling Vsync) creates a better experience in the games you regularly play, keep it! And if you find that your game feels less responsive, up the value\u2014twice your monitor\u2019s refresh rate, if your graphics card can handle it\u2014or turn it off entirely. \n\n\n\nThe controversial setting doesn\u2019t come with a single right or wrong answer for every instance; it all depends on the kind of games you play and the kind of experience you want. If you\u2019re looking to make a career out of CS:GO, I\u2019d avoid the setting entirely. If you like playing single-player role-playing games, give it a try and see if it makes a difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Murphy\n\n\n\nRead David's full bio\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore by David\n\n\n\n\n\nEvil Week: How to Hide Porn on Your Windows PC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        October 30, 2023\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware\n\n\nHow to Buy a Burner Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        September 11, 2023\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\n                See More\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\nTake These Steps Now to Protect Your Data From Medusa Ransomware\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        March 18, 2025\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\nWhat People Are Getting Wrong This Week: Secret Tunnels Under Gene Hackman's House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        March 18, 2025\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputing\n\n\nGIMP 3's New Features Make the Best Free Image Editor Even Better\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        March 18, 2025\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        December 17, 2024\n    \n\u00a0\n                    \nThis Nvidia App Setting Is Tanking Your Frame Rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        November 7, 2024\n    \n\u00a0\n                    \nMax Is the Latest Streaming Service to Target Password Sharing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        November 6, 2024\n    \n\u00a0\n                    \nThe PS5 Pro Can Now Give Your PS4 Games a Visual Boost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        June 25, 2024\n    \n\u00a0\n                    \nToday's Strands NYT Hints (and Answer) for Tuesday, June 25, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

To kick off the new year, we\u2019re excited to share that a ray-traced upgrade for Wolfenstein: Youngblood will be available the week of January 6th.\nWith ray tracing enabled, you can marvel at ray-traced reflections throughout each of Wolfenstein: Youngblood\u2019s levels. Any surface, if it\u2019s reflective, will feature accurate, high-quality, high-detail, lifelike reflections that elevate graphical fidelity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn action, ray tracing truly shines, with weapon effects reflecting, and dynamic real-time reflections being reflected on enemies and moving game elements. To see for yourself, check out the video below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enable Ray-Traced Reflections, ensure you have the latest Game Ready Driver, Windows 10 update and game patch installed (when released), and navigate to Options > Video > Advanced Settings. Scroll down, switch Ray Traced Reflections on, and restart the game when prompted. At the same time, you can also enable NVIDIA DLSS, and select the DLSS Mode, which offers players different balances between performance and quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith DLSS enabled, we recommend the GeForce RTX 2060 for 1920x1080, the GeForce RTX 2070 for 2560x1440, and the GeForce RTX 2080 for 3840x2160, enabling all GeForce RTX gamers to experience Wolfenstein: Youngblood\u2019s graphics and ray tracing at max settings at 60 FPS+ (note, users with 6GB of VRAM may need to lower texture detail by one level). And while we strive to support ray tracing on all GeForce GTX 1060 6GB and higher GPUs, Wolfenstein: Youngblood only supports ray tracing on GeForce RTX GPUs at this time due to several bugs and performance issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS Boosts Performance In Wolfenstein: Youngblood\nWhile ray tracing provides the next generation of visual fidelity in Wolfenstein: Youngblood, our DLSS technology accelerates performance so you can enjoy that fidelity at higher frame rates.\nAs an AI algorithm, DLSS is constantly learning and improving. Wolfenstein: Youngblood demonstrates this continuous improvement, with DLSS delivering big boosts in frame rates while providing similar image quality to native resolution with TAA.\nWhat this means for gamers is playing at higher output resolutions and quality settings with ray tracing enabled: in Wolfenstein: Youngblood, the GeForce RTX 2060 delivers over 80 FPS at 1920x1080 with RT and DLSS, and the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti exceeds 100 FPS at 4K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease set YouTube to 1080p60, instead of \u201cAuto\u201d, to see the video as intended\nWolfenstein: Youngblood brings three DLSS modes: Quality, Balanced, and Performance. These options control the DLSS rendering resolution, allowing you to choose the right balance of image quality and FPS. For 1920x1080 and 2560x1440, the default is set to Quality, with 4K set to Performance. Looking at performance with ray tracing on and DLSS at default settings, you\u2019ll enjoy solid gains across our entire RTX line-up:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS can improve performance by up to 2x in Wolfenstein: Youngblood\nMost importantly, DLSS achieves this performance while keeping image quality comparable to native resolutions with TAA. Let's look at two examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages captured at 1080p using DLSS Quality Mode\nAbove, DLSS maintains the crucial line work on the pipes and railings, the specular lights, the subtle gradients, and all the details. Here, it strengthens the grating on the right side of the screen and the pipes on the building in the center, which both look less detailed and apparent in the native image with TAA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages captured at 1080p using DLSS Quality Mode\nDLSS again maintains the crucial line work on the wiring and window sills, the specular lights, the shaded areas, and all the details. Here, it strengthens the window sills on the right side of the screen and the antennas on the top of the building, which are much more muted in the native image with TAA.\nWolfenstein: Youngblood highlights many of the improvements in image quality and performance we\u2019ve made with DLSS over the course 2019. As we begin 2020, we look forward to further improvements!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Highlights In Wolfenstein: Youngblood\nIn addition to adding ray tracing and DLSS, the new Wolfenstein: Youngblood update also includes NVIDIA Highlights. With the latest version of GeForce Experience installed, Highlights will automatically record your best gameplay moments, which you can later edit and upload to YouTube and social media.\nWhen you load the game post-patch, with the latest versions of our Game Ready Driver and GeForce Experience installed, you\u2019ll be prompted to enable NVIDIA Highlights. If you accidentally click \u201cNo,\u201d you can still switch it on by pressing Alt+Z in-game to load GeForce Experience\u2019s overlay, and then navigating to Settings > Highlights via the cog wheel icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor even more ray-traced games, stay tuned to GeForce.com. We\u2019ve already announced that several of this year\u2019s biggest games will benefit from ray tracing, and there are plenty more to come, too.

In very good news, Nvidia is going to make that new remote available to older Shield TV models in the future.\n\nThe new remote that ships with Shield TV (2019) and Shield TV Pro is a pretty big departure from previous offerings from the company. It\u2019s thicker, runs on AAA batteries, and also has more physical buttons than ever before. The D-Pad is still front and center, but underneath it, you\u2019ll find buttons for volume, play/pause, fast forward, rewind, Google Assistant, and also a dedicated Netflix button, too.\nAbove the D-Pad, the new Shield TV remote also has a dedicated button for putting the device to sleep or turning it back on. There\u2019s also a settings button that can be customized to do just about anything you want.

Nvidia confirmed that the new Shield TV remote will be compatible with older models soon. That includes both the 2015 and 2017 versions of the device, too.\nA future software update will enable pairing of the remote and, at some point in the future, the new remote will be sold separately. The standalone remote will cost $29.99 when it does release separately. Nvidia has sign-ups available on its website.\n\nUpdate 1/27: After a few months, Nvidia has finally made its new Shield remote available to older models. This updated remote works with all previous Shield TV models and, alternatively, serves as a replacement in the case you\u2019ve already lost the remote from your 2019 model. Head over to Nvidia\u2019s Shield shop and scroll down to purchase.\n\nBetter than third-party options on Amazon, right?\nMore on Nvidia Shield TV:\n\nNvidia Shield TV (2019) starts at $149 w/ new \u2018tube\u2019 design, Dolby Vision, more\nNvidia Shield TV Pro costs $199 w/ Android TV, AI upscaling, Tegra X1+, more\n\n\n\nAdd 9to5Google to your Google News feed.\u00a0\n\t\t\t \n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Boasting anywhere from 5% to 20% more performance (depending on the game in question) than the RTX 1660 Ti, the AMD Navi 10-equipped GPU is going to be retailing for USD 279 (roughly the same price as a 1660 Ti). Our review of the RX 5600 XT has been delayed a bit because of the frequent BIOS updates, but rest assured it will be going up soon!\nAMD Radeon RX 5600 XT launched for USD 279\nThe story of the RX 5600 XT BIOS versions is really interesting as well. NVIDIA responded to the imminent launch of the RX 5600 XT by dropping the MSRP on its RTX 2060 (non-SUPER) by USD 50 and AMD responded with not one but two BIOS. In fact, we received a third BIOS for the RX 5600 XT just one day before the reviews were scheduled to go live (therefore the delay).\nRelated Story AMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\nThe AMD RX 5600 XT features the Navi 10 XLE chip with 2304 cores. Clocked at 1560 MHz, this is the first card to feature 6GB of GDDR6 memory along with a 192-bit bus. The memory clock is 12 Gbps for many cards while some are shipping with overclocked memories as well. This means you are looking at a minimum bandwidth of 288 GB/s all the way up to 336 GB/s. The TBP is 150W (and up to 180W for the OC variants) and the MSRP of 279 USD puts it dead center of NVIDIA's bread and butter budget-level lineup.\nComing to the memory design, this is where we start seeing major differences between the Radeon RX 5700 and the Radeon RX 5600 XT. While the Radeon RX 5700 rocks an 8 GB GDDR6 memory with a 256-bit wide bus interface, the Radeon RX 5600 XT would rock a 6 GB GDDR6 memory with a 192-bit bus interface. The Radeon RX 5700 also delivers a higher 448 GB/s bandwidth, utilizing the 14 Gbps DRAM dies while the Radeon RX 5600 XT will offer 288 GB/s bandwidth, utilizing slower 12 Gbps DRAM dies. The card will require a single 8-pin power connector and display outputs include a single HDMI 2.0b and triple DisplayPort 1.4 ports.\n\nFull performance benchmarks of the RX 5600 XT (vanilla) are given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe new BIOS that AMD released not only increases the clock speeds of the graphics cards but also increases the TBP. In some cases, the memory clock speed is also increased. This means that the performance levels you are seeing below are actually \"conservative\" and actual performance should be even higher. NVIDIA is going to be facing a lot of heat with the launch of the new RX 5600 XT and this is something that results from the fact that the company is still stuck on the 16/14 node while AMD GPUs are manufactured on the 7nm node.\nAMD Radeon RX 5000 '7nm Navi RDNA' GPU Lineup Specs:\n\n\n\nGraphics CardRadeon RX 5700 XT 50th AnniversaryRadeon RX 5700 XTRadeon RX 5700Radeon RX 5600 XTRadeon RX 5500 XTRadeon RX 5300\n\n\n\n\nGPU Architecture7nm Navi (RDNA 1st Gen)7nm Navi (RDNA 1st Gen)7nm Navi (RDNA 1st Gen)7nm Navi (RDNA 1st Gen)7nm Navi (RDNA 1st Gen)7nm Navi (RDNA 1st Gen)\n\n\nStream Processors2560 SPs2560 SPs2304 SPs2304 SPs1408 SPs1408 SPs\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs160 / 64160 / 64144 / 64144 / 6488 / 3288 / 32\n\n\nBase Clock1680 MHz1605 MHz1465 MHz1130 MHz1670 MHzTBD\n\n\nBoost Clock1980 MHz1905 MHz1725 MHz1560 MHz1845 MHz1645 MHz\n\n\nGame Clock1830 MHz1755 MHz1625 MHz1375 MHz1717 MHz1448 MHz\n\n\nCompute Power10.14 TFLOPs9.75 TFLOPs7.95 TFLOPs7.19 TFLOPs5.19 TFLOPs4.63 TFLOPs\n\n\nVRAM8 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR66 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6\n4 GB GDDR63 GB GDDR6\n\n\nBus Interface256-bit256-bit256-bit192-bit128-bit96-bit\n\n\nBandwidth448 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s288 GB/s224 GB/s168 GB/s\n\n\nTBP235W225W180W150W130W100W\n\n\nPrice$449 US$399 US$349 US$279 US$169 US (4 GB)\n$199 US (8 GB)$129 US?\n\n\nLaunch7th July 20197th July 20197th July 201921st January, 20207th October 201928th August, 2020\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of performance, the card outpaces the GTX 1660 TI which costs the same at $279 and the GTX 1660 SUPER which is very similar to the GTX 1660 Ti in performance at a price of $229 US. Some early performance tests show that the card doesn't have enough power to rival the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 which makes things for it a little hard as EVGA has since released their new RTX 2060 KO edition cards which start at $279 US, the same price as the RX 5600 XT without even factoring in the custom model premium. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060, on the other hand, is up to 20% faster than the GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER while offering added features such as RTX, DLSS, etc.\nReview roundup of the RX 5600 XT:\n\nWccftech RX 5600 XT Review (Delayed)\nIgor's Lab RX 5600 XT Review\nAnandtech RX 5600 XT Review\nGamer's Nexus RX 5600 XT Review\nHexus RX 5600 XT Review\nHot Hardware RX 5600 XT Review\nKitGuru RX 5600 XT Review\nTom's Hardware RX 5600 XT Review\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJP Morgan Believes AMD\u2019s AI GPU Business Would Grow By 60 Percent This Year, Highlights Oracle\u2019s Initial Order Of 30,000 MI355X GPUs\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D & 9900X3D 3D V-Cache CPUs Now Available \u2013 The Best Gaming & Content Creation Package Ever!\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSpaceX\u2019s Letter To Trump Admin Blasts Foreign Duties & Fees On Satellite Service\n\n\n\n111\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n90\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n46\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\n\n\n39\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\n12V-2\u00d76 Power Connector Cooks At Over 150\u00b0C With A \u201cWater-Cooled\u201d NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090\n\n\n\n1360\nComments\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Releases Another Hotfix Driver to Resolve Black Screen Issues, Marking the Firm\u2019s Fifth Attempt to Address The Problem\n\n\n\n1300\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

And for all the details, read on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax Frame Rate: Cap Frame Rates, Save Power, and More\nYou asked for it - the number one community requested feature is here!\nNow, you can set the max frame rate for a 3D application or game. This feature is particularly helpful when trying to save power, reduce system latency, or keep within a specific Variable Refresh Rate range on a G-SYNC or G-SYNC Compatible display.\n\nSaving Power: Enable Max Frame Rate (NVIDIA Control Panel > 3D Settings > Max Frame Rate) and set your power management mode to \u201cOptimal Power\u201d(NVIDIA Control Panel > 3D Settings > Power Management Mode). While in this mode, GPU frequency is reduced and uses less power. For laptop users, Max Frame Rate also works alongside with Battery Boost and Whisper Mode. If either of these modes are enabled at the same time as Max Frame Rate, the NVIDIA Control Panel will cap the framerate to the lowest of the limits.\nReducing System Latency: Enable Max Frame Rate and set your power management mode to \u201cPrefer maximum performance\u201d to reduce latency. While in this mode, the GPU is kept at higher frequencies to process frames as quickly as possible. To maximize latency reduction in GPU bound scenarios where FPS is consistent, set Max Frame Rate to a framerate slightly below the average FPS and turn Low Latency Mode to Ultra.\nStaying in VRR Range: Set the Max Frame Rate slightly below the maximum refresh rate of your display to stay within the Variable Refresh Rate range - providing a no-tear, low system latency experience! For the smoothest, no tear experience, set the low latency mode to Ultra and turn VSYNC on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Rate Supersampling: Improve Image Quality In VR\nVariable Rate Supersampling (VRSS) is a new technique to improve image quality in VR games. It uses NVIDIA Variable Rate Shading (VRS), a key feature in NVIDIA\u2019s Turing architecture, to dynamically apply up to 8x supersampling to the center of the VR headset display, where the eye is generally focused. It intelligently applies supersampling only when GPU headroom is available in order to maintain the VR headset\u2019s fixed FPS and ensure a smooth VR experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to alternative techniques that supersample the entire screen with large hits to frame rate, VRSS\u2019s adaptive use of Variable Rate Shading boosts image quality while staying about the typical 90Hz fixed refresh rate of the VR headset. In the VR game Boneworks, VRSS keeps FPS above 90, whereas a fullscreen 4x supersample drops frame rates to unplayable levels. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTested on GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, Intel Core i7-6700K, 32GB, Windows 10, HTC Vive Pro, CES 2020 Game Ready Driver\nTo enable VRSS, open the NVIDIA Control Panel and select Manage 3D Settings, then scroll to Virtual Reality \u2013 Variable Rate Supersampling, and change the setting to \u201cAdaptive\u201d. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor advanced users, the Control Panel also offers an \u2018Always On\u2019 setting that applies up to 8x supersampling regardless of performance. Note, this may bring your frame rate below the VR headset\u2019s refresh rate and impact your experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVRSS is supported by the driver--no game integration required--and can be applied to DX11 VR games or application that have forward renderers and support MSAA, and have been tested by NVIDIA. At the time of writing, over 20 games meet this criteria, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Battlewake Boneworks Eternity WarriorsTM VR Hot Dogs, Horseshoes and Hand Grenades In Death Job Simulator Killing Floor: Incursion L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files Lone Echo \nMercenary 2: Silicon Rising Pavlov VR Raw Data Rec Room Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality Robo Recall SairentoVR Serious Sam VR: The Last Hope Skeet: VR Target Shooting\nSpace Pirate Trainer Special Force VR: Infinity War Spiderman: Far from Home Spiderman: Homecoming \u2013 Virtual Reality Experience Talos Principle VR The Soulkeeper VR\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll continue to test more VR games and add them to future driver releases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Freestyle Splitscreen Filter To Showcase Your Creations\nIn over 700 games, you can press Alt+F3 to load NVIDIA Freestyle, a GeForce Experience feature that enables you to adjust the look and feel of your gameplay in real-time using post-process filters. And in any game with NVIDIA Ansel support, you can press Alt+F2 to frame and snap in-game photos with an incredible level of visual customization.\nWith our latest Game Ready Driver, we\u2019re releasing a new Splitscreen filter that allows you to showcase screenshots or videos of your creation with the modding community. You can split the screen, showcase a side-by-side comparison, or even blend filters using the gradient function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSplit the screen down the middle, or blend the two results together\nYou can also import hundreds of new customization filters from ReShade. Download our collection of curated ReShade filters, and extract into \u201cProgram Files\\NVIDIA Corporation\\Ansel\\Custom\u201d (typically on your C:\\ drive). If you install DCH drivers, instead of the standard Game Ready Driver, you may have to create this folder yourself. A larger selection of \u2018custom\u2019 filters can also be downloaded directly from ReShade\u2019s Github repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Sharpening Update Further Improves Your Experience\nWe recently introduced a standalone image sharpening filter built into the NVIDIA Control Panel, enabling you to improve image clarity in all DirectX 9-12, Vulkan and OpenGL games. Based on your feedback, now you can separately enable the GPU Scaling feature without image sharpening. Furthermore, custom resolutions are supported when you enable GPU Scaling.\nTo use image sharpening on your system, open the NVIDIA Control Panel and navigate to 3D Settings > Manage 3D Settings, select Image Sharpening, configure your options, hit OK, then click Apply on the bottom right of the Control Panel window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further info about Image Sharpening, and to see how it can improve your gaming, head here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport For Newly Validated G-SYNC Compatible Displays\nOur newest Game Ready Driver driver is adding support for an additional 8 G-SYNC Compatible displays, and we\u2019ve announced future support for a further 17, including new LG OLED 2020 BFGD TVs. These gaming monitors and TVs deliver a baseline Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) experience that makes your gaming smoother, clearer, and more enjoyable.\nWith the new and upcoming additions announced today, there are now 90 G-SYNC Compatible displays total, across all resolutions, sizes and refresh rates, giving gamers tons of choice when searching for the perfect display. For instance, today\u2019s new monitors range in size from 24.5 inches, all the way up to LG\u2019s 88 inch Z9 BFGD behemoth, which will deliver a jaw-dropping big-screen OLED VRR gaming experience in your living room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew G-SYNC Compatible Gaming Monitors, TVs and BFGDs\n\n\nGaming Monitors\n\n\nModel\nSize\nResolution\nGame Ready Driver Support\n\n\nAcer VG252QX\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nAcer XB253Q GX\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nAcer XV253QX\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nASUS VG259QM\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nComing soon\n\n\nASUS VG279QM\n27\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nASUS PG43UQ\n43\u201d\n3840x2160\nComing soon\n\n\nDell AW2521HF\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nComing soon\n\n\nDell AW2521HFL\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nComing soon\n\n\nLG 38WN95C\n37.5\u201d\n3840x1600\nAvailable now\n\n\nLG 28GN950\n37.5\u201d\n3840x1600\nAvailable now\n\n\nLG 34GN850\n34\u201d\n3440x1440\nComing soon\n\n\nView Sonic XG270\n27\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nBig Format Gaming Displays (BFGDs)\n\n\nLG 2020 BX\n55\u201d 65\u201d and 77\u201d\n3840x2160 \nLater this year\n\n\nLG 2020 CX\n48\u201d 55\u201d 65\u201d and 77\u201d\n3840x2160\nLater this year\n\n\nLG 2020 GX\n55\u201d 65\u201d and 77\u201d\n3840x2160\nLater this year\n\n\nLG 2020 ZX\n77\u201d and 88\u201d\n7680x4320 \nLater this year\n\n\nLG 2019 Z9\n88\u201d\n7680x4320\nAvailable now (TV firmware update required)\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor a complete list of all 164 G-SYNC, G-SYNC ULTIMATE, and G-SYNC Compatible gaming displays, check out our handy and frequently updated G-SYNC page, and head on over to our CES 2020 G-SYNC article to learn much more about new LG G-SYNC Compatible BFGD TVs, the new G-SYNC Compatible gaming monitors, and other G-SYNC advancements and enhancements coming down the pipe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Wolfenstein: Youngblood\u2019s Ray Tracing Update\nWolfenstein: Youngblood is receiving a large update later this week, that adds realistic ray tracing, performance-boosting NVIDIA DLSS, and NVIDIA Highlights, for automatically recording your best gameplay moments.\nFor a complete rundown of all the additions, and how they make your gaming experience better, check out our Wolfenstein: Youngblood article and the new video below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for full support for each feature, along with optimum performance, download and install our new Game Ready Driver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Quake II RTX v1.3 Update\nQuake II RTX is our ray-traced remaster of the beloved 1997 first-person shooter.

The new system will feature higher performance for a better VR experience, as well as an updated backpack.\nZOTAC's VR Go 3.0 will inherit the chassis and (presumably) batteries from the VR Go 2.0 that has been on the market for over a year. The key improvement of the new model over the VR Go 2.0 will be updating the GPU to NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 2070. The CPU side is also getting an upgrade with Intel's latest Core i7 processor, though the manufacturer does not disclose which one (Comet Lake-H perhaps?).\n\nThe new VR Go 3.0 will come with a new backpack that utilizes a sweatproof material for easier maintenance. And, just like its predecessors, the upcoming VR Go wil be able to work both as a desktop and as a wearable PC. Though surprisingly enough, even with the switch to a current-generation GeForce RTX GPU, Zotac isn't integrated a USB-C-based VR Link port (or USB-C port of any kind, for that matter), so any kind of display will still need to be hooked up via HDMI or DisplayPort.\n\nVR gaming is an interesting market in general. There are only three makers of popular VR headsets and there are equally few PC makers that that offer wearable PCs for VR gaming. Which has meant that the market for VR PCs has operated on a relatively slow cadence, especially as it's generally years between PC VR headset releases.\n\nRelated Reading:\n\nZOTAC Unveils VR GO 2.0 Wearable PC: Core i7-8700T Meets GeForce GTX 1070\nZOTAC Preps Second-Gen Wearable Backpack \"VR GO\" PC\nZOTAC VR GO Backpack PC Gets Priced: Core i7-6700T, GeForce GTX 1070, $1999\nZOTAC Announces VR GO Backpack PC with GeForce GTX 1070\nHP Expands Commercial VR Strategy: Z VR Backpack and Immersion Centers\nMSI Releases the 'VR One': A Backpack PC For VR From $1999\n\nSource: ZOTAC\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n11 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\ningwe - Friday, January 17, 2020 - link\nI am really curious how many of these are sold. I guess enough to justify the cost (or at least they expect it to at some point justify it). Just doesn't look very comfortable/fun to me. I realize I am not the target audience though. \n\n\n\nalphasquadron - Friday, January 17, 2020 - link\nYeah I'm really interested in who buys this. I can't imaging wearing a computer on my back to play VR. But then again I can't imagine putting Christmas lights in and around my computer and those seem to sell like hotcakes so who knows.\n\n\n\ncoburn_c - Friday, January 17, 2020 - link\nNot having a tether would be more comfortable, but it's also the only thing that keeps me from wandering into a wall. \n\n\n\nSmell This - Friday, January 17, 2020 - link\n**I am really curious how many of these are sold. **_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _Really.This smells like Chipzillah trying to create a subsidized market with Zotac.\n\n\n\nJKflipflop98 - Friday, January 17, 2020 - link\nYou realize that makes about as much sense as a screendoor on a submarine, right? People that are into conspiracy theories are hilarious.\n\n\n\nSmell This - Tuesday, January 21, 2020 - link\nSince AMD's \"Cat Cores\" et. al., over nearly 10 years, how many UCFF ('NUC') and mini-STX small form-factor OEM platforms has Zotac produced?  Hundreds (if not thousands) ?I can think of 2 that were AMD based:  the E-350 'Bobcat' and the A6-1450 ''Temash.\"  (I suspect they might be one or two that I missed.)  Amazingly, the 8-watt Z-Box 320 Nano 4-core Temash slobber-knocked the Intel Bay Trail Fails 7 or more years ago (and they were never heard from again).So.  How many tens of billions of dollars did Intel spend 'subsidizing' the UCFF's and Atoms?  Of all the Cat Cores and APUs, none has made their way to Zotac over the last 7 years?  Really?Good luck with that, Zotac.  And, good luck with your latest 'creation'  -- I hope you've got a really long cord ...\n\n\n\nSmell This - Tuesday, January 21, 2020 - link\nhttp://old.zotac.com/us/products/mini-pcs/zbox/amd...Once, again ... Really?\n\n\n\nCrazyeyeskillah - Monday, January 20, 2020 - link\nThis is really going to be sold to a commercial business market.  Think more of an 'experience' type application than in home use.  Anytime the price is absurd, it's not being aimed at the consumer.\n\n\n\nJames5mith - Monday, January 20, 2020 - link\n\"I am really curious how many of these are sold.\"Enough to make an \"VR experience\" a viable thing?  My wife and I tried it at Disney Springs in Florida.  It's pretty neat what they are doing with the freedom that the backpacks provide.https://www.thevoid.com/\n\n\n\nstephenbrooks - Friday, January 17, 2020 - link\nThis would come into its own if the VR headset supported \"endless\" tracking that you could use in a large open area, but I don't think any of the headsets do that yet.  Otherwise, the tethering on things like the Vive is only a minor annoyance (probably equivalent to a backpack) and if your room doesn't limit the VR space, the range of the trackers does.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Wong      This article is part of \n  TechXchange: \n  RISC V and \nTechXchange: \n  Ada and SPARKA whitepaper on the use of SPARK by NVIDIA is available from Adacore.Nvidia tends to hype the machine-learning (ML) capabilities of its system-on-chip (SoC) solutions like its DRIVE AGX Orin that targets automotive applications. Often lost in the mix is the security processor that is part of the package but these are critical to safe and secure applications. Nvidia's security support has used a custom processor, but it's moving to RISC-V for future implementations. The company isn't alone in its adoption of RISC-V. Western Digital is   taking advantage of SiFive\u2019s RISC-V designs across the board for its storage solutions. NVIDIA isn't changing the SoC\u2019s core processors at this point. These are still Arm Cortex cores, but the security processor is essentially isolated from the rest of the system and it runs its own firmware. That firmware will not be written in C though. It is being done in SPARK, a provable subset of the Ada programming language. Ada 2012 added contracts to that language and SPARK takes advantage of this feature. It allows programmers to specify details like the characteristics of procedure inputs and outputs. The compiler can then enforce these rules for calls to the procedure as well as how the results will be used. The contract support enables the compiler to prove that a procedure does what it is desired, and the code that calls and uses the results will operate as specified by the contracts and implicit contracts within the language definition. An example of the implicit language checking is the range checking done by Ada for arrays and strings. One of the biggest problems with C and C++ code has been buffer overruns, which can't happen with Ada. The advantage of including the contract information and allowing the compiler to do the checking is that it can also remove many of the runtime checks often associated with Ada, because they are unnecessary. For example, the implicit array access range checks can be removed from the runtime if it's known that an index to the array can never exceed the size of the array. Ada\u2019s use in avionics is well-known, but it's also ideal for any embedded application. It can be extremely useful in safety applications like medical and automotive. Though the amount of code in a self-driving car will typically exceed that in even an advanced fighter jet, it will need the same level of scrutiny to provide safe and reliable operation. It makes a lot of sense to have the compiler checking that the code is doing what's desired rather than having humans do that same chore by examining the code. \u201cSelf-driving cars are extremely complex and require sophisticated software that needs the most rigorous standards out there,\u201d said Daniel Rohrer, vice president of Software Security at Nvidia. \u201cTaking measures like incorporating Ada and SPARK languages into Nvidia platforms can improve the robustness and assurances of our automotive security.\u201dC and C++ remain the primary languages for embedded programming. However, there are advantages to using Ada and SPARK, including cost savings when looking at the total cost of ownership (TOC). Open-source versions of Ada and SPARK tools are available as well as online training. \n>> Website Resources\n.. >> Library: TechXchange \n.. .. >> TechXchange: Embedded Software \n.. .. .. >> Topic: Ada and SPARK \n About the Author William G.

With more results in-hand, we\u2019re now going to explore performance from five other renderers that also require NVIDIA: Arnold, Redshift, Octane, V-Ray, and Adobe Dimension. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe recently published a performance look at both Capturing Reality\u2019s RealityCapture photogrammetry tool, as well as the major update to Luxion\u2019s popular design and rendering tool, KeyShot. Both share the distinction of requiring NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA to run, a trait that still seems common after all these years. That\u2019s unfortunate for AMD and Intel GPU users, so we hope things change in time.\nThere has been a lot of benchmarking going on here the past couple of weeks in preparation for content, which included the aforementioned pieces. We\u2019ve almost finished retesting all of our NVIDIA GPUs with our latest workstation suite, but have to wait until after CES to jump on AMD\u2019s and get some fresh numbers posted in what will likely become a Quadro RTX 6000 review (since we\u2019re due).\nTo get some more juicy render numbers up before CES, we wanted to take advantage of the completed NVIDIA data we have, and focus on the other tests in our suite that work only on NVIDIA. In our minds, there isn\u2019t enough performance data from any one of these applications to warrant a standalone article, so we\u2019re combining them all into one here. We plan to expand our testing on each of these renderers in time.\n\nAt the moment, none of the workloads featured here, to our knowledge, has support for non-NVIDIA GPUs planned \u2013 except OTOY, which will use Vulkan sometime in the future to enable support for AMD and Intel GPUs on Windows. We wrote the other day that the company will soon be releasing the first preview of Octane X for macOS, which will deliver on the same goals of AMD/Intel GPU support. CUDA will remain locked to those running an older version of macOS, since Apple killed support in later versions.\nSome of these tests include support for NVIDIA\u2019s OptiX ray tracing and denoising acceleration through its RTX series\u2019 RT and Tensor cores. The lone exception is Redshift, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s the current stable version of 2.6. 3.0 with full OptiX support is coming, and we\u2019ll definitely be digging into testing that soon enough.\nFor this article, we\u2019re taking a look at straight-forward rendering performance. All are real-world workloads except for OctaneBench, which has scaled well enough over time to give us enough confidence to trust it. But, we\u2019d love to test a real Octane RTX implementation sometime.\nHere\u2019s a look at the PC used during testing:\n\n\n\n\nTechgage Workstation Test System\n\n\nProcessor\nIntel Core i9-10980XE (18-core; 3.0GHz)\n\n\nMotherboard\nASUS ROG STRIX X299-E GAMING\n\n\nMemory\nG.SKILL Flare X (F4-3200C14-8GFX)\n4x8GB; DDR4-3200 14-14-14\n\n\nGraphics\nNVIDIA TITAN RTX (24GB, GeForce 441.66)\nNVIDIA TITAN Xp (12GB, GeForce 441.66)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti (11GB, GeForce 441.66)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER (8GB, GeForce 441.66)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER (8GB, GeForce 441.66)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER (8GB, GeForce 441.66)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (6GB, GeForce 441.66)\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (11GB, GeForce 441.66)\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti (6GB, GeForce 441.66)\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 (24GB, Quadro 441.66)\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000 (8GB, Quadro 441.66)\nNVIDIA Quadro P2000 (5GB, Quadro 441.66)\n\n\nAudio\nOnboard\n\n\nStorage\nKingston KC1000 960GB M.2 SSD\n\n\nPower Supply\nCorsair 80 Plus Gold AX1200\n\n\nChassis\nCorsair Carbide 600C Inverted Full-Tower\n\n\nCooling\nNZXT Kraken X62 AIO Liquid Cooler\n\n\nEt cetera\nWindows 10 Pro build 18363 (1909)\n\n\n\nThroughout most of our benchmarking, three runs is standard fare for our tests, but many renderers are exceptions, due to their ridiculously stable performance. Four of the five tests in this article fit that bill \u2013 you could run them over and over and rarely see more than a 1% or 2% maximum performance delta from the previous run. Adobe Dimension is that one oddball among this lineup, but we\u2019ll save talking about that for when we get to its performance later in the page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutodesk Arnold in Maya 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nRedshift in 3ds Max 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nOctaneBench RTX\n\n\n\n\n\nChaos Group V-Ray Next in 3ds Max 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nAdobe Dimension\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArnold\n\n\nThe fact that three GPUs couldn\u2019t finish either of their renders here is a good place to start. It\u2019s obvious that a healthy framebuffer matters a lot with GPU rendering, and that\u2019s the reason we\u2019ve been suggesting going no lower than 8GB for design work. That\u2019s one thing to note; another is the fact that NVIDIA\u2019s RTX series speeds things up a lot. Provided you have the memory.\nDespite having RT cores, the RTX 2060 struggled in our Arnold renders here, again to what we suspect would be a VRAM issue, given the other low-VRAM chips suffered just the same. But when framebuffer doesn\u2019t matter, such as in the match-up between the TITAN Xp and TITAN RTX, we can see massive gains from one generation to the next. In the battle of GTX 1080 Ti vs RTX 2080 Ti, the latter cuts the end render time in half.\nWith Arnold, you want RTX, and also 8GB. At the top-end, your best value would be with the RTX 2080 Ti, while those with seriously complex projects would want to consider the much larger framebuffer of the TITAN RTX or Quadro RTX 6000. The 2060S looks to provide a great all-around value.\nRedshift\n\n\nRedshift has version 3.0 coming, and we\u2019re planning to take a look at it as soon as we can. For now, we\u2019re going to stick to the battle-tested Redshift 2.6, in particular, its recent .50 release. Overall, all of the GPUs scale quite nicely here, with even the last-gen NVIDIA Pascal GPUs delivering great performance in comparison to the newer Turing RTXs.\nWe mentioned memory being a big potential limitation earlier, and further proof of that drops here by way of the Quadro P2000. Remember when 5GB would have felt like a really healthy amount of VRAM? Today, 8GB should be considered the minimum, which fortunately opens up three main options in the GeForce line, and an affordable Quadro RTX 4000 option on the workstation side.\nOTOY Octane\n\n\nOTOY has a sickness, and that\u2019s that it never wants to stop improving on Octane\u2019s feature set, or its performance. The original OctaneBench uses the regular CUDA processors to render their image, while the RTX version released last year engages the hardware\u2019s RT cores. As you can see, enabling RTX capabilities doesn\u2019t just enhance performance, it brings it to a new level.\nSince we haven\u2019t tested Octane yet in an actual design suite with an actual project, we can\u2019t yet state how much this performance actually correlates with real-world gains, but the previous scaling has seemed to be bang-on, so we truly hope to see the RTX gains here carry over into the real-world. Octane 2020 is going to be released in a few months, and we\u2019re not entirely sure if this RTX benchmark represents the latest code, but we\u2019d imagine it comes close. Since we\u2019re addicted to benchmarking, we\u2019ll update our numbers as soon as an updated build releases.\nChaos Group V-Ray\n\n\n\nV-Ray is one of the oldest, and definitely one of the best-respected renderers out there. While it\u2019s spent most of its life focusing on the CPU for rendering, recent years have opened up access to NVIDIA GPUs. Chaos Group became one of the earliest supporters of NVIDIA\u2019s OptiX technologies. We remember V-Ray being one of the first places we saw AI denoise hit consumers.\nOn the CPU side, the renderer seems to favor Intel CPUs a bit more than AMD, as we\u2019ve seen in the past \u2013 although that\u2019s just from a core count standpoint, not an overall chip value standpoint. For GPU, the scaling seems almost ideal. You get what you pay for when moving up to a bigger model, although based on the RTX benchmark, going with one of those supported GPUs seems like a no-brainer at this point.\nAdobe Dimension\n\n\nAdobe Dimension is a bit of an oddball in this lineup, but not because it\u2019s not a good GPU benchmark. When Dimension 3.0 released, it clearly changed a lot of the mechanics in the back-end, because we haven\u2019t yet found a way to keep using it as a CPU-only benchmark and deliver truly scalable results. We need to look into it more when we have time, but for now, it looks like Dimension has shifted from our CPU suite right on over to our workstation GPU one.\nWith our two projects in-hand, some GPUs struggle quite a bit, just as we saw in Arnold. Given the two models we see sitting at the bottom, it seems safe to say that this is more proof that an 8GB GPU should be your minimum target. That said, the 6GB RTX 2060 actually did manage to get through its renders without error, so it could be that RTX\u2019s acceleration is paying off there. It\u2019s interesting to note that the 2060 SUPER beats out the last-gen top dogs, GTX 1080 and TITAN Xp.\nIt\u2019s unlikely the same situation here, but in our past testing with deep-learning, we found that GPUs equipped with Tensor cores are efficient enough to reduce the amount of memory needed at any given time; eg: certain high-end workloads would croak on 12GB TITAN Xp, but not the Volta-based 12GB TITAN V. Nonetheless, it does seem clear that GTX is just not a good path to take for Dimension, when the lower-end RTXs beat out last-gen\u2019s top GTX offerings.\nFinal Thoughts\nAs mentioned before, we decided to post this article because we had almost all of our NVIDIA GPU testing done, and it made sense to tackle the CUDA-only tests here. After CES, whatever leftover tests need to be run on NVIDIA will be done, and then AMD\u2019s cards will go through the gauntlet, and we\u2019ll post some fresh overall proviz numbers.\nWhenever we post content like this, someone inevitably asks why we didn\u2019t include AMD, or better: why we even bothered posting it if AMD isn\u2019t supported. We\u2019re obviously in the business of trying to provide relevant benchmarks to our readers, and while it\u2019s unfortunate that so many solutions are locked to NVIDIA, there is always hope that some will begin to open up their code and invite competitors on in. OTOY is working on its solution to this with Octane, but we don\u2019t know about the others.\nThat all said, in these particular workloads, AMD would struggle even if it\u00a0were supported. With RT and Tensor cores on tap, NVIDIA\u2019s RTX series is seriously powerful for design work when implemented properly. In solutions like Blender, you must enable OptiX acceleration separately, whereas in Arnold, for example, RT cores are used by default. That\u2019s what we\u2019d call a perfect implementation. We have a feeling once AMD releases GPUs with a similar feature set, some developers might feel more compelled to branch their support.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport our efforts!

Videocardz reports that there are 2 MX300 series chips in the work, the MX350 & the MX330, and both are based on the Pascal GPU architecture.\nNVIDIA MX300 Low-Power Mobility GPUs: MX350 With 640 Cores, MX330 With 384 Cores - Pascal GPU Fights Against 7nm Vega and Gen 11 Iris Plus\nThe MX series are low-power discrete graphics chips that are designed for entry-level notebooks. These GPUs offer more graphics power than integrated solutions and take a lot of pressure off of the main chip itself. Both Intel and AMD have been hard at work into fine-tuning the performance of their integrated graphics chips and the resultant Gen 11 / 7nm Vega GPUs have proved that the era of the low-end discrete GPUs in notebooks is at an end as integrated graphics now offer equal or superior performance.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nWith NVIDIA knowing this threat, they have decided to release a new set of MX300 series chips that are still based on the Pascal GPU architecture but offer an even higher tier SKU with more cores. It looks like the two chips will be using different Pascal GPUs, the MX350 would make use of GP107 and the MX330 would make use of GP108.\n\nNVIDIA_DEV.1C94 = \u201cNVIDIA GeForce MX350\u201d\nNVIDIA_DEV.1D16 = \u201cNVIDIA GeForce MX330\u201d\n\nBased on the Device ID for the MX350, it looks like the chip would be making use of a similar GPU configuration as the GeForce GTX 1050 mobile which would suggest 640 CUDA cores. These would be twice the number of cores featured on the previous MX250 (Pascal GP108) GPU. The chip is still based on the Samsung 14nm FinFET process node and would feature a TDP of around 25-30W. The clock speeds would receive a slight boost over the MX250 and considering that the GeForce MX250 is slightly faster than existing integrated GPUs, MX350 would have no problem outperforming the same chips.\nThe ASUS Vivobook S13 would make use of an unreleased NVIDIA GeForce GPU, hinting at the MX300 series since its predecessor featured the MX200 series chips. (Image Credits: NotebookCheck)\nThe MX330, on the other hand, would retain 384 CUDA cores but is expected to feature higher and optimized clock speeds. The discrete notebook chip would feature a TDP of around 10W which will be the same as the MX250 and MX150 but feature slightly higher clocks. The first notebooks based on these new GPUs were spotted by NotebookCheck at CES 2020 in an ASUS VivoBook featuring an Intel Core i7-1065G7 Ice Lake CPU which once again shows proves that NVIDIA's low-power discrete GPUs will still find a home in laptops that feature capable graphics chips, proving the worth of a discrete GPU solution. The first laptops based on the NVIDIA GeForce MX300 series are expected to launch in late February.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n186\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n67\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n51\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nResident Evil 9 Is Taking so Long to Release Because It Is a Reinvention of the Series \u2013 Rumor\n\n\n\n46\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1463\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Upgrade Now          AMD's 'NVIDIA Killer' High-End GPU Rumored for 2020 Launch      Zacks Equity Research   January 22, 2020            In This Article:  AMD       NVDA       GRMN       KEYS         Advanced Micro Devices AMD has been reportedly developing advanced high-performance graphics card, in a bid to challenge NVIDIA\u2019s NVDA dominance in the high-end GPU market. The GPU is reportedly dubbed to be, \"NVIDIA Killer.\"Rumors have been doing the rounds ever since the company\u2019s CEO, Dr. Lisa Su, mentioned about unveiling \u201cBig Navi\u201d soon.In fact, tech enthusiasts are of the opinion that the latest filing with Eurasian Economic Commission for Radeon RX 5950XT and other cards, on Jan 14, validates the buzz around the launch of the new chip.Per Tech Radar report, the new graphics card is touted to be 30% faster than NVIDIA's RTX 2080 Ti.Per Twitter user, KittyCorgi, cited on various sources, AMD Radeon Navi 21, features 80 Compute Units, hardware Ray Tracing and offers 2X faster performance over the company\u2019s Navi 10 or RX 5700 XT.We believe that the robust features of the new GPU, rumored for launch in 2020, positions AMD well to capitalize on the high-end graphics card market.    Coming to price performance, shares of AMD have returned 158.3% in the past year, significantly outperforming the industry\u2019s rally of 50.6%.GPU Initiatives Favor Growth ProspectsAMD\u2019s expanding GPU portfolio catering to every price points is a threat to NVIDIA\u2019s dominance.Notably, per third-quarter 2019 JPR data, AMD\u2019s market share in discrete GPU shipments came in at 27.08%, up from 25.72% in third-quarter 2018. Consequently, NVIDIA\u2019s market share declined to 72.92% from 74.28% in the same period.Markedly, AMD\u2019s GPUs based on Navi gaming architecture, are compliant with PCIe 4.0 and offer high-speed GDDR6 memory. The company claims that RDNA offers higher performance on a per-clock and per-watt basis over AMD\u2019s prior Graphic Core Next (GCN) architecture.Moreover, the company\u2019s GPUs integrated with Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS), enable high-resolution display and provide immersive 1440p gaming experience. Meanwhile, FidelityFX capability allows developers to improve gaming with robust post-process effects. Further, Radeon Anti-Lag functionality reduces input lag time by approximately 31%.According to Mordor Intelligence data, the GPU market is set to hit $104.71 billion by 2025, from $20.62 billion valuation in 2019, at a CAGR of 31.1% from 2020 to 2025. The upside is likely to be driven by constant changes in graphic games and advancement in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) platform as well as AI. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus \u00a0   Story Continues   Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteMoreover, growth in the gaming hardware market is driving demand for GPUs as well, which is a tailwind for AMD. We expect that the efforts undertaken by AMD in the GPU arena to boost business prospects.Intense Competition from NVIDIA: A Major HeadwindAlthough AMD\u2019s strengthening 7nm-based portfolio holds promise, intense competition from NVIDIA, which has a competitive edge in the GPU market on the back of its robust drivers, remains a major concern.Moreover, NVIDIA is enabling ray tracing backup to several GeForce GTX GPUs, including recently launched Turing-based gaming cards, which is a key challenger for AMD. NVIDIA\u2019s latest GPUs make real-time ray tracing more accessible and deliver faster performance.NVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus\u00a0  NVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus  NVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteNVIDIA\u2019s Turing GPU and its real-time ray tracing technology are witnessing a massive adoption. Markedly, the company is also benefiting from the adoption of real-time ray tracing in the professional visualization markets.Zacks RankBoth, AMD and NVIDIA currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Keysight Technologies KEYS and Garmin GRMN, both flaunting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Originally known as NVIDIA GRID, it allowed streaming access to a curated library of games via a monthly subscription business model. Users could play those games from their PCs, Macs, or NVIDIA Shield devices.\nAt CES 2017, NVIDIA unveiled another version of GeForce NOW. This one would essentially rent you NVIDIA's powerful servers, allowing users to access their existing PC libraries (such as Steam).\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostThe beta for this GeForce NOW dropped in December 2017 for Mac and January 2018 for PC; our Keith looked into it at the time. In the last two years, plenty of gamers had the chance to 'freeload' off NVIDIA's powerful remote servers to play PC games on any compatible device, including Android ones with the recently added support.\nOf course, that had to come to an end sooner or later. NVIDIA hinted that was happening and now we've got the first unofficial details of what the cloud-based games streaming service will be like after the beta's end.\nEarlier today, VideoCardz.com tweeted that the GeForce NOW Founders tier would be priced $4.99 per month. Then they added quite a bit of extra details in a follow-up tweet: this tier would be a limited time offer that customers can pick if they agree to subscribe for twelve months. The Founders tier also reportedly includes raytracing support, a free introductory period of three months, 'priority access' to the servers, and 'extended session length'. The last two perks make more sense in relation to the GeForce NOW free tier, which is apparently limited to one-hour sessions and only has 'standard access', meaning you would likely have to wait in queue for some time before playing.\nWe also have something of our own to add to this report. According to a source knowledgeable with the project, the decision to go with such a low price was mostly due to the competitive environment of the cloud gaming market. Here's the brief quote we can provide:\nThe GeForce NOW team was exploring a $10/mo price point, but is fearing competitive pressure from Microsoft, Amazon, and Google.\nIndeed, the competition in this market is about to get fierce. While Google Stadia didn't exactly have a booming start, Microsoft is readying its Project xCloud and Amazon is yet to unveil its own offering after earlier rumors.\nOf course, it is too early to tell whether the GeForce NOW Founders tier will be worth it. There's a lot we don't know yet - will it support 4K HDR streaming? What kind of hardware will be used, exactly, and how often will it be updated?\nWe'll keep you posted as soon as NVIDIA drops the official information. Until then, stay tuned.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n83\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n29\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\n\n\n27\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s H20 AI Accelerators Are Reportedly Facing A Shortage In China, Amid The Massive Demand Prompted Due To DeepSeek\n\n\n\n18\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n18\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\n12V-2\u00d76 Power Connector Cooks At Over 150\u00b0C With A \u201cWater-Cooled\u201d NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090\n\n\n\n1360\nComments\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Releases Another Hotfix Driver to Resolve Black Screen Issues, Marking the Firm\u2019s Fifth Attempt to Address The Problem\n\n\n\n1300\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Specifically aiming at the Esports segment, NVIDIA has revealed a brand new display technology surrounding G-SYNC which delivers new features and offers higher refresh rates than any existing monitor to help you win the game!\nNVIDIA G-SYNC Lineup Expanded To eSports For 2020 With New 360 Hz G-SYNC Esports Displays\nWhile there are many G-SYNC related announcements coming at CES 2020, the first one NVIDIA is taking wraps off is their G-SYNC Esports lineup. Aimed at competitive gamers, the NVIDIA G-SYNC displays will offer the fastest refresh rates on any screen designed to date. The first product in this lineup is ASUS's ROG Swift 360 Hz and is made in full accordance with the new Esports based specifications.\nRelated Story NVIDIA G-SYNC Pulsar Further Optimizes VRR Gaming Monitors With Stutter-Free Gameplay & Buttery Smooth MotionIn the world of competitive gaming, where mere milliseconds can make the difference between victory and defeat, NVIDIA today unveiled new G-SYNC displays with a 360Hz refresh rate, providing esports enthusiasts and competitive gamers with the fastest gaming displays ever made. At 360Hz, game frames are displayed once every 2.8ms\u2014up to 6X faster than traditional gaming displays and TVs.\nNVIDIA G-SYNC Esports 360 Hz Refresh Rate Monitors For Fast-Paced Gamers\nThe new G-SYNC Esports displays are aimed specifically at fast-paced, competitive gaming. Last month, we got to see the first 280 Hz refresh rate monitor in the form of the ASUS TUF Gaming VG279QM IPS, which sported G-SYNC along with a resolution of 1080p (HD). The monitor had a range of other features such as ASUS's Extreme Low Motion Blur (ELMB), VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) and also supported VESA's Adaptive-Sync technology.\n\nWell, NVIDIA is planning to offer an even higher refresh rate to competitive gamers with the G-SYNC Esports displays. The monitors will be carrying a breakthrough 360 Hz refresh rate in the same 1080p (HD) package. The first monitor that is being listed to carry the new G-SYNC Esports specifications is the ASUS ROG Swift 360 Hz which features a bezel-less design on a 24.5\" panel, comes with an advanced G-SYNC processor with minimal ghosting with custom-tuned dynamic overdrive and is based on an AU Optronics LCD panel. The main features of NVIDIA's G-SYNC Esports display include:\n\nBlistering Fast Refresh Rate: 360Hz delivers crystal clear visuals, extremely low system latency for faster reaction times, and the smoothest motion to keep pros on target.\nDesigned for Esports: Play how the pros do and never miss a critical moment with the highest performance 24.5 inches Full HD display.\nSuperior Clarity:\u00a0No distracting tearing, stuttering, flicker, or artifacts with NVIDIA G-SYNC VRR technology.\nQuality Certified by NVIDIA: All G-SYNC certified displays undergo a rigorous validation process and are subjected to 300 image quality tests to ensure they deliver consistent quality and maximum performance.\n\n\nAccording to NVIDIA's own research, there are certain advantages associated with higher-refresh rate monitors such as the G-SYNC Esports panels. Some of the advantages listed are:\n\nEasier Target Tracking (Smoother Animations)\nReduced Distracting Effects (Less Ghosting & Tearing)\nSee Players Earlier (Lower System Latency - Higher refresh rate monitors reduce\noverall system latency)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nIt is also stated that the general flick short improvement between a 60 Hz monitor to a 120Hz panel is a staggering 28% with 240 Hz offering a further 5% improvement and 360Hz offering another 5% uptick.\nASUS ROG SWIFT 360Hz With NVIDIA G-SYNC Esports:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThis certainly opens a wave of new higher refresh rate monitors to be embedded in gaming cafes which specialize towards Esports gamers, a widely popular gaming category across the globe and especially in Asian and South Asian regions where Esports titles are now highly-competitive with huge pools of winnings being announced in several tournaments. Expect to see more OEMs offer their own G-SYNC Esports displays in the coming months.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Launches G-SYNC ULMB 2: 2nd Gen Ultra Low Motion Blur Tech With 1000 Hz Motion Clarity\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI launches world\u2019s first 27-inch 300Hz Rapid IPS Mini LED display\n\nJason R.

It was later discovered that the dongle ran a 32-bit version of Android TV, which caused some to worry about incompatible apps, but you (probably) have nothing to worry about. \nBoth of 2019's Shield TV devices use the same Tegra X1+ processor, but they differ in RAM amounts. While the Pro has 3GB of RAM, the dongle only has 2GB. Even though the processor is capable of running 64-bit Android TV, Nvidia decided to go with 32-bit Android TV on the dongle.\nMany buyers have pointed this out since release, and some have even returned their Shields, believing the 32-bit limitation to be a deal-breaker. Nvidia's website lists the applications that won't work on the dongle, which include most of the older Shield-exclusive titles and the Wii/GameCube emulator Dolphin: \n\n                                        Borderlands 2\n                        \n\n                                        Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel\n                        \n\n                                        Contrast\n                        \n\n                                        Doom 3\n                        \n\n                                        Half-Life 2 + Episodes\n                        \n\n                                        Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance\n                        \n\n                                        Metal Gear Solid 2\n                        \n\n                                        Metal Gear Solid 3\n                        \n\n                                        Portal\n                        \n\n                                        Resident Evil 5\n                        \n\n                                        Super Mega Baseball\n                        \n\n                                        The Witness\n                        \n\n                                        Tomb Raider (2013)\n                        \n\n                                        Ultimate Chicken Horse\n                        \n\n                                        Dolphin emulator\n                        \n\nWhile Nvidia never clarified why most of the Shield-exclusive catalog is missing, my guess is that the company either can't release 32-bit versions (perhaps due to expired agreements/lack of developer interest), or doesn't believe the games would work well enough with only 2GB of RAM. Update: Nvidia told us the games simply require 3GB of RAM to run.\nAs for the Dolphin emulator, a post on the project's blog from 2018 explains that a 64-bit CPU is required because it was too difficult to maintain compatibility with all 32-bit architectures (including 32-bit x86 PCs): \nARMv7, as a 32-bit only architecture, was simply too limited for Dolphin to ever obtain fullspeed in 99% of Dolphin's catalog. Just like why we removed our 32-bit x86 JIT, ARMv7's 32-bit nature required all manner of crazy workarounds and prevented countless optimizations. It just couldn't be improved any further.\n\nSo, the question remains: why did Nvidia go with 32-bit Android TV on the Shield dongle? We reached out to the company with that very question, and the answer is perhaps unsurprising \u2014 Nvidia wanted a more economical price: \nFor an app to be Android TV-compliant, it must support 32-bit. As a result, SHIELD TV supports all Android TV apps. By moving SHIELD TV to 32-bit we were able to bring it to a lower price point without impacting the user experience for the vast majority of our users.\nSHIELD TV Pro continues to support 64-bit for enthusiast users who want to sideload the rare instances when an app is 64-bit-only. Both models support all Android TV apps, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos and our new AI Upscaling feature.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that 64-bit operating systems generally perform worse on systems with under 3-4GB of RAM than the 32-bit equivalents, even with identical CPUs. By going with 32-bit Android TV, Nvidia could stretch 2GB of RAM even further than it could with 64-bit Android TV, improving the overall experience.\nIt's worth noting that Nvidia is not the only manufacturer that has done this. Several Motorola phones in the past have used 32-bit Android to reduce memory usage, like the Moto G6. Amazon has done the same with some of its Fire tablets.\nSome of the panic around this issue has come from the 32-bit exodus that has been going on for the past few years. Apple recently dropped support for all 32-bit software across both Mac and iPhone, and many Linux-based operating systems are moving away from 32-bit. However, Google has shown no interest in doing the same with Android \u2014 developers aren't even required to create 64-bit binaries yet.\nIn summary, you probably don't have to stress about the 32-bit OS on the Shield TV dongle. While you will miss out on the older catalog of Shield games, and one emulator, just about every single other Android TV app and game will work just fine.\nThanks: Stephen Salter \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\nDolphin\n\n\n\n\nAndroid TV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support Android Police.

Don\u2019t forget that the RTX 2060 also brings ray tracing to the table, although in more demanding games, there are obviously caveats here for Nvidia\u2019s lowest-powered RTX offering.These are the best graphics cards you can buy\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

(Photo via Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images).Getty\nNvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) total revenue has grown from $6.91 billion in 2017 to $11.72 billion in 2019, primarily driven by a growth of $4.09 billion in GPU revenue. However, we expect revenue to drop to $10.88 billion in 2020, amidst dropping PC and notebook sales and a slowdown in the Chinese economy.\n\n\nRegardless, total revenue should rise to around $12.21 billion by 2021, driven by the company\u2019s new Turing products, and a revival in data center demand.\n\nTakeaway\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s GPU segment, which sells graphic processors used in PCs and data centers, is expected to contribute $9.46 billion to total revenue in 2020, making up 87% of Nvidia\u2019s total revenue estimate.\nThe Tegra Processors division is expected to bring in $1.42 billion in 2020, to make up 13% of the total revenue estimate.\nThe GPU division has been the sole driver of revenue growth, and is expected to add $4.51 billion between 2017 and 2021, which is 85% of the additional $5.3 billion that the company is expected to bring in over this period.\nNvidia\u2019s total revenue has grown more than 70% between 2017 and 2019, but we expect a 7% YoY drop in revenue for 2020.\nIn our interactive dashboard Nvidia Revenue: How Does Nvidia Make Money?, we discuss Nvidia\u2019s business model, followed by sections that review past performance and 2021 expectations for Nvidia\u2019s revenue, including comparisons with close competitors, Intel and AMD.\n\n\n\nA look at Nvidia\u2019s segments and their contribution to total revenue\n GPU revenue to grow by $420 million over the next 2 years, to make up 87% of total revenue in 2021\n\n\nGPU revenue has grown from $6.09 billion in 2017 to $10.18 billion in 2019, and has been the primary driver of Nvidia\u2019s revenue growth.\nHowever, we expect GPU revenue to drop to $9.46 billion in 2020, under pressure from low PC and notebook sales, and a slowdown in data center demand.\nHowever, things should get better by 2021, and we expect revenue in 2021 to come in at $10.6 billion.\n\n\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\n Revenue from the Tegra Processors segment to grow by $80 million over the next 2 years, to make up 13% of the total revenue estimate\n\n\nRevenue from this segment has grown from $0.82 billion in 2017 to $1.54 billion in 2019.\nHowever, revenue from Tegra Processors could come under pressure in 2020, due to a slowdown in the Chinese economy (around 25% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue comes from China).\nHowever, by 2021 this metric could grow to $1.62 billion on the back of growing demand for gaming consoles.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s behind Trefis?

There are plenty of reasons.  One is so that you can enjoy non-tearing gaming but still keep VSYNC OFF for the best latencies.  Another is to adjust your performance to monitor for GSYNC and non-GSYNC displays. \n \n \n \n\n\n\nMore Tech News From Around The Web\n\n\n \n \n\n\nNVIDIA GPU Performance In Arnold, Redshift, Octane, V-Ray & Dimension @ Techgage\nThe VRSS Review \u2013 Does Variable Rate Supersampling Deliver Better IQ & Performance for VR Gamers? @ BabelTechReviews\nGIGABYTE AORUS GeForce RTX 2070 Super Graphics Card Review @ NikKTech\nCES Game Ready Driver 441.77 New Features & 26-game Performance Analysis @ BabelTechReviews\nRyzen 5 3600 vs. R5 2600: GPU Scaling Benchmark Test @ TechSpot\n\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousPatch Your FireFox To 72.0.1 If You Haven\u2019t Already \n\nNextCORSAIR\u2019s K95 RGB Platinum XT Elgato Streamdeck Keyboard \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nJeremy Hellstrom\nCall it K7M.com, AMDMB.com, or PC Perspective, Jeremy has been hanging out and then working with the gang here for years.

But the volume is spiraling with projects like the recent Dark Energy Survey and upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time, which will capture billions more.\nVolunteers flocked to a recent crowdsource project, Galaxy Zoo, to help classify over a million galaxy images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. But citizen science can carry astrophysics only so far.\n\u201cGalaxy Zoo was a very successful endeavor, but the rate at which next-generation surveys will gather data will make crowdsourcing methods no longer scalable,\u201d said Asad Khan, a physics doctoral student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \u201cThis is where human-in-the-loop techniques present an approach to guide AI to data-driven discovery, including image classification.\u201d\nUsing transfer learning from the popular image classification model Xception, Khan and his fellow researchers developed a neural network that categorizes galaxy images as elliptical or spiral with expert-level accuracy. Classifying galaxy shapes helps scientists determine how old they are. It can also help them understand more complex questions about dark energy and how fast the universe is expanding.\nAutomating elements of galaxy classification enables astrophysicists to spend less time on basic labeling and focus on more complex research questions.\nThe research \u2014 the first application of deep transfer learning for galaxy classification \u2014 was one of six projects featured at the Scientific Visualization and Data Analytics Showcase at SC19, the annual supercomputing trade show.\nAI Wrinkle in Time\nThe researchers trained the deep learning network on around 35,000 galaxy images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Using Argonne National Laboratory\u2019s Cooley supercomputer, which is equipped with dozens of NVIDIA data center GPUs, the team accelerated neural network training from five hours to just eight minutes.\nWhen tested on other images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the AI achieved 99.8 percent accuracy for classifying images as either elliptical or spiral galaxies \u2014 an improvement compared to neural networks trained without transfer learning.\nUsing a single NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPU for inference, the team was able to classify 10,000 galaxies in under 30 seconds.\n\u201cWe can already start using this network, or future versions of it, to start labeling the 300 million galaxies in the Dark Energy Survey,\u201d Khan said, \u201cWith GPU-accelerated inference, we could classify all the images in no time at all.\u201d\nKhan and his team also developed a visualization to show how the neural network learned during training.\n\u201cEven if deep learning models can achieve impressive accuracy levels, when AI does make a mistake, we often don\u2019t know why,\u201d he said. \u201cVisualizations like these can serve as a heuristic check on the network\u2019s performance, providing more interpretability for science communities.\u201d\nThe researchers next plan to study how the morphology of galaxies change with redshift, a phenomenon caused by the expansion of the universe.\nMain image from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, licensed from Wikimedia Commons under Creative Commons (CC BY 4.0).\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ResearchTags: Artificial Intelligence | Inference | Science \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

But while the Dell Precision 5540, HP ZBook Studio G5 and Lenovo ThinkPad P1 might be perfect for 3D CAD, they will likely fall short in more demanding workflows.\nWhen Dell launched the chunkier Precision 7540 in May 2019, it followed a familiar template for mainstream 15-inch mobile workstations: top-end mobile CPU (up to an 8-core Intel Xeon), lots of memory (up to 128GB), plenty of storage (up to three drives), but a more conservative selection of GPUs, maxing out with the Nvidia Quadro RTX 3000 (6GB).\nThe machine proved great for CPU-intensive workflows, such as ray trace rendering, simulation and point cloud processing. But the Quadro RTX 3000 was only really suited to entry-level real-time viz, GPU rendering and VR.\nAs Dell\u2019s more demanding customers were led to the 17-inch Precision 7740 and its high-end Quadro RTX 5000 (16GB) GPU, other manufacturers were looking to pick up business by offering the same GPU in a 15-inch mobile workstation, a form factor that\u2019s smaller and lighter and considerably more popular.\nLenovo was the first to break the mould. With its ThinkPad P53, it became the first major workstation OEM to offer such a high-end GPU in a 15-inch mobile workstation. Acer, Asus, BOXX, MSI and Razer also delivered 15-inch laptops with the Quadro RTX 5000.\nIn response to this competition, Dell completely re-engineered the cooling system in the Precision 7540, so that it can take the Quadro RTX 5000. What\u2019s more, Dell reckons it can run it at 80W, which it claims is 10W more than the Lenovo ThinkPad P53. Update 3/02/20 Lenovo has informed AEC Magazine that the Quadro RTX 5000 in its ThinkPad P53 also runs at 80W\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nThe chassis\nThe Quadro RTX 5000 might grab the headlines, but there\u2019s a lot more to this mobile workstation than simply a powerful GPU. The Precision 7540\u2019s chassis is incredibly well-built and feels extremely solid.\nAt 25mm (front) and 29.95mm (rear), it\u2019s not exactly thin and with a large bezel surrounding the 15.6-inch display, it\u2019s also wide and deep (337.6mm x 251.3mm). However, starting at 2.53kg, it still feels relatively portable, and is significantly smaller and lighter than the 17-inch Precision 7740, which starts at 3.08kg.\nA larger chassis does have its benefits. Unlike the slender Precision 5540, there\u2019s a full-sized keyboard, complete with number pad for punching in dimensions. There\u2019s a little bit of flex in the middle of the deck when typing, but it generally feels nice to use.\n\nThe Precision 7540 comes with a full sized keyboard and number pad\nThe trackpad is of a decent size with a good amount of resistance and three clickable buttons. There\u2019s also a trackpoint with its own set of buttons below the space bar. But for precise design work in general, we\u2019d always recommend an external mouse.\nThere\u2019s a choice of four displays: three are FHD (1,920 x 1,080) and one is 4K (3,840 x 2,160). We\u2019re used to seeing nice displays on Dell mobile workstations and the 4K IGZO panel that came with our review unit is no different. Linework in CAD is super-sharp and colours are notably vivid. The panel supports 100% of the Adobe RGB colour space, so you should pick up nice subtleties in your renders.\n4K on a 15.6-inch display means a very high-pixel density. To avoid tiny icons and text that\u2019s unreadable to ageing eyes, Windows ramps things up to 250%, but we found the best balance to be at 200%. If you\u2019re on a tight budget and don\u2019t need 4K, you can save yourself around \u00a3300 by choosing a more basic FHD panel.\nIn terms of connectivity, the machine is relatively well-equipped. There are 2 x USB 3.1 Type A ports w/PowerShare on the right, 2 x Thunderbolt 3 Type C ports on the left, and a mini DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.0 and Ethernet at the rear. Those with multiple USB Type A peripherals can always plug in a hub or use a USB Type C to A adapter, as we did when setting up an Oculus Rift VR headset with two sensors.\nKey repairs and upgrades are relatively simple. After loosening five Philips screws, the back panel pops off, giving access to the battery, storage and two of the four memory slots.\nCore specs\nThe machine comes with a big choice of CPUs, from the quad-core Intel Core i5-9400H (2.50GHz, 4.3GHz Turbo), right up to the eight-core Intel Xeon E2286M (2.40GHz, 5.00GHz Turbo), which was in our review unit.\nIf your workflows aren\u2019t particularly multi-threaded, you could save yourself between \u00a3120 and \u00a3180 by going down to six cores, but you will lose a little bit of single-threaded performance as well: the six-core Xeon E-2276M and Core i7-9850H, for example, peak at 4.7GHz and 4.6GHz respectively.\nFor GPUs, there\u2019s an equally big choice. This includes the entry-level AMD Radeon Pro WX 3200 (4GB), Nvidia Quadro T1000 (4GB) and T2000 (4GB), the mid-range Nvidia Quadro RTX 3000 (6GB) and RTX 4000 (8GB) and, of course, the high-end Nvidia Quadro RTX 5000 (16GB). If you simply work with 3D CAD and therefore don\u2019t need anything more than the Quadro T2000, you\u2019re probably better served by the smaller and lighter Dell Precision 5540. The machine can be fitted with up to 128GB of RAM, spread across four DIMMs. Our test unit came with 64GB (2 x 32GB) of DDR4 2666MHz Non-ECC memory, fitted behind the keyboard. This should be plenty for most users, but should your needs change, there are two slots free for upgrades.\nThere\u2019s lots of scope for storage with support for up to three drives: either three M.2 PCIe SSDs or two M.2 PCIe SSDs and one 2.5\u201d HDD. There is a caveat to this, however: you can\u2019t have a 2.5-inch drive with a Quadro RTX 3000, 4000 or 5000, as these power-hungry GPUs need the larger 6-cell 97Wh Lithium Ion battery, which blocks off the 2.5-inch bay. With the larger Precision 7740, you can have both.\nFor those who work with very large datasets this an important consideration, as the price per GB of SSDs is still significantly higher than it is for HDDs.\nOur test unit came with single 512GB \u2018Class 50\u2019 SSD, an SK Hynix PC601. We found very little information about this particular SSD, which may or not be used in other Precision 7540s (Dell uses a range of suppliers). However, in Dell speak \u2018Class 50\u2019 means better performance than \u2018Class 40\u2019, where an equivalent capacity SSD is \u00a3200 cheaper. For many professional users, a more important metric is endurance, but we couldn\u2019t find any data on this.\nPerformance\nThe Precision 7540 is built for performance and we were largely impressed with the results from our real-world tests.\nExporting an IGES model from 3D CAD software Solidworks took 82 secs and for this single-threaded process, the Xeon E2286M CPU maintained a clock speed of 4.7GHz. This is on par with most desktop workstations.\nUsing all eight CPU cores, a 4K render in Luxion KeyShot took 381 seconds. This is slower than you\u2019d expect from a top-end eight-core desktop CPU but considering the Xeon E2286M has a TDP of 45W and a base clock speed of 2.4GHz, we were very impressed that it hit 3.2GHz for the duration of the test. In fact, it even maintained this frequency when rendering for over an hour, with fan noise at quite acceptable levels.\nPutting the Quadro RTX 5000 through its paces in Autodesk VRED Professional, an application used extensively in automotive design, 3D performance was good at 4K resolution. We got a smooth 42 frames per second (FPS) with anti-aliasing (AA) off and 26 FPS with AA set to medium. This is slightly faster than we\u2019d expect from a desktop Quadro RTX 4000, but slower than a desktop Quadro RTX 5000.\nIn Enscape, a popular real-time viz tool for architecture, we got an adequate 17 FPS at 4K with our large architectural scene. Here, performance was almost identical to a desktop Quadro RTX 4000.\nOf course, the Quadro RTX 5000 is also VR ready and we had a very good flicker-free experience with an Oculus Rift in both Autodesk VRED Professional and Enscape. With newer, higher resolution VR headsets, you\u2019d likely see a bit of drop in performance here.\nThe machine was a fair bit off the pace in GPU rendering. The Quadro RTX 5000 took about 40% longer to render a scene than a desktop Quadro RTX 4000. This was in both the V-Ray NEXT benchmark and Solidworks Visualize. This could be down to sustained demands on the GPU. With interactive graphics, the GPU is taxed on and off as and when you move the model, whereas with GPU rendering, it is hammered for extended periods. In one eight-minute render, for example, as the GPU heated up, we saw the clock speed drop from around 1,500MHz to 1,200MHz.\nWhat these results show is that while the mobile Quadro RTX 5000 might have the same name as its desktop counterpart and be built from the same silicon, you can\u2019t expect the same performance. This is down to the available power and the challenges of keeping a hot GPU running cool in a small space.\nTo put this in perspective, the Quadro RTX 5000 runs up to 80W in the Precision 7540, up to 110W in the larger Precision 7740 and up to 265W in a desktop workstation. However, it\u2019s important to note that the relationship between power and performance is non-linear and the performance curve will flatten off above 80W.\nTo really push the machine to its limits, we started a CPU render and GPU render at the same time. The CPU clocked down to 1.95GHz and GPU utilisation went down from 95% to around 70-80% but the machine remained stable. We could even launch Solidworks and spin a model without it locking up. Most impressively, fan noise never became too loud and the palm rest stayed cool, although the keyboard did get a little warm, but certainly not hot.\nThe battery drop\nWe also tested performance when running off battery and were quite surprised, if not completely shocked, at how much the GPU and CPU clocked down. In KeyShot, the CPU dropped to 2.2GHz, taking 45% longer to complete the test render. In Solidworks Visualize the difference was even more dramatic, with the GPU instantly dropping from 1,500MHz to 300MHz. It was so slow, in fact, that we didn\u2019t even wait for our render to finish.\nIn short, when running off battery, you can get away with rendering on the CPU, but for GPU rendering, you really need to be plugged in. And, of course, any compute intensive operation will drain your battery much more quickly.\nConclusion\nDell has given its mainstream 15-inch mobile workstation a new lease of life with the powerful Nvidia Quadro RTX 5000 GPU. It might not reach the heights of a desktop RTX 5000, and there are questions about performance when GPU rendering, but it gives those with GPU-hungry workflows a strong alternative to the bulkier 17-inch mobile workstation.\nWhen shoehorning powerful components into a small chassis, there\u2019s always a danger that thermals will get out of control. But Dell\u2019s engineering team looks to have done an excellent job here and in our real-world tests, the machine maintained relatively high clock speeds without too much fan noise or heat.\nConsidering the high-end spec, it will come as little surprise that our review unit costs \u00a34,690 + VAT. Moving down to a Quadro RTX 4000 would save a substantial \u00a3812. We\u2019d be interested to learn how this impacts 3D performance, although the drop from 16GB to 8GB of GPU memory should also be considered. With our largest models in Enscape VR and Solidworks Visualize, for example, we were pushing 10 \u2013 11GB.\nIn summary, those who value performance above anything else would likely be best served by the Precision 7740, or even a desktop workstation, but for a blend of speed, portability and stability in a very well-engineered chassis, the Precision 7540 is hard to beat.\n\n\u25cf1 2 x spare memory slots\u00a0 \u25cf2 2 x NVMe SSD slots\u00a0 \u25cf3 M.2 NVMe SSD slot or 2.5-inch drive bay when fitted with smaller battery\u00a0 \u25cf4 97wh Li-ion battery\nProduct specifications\n\u25a0 Intel Xeon E2286M CPU (8 Cores) (2.40GHz, 5.00GHz Turbo)\n\u25a0 Nvidia Quadro RTX 5000 GPU (16GB GDDR6 memory))\n\u25a0 64GB (2 x 32GB) DDR4 2666MHz non-ECC memory\n\u25a0 512GB M.2 NVMe PCIe Class 50 SSD\n\u25a0 Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX200 2\u00d72 .11ax 160MHz + Bluetooth 5.0\n\u25a0 M15.6\u201dUltraSharp UHD (3,840 x 2,160) Anti-Glare IGZO, 100% Adobe colour\n\u25a0 From 2.53kg\n\u25a0 337.6mm (w) x 251.3mm (d) x 25mm \u2013 29.95mm (h)\n\u25a0 Windows 10 Pro for Workstation (4 Cores Plus)\n\u25a0 3 year ProSupport and Next Business Day onsite service\n\u25a0 \u00a34,690 (ex VAT)\ndell.com/en-uk\n\n\nCPU benchmarks (secs \u2013 smaller is better)\nCAD\n(Solidworks 2020 IGES export) \u2013 62 secs (smaller is better)\nRendering\n(KeyShot 8.1) \u2013 381 secs (smaller is better)\n(V-Ray Next Benchmark) \u2013 9,651 ksamples (bigger is better)\nGraphics benchmarks (frames per second @ 4K res) (bigger is better)\nVIZ (Enscape)\nMuseum \u2013 17\nVIZ (Autodesk VRED Pro)\nCar model (AA off, med, high) \u2013 42.05 / 26.55 / 9.85\nGPU rendering benchmarks\nGPU rendering\n(Solidworks Visualize 2020) 1969 Camaro car @ 4K\n\u2022 1,000 passes \u2013 452 secs\n\u2022 100 passes + AI denoising \u2013 56 secs (smaller is better)\nGPU rendering\n(V-Ray Next Benchmark)\n159 mpaths (bigger is better)\nIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe to our email newsletter or print / PDF magazine for FREE\nRelated articles:Lenovo takes graphics to new levels with ThinkPad P53Teradici and HP launch HP Anyware betaThe AEC industry faces unique challenges and opportunities when enabling remote workReview: HP Z2 Mini workstationDell Precision M6400AEC Magazine Jan / Feb 2025 EditionAMD Radeon Pro W6600 GPU reviewReview: HP ZBook Firefly 14 G11 A\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPrevious Post \n\nNext Post \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStay informed\nJoin the AEC community\nNewsletter \u2022 FREE digital magazine \u2022 print magazine\nGo\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLatest content \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAI and the future of arch viz\n\nFebruary 21, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWorkstation Special Report \u2013 Winter 2025\n\nFebruary 9, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMotif to take on Revit: exclusive interview\n\nFebruary 7, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAllplan acquires Manufacton to boost offsite\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nD5 Render 2.10 introduces real-time path tracing\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \u00a9 2008 - 2024 X3DMedia\r\n19 Leyden Street, London, E1 7LE, UK\r\nTel: +44(0)20 3355 7310                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Cookie Consent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.

The move was done just a few days after EVGA introduced their GeForce RTX 2060 KO series of graphics cards which start at an impressive price of $279.99 US.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Now Available For $299.99 US - Get RTX, DLSS, and More In This Feature-Packed Mainstream Powerhouse\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 launched last year at CES 2019 at a starting price of $349.99 US. The graphics card has since received the SUPER treatment but despite the other RTX variants which got replaced by their SUPER brethren, the RTX 2060 was still kept in NVIDIA's inventory, making up the sub $350 US market.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB MemoryNow, NVIDIA has officially brought the price of their mainstream offering to $299.99 US, making it the only RTX option to purchase under $300 US. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 packs the NVIDIA Turing TU106 GPU with 1920 CUDA cores, 120 TMUs, and 48 ROPs. The chip is coupled with 6 GB of GDDR6 memory running at 14.00 Gbps to deliver 336 GB/s of bandwidth along its 192-bit interface. The card has a TDP of 160W and should go along nicely with mainstream gaming PCs under $1000 US.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX/GTX \"Turing\" Family:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 D6NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 SUPERNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti\n\n\n\n\nGPU ArchitectureTuring GPU (TU117)Turing GPU (TU117)Turing GPU (TU116)Turing GPU (TU116)Turing GPU (TU116)Turing GPU (TU116)Turing GPU (TU106)Turing GPU (TU106)Turing GPU (TU104)Turing GPU (TU102)\n\n\nProcess12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN\n\n\nDie Size200mm2200mm2284mm2284mm2284mm2284mm2445mm2445mm2545mm2754mm2\n\n\nTransistors4.7 Billion4.7 Billion6.6 Billion6.6 Billion6.6 Billion6.6 Billion10.6 Billion10.6 Billion13.6 Billion18.6 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores896 Cores896 Cores1280 Cores1408 Cores1408 Cores1536 Cores1920 Cores2304 Cores2944 Cores4352 Cores\n\n\nTMUs/ROPs56/3256/3280/3288/4888/4896/48120/48144/64192/64288/96\n\n\nGigaRaysN/AN/AN/AN/AN/AN/A5 Giga Rays/s6 Giga Rays/s8 Giga Rays/s10 Giga Rays/s\n\n\nCache1.5 MB L2 Cache1.5 MB L2 Cache1.5 MB L2 Cache1.5 MB L2 Cache1.5 MB L2 Cache1.5 MB L2 Cache4 MB L2 Cache4 MB L2 Cache4 MB L2 Cache6 MB L2 Cache\n\n\nBase Clock1485 MHz1410 MHz1530 MHz1530 MHz1530 MHz1500 MHz1365 MHz1410 MHz1515 MHz1350 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock1665 MHz1590 MHz1725 MHz1785 MHz1785 MHz1770 MHz1680 MHz1620 MHz\n1710 MHz OC1710 MHz\n1800 MHz OC1545 MHz\n1635 MHz OC\n\n\nCompute3.0 TFLOPs3.0 TFLOPs4.4 TFLOPs5.0 TFLOPs5.0 TFLOPs5.5 TFLOPs6.5 TFLOPs7.5 TFLOPs10.1 TFLOPs13.4 TFLOPs\n\n\nMemoryUp To 4 GB GDDR5Up To 4 GB GDDR6Up To 4 GB GDDR6Up To 6 GB GDDR5Up To 6 GB GDDR6Up To 6 GB GDDR6Up To 6 GB GDDR6Up To 8 GB GDDR6Up To 8 GB GDDR6Up To 11 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Speed8.00 Gbps12.00 Gbps12.00 Gbps8.00 Gbps14.00 Gbps12.00 Gbps14.00 Gbps14.00 Gbps14.00 Gbps14.00 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Interface128-bit128-bit128-bit192-bit192-bit192-bit192-bit256-bit256-bit352-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth128 GB/s192 GB/s192 GB/s192 GB/s336 GB/s288 GB/s336 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s616 GB/s\n\n\nPower ConnectorsN/AN/A6 Pin8 Pin8 Pin8 Pin8 Pin8 Pin8+8 Pin8+8 Pin\n\n\nTDP75W75W100W120W125W120W160W185W (Founders)\n175W (Reference)225W (Founders)\n215W (Reference)260W (Founders)\n250W (Reference)\n\n\nStarting Price$149 US$149 US$159 US$219 US$229 US$279 US$349 US$499 US$699 US$999 US\n\n\nPrice (Founders Edition)$149 US$149 US$159 US$219 US$229 US$279 US$349 US$599 US$799 US$1,199 US\n\n\nLaunchApril 2019April 2020November 2019March 2019October 2019February 2019January 2019October 2018September 2018September 2018\n\n\n\n\nThe move without a doubt has been done to tackle the AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT which got its intro at CES 2020 and will be hitting retail shelves in the coming week for $279.99 US plus premium for the custom models. The EVGA GeForce RTX 2060 KO is already going to hit the sales of the card at $279.99 US, but other AIBs are also well underway to prepare their own cost-effective RTX 2060's while dropping the prices of their existing RTX 2060 graphics cards to match NVIDIA's new MSRP.\nAt $299 US, the RTX 2060 will offer much better value than the Radeon RX 5600 XT, even while being $20 US more expensive than AMD's Navi based offering. AMD has shown the RX 5600 XT to be up to 15% faster than a GTX 1660 SUPER and 20% faster than a GTX 1660 Ti.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060, on the other hand, is up to 20% faster than the GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER while offering added features such as RTX, DLSS, etc. It will be interesting to see how the Radeon RX 5600 XT and the price-cut GeForce RTX 2060 perform against each other in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\nWhich mainstream gaming graphics card is now the better purchase?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 @ $299 US\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT @ 279 US\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n159\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n95\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n69\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n54\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Alongside the usual slate of compatibility updates and bug fixes, the software includes a new feature that allows you to set a framerate limit across all your games, whether they individually offer the option or not.According to NVIDIA, a global framerate cap has been one of the most requested features from its users. It's especially useful on notebooks and gaming laptops since it allows you to conserve battery power by stopping your graphics card from running at full load if it doesn't need to. In some instances, limiting a game's framerate can also lead to reduced latency. Combine those with the fact that not all video games include the option, and it's easy to see why NVIDIA is adding the setting.Once you've installed the new drivers, you can set a max framerate by launching the NVIDIA Control Panel. Click on the \"Manage 3D settings\" menu item under the 3D Settings heading, and then scroll down through the \"Global Settings\" panel until you see the \"Max Frame Rate\" option. Once there, turn it on and then decide on a limit. Usually, it's best to go with one that's equivalent to your monitor's refresh rate. So, for example, if you have a 144Hz monitor, set a 144 FPS max.The update also adds a new rendering technique called Variable Rate Supersampling (VRSS) that can improve how virtual reality games look. NVIDIA claims the feature can make a VR game look better without negatively impacting performance since it only turns on when there's extra GPU headroom. At the moment, approximately 24 DirectX 11-compatible VR games can take advantage of VRSS.Besides those new features, the update also includes support for eight new G-Sync Compatible displays, and adds ray tracing to Wolfenstein: Youngblood.If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\n\n\n\nAn unknown graphics card has been spotted in a VR benchmark, and it blows away Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, with some speculation arguing that this could be AMD\u2019s unreleased \u2018big Navi\u2019 GPU that's rumored to launch this year.In fact, at CES 2020, AMD\u2019s CEO has just been talking about how a high-end Navi GPU is in the pipeline, implying it will turn up in 2020, and the benchmark result is certainly in line with an \u2018Nvidia killer\u2019 graphics card.At CES 2020, Intel fails to defend its crown from AMDWe've chosen all the\u00a0best graphics cardsThese are the\u00a0best processorsOf course, we need to chuck a load of salt around here \u2013 definitely don\u2019t be shy with that shaker \u2013 because the benchmark and machine spec are rather odd in some respects. As spotted on Reddit, and highlighted by Videocardz, the OpenVR benchmark shows an unknown AMD Radeon Graphics solution outperforming the fastest RTX 2080 Ti in the database by 17%.Now, remember that this is the very fastest, or in other words the most overclocked, RTX 2080 Ti in the database, and compared to a typical stock version of Nvidia\u2019s GPU, the result is more like 30% faster. And this is still allegedly an early sample GPU, not the finished product, so the gains could be even greater.Given this, you can see why people are whispering about \u2013 or indeed hoping \u2013 that this is indeed AMD\u2019s high-end Navi offering, because it could theoretically leave the RTX 2080 Ti in the dust. And the further hope would be AMD will price it competitively compared to the GeForce giant.Let\u2019s not get carried away, though. For starters, we obviously can\u2019t disregard the possibility of fakery here, although going by the chatter online \u2013 even the developer of the OpenVR benchmark has chimed in on Reddit \u2013 this seems to be a genuine result. But then there\u2019s still the question of what GPU the result pertains to\u2026The benchmark is rather strange in that not only does this appear to be an engineering sample GPU, but it\u2019s seemingly benchmarked with an early sample of AMD\u2019s Ryzen 7 4800H \u2013 yes, that\u2019s a mobile CPU in a laptop (freshly revealed at CES).Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.That\u2019s an odd setup to be testing out a new high-end Navi card, for sure. Although that doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that this could be the case \u2013 all sorts of odd configurations can be tested before the release of new hardware.Minefield of speculationThere are various possibilities that this unknown GPU could be, however, other than high-end Navi, and some folks are arguing that it may well be a company (presumably a laptop manufacturer) testing an external GPU enclosure \u2013 possibly sporting an unreleased Nvidia solution.While the benchmark carries the label of \u2018AMD Radeon Graphics\u2019, the argument further runs that this refers to the Ryzen 7 4800H APU (in other words, the integrated graphics), and there\u2019s a second GPU in play which is Nvidia. Although that\u2019s not necessarily the case \u2013 there are other possibilities here, such as the APU having its graphics disabled, and there being two separate cards on the system (not likely, admittedly).Alternatively, the benchmark could point to a setup running twin GPUs, like a pair of beefy existing AMD cards in Crossfire \u2013 although the benchmark developer notes that he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to run the OpenVR benchmark with a Crossfire (or SLI) setup (or, at least, no profiles for this kind of rig exist).Furthermore, the dev notes that if this is an unknown Nvidia card, it would be very unlikely for somebody to have access to both AMD engineering samples (the APU) and Nvidia (GPU \u2013 assuming it\u2019s an unreleased Nvidia graphics solution, which the benchmark result would certainly indicate). But not impossible\u2026We could go back and forth on the theories surrounding this benchmark leak all day, and suffice to say it\u2019s a bit of a minefield of speculation \u2013 but the tantalizing possibility remains that this might just be the infamous Nvidia-killer packing some large caliber ammunition.Whatever the case, AMD needs to get a move on with the release of high-end Navi realistically, given that Nvidia\u2019s next-gen Ampere graphics cards are rumored to be launching in the second half of this year; at which point the goalposts will be seriously shifted.Our pick of the\u00a0best PC games\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nAMD\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

To decide which are enabled, press Alt+Z in-game, click the cog, navigate to Highlights, and select Highlight types:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the match, you can click the \u201cNVIDIA Highlights\u201d button to access recordings and screenshots. In this in-game overlay, you can quickly review, edit and share your Highlights to multiple sites and social media platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Highlights is also available a number of other games with GeForce Experience, listed in full here.\nFor news on future integrations of Highlights in new titles, stay tuned to GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProductos\n\n\nTodas las Tarjetas Gr\u00e1ficas\n\n\nLaptop\n\n\nMonitores G-SYNC\n\n\nGaming en la Nube\n\n\n\n\nComunidad y Noticias\n\n\n\u00daltimas Noticias\n\n\nForos\n\n\n#SHOTWITHGEFORCE\n\n\nPortal de la Comunidad\n\n\nRecursos para Desarrollador\n\n\n\n\nSoporte\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nSoporte de Compra\n\n\nSoporte T\u00e9cnico\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           M\u00e9xico\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPol\u00edtica de Privacidad\n\n\nGestionar Mi Privacidad\n\n\nLegal\n\n\nAccesibilidad\n\n\nSeguridad del Producto\n\n\n Cont\u00e1ctenos\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Released into Early Access last year, this fast-paced title places you in the role of Shelia, an agent that\u2019s trying to save the world from a terrorist organization while battling an army of reanimated creatures. Now, Bright Memory has updated its Early Access release with ray-traced reflections and NVIDIA DLSS.\u00a0\nBright Memory is built on the Unreal Engine 4 and combines the ranged shooting style of a traditional FPS, with quick-paced combo attacks from melee skills, and close-range abilities normally found in action titles. When the new update is installed, the power of ray-tracing will bring reflective surfaces to life with detailed, high-quality lifelike reflections. And with DLSS, you\u2019re sure to get the best performance and visual fidelity possible on your GeForce RTX GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enable\u00a0ray-traced reflections, ensure you have the latest Game Ready Driver, Windows 10 update and game patch installed, then navigate to Options > Graphics > switch Ray Tracing on. At the same time, you can also enable NVIDIA DLSS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS Boosts Performance in Bright Memory \nRay-traced reflections add a new layer of lifelike visual effects to an already beautiful game, and DLSS uses the power of deep learning and AI to improve the game\u2019s performance and anti-aliasing. This allows you to achieve higher frame rates without having to sacrifice the game\u2019s incredible visual fidelity.\nIn Bright Memory, DLSS is able to improve performance significantly when compared to the game\u2019s native AA solution, without sacrificing quality. In fact, organic objects such as plants and trees tend to look better when using DLSS than at native resolutions.\u00a0\nIn terms of raw performance, this means that with DLSS you can crank the in-game graphics and ray-tracing settings to their maximum, while maintain a solid 60+ FPS at 1920x1080 on a GeForce RTX 2060:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost importantly, DLSS achieves this performance while keeping image quality comparable to native resolutions with TAA.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages captured at 1080p with RTX 2060\nAbove, DLSS maintains the detailed lines in the cracks and fissures, and patterns in the stones ensuring that the textures and depth cues are preserved.

That\u2019s not surprising at that price point, because it meant that this RTX 2060 was actually pitched at exactly the same recommended price AMD has set for its new Radeon RX 5600 XT (which will be available January 21).Indeed, at Nvidia\u2019s new official asking price, the RTX 2060 is only $20 more than the RX 5600 XT, and you\u2019re getting a lot more card for your money. Remember that the 5600 XT is built to beat out the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti \u2013 that was the GPU AMD was comparing the card to at CES.Competing with the RTX 2060 is, of course, a different matter, plus as a member of the RTX family, that Nvidia graphics card also comes packing ray tracing cores.Knockout blow?When EVGA dropped the price of its KO (Knockout) Gaming card, we were mulling over whether this was the manufacturer acting alone, or whether this was part of some bigger plan orchestrated by Nvidia \u2013 and now we know it\u2019s obviously the latter.Presumably, then, other GPU makers will be dropping their RTX 2060 offerings, with the baseline models coming down to reflect this new price level \u2013 or possibly even lower in the spirit of competition, as EVGA did with its initial discount with the KO card (a discount which has now been withdrawn, by the way, although it\u2019s a moot point as there is no stock of the KO Gaming left anyway right now).Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Now we\u2019ll have to see how AMD might respond to the move, and indeed how Nvidia\u2019s line-up will be adjusted in light of the fact that the RTX 2060 is now sitting a lot closer to the top-end GTX Turing offerings.Remember that the 1660 Ti is selling for much the same price as AMD\u2019s incoming 5600 XT, or at least the cheapest versions are in the US currently, giving that GPU a similar problem in terms of its comparative value proposition to the RTX 2060.These are the best graphics cards of 2020Via PC Gamer\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

You can now cap your PC's framerates---either for all games on your PC or just for specific games. Here's how. \n                        Why Would You Want to Cap Your FPS?\n               \nThis feature is particularly useful on Windows gaming laptops with NVIDIA hardware, as you can stop your GPU from running as fast as it can. This will save battery power and reduce heat consumption, letting you game for longer when you're away from a power outlet.\nYou might also find the cap useful to reduce screen tearing in games. You can try\u00a0setting the maximum FPS to your display's refresh rate\u00a0if you don't have\u00a0a G-Sync or FreeSync-enabled monitor with variable refresh rates. The NVIDIA Control Panel also says this feature can \"[reduce] system latency in certain scenarios.\" \n                        How to Set a Maximum FPS for All Games\n               \nThis feature is built into the NVIDIA Control Panel. To open it, right-click your Windows desktop and select \"NVIDIA Control Panel.\"\n(If you don't see this menu option, you likely don't have NVIDIA's drivers installed.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect \"Manage 3D Settings\" under 3D Settings at the left side of the NVIDIA Control Panel window.\nTo control the maximum frame rate for all applications on your PC, ensure the \"Global Settings\" tab is selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the list of settings, click the box to the right of \"Max Frame Rate.\" By default, this option is disabled, and there is no maximum frame rate.\nTo set a maximum frame rate, select \"On\" and choose your maximum frames per second (FPS.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \"Apply\" at the bottom of the window to save your settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        How to Control Max Frame Rate for Specific Games\n               \nYou can also control the maximum frame rate setting for individual applications. Click the \"Program Settings\" tab at the top of the list of settings. Under \"Select a program to customize,\" choose the app you want to control.\nIf a game doesn't appear in the list, you can click \"Add\" and specify its .exe file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook for the \"Max Frame Rate\" option, click it, and select your desired setting. By default, each game is set to \"Use global setting\"---it'll use whatever setting you chose on the Global Settings tab.\nHowever, you can select different settings here. For example, you might leave the maximum frame rate option disabled on the \"Global Settings\" tab and configure a different maximum frame rate for each game you want to cap. Or, you might set a maximum frame rate globally and exempt individual games from the cap. It's up to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to click \"Apply\" to save your settings. \nIf you don't see this option, be sure to update your NVIDIA drivers. You can update your drivers in the GeForce Experience application if it's installed or by downloading the latest drivers from NVIDIA's website.\nThis feature was added in version 441.87 of the NVIDIA GeForce drivers, which were released on January 6, 2020. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Games\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

Part of her design process is sculpting and hand painting every detail, from a chameleon\u2019s scales to an octopus\u2019s tentacles.\nMonteleone uses Substance Painter, a 3D painting program from Substance by Adobe, to create new textures and patterns by baking maps, which she then uses to give realistic appearances to her 3D designs and models.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re doing any sort of heavy texturing or GPU rendering, having an NVIDIA RTX card in your machine will pay for itself.\u201d \u2014 Nikie Monteleone, 3D artist\n\nTexture baking allows artists to transfer details from one model to another \u2014 but it can be a time-consuming process, and Monteleone needed a graphics card that could keep up. This is especially important because inspiration hits when she least expects it. With NVIDIA RTX, Monteleone can quickly turn her creative ideas into reality.\nMore companies are incorporating RTX capabilities into their software, and Substance Painter is one of the creative applications that\u2019s using RTX to speed up certain processes \u2014 including baking.\nWith RTX-powered Substance Painter, Monteleone can bake maps up to 8x faster than before. The speed and performance of the NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 graphics card lets Monteleone skip the 2D concept and take her ideas straight to 3D modeling.\nThe artist-friendly Substance Painter lets animators have fun with developing looks and textures for their designs. Images courtesy of Nikie Monteleone.\nRTX-tra Features in Substance Painter\nThe first time Monteleone opened Substance Painter, she was immediately hooked. The interface and navigation in Substance Painter are easy to use, allowing her to create new looks and play around with designs faster than before.\n\u201cFor an artist who\u2019s constantly iterating, the RTX 6000 is proving to be quite a timesaver and is really fun to use,\u201d said Monteleone. \u201cI\u2019m able to do real-time rendering and get designs approved on the fly, with the ability to perform faster on more 3D asset iterations than before.\u201d\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Nikie-Monteleone-SP-baking.mp4\n\u00a0\nBut there\u2019s one place where RTX really shines in Substance Painter: hitting the bakes with the new GPU-accelerated features.\nMonteleone relies heavily on baked maps, using them to multiply, overlay or add definition to her designs. As she started to specialize more in surfacing, she upgraded to using the Quadro RTX 6000.\nWith the new graphics card, Monteleone was seeing massive performance boosts with baking maps, being able to navigate larger scenes and load higher resolution maps on the spot.\nPreviously, Monteleone would wait up to 78 minutes for a bake to finish. But with the RTX card, that time reduced to seven minutes \u2014 barely enough time for a quick coffee break.\nWith Quadro RTX, Monteleone can spend less time waiting for bakes to finish and more time bringing her characters and designs to life.\nLearn more about NVIDIA RTX.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | Creators | NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It started to make video cards in 1978, several years before ATI, and 15 years before NVIDIA. While the company's own internal GPU development efforts petered early this century, the company has continued on as a specialist card maker, using other vendors' GPUs to make special-purpose multi-monitor solutions. Since 2014 the company has been using AMD\u2019s GPUs for its boards, and earlier this month the company inked a similar agreement with NVIDIA. This week, Matrox launched its first NVIDIA-based graphics cards.\nThe Matrox D-series family of multi-display graphics cards based on a custom-built NVIDIA Quadro embedded GPU and carries 4 GB of GDDR5 memory as well as four DisplayPort 1.4 (D1480) or four HDMI 2.0 (D1450) outputs. The D1450 supports four monitors, with a maximum resolution of up to 4096x2160@60Hz, whereas the D1480 adapter supports four monitors with resolujtions up to 5120\u00d73200@60Hz. The card consumes 47 W and only uses power supplied to it through the PCIe x16 slot.\n\nFor video wall applications used in aerospace, military, pro A/V, digital signage, security, and industries, four of Matrox D-series boards can be combined in a single system via board-to-board framelock cables, driving up to 16 displays using one PC. In addition, the cards can further be augmented with Matrox's QuadHead2Go\u00a0multi-display controllers to drive up to 64 Full-HD screens from a single PC. It is also possible to pair D-series cards with Matrox Mura IPX capture and IP encode/decode boards for applications that need those capabilities.\n\nMatrox does not disclose which GPU it uses for the D-series video cards, but it claims that the \u2018custom-built\u2019 NVIDIA Quadro GPU is compatible with DirectX 12, OpenCL 1.2 and OpenGL 4.5, which points to one of NVIDIA\u2019s latest architecture (e.g., Pascal, Turing).\nMatrox\u2019s D1450 and D1480 graphics cards will be available sometimes in the second quarter. Their exact pricing is unknown, but expect to see Matrox to charge a premium for their specialized products.\nRelated Reading:\n\nMatrox Acquired by Co-Founder\nMatrox to Use AMD GPUs in Their Next Generation Multi-Display Graphics Cards\n\nSources: Matrox Graphics, Matrox Graphics\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n29 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\ndomboy - Wednesday, January 29, 2020 - link\nA single slot video card!! I miss those...\n\n\n\njeremyshaw - Wednesday, January 29, 2020 - link\nA lot of those still exist in the professional market, but are priced to the high moon.\n\n\n\nBoemlauweBas - Thursday, January 30, 2020 - link\nQUADRO P2000 / P4000 come to mind. \n\n\n\nRU482 - Friday, January 31, 2020 - link\n47W....more like P1000\n\n\n\nmode_13h - Tuesday, February 4, 2020 - link\nUp to Quadro RTX 4000, if you want current-gen.  On that card, you get a TU104 with 8 GB, and pricing is about $900, IIRC.  So, it's like a down-clocked RTX 2070 Super.The other thing about Quadro cards is their power connectors are on the short edge.  So, you can fit them in a 3U case, without having to use a riser.\n\n\n\nDanNeely - Wednesday, January 29, 2020 - link\noccasional mid-range single slot cards show up from tier 2 vendors.  They're rare though because a single slot blower pushing 100W is obnoxiously loud.At only 45W Matrox's cards are a more reasonable TDP for the cooling; and will probably be stuffed away in a network closet instead of being next to a users desk.\n\n\n\nPeachNCream - Wednesday, January 29, 2020 - link\nLots of us miss them.  Sure the TDP can't go as high before noise gets out of hand, but it stinks giving up two or three expansion slots on a mATX build (or finding room for a giant GPU card in an ITX case) with the only other option being something like a GT 1030 or iGPU.\n\n\n\nbolkhov - Thursday, January 30, 2020 - link\nP1000 is also single slot, as well as P2000.Both are almost 3 years old now, and are widely available, e.g. from PNY.P1000 is 45W with 4x mDP, P2000 is 75W with 4x DP.How is this Matrox D-series different?D-1480 with its 4GB looks like a P1000 in a P2000 packaging (full-height PCB with full-size DPs and bigger cooler).\n\n\n\nnicolaim - Wednesday, January 29, 2020 - link\nTypo: resolujtions\n\n\n\njbounds - Wednesday, January 29, 2020 - link\nIt's Swedish. :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Actually there were two such cards in the new 'KO' range, the EVGA GeForce RTX 2060 KO and the EVGA GeForce RTX 2060 KO Ultra. These could be found advertised on EVGA's own store for $279 and $299, respectively, with instant rebates applied to the shopping cart.\n\nSome initially commented on the move as an Nvidia plan to undermine the AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT launch. However, at the time EVGA seemed to indicate the price slashing initiative was simply its own, and nothing to do with the GPU maker. Now it has been noted that Nvidia has changed the price of its own GeForce RTX 2060 Founders Edition to $299 stateside. This price is $50 lower than it was previously, recently advertised at. Furthermore, if you browse US retail sites you can find other brand RTX 2060 cards like the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 2060 OC GG with WindForce 2X cooler at $299, after $30 rebate (Newegg link).\n\nThe timing of the raytracing hardware equipped RTX 2060's price cut might be seen as Nvidia's attempt to spoil AMD's Radeon RX 5600 XT hard launch. I noticed Tom's Hardware's report on this price cut news included a quote from a statement it received from Nvidia, about the GeForce RTX 2060 Founders Edition price cuts. \"In case you are currently testing the Radeon 5600 XT,\" began the message, which went on to announce the reduced Founders Edition pricing...\n\nWhen I first saw the EVGA GeForce RTX 2060 I noted that AMD's own promotional launch slides compared the RX 5600 XT against the GTX 1660 Super and GTX 1660 Ti - but this beefier Turing GPU with raytracing and DLSS features will now be lowered into the RX 5600 XT's price bracket. Welcoming competition, it would be great if AMD could cut its Radeon RX 5000 Series prices in reaction.\nAnnounced last week at CES 2020, the first AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT graphics cards will become available, from a multitude of AIBs, starting next week (Tuesday, 21st January is the official date). The RRP for partner cards as announced last week is $279, filling the yawning gap between the $199 RX 5500 XT and the $349 RX 5700.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nHEXUS Week In Review: Radeon RX 6600 and RTX 3070 Noctua Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 3 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

G-SYNC ULTIMATE gaming monitors and Big Format Gaming Displays (BFGD) give users stunning best-in-class HDR gaming, with the latest panels and display technologies. G-SYNC gaming monitors are available with excellent features and technology in virtually every resolution, size and refresh rate. And G-SYNC Compatible gaming monitors are validated to ensure GeForce users receive a flawless baseline variable refresh rate experience, so when you buy a G-SYNC Compatible display you know it\u2019ll work straight out of the box.\nNow, at CES 2020, we\u2019re expanding the range of G-SYNC and G-SYNC Compatible monitors, enhancing our technology to deliver newer and better experiences, and introducing new world firsts, such as the first 360Hz gaming monitor, and the first 32\u201d Mini-LED 4K gaming monitors, all enhanced with G-SYNC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 360Hz Esports Gaming Monitors, For Faster, Smoother, Better Performance\nCompetitive gamers, esports players and esports tournaments already rely on 144Hz and 240Hz G-SYNC gaming monitors for the highest refresh rates, fastest response times, and clearest visuals. Now though, we\u2019re making a major new advancement with the creation of 360Hz, custom-tuned G-SYNC esports monitors that make gaming even more responsive and even clearer, for a competitive edge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur partners at ASUS have implemented this technology, together with AU Optronics\u2019s panel, in the ASUS ROG Swift 360Hz esports display. To get the complete lowdown, check out our dedicated 360Hz monitor article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n LG 2020 OLED TVs Are Also G-SYNC Compatible Big Format Gaming Displays\nIn November, LG became the first TV manufacturer to add G-SYNC Compatible support for their big-screen TVs, enabling GeForce gamers to enjoy stunning visuals and smooth variable refresh rate gaming on LG\u2019s spectacular OLEDs.\nAt CES 2020, LG has unveiled a suite of new big-screen OLED TVs, all 12 of which will be G-SYNC Compatible, with models ranging in size from 48 inches to a whopping 88 inches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith G-SYNC and LG\u2019s technology delivering low latency and smooth, responsive gaming, and their TVs getting ever larger, we\u2019re classifying LG\u2019s new 2020 TVs as Big Format Gaming Displays (BFGDs), giving gamers more options for smooth, high-quality VRR living room gaming.\nSo, if you buy one of LG\u2019s new 2020 G-SYNC Compatible BFGDs, you can be assured to receive an amazing experience, with stunning OLED-powered visuals, ultra low latency courtesy of LG\u2019s latest gaming innovations, and super smooth variable refresh rate gaming, free from tearing or V-SYNC-induced input lag.\nFor info about the release of LG\u2019s new 2020 TVs, stay tuned to their social media channels and websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG-SYNC ULTIMATE Mini-LED Gaming Monitors Make 4K HDR PC Gaming Even Better\nIn 2019, we announced that we were working on next-gen Mini-LED G-SYNC ULTIMATE gaming monitors, which would improve every aspect of previously-released G-SYNC ULTIMATE monitors, delivering an even better experience.\nThis week at CES 2020, our partners at ACER and ASUS are showing the latest version of this display technology, which has been enhanced and improved since its announcement. Previously, Mini-LED was to feature 576 local dimming zones for HDR, improving contrast, minimizing haloing, and improving color accuracy and overall picture quality.\nThis was a 50% improvement over the 384 zones offered by our first G-SYNC ULTIMATE monitors, which were themselves a massive leap over previously-released HDR PC displays. But now, there are an unprecedented 1152 local dimming zones on the ASUS and ACER 32\u201d 144Hz 4K G-SYNC ULTIMATE gaming monitors, vastly improving picture quality.\nFurthermore, we\u2019ve tweaked and improved contrast, boosted HDR brightness to a peak of 1400 nits, and enhanced our DCI-P3 color accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook for coverage of the new ASUS PG32UQX and Acer X32 Mini-LED 4K G-SYNC ULTIMATE gaming monitors on your favorite tech channels and websites this week. And stay tuned to GeForce.com for word on the release of these best-in-class displays, which improve every aspect of the G-SYNC ULTIMATE experience that press and gamers rate so highly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25 New G-SYNC Compatible Displays Announced and Supported\nThis time last year, we unveiled G-SYNC Compatible, a new category of gaming monitors that offered a baseline variable refresh rate (VRR) experience with a sufficiently-wide VRR range, and were guaranteed to deliver a flawless G-SYNC experience straight out of the box. By introducing G-SYNC Compatible, we ensured that gamers could easily find and buy a good gaming monitor with the knowledge that it\u2019ll work well, improving their gaming.\nSince then, we've introduced support for more and more monitors via our Game Ready Drivers, across all major resolutions, on monitors big and small, with refresh rates of up to 240Hz. And now, we\u2019re announcing support for a further 25 G-SYNC Compatible gaming monitors and displays, taking us to 90 displays total.\nOf the 25, 7 gaming monitors are enabled in today\u2019s new Game Ready Driver, along with support for the 2019 LG Z9 88\u201d BFGD, which users will also need to install a new firmware for via LG\u2019s website or the TV\u2019s built-in firmware update tool.\nSupport for the LG 2020 OLED Big Format Gaming Displays and other G-SYNC Compatible gaming monitors will follow later in the year, so keep your eye on our driver article news feed for word of their release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew G-SYNC Compatible Gaming Monitors, TVs and BFGDs\n\n\nGaming Monitors\n\n\nModel\nSize\nResolution\nGame Ready Driver Support\n\n\nAcer VG252QX\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nAcer XB253Q GX\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nAcer XV253QX\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nASUS VG259QM\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nComing soon\n\n\nASUS VG279QM\n27\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nASUS PG43UQ\n43\u201d\n3840x2160\nComing soon\n\n\nDell AW2521HF\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nComing soon\n\n\nDell AW2521HFL\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nComing soon\n\n\nLG 38WN95C\n37.5\u201d\n3840x1600\nAvailable now\n\n\nLG 28GN950\n37.5\u201d\n3840x1600\nAvailable now\n\n\nLG 34GN850\n34\u201d\n3440x1440\nComing soon\n\n\nView Sonic XG270\n27\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nBig Format Gaming Displays (BFGDs)\n\n\nLG 2020 BX\n55\u201d 65\u201d and 77\u201d\n3840x2160 \nLater this year\n\n\nLG 2020 CX\n48\u201d 55\u201d 65\u201d and 77\u201d\n3840x2160\nLater this year\n\n\nLG 2020 GX\n55\u201d 65\u201d and 77\u201d\n3840x2160\nLater this year\n\n\nLG 2020 ZX\n77\u201d and 88\u201d\n7680x4320 \nLater this year\n\n\nLG 2019 Z9\n88\u201d\n7680x4320\nAvailable now (TV firmware update required)\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor a complete list of all supported G-SYNC, G-SYNC ULTIMATE and G-SYNC Compatible gaming monitors, head to our handy webpage, with filters and options for sorting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG-SYNC In 2020: More Options, Even-Better Tech, and New Innovations\nThere are now 164 G-SYNC, G-SYNC Compatible, G-SYNC ULTIMATE and G-SYNC ULTIMATE BFGD gaming monitors and TVs, giving gamers seeking smooth, superior gaming enough choice to find the perfect display for their den, office or living room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the upcoming launch of our 360Hz and Mini-LED gaming monitors, even better displays will soon be available, and we continue to work with partners around the world to develop and launch even more G-SYNC monitors in each category, using the latest optimizations, enhancements and innovations.\nFor more on these and other NVIDIA advancements and developments, stay tuned to GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Spotted by _Rogame in the Geekbench database, two GPUs were coupled with Intel's next-generation 10th Gen Comet Lake-H processors which are reportedly launching in March of 2020.\nNVIDIA's GeForce GTX Turing Refresh 1650 SUPER & 1650 TI GPU Spotted Alongside Intel's 10th Gen Comet Lake-H CPUs\nNVIDIA is working on a series of updates for the mobility GPU family, the entire GeForce lineup from flagship to entry-level and we have seen a couple of those chips over the past few months. The latest database reveal points out to two NVIDIA GeForce GTX mobility GPUs, the GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER and the GeForce GTX 1650 Ti.\nRelated Story NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDPBased on the specifications and what is mentioned, the GeForce GTX 1650 TI notebook seems to be the fastest of the two while the GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER is the most entry-level GPU in the Turing family. There are more entry-level chips as I mentioned above but those are based on the Pascal GPU architecture. So this should mean that NVIDIA's Turing Mobility refresh lineup would look something like the following:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER Mobile (N18E-G3R)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER Mobile (N18E-G2R)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER Mobile (N18E-G1R)\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Notebook (N18P-G62)\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER Mobile (N18P-G61)\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Notebook GPU\nComing to the specifications and performance numbers of these GPUs, first up we have the GTX 1650 Ti. The GeForce GTX 1650 TI notebook GPU didn't exist in the initial lineup but would make its way into the refreshed family. The chip is indicated to feature 16 Compute Units (SMs) which make up 1024 CUDA Cores. The clock speed is reported at 1.49 GHz so we can expect a final clock speed of around 1.50 GHz. The chip is also listed to feature 4 GB of GDDR6 memory which will be running across a 128-bit bus interface. The clock speeds aren't reported but it is likely that we would get to see 12-14 Gbps pin speeds which should result in a decent boost compared to existing parts which feature 8 Gbps GDDR6/GDDR5 memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nIn terms of performance, the GTX 1650 Ti notebook scores 44,246 points while the GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER (desktop) scores around 52,000 points. This means that the desktop solution is just about 20% ahead of the notebook chip but we have to consider the fact that the desktop variant comes with more cores (1024 vs 1280) and much higher clock speeds (up to 1725 MHz vs 1.5 GHz). The GTX 1650 SUPER variant is equipped with 12 Gbps memory so I would presume that NVIDIA would stick with that at least in the entry-level models.\nWhen comparing the GTX 1650 Ti notebook with the GTX 1650 (desktop), we get to see a 20% jump in performance for the mobility part which is also expected since the notebook variant has better specifications.\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER Notebook GPU\nMoving on to the GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER notebook GPU, we are looking at 14 Compute Units (SMs) or 896 CUDA cores. This chip has a reported clock speed of 1.56 GHz which may not be a final retail configuration but comes with 4 GB of GDDR6 memory. It is stated that this chip could potentially feature higher clocks and higher memory speeds while retaining the core configuration of the TU117 GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX SUPER Mobility GPU Lineup Specs:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti NotebookNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 RefreshNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 RefreshNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPERNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER\n\n\n\n\nCodenameN18P-G62N18E-G1-BN18E-G1RN18E-G2RN18E-G3R\n\n\nArchitectureTuring TU116Turing TU106Turing TU104Turing TU104Turing TU104\n\n\nProcess Node12nm FinFET NVIDIA12nm FinFET NVIDIA12nm FinFET NVIDIA12nm FinFET NVIDIA12nm FinFET NVIDIA\n\n\nSMs1630364048\n\n\nCUDA Cores10241920230425603072\n\n\nStandard Max Boost Clock1485 MHz1285 MHz1485 MHz1380 MHz1560 MHz\n\n\nMax-Q Max Boost Clock1200 MHzTBCTBC1155 MHz1080 MHz\n\n\nVRAM4 GB GDDR66 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus128-bit192-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit\n\n\nMemory Clock12 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Bandwdith192 GB/s336 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s\n\n\nTGP (Total Graphics Power)35W (Standard)\n55W (Max-Q)115W (Standard)115W (Standard)115W (Standard)\n80 (Max-Q)150W+ (Standard)\n80 (Max-Q)\n\n\n\nThe performance of the GTX 1650 SUPER notebook is slightly better than most of the GTX 1650 desktop graphics card results which shows that notebooks would now match the performance of desktop counterparts in the entry-level in a sub 50W TDP design.\n\nBoth NVIDIA GeForce GTX Turing refresh GPUs were spotted in notebooks that were powered by Intel's 10th Generation Core i7-10750H processor which we detailed a few days ago along with its own leaked benchmarks. It looks like we will be getting some very decent notebook designs in the months ahead, coming from all camps, Intel, AMD & NVIDIA. Expect the GeForce RTX SUPER Notebook Refresh GPUs to launch alongside the Intel 10th Gen processors in March and the following months.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n120\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n79\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n69\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n55\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n52\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1160\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

And performance is further accelerated by NVIDIA Adaptive Shading, which can boost framerates by as much as 20%, with no perceptible effect on image quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, get comfy and prepare to delve into Wolfenstein: Youngblood's PC settings and enhancements, with examinations of each, using interactive comparison screenshots, relative performance charts, and written explainers, giving you all the info you need to tweak and tailor your graphics and performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuide Contents:\n\nNVIDIA RTX Ray Tracing\nGraphics Settings\n\nAnti-Aliasing\nAsync Compute\nDecal Filtering\nDecals\nDeferred Rendering\nDepth of Field\nDepth of Field Anti-Aliasing\nDirectional Occlusion\nGPU Culling\nHDR Bloom\nImage Aniso Filter\nImage Streaming\nLightmap Aniso Filter\nLights\nLOD Switch\nMaterial Aniso Filter\nMotion Blur\nNVIDIA Adaptive Shading\nNVIDIA DLSS \nParticles\nReflections\nRay Traced Reflections\nResolution Scale\nShadows\nSharpening\nVolumetric Quality\nWater Quality\nSettings Wrap-Up\n \nGeForce Experience: Optimal Playable Settings With A Single Click\nWolfenstein: Youngblood Game Ready Driver\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Effects Available Now In Wolfenstein: Youngblood\nBethesda Softworks and MachineGames have chosen NVIDIA GeForce as the PC platform of choice for Wolfenstein: Youngblood, giving us the opportunity to enhance Wolfenstein: Youngblood with realistic Ray-Traced Reflections.\nIn Wolfenstein: Youngblood, Ray-Traced Reflections will accurately simulate the way light reflects on glossy and metal surfaces by tracing a single bounce of reflection rays across the scene. Materials affected include smooth, natural mirrors, like windows and water, but also rougher surfaces like brushed metal. Unlike screen space techniques, which can only reflect what\u2019s on screen, ray-traced reflections incorporate the entire scene around the character, and can accurately represent objects outside the camera view, as well as those facing away from the camera. These reflections will enhance everything, from street scenes to secret labs, to casinos and control centers.\nTo experience these effects for yourself, grab the latest game update, and configure graphics options as detailed here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime-Limited Wolfenstein: Youngblood GeForce RTX Bundle\nThe GeForce RTX family recently expanded with the launch of our SUPER graphics cards, enhanced GeForce RTX 20-Series GPUs that are up to 25% faster, giving gamers best-in-class performance and features, and fast, high-fidelity real-time ray tracing.\nTo celebrate, we\u2019re giving buyers of eligible GeForce RTX GPUs, gaming desktops and gaming laptops copies of Wolfenstein: Youngblood and Control, two games that take full advantage of GeForce RTX's capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThis SUPER FAST. SUPERNATURAL Bundle is available now with qualifying products until August 18th, 2019, at participating retailers around the world. Learn more here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWolfenstein: Youngblood Graphics Settings\nWolfenstein: Youngblood includes nearly 30 settings that affect image quality and performance, giving you plenty to configure and tweak in your quest for the definitive experience. For all the details, keep reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-Aliasing\nAnti-Aliasing reduces the visibility of jagged edges, and nowadays many techniques also include a Temporal Anti-Aliasing component, counteracting shimmering and crawling seen on anti-aliased edges when they or the camera moves.\nIn Wolfenstein: Youngblood, six anti-aliasing options are available. Some are slightly sharper, and some have slightly better anti-aliasing properties on different game elements, but all you really need to know is that TSSAA 8TX is superior to all other AA settings, and should be enabled on all systems that aren't struggling for performance.\nLooking at the interactive comparisons below, you'll see that TSSAA 8TX has greatly improved anti-aliasing (immediately noticeable on the lamppost), the clarity and sharpness of textures is maintained better than with other techniques, shiny specular details are less muted, and with its 8 Temporal Anti-Aliasing samples, versus the single sample used by the other TAA techniques, TSSAA 8TX does a great job of keeping the action clear and shimmer free while you're playing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Comparisons\n\n\nTSSAA 8TX vs. SMAA 1TX\nTSSAA 8TX vs. FXAA 1TX\nTSSAA 8TX vs. TAA 1TX\n\n\nTSSAA 8TX vs. SMAA\nTSSAA 8TX vs. FXAA\nTSSAA 8TX vs. AA Off\n\n\nSMAA 1TX vs. FXAA 1TX\nSMAA 1TX vs. TAA 1TX\nSMAA 1TX vs. SMAA\n\n\nSMAA 1TX vs. FXAA\nSMAA 1TX vs. AA Off\nFXAA 1TX vs. TAA 1TX\n\n\nFXAA 1TX vs. SMAA\nFXAA 1TX vs. FXAA\nFXAA 1TX vs. AA Off\n\n\nTAA 1TX vs. SMAA\nTAA 1TX vs. FXAA\nTAA 1TX vs. AA Off\n\n\nSMAA vs. FXAA\nSMAA vs. AA Off\nFXAA vs. AA Off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHaving played and tested the entire game, here's our succinct summary: if you want the best overall AA, use TSSAA 8x; if you want the best TAA, use TSSAA 8x; and if you want to use normal AA instead, select SMAA.\nPerformance: The delta between TSSAA 8TX and Off is just shy of 10 FPS; a relatively high number in today's world of 2-3 FPS post-process anti-aliasing. Hopefully though, you'll agree the cost is worth it, as TSSAA 8TX does a much better job than the other AA techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne final anti-aliasing note: to make the results softer or sharper, you can apply additional post-process sharpening via the dedicated Sharpening setting, examined later in this guide. All screenshots above were taken with the default Sharpening value, 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsync Compute\nAsynchronous computing allows the GPU to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, rather than waiting for one to be finished before the next is started. This accelerates workloads, meaning your framerate increases, unless your GPU's performance is limited by a CPU bottleneck.\nIn Wolfenstein: Youngblood, enabling Async Compute can improve performance by 6-10% on Turing-architecture GPUs, in most instances, though the level of speed up will be reduced on prior-generation GPUs with less efficient asynchronous capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecal Filtering\nMost game engines have a single Anisotropic Filtering option, enabling players to increase the sharpness of textures seen in the distance and on the edges of the screen. In Wolfenstein: Youngblood, there are four AF options, the first of which is \"Decal Filtering\".\nIn game terms, a Decal is a scorch mark, a bullet hole, or some other effect applied to a textured surface. In our example below, focus exclusively on the road marking to the right of the enemy's foot, and you'll observe that it's clearer, sharper and more detailed with filtering set to 16x:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance: With a barely perceptible performance cost, that is well within the margin of error for benchmarks, there's no good reason to reduce the fidelity and clarity of decals, many of which you'll see throughout this action-packed FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecals\nThe second decals setting affects the quality and visibility of bullet impacts and the like. In the interactive comparison below, look to the checkpoint and swipe the slider back and forth: when the setting is lowered, less decals are visible, making it appear that your actions have little effect on the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Comparisons\n\n\nUltra vs. High\nUltra vs. Medium\nHigh vs. Medium\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPerformance: With a minimal performance cost, maxing out the Decal setting is recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred Rendering\nIn short, Deferred Rendering delays shading until a later part in the graphics pipeline, resulting in performance improvements for some configurations.\nOn our test bench, the benefit is just over 2 FPS, but do note that this setting cannot be used in conjunction with NVIDIA Adaptive Shading, which delivers far larger gains on Turing-architecture GPUs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth of Field\nThis tricky-to-benchmark setting applies some out of focus blurring at select moments during the game, maybe having a performance cost of around 5 FPS at 4K.\nIf you're looking for performance gains, switching Depth of Field off will certainly help, and you're unlikely to notice its absence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth of Field Anti-Aliasing\nWhen \"Depth of Field\" is enabled, this extra anti-aliasing setting can smooth out any rough edges where out of focus detail meets in focus detail. And best we can tell, it has a minimal extra cost, so if you decide to use DoF, this shouldn't affect framerates to any noticeable degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectional Occlusion\nWolfenstein: Youngblood's take on Ambient Occlusion is Directional Occlusion. Three detail levels are on offer, and in static comparisons the differences between levels can be summarized as, \"darker, more accurate shadowing\". In motion though, higher quality levels look a fair bit better as they have fewer temporal artifacts, therefore appearing more realistic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Comparisons\n\n\nHigh vs. Medium\nHigh vs. Low\nHigh vs. Off\n\n\nMedium vs. Low\nMedium vs. Off\nLow vs. Off\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIn darker areas, Directional Occlusion continues to improve image quality, though the benefits of higher details levels are diminished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Comparisons\n\n\nHigh vs. Medium\nHigh vs. Low\nHigh vs. Off\n\n\nMedium vs. Low\nMedium vs. Off\nLow vs. Off\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIn detailed scenes, with objects behind objects, behind objects, the benefits of higher detail levels can be more pronounced.

However, on modern NVIDIA graphics cards, our GPU architectures are more efficient at this at a global level, resulting in a loss of performance when enabling \"GPU Culling\". As such, we recommend switching-off GPU Culling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDR Bloom\nLights, sunlight, and other effects gain a bright, bloomy glow with HDR Bloom enabled, as demonstrated below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance: The post-process HDR Bloom effect has a minimal cost in the highly performant Wolfenstein: Youngblood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Aniso Filter\nThe second Anisotropic Filtering setting is a mystery, described in-game as affecting \"remaining image types\". Dozens of locations were tested and compared under a magnifier, and to date we've yet to find a single visual or performance difference between Trilinear and 16x filtering, so we'd recommend just leaving Image Aniso Filter at max quality for the duration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Streaming\nEssentially, Image Streaming is a Texture Quality setting combined with a texture loading setting, affecting not only the fidelity of textures, but the speed at which new textures load in.\nIf you've got a modern GPU with 6-8GB of VRAM, set Image Streaming to Uber or Ultra, and only turn it down if you notice delays in textures loading, or stuttering and pausing from repeated memory swapping. At these detail levels, everything is crisp and clear, and no texture pop-in is observed while sprinting at max speeds.\nOn lower detail levels, the quality of select textures begins to be reduced. In our example below, the quality of the statue and gambling table are greatly reduced; the advertising poster isn't as detailed or as sharp; the road texture is slightly blurrier; and the quality of the textures on geometry and debris is microscopically lower.\nMore importantly, textures can take longer to load in, and scenery in the distance can be distractingly blurry, affecting realism and immersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Comparisons\n\n\nUber vs. Ultra\nUber vs. High\nUber vs. Medium\n\n\nUber vs. Low\nUltra vs. High\nUltra vs. Medium\n\n\nUltra vs. Low\nHigh vs. Medium\nHigh vs. Low\n\n\n\u00a0\nMedium vs. Low\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPerformance: With no other bells and whistles tied to the Image Streaming setting, the level of detail you select should be dictated by your GPU's VRAM. With 8GB or more, everything should be gravy at 4K, though those with 6GB may find they need to drop to Ultra. If you have less than 6GB, we recommend limiting your gaming to Ultra at 1920x1080 or 2560x1440.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightmap Aniso Filter\nOur next Anisotropic Filtering setting adjusts the clarity of the lightmaps applied to environments.

In other areas though, and those primarily illuminated by daylight, the differences are less dramatic and far less visible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Comparisons\n\n\nUltra vs. High\nUltra vs. Medium\nUltra vs. Low\n\n\nHigh vs. Medium\nHigh vs. Low\nMedium vs. Low\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPerformance: In scenes such as the one shown above, Lights is the most demanding setting in the game, decreasing performance by over 20 FPS at its maximum detail level.

With Lights, this holds true in many locations, but in scenes such as the one shown above you ideally want max quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOD Switch\nWe've been unable to measure or observe any change in image quality or performance using this level of detail setting, so simply set it to max to ensure objects and game elements load at high levels of detail at all times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterial Aniso Filter\nMaterial Aniso Filter, the final Anisotropic Filter setting, is a traditional Texture Filter setting, improving the clarity of textures seen at a distance or on an angle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance: Anisotropic Filtering is generally a 'free' setting, having little to no performance cost. Here, however, there's a 7 FPS delta between 16x and Trilinear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the perf gains with lower settings, 16x is something you should enable regardless, unless you want your textures blurry for the duration of the game...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotion Blur\nAlong with an On-Off toggle, there's also a Motion Blur Quality setting, improving the fidelity of the blurring effect. As this can't be reliably tested, we're guesstimating that there's a 4-7 FPS delta between the minimum and maximum Motion Blur quality presets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Adaptive Shading\nGeForce RTX 20-Series GPUs are powered by our advanced Turing architecture, which makes real-time ray tracing a reality. Furthermore, Turing is the first and only architecture to offer support for Variable Rate Shading, Mesh Shading, and other technologies that make games look and play better.\nIn Wolfenstein: Youngblood, we utilize Variable Rate Shading (VRS) and some NVIDIA magic to improve performance by up to 20%, with zero downsides.\nIn-game, you'll want to enable \"NVIDIA Adaptive Shading\" (NAS), our custom setting that combines the Content Adaptive Shading (CAS) and Motion Adaptive Shading (MAS) VRS techniques with some additional engineering. Together, they detect areas of the screen that don't require full-rate shading.\nFor instance, in a dark corner you can't see any detail, so why shade at maximum quality, or even shade at all? And if you or the camera are moving at speed, and perhaps with Motion Blur enabled, too, why shade detail at full quality when you won't be able to see it? Using this logic, we can shade individual pixels less frequently, with no perceptible reduction in quality, boosting performance 'for free'.\nUsing a debug option, we can demonstrate NVIDIA Adaptive Shading in a scene from Wolfenstein: Youngblood. Balanced, Quality and Performance presets adjust the amount of variable rate shading, and the extent to which affected areas are less frequently shaded, shown in our debug images in different colors. Blue means the shading rate is 2x lower, green 4x lower, and yellow 8x lower:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Comparisons\n\n\nBalanced vs. Quality\nBalanced vs. Performance\nBalanced vs. Off\n\n\nQuality vs. Performance\nQuality vs. Off\nPerformance vs. Off\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIn this garage scene, the application of NVIDIA Adaptive Shading increases performance by 9% when using Balanced, our recommended setting, and by 12.6% when using Performance:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the scene without the debug overlay enabled, there is no perceptible loss of quality when using Balanced or Quality, though the more aggressive Performance mode does introduce a few blemishes that a trained eye will spot in static comparisons:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Comparisons\n\n\nBalanced vs. Quality\nBalanced vs. Performance\nBalanced vs. Off\n\n\nQuality vs. Performance\nQuality vs. Off\nPerformance vs. Off\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nDepending on the scene, performance gains from NVIDIA Adaptive Shading may increase or decrease.

Learn more in our tech explainer, and check out our GDC presentation if you want the complete lowdown on NVIDIA Adaptive Shading.\nIn summary, set it and forget it: NVIDIA Adaptive Shading set to Balanced will improve performance by 10-20% in the vast majority of the game's levels and locations, with no perceptible reduction in image quality, and without further user intervention or tweaking.\nBut if you do want to tweak, set NAS to Custom and adjust the sliders that tell the game when, where and how to use variable rate shading.\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS\nWhile ray tracing provides the next generation of visual fidelity in Wolfenstein: Youngblood, our DLSS technology accelerates performance so you can enjoy that fidelity at higher frame rates.\nAs an AI algorithm, DLSS is constantly learning and improving. Wolfenstein: Youngblood demonstrates this continuous improvement, with DLSS delivering big boosts in frame rates while providing similar image quality to native resolution with TAA.\nWhat this means for gamers is playing at higher output resolutions and quality settings with ray tracing enabled: in Wolfenstein: Youngblood, the GeForce RTX 2060 delivers over 80 FPS at 1920x1080 with RT and DLSS, and the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti exceeds 100 FPS at 4K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease set YouTube to 1080p60, instead of \u201cAuto\u201d, to see the video as intended\nWolfenstein: Youngblood brings three DLSS modes: Quality, Balanced, and Performance. These options control the DLSS rendering resolution, allowing you to choose the right balance of image quality and FPS. For 1920x1080 and 2560x1440, the default is set to Quality, with 4K set to Performance. Looking at performance with ray tracing on and DLSS at default settings, you\u2019ll enjoy solid gains across our entire RTX line-up:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS can improve performance by up to 2x in Wolfenstein: Youngblood\nMost importantly, DLSS achieves this performance while keeping image quality comparable to native resolutions with TAA.

Here, it strengthens the grating on the right side of the screen and the pipes on the building in the center, which both look less detailed and apparent in the native image with TAA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages captured at 1920x1080 using DLSS Quality Mode\nDLSS again maintains the crucial line work on the wiring and window sills, the specular lights, the shaded areas, and all the details. Here, it strengthens the window sills on the right side of the screen and the antennas on the top of the building, which are much more muted in the native image with TAA.\nTo enable NVIDIA DLSS, ensure you have the latest Game Ready Driver, Windows 10 update and game patch installed, navigate to Options > Video > Advanced Settings, scroll down, switch DLSS on, and select a quality mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticles\nShoot robotic enemies, and other game elements, and particles will be emitted, making fights look more interesting and dynamic. Using the Particles setting, the number and quality of these particles can be adjusted.\nAs with some other settings, making a repeatable benchmark is nigh on impossible, so we're guesstimating based on our many hours of gameplay and testing that Ultra runs around 10 FPS slower than Low in the biggest battles, and that High is a few FPS faster than Ultra with only a minimal change in image quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflections\nPuddles, select metal surfaces, glossy floors, and other material types feature Screen Space Reflections, showing real-time reflections of surrounding action and game elements:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Comparisons\n\n\nUltra vs. High\nUltra vs. Medium\nUltra vs. Low\n\n\nHigh vs. Medium\nHigh vs. Low\nMedium vs. Low\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAs you can see, most geometric detail is retained on everything but Low, which essentially disables all reflectivity.\nIn our next set of comparisons, you can see the ever-improving accuracy of shadows when the quality setting is raised step by step from Low to Ultra: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Comparisons\n\n\nUltra vs. High\nUltra vs. Medium\nUltra vs. Low\n\n\nHigh vs. Medium\nHigh vs. Low\nMedium vs. Low\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIn our final set of comparisons, Reflections enhance the walls, floor and ceiling, though not the windows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Comparisons\n\n\nUltra vs. High\nUltra vs. Medium\nUltra vs. Low\n\n\nHigh vs. Medium\nHigh vs. Low\nMedium vs. Low\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nElsewhere, reflections can be found on large bodies of water, like those shown later in this guide. In those instances, the Reflections setting has no impact on reflected world detail, or on dynamic reflections seen on the water's surface. Nor do they affect reflections on windows and other surfaces, which use cubemaps to approximate reflected detail at a minimal performance cost.\nPerformance: For a good balance between performance and quality, High is recommended. And while Low's minimal cost is appealing, its use isn't recommended due to the reduction in image quality on innumerable surfaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay Traced Reflections\nAs of January 9th, 2020, if you have the latest Game Ready Driver, Windows 10 update and game patch installed, you can enable realistic real-time ray traced reflections in Wolfenstein: Youngblood.\nNavigate to Options > Video > Advanced Settings, scroll down, switch Ray Traced Reflections on, and restart the game when prompted. At the same time, you can also enable NVIDIA DLSS, and select the DLSS Mode, boosting performance greatly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Wolfenstein: Youngblood running at high framerates on all GeForce RTX graphics cards, ray tracing is possible at all resolutions, even 4K. And with DLSS enabled, performance is accelerated by a significant degree, enabling you to enjoy massively improved ray-traced graphics at over 100 FPS at 4K, and at over 150 FPS at lower resolutions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith ray tracing enabled, every location with even a hint of reflectivity is enhanced by the new ray traced reflections, adding realistic, real-time detail to windows, water, objects, enemies, and much more. And with DLSS, not only do you get improved anti-aliasing, as detailed earlier, you also receive a massive increase to performance, offsetting the cost of the cutting-edge, high-fidelity reflections that improve fidelity, realism and immersion throughout the entireity of Wolfenstein: Youngblood. \n\n\n\n\n\nWith DLSS enabled, we recommend the GeForce RTX 2060 for max-setting 60 FPS+ 1920x1080 ray tracing, the GeForce RTX 2070 for 2560x1440, and the GeForce RTX 2080 for 3840x2160 (note, users with 6GB of VRAM may need to lower texture detail by one level).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResolution Scale\nUsing in-game options to adjust the rendering resolution is increasingly common, though Wolfenstein: Youngblood takes it a step further by offering players a dynamic option that temporarily decreases the resolution to return performance to an acceptable state. If you're on an entry-level machine, it's well worth enabling to avoid any nasty slowdowns during high intensity moments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShadows\nUnsurprisingly, the Shadows setting changes the quality and visibility of shadows. In Wolfenstein: Youngblood, only Uber and Ultra bear looking at, as they cast shadows across medium and long-range views, as demonstrated on the steps to the right of our interactive comparisons. And as you'll observe, only Uber has nicely-defined, highly detailed shadowing, making it the setting you ideally want to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Comparisons\n\n\nUber vs. Ultra\nUber vs. High\nUber vs. Medium\n\n\nUber vs. Low\nUltra vs. High\nUltra vs. Medium\n\n\nUltra vs. Low\nHigh vs. Medium\nHigh vs. Low\n\n\n\u00a0\nMedium vs. Low\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPerformance: Given the significant improvement to image quality, we can only recommend the use of Uber, which runs just 9 FPS slower than Low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharpening\nApplying post-process anti-aliasing, and downscaling the rendering resolution, makes gameplay blurrier. To counteract this loss of clarity, you can enable Sharpening via a slider. By default, the slider sits at the mid-point, 2.0, tackling most of the added blur without introducing additional aliasing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Comparisons (TSSAA 8TX Anti-Aliasing)\n\n\n4.0 vs. 3.0\n4.0 vs. 2.0\n4.0 vs. 1.0\n\n\n4.0 vs. Off\n3.0 vs. 2.0\n3.0 vs. 1.0\n\n\n3.0 vs. Off\n2.0 vs. 1.0\n2.0 vs. Off\n\n\n\u00a0\n1.0 vs. Off\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Comparisons (TSSAA 8TX Anti-Aliasing)\n\n\n4.0 vs. 3.0\n4.0 vs. 2.0\n4.0 vs. 1.0\n\n\n4.0 vs. Off\n3.0 vs. 2.0\n3.0 vs. 1.0\n\n\n3.0 vs. Off\n2.0 vs. 1.0\n2.0 vs. Off\n\n\n\u00a0\n1.0 vs. Off\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPerformance: Regardless of whether you apply a little or a lot of sharpening, the post-process effect has zero impact on performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolumetric Quality\nWolfenstein: Youngblood's volumetric effects are generally found where bright light illuminates an area, exemplified in the three examples below. By raising their fidelity from Medium to High, they blend with the scenery more realistically, eliminating the shadowy blemishes a keen observer may notice (the artifacts around the \"Halt\" pillar in our first comparison, for example):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance: During gameplay, you'd be hard-pushed to notice these blemishes, so if you need to extract additional performance to raise your framerate, dropping from High to Medium is an easy way to recover a few FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater Quality\nSet in and around Paris, there's a fair bit of water to be found in Wolfenstein: Youngblood, and using the Water Quality setting its fidelity can be adjusted. Specifically, items affected include, the quality of the water simulation, the quality of the reflections seen on the water's surface, the ability for water to affect the appearance of surrounding game elements, and whether the water's surface correctly blocks the display of underwater detail.\nIn our first set of comparisons, Ultra and High are virtually identical, with only a small change in sim quality visible towards the back of the scene. Medium further reduces sim quality and removes some distant and peripheral detail, while Low disables or reduces the quality of just about everything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Comparisons\n\n\nUltra vs. High\nUltra vs. Medium\nUltra vs. Low\n\n\nHigh vs. Medium\nHigh vs. Low\nMedium vs. Low\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nElsewhere, Ultra and High are indistinguishable, Medium affects shading and shadowing (around the boat, for example), and Low once again switches everything off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Comparisons\n\n\nUltra vs. High\nUltra vs. Medium\nUltra vs. Low\n\n\nHigh vs. Medium\nHigh vs. Low\nMedium vs. Low\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPerformance: If one ignores Low, the cost of Water Quality is comparatively low, though if you did need to save a few frames here and there, High offers nearly identical fidelity to Ultra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSettings Wrap-Up\nAs was the case with previous Wolfenstein games, framerates are sky high on most modern GPUs at 1920x1080 and 2560x1440, even with max settings enabled:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf, however, you want to make framerates even better, there are several quick changes you can make:\n\nDirectional Occlusion: Medium instead of High\nImage Streaming: Ultra instead of Uber\nMotion Blur: Turn down the quality, or disable entirely\nParticles: High instead of Ultra\nReflections: High instead of Ultra\nVolumetric Quality: Medium instead of High\nWater Quality: High instead of Ultra\n\nTogether, these changes boost performance in our benchmarks by nearly 20 FPS, and if you want to take things further you could use Ultra Shadows instead of Uber, turn lights down to High, and switch NVIDIA Adaptive Shading to Performance, though these additional changes would affect image quality.\nIn conclusion, virtually any supported GPU can attain a playable Wolfenstein: Youngblood experience, and a vast number of modern GPUs will deliver excellent fidelity and framerates at 1920x1080 and 2560x1440. But if you want that ultimate 4K experience, with everything set to 11, running at 60 FPS, you'll need, at minimum, an overclocked GeForce GTX 1080, a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, or a GeForce RTX 2060. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Experience: Optimal Playable Settings With A Single Click\nIf you don't wish to manually adjust settings, the best way to automatically configure Wolfenstein: Youngblood for a smooth, enjoyable experience is through GeForce Experience, an invaluable tool for all GeForce users. In addition to optimizing Wolfenstein: Youngblood and over 700 other games, the free GeForce Experience application can automatically update drivers and profiles, and record and stream gameplay with ShadowPlay.\nTaking into account your GPU and CPU, as well as many additional factors, GeForce Experience's game recommendations can be applied with a single click and are updated over time should developer patches and NVIDIA driver updates improve performance further still. This one-click solution is perfect for gamers who wish to simply play their games, and for those with little experience in configuring settings for an optimal experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready Wolfenstein: Youngblood Driver\nFor the best Wolfenstein: Youngblood experience we recommend updating your system with the Wolfenstein: Youngblood GeForce Game Ready Driver. This includes day-1 optimizations and fixes, and will ensure the best possible experience from the second you start playing. To download, head to the Drivers tab in GeForce Experience, or download manually from our website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Definitive Wolfenstein: Youngblood Experience\nWith faster framerates, higher levels of detail, realistic ray tracing, and performance-boosting NVIDIA DLSS, the PC edition of Wolfenstein: Youngblood offers gamers the definitive experience.\nTo get Wolfenstein: Youngblood, head to the Bethesda store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

To kick off the new year, we\u2019re excited to share that a ray-traced upgrade for Wolfenstein: Youngblood will be available the week of January 6th.\nWith ray tracing enabled, you can marvel at ray-traced reflections throughout each of Wolfenstein: Youngblood\u2019s levels. Any surface, if it\u2019s reflective, will feature accurate, high-quality, high-detail, lifelike reflections that elevate graphical fidelity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn action, ray tracing truly shines, with weapon effects reflecting, and dynamic real-time reflections being reflected on enemies and moving game elements. To see for yourself, check out the video below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enable Ray-Traced Reflections, ensure you have the latest Game Ready Driver, Windows 10 update and game patch installed (when released), and navigate to Options > Video > Advanced Settings. Scroll down, switch Ray Traced Reflections on, and restart the game when prompted. At the same time, you can also enable NVIDIA DLSS, and select the DLSS Mode, which offers players different balances between performance and quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith DLSS enabled, we recommend the GeForce RTX 2060 for 1920x1080, the GeForce RTX 2070 for 2560x1440, and the GeForce RTX 2080 for 3840x2160, enabling all GeForce RTX gamers to experience Wolfenstein: Youngblood\u2019s graphics and ray tracing at max settings at 60 FPS+ (note, users with 6GB of VRAM may need to lower texture detail by one level). And while we strive to support ray tracing on all GeForce GTX 1060 6GB and higher GPUs, Wolfenstein: Youngblood only supports ray tracing on GeForce RTX GPUs at this time due to several bugs and performance issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS Boosts Performance In Wolfenstein: Youngblood\nWhile ray tracing provides the next generation of visual fidelity in Wolfenstein: Youngblood, our DLSS technology accelerates performance so you can enjoy that fidelity at higher frame rates.\nAs an AI algorithm, DLSS is constantly learning and improving. Wolfenstein: Youngblood demonstrates this continuous improvement, with DLSS delivering big boosts in frame rates while providing similar image quality to native resolution with TAA.\nWhat this means for gamers is playing at higher output resolutions and quality settings with ray tracing enabled: in Wolfenstein: Youngblood, the GeForce RTX 2060 delivers over 80 FPS at 1920x1080 with RT and DLSS, and the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti exceeds 100 FPS at 4K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease set YouTube to 1080p60, instead of \u201cAuto\u201d, to see the video as intended\nWolfenstein: Youngblood brings three DLSS modes: Quality, Balanced, and Performance. These options control the DLSS rendering resolution, allowing you to choose the right balance of image quality and FPS. For 1920x1080 and 2560x1440, the default is set to Quality, with 4K set to Performance. Looking at performance with ray tracing on and DLSS at default settings, you\u2019ll enjoy solid gains across our entire RTX line-up:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS can improve performance by up to 2x in Wolfenstein: Youngblood\nMost importantly, DLSS achieves this performance while keeping image quality comparable to native resolutions with TAA. Let's look at two examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages captured at 1080p using DLSS Quality Mode\nAbove, DLSS maintains the crucial line work on the pipes and railings, the specular lights, the subtle gradients, and all the details. Here, it strengthens the grating on the right side of the screen and the pipes on the building in the center, which both look less detailed and apparent in the native image with TAA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages captured at 1080p using DLSS Quality Mode\nDLSS again maintains the crucial line work on the wiring and window sills, the specular lights, the shaded areas, and all the details. Here, it strengthens the window sills on the right side of the screen and the antennas on the top of the building, which are much more muted in the native image with TAA.\nWolfenstein: Youngblood highlights many of the improvements in image quality and performance we\u2019ve made with DLSS over the course 2019. As we begin 2020, we look forward to further improvements!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Highlights In Wolfenstein: Youngblood\nIn addition to adding ray tracing and DLSS, the new Wolfenstein: Youngblood update also includes NVIDIA Highlights. With the latest version of GeForce Experience installed, Highlights will automatically record your best gameplay moments, which you can later edit and upload to YouTube and social media.\nWhen you load the game post-patch, with the latest versions of our Game Ready Driver and GeForce Experience installed, you\u2019ll be prompted to enable NVIDIA Highlights. If you accidentally click \u201cNo,\u201d you can still switch it on by pressing Alt+Z in-game to load GeForce Experience\u2019s overlay, and then navigating to Settings > Highlights via the cog wheel icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor even more ray-traced games, stay tuned to GeForce.com. We\u2019ve already announced that several of this year\u2019s biggest games will benefit from ray tracing, and there are plenty more to come, too.

And for all the details, read on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax Frame Rate: Cap Frame Rates, Save Power, and More\nYou asked for it - the number one community requested feature is here!\nNow, you can set the max frame rate for a 3D application or game. This feature is particularly helpful when trying to save power, reduce system latency, or keep within a specific Variable Refresh Rate range on a G-SYNC or G-SYNC Compatible display.\n\nSaving Power: Enable Max Frame Rate (NVIDIA Control Panel > 3D Settings > Max Frame Rate) and set your power management mode to \u201cOptimal Power\u201d(NVIDIA Control Panel > 3D Settings > Power Management Mode). While in this mode, GPU frequency is reduced and uses less power. For laptop users, Max Frame Rate also works alongside with Battery Boost and Whisper Mode. If either of these modes are enabled at the same time as Max Frame Rate, the NVIDIA Control Panel will cap the framerate to the lowest of the limits.\nReducing System Latency: Enable Max Frame Rate and set your power management mode to \u201cPrefer maximum performance\u201d to reduce latency. While in this mode, the GPU is kept at higher frequencies to process frames as quickly as possible. To maximize latency reduction in GPU bound scenarios where FPS is consistent, set Max Frame Rate to a framerate slightly below the average FPS and turn Low Latency Mode to Ultra.\nStaying in VRR Range: Set the Max Frame Rate slightly below the maximum refresh rate of your display to stay within the Variable Refresh Rate range - providing a no-tear, low system latency experience! For the smoothest, no tear experience, set the low latency mode to Ultra and turn VSYNC on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Rate Supersampling: Improve Image Quality In VR\nVariable Rate Supersampling (VRSS) is a new technique to improve image quality in VR games. It uses NVIDIA Variable Rate Shading (VRS), a key feature in NVIDIA\u2019s Turing architecture, to dynamically apply up to 8x supersampling to the center of the VR headset display, where the eye is generally focused. It intelligently applies supersampling only when GPU headroom is available in order to maintain the VR headset\u2019s fixed FPS and ensure a smooth VR experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to alternative techniques that supersample the entire screen with large hits to frame rate, VRSS\u2019s adaptive use of Variable Rate Shading boosts image quality while staying about the typical 90Hz fixed refresh rate of the VR headset. In the VR game Boneworks, VRSS keeps FPS above 90, whereas a fullscreen 4x supersample drops frame rates to unplayable levels. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTested on GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, Intel Core i7-6700K, 32GB, Windows 10, HTC Vive Pro, CES 2020 Game Ready Driver\nTo enable VRSS, open the NVIDIA Control Panel and select Manage 3D Settings, then scroll to Virtual Reality \u2013 Variable Rate Supersampling, and change the setting to \u201cAdaptive\u201d. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor advanced users, the Control Panel also offers an \u2018Always On\u2019 setting that applies up to 8x supersampling regardless of performance. Note, this may bring your frame rate below the VR headset\u2019s refresh rate and impact your experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVRSS is supported by the driver--no game integration required--and can be applied to DX11 VR games or application that have forward renderers and support MSAA, and have been tested by NVIDIA. At the time of writing, over 20 games meet this criteria, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Battlewake Boneworks Eternity WarriorsTM VR Hot Dogs, Horseshoes and Hand Grenades In Death Job Simulator Killing Floor: Incursion L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files Lone Echo \nMercenary 2: Silicon Rising Pavlov VR Raw Data Rec Room Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality Robo Recall SairentoVR Serious Sam VR: The Last Hope Skeet: VR Target Shooting\nSpace Pirate Trainer Special Force VR: Infinity War Spiderman: Far from Home Spiderman: Homecoming \u2013 Virtual Reality Experience Talos Principle VR The Soulkeeper VR\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll continue to test more VR games and add them to future driver releases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Freestyle Splitscreen Filter To Showcase Your Creations\nIn over 700 games, you can press Alt+F3 to load NVIDIA Freestyle, a GeForce Experience feature that enables you to adjust the look and feel of your gameplay in real-time using post-process filters. And in any game with NVIDIA Ansel support, you can press Alt+F2 to frame and snap in-game photos with an incredible level of visual customization.\nWith our latest Game Ready Driver, we\u2019re releasing a new Splitscreen filter that allows you to showcase screenshots or videos of your creation with the modding community. You can split the screen, showcase a side-by-side comparison, or even blend filters using the gradient function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSplit the screen down the middle, or blend the two results together\nYou can also import hundreds of new customization filters from ReShade. Download our collection of curated ReShade filters, and extract into \u201cProgram Files\\NVIDIA Corporation\\Ansel\\Custom\u201d (typically on your C:\\ drive). If you install DCH drivers, instead of the standard Game Ready Driver, you may have to create this folder yourself. A larger selection of \u2018custom\u2019 filters can also be downloaded directly from ReShade\u2019s Github repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Sharpening Update Further Improves Your Experience\nWe recently introduced a standalone image sharpening filter built into the NVIDIA Control Panel, enabling you to improve image clarity in all DirectX 9-12, Vulkan and OpenGL games. Based on your feedback, now you can separately enable the GPU Scaling feature without image sharpening. Furthermore, custom resolutions are supported when you enable GPU Scaling.\nTo use image sharpening on your system, open the NVIDIA Control Panel and navigate to 3D Settings > Manage 3D Settings, select Image Sharpening, configure your options, hit OK, then click Apply on the bottom right of the Control Panel window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further info about Image Sharpening, and to see how it can improve your gaming, head here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport For Newly Validated G-SYNC Compatible Displays\nOur newest Game Ready Driver driver is adding support for an additional 8 G-SYNC Compatible displays, and we\u2019ve announced future support for a further 17, including new LG OLED 2020 BFGD TVs. These gaming monitors and TVs deliver a baseline Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) experience that makes your gaming smoother, clearer, and more enjoyable.\nWith the new and upcoming additions announced today, there are now 90 G-SYNC Compatible displays total, across all resolutions, sizes and refresh rates, giving gamers tons of choice when searching for the perfect display. For instance, today\u2019s new monitors range in size from 24.5 inches, all the way up to LG\u2019s 88 inch Z9 BFGD behemoth, which will deliver a jaw-dropping big-screen OLED VRR gaming experience in your living room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew G-SYNC Compatible Gaming Monitors, TVs and BFGDs\n\n\nGaming Monitors\n\n\nModel\nSize\nResolution\nGame Ready Driver Support\n\n\nAcer VG252QX\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nAcer XB253Q GX\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nAcer XV253QX\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nASUS VG259QM\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nComing soon\n\n\nASUS VG279QM\n27\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nASUS PG43UQ\n43\u201d\n3840x2160\nComing soon\n\n\nDell AW2521HF\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nComing soon\n\n\nDell AW2521HFL\n24.5\u201d\n1920x1080\nComing soon\n\n\nLG 38WN95C\n37.5\u201d\n3840x1600\nAvailable now\n\n\nLG 28GN950\n37.5\u201d\n3840x1600\nAvailable now\n\n\nLG 34GN850\n34\u201d\n3440x1440\nComing soon\n\n\nView Sonic XG270\n27\u201d\n1920x1080\nAvailable now\n\n\nBig Format Gaming Displays (BFGDs)\n\n\nLG 2020 BX\n55\u201d 65\u201d and 77\u201d\n3840x2160 \nLater this year\n\n\nLG 2020 CX\n48\u201d 55\u201d 65\u201d and 77\u201d\n3840x2160\nLater this year\n\n\nLG 2020 GX\n55\u201d 65\u201d and 77\u201d\n3840x2160\nLater this year\n\n\nLG 2020 ZX\n77\u201d and 88\u201d\n7680x4320 \nLater this year\n\n\nLG 2019 Z9\n88\u201d\n7680x4320\nAvailable now (TV firmware update required)\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor a complete list of all 164 G-SYNC, G-SYNC ULTIMATE, and G-SYNC Compatible gaming displays, check out our handy and frequently updated G-SYNC page, and head on over to our CES 2020 G-SYNC article to learn much more about new LG G-SYNC Compatible BFGD TVs, the new G-SYNC Compatible gaming monitors, and other G-SYNC advancements and enhancements coming down the pipe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Wolfenstein: Youngblood\u2019s Ray Tracing Update\nWolfenstein: Youngblood is receiving a large update later this week, that adds realistic ray tracing, performance-boosting NVIDIA DLSS, and NVIDIA Highlights, for automatically recording your best gameplay moments.\nFor a complete rundown of all the additions, and how they make your gaming experience better, check out our Wolfenstein: Youngblood article and the new video below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for full support for each feature, along with optimum performance, download and install our new Game Ready Driver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Quake II RTX v1.3 Update\nQuake II RTX is our ray-traced remaster of the beloved 1997 first-person shooter.

Nor will reading multiple books containing similar material. Truly mastering a skill or area of knowledge requires lots of information coming from a diversity of sources.\nThe same is true for autonomous driving and other AI-powered technologies.\nThe deep neural networks responsible for self-driving functions require exhaustive training. Both in situations they\u2019re likely to encounter during daily trips, as well as unusual ones they\u2019ll hopefully never come across. The key to success is making sure they\u2019re trained on the right data.\nWhat\u2019s the right data? Situations that are new or uncertain. No repeating the same scenarios over and over.\nActive learning is a training data selection method for machine learning that automatically finds this diverse data. It builds better datasets in a fraction of the time it would take for humans to curate.\n\nIt works by employing a trained model to go through collected data, flagging frames it\u2019s having trouble recognizing. These frames are then labeled by humans. Then they\u2019re added to the training data. This increases the model\u2019s accuracy for situations like perceiving objects in tough conditions.\nFinding the Needle in the Data Haystack\nThe amount of data needed to train an autonomous vehicle is enormous. Experts at RAND estimate that vehicles need 11 billion miles of driving to perform just 20 percent better than a human. This translates to more than 500 years of nonstop driving in the real world with a fleet of 100 cars.\nAnd not just any driving data will do. Effective training data must contain diverse and challenging conditions to ensure the car can drive safely.\nIf humans were to annotate this validation data to find these scenarios, the 100-car fleet driving just eight hours a day would require more than 1 million labelers to manage frames from all the cameras on the vehicle \u2014 a gargantuan effort. In addition to the labor cost, the compute and storage resources needed to train DNNs on this data would be infeasible.\nThe combination of data annotation and curation poses a major challenge to autonomous vehicle development. By applying AI to this process, it\u2019s possible to cut down on the time and cost spent on training, while also increasing the accuracy of the networks.\nWhy Active Learning\nThere are three common methods to selecting autonomous driving DNN training data. Random sampling extracts frames from a pool of data at uniform intervals, capturing the most common scenarios but likely leaving out rare patterns.\nMetadata-based sampling uses basic tags (for example, rain, night) to select data, making it easy to find commonly encountered difficult situations, but missing unique frames that aren\u2019t easily classified, like a tractor trailer or man on stilts crossing the road.\nCaption: Not all data is created equal. Example of a common highway scene (top left) vs. some unusual driving scenarios (top right: cyclist doing a wheelie at night, bottom left: truck towing trailer towing quad, bottom right: pedestrian on jumping stilts).\nFinally, manual curation uses metadata tags combined with visual browsing by human annotators \u2014 a time-consuming task that can be error-prone and difficult to scale.\nActive learning makes it possible to automate the selection process while choosing valuable data points. It starts by training a dedicated DNN on already-labeled data. The network then sorts through unlabeled data, selecting frames that it doesn\u2019t recognize, thereby finding data that would be challenging to the autonomous vehicle algorithm.\nThat data is then reviewed and labeled by human annotators, and added to the training data pool.\n\nActive learning has already shown it can improve the detection accuracy of self-driving DNNs over manual curation. In our own research, we\u2019ve found that the increase in precision when training with active learning data can be 3x for pedestrian detection and 4.4x for bicycle detection relative to the increase for data selected manually.\nAdvanced training methods like active learning, as well as transfer learning and federated learning, are most effective when run on a robust, scalable AI infrastructure. This makes it possible to manage massive amounts of data in parallel, shortening the development cycle.\nNVIDIA will be providing developers access to these training tools as well as our rich library of autonomous driving deep neural networks on the NVIDIA GPU Cloud container registry.\nLearn more about autonomous driving on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\n\n\nCategories: DRIVE Labs | Driving | ExplainerTags: Artificial Intelligence | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVGA debuted its new Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 KO here at CES 2020 with an enticing $299 price point, but you can pick the card up right now with a $20 instant rebate.\u00a0The 2060 KO's TU106 silicon operates at the reference 1650 MHz boost clock, but its support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing and DLSS will be key differentiating features over the RX 5600 XT.\u00a0(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Even at recommended pricing, the 2060 KO comes at a lower price than the reference RTX 2060 models at launch, placing it right in the pricing sweet spot (within $20) to challenge AMD's soon-to-debut RX 5600 XT.EVGA also has an overclocked RTX KO Ultra model that boosts up to 1755 MHz but lands at $319. This model also has a $20 instant rebate, at least for now. Both models come with 6GB of GDDR6 that communicates over a 192-bit bus.\u00a0(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Even though this is a lower-cost model, as you can see by the aluminum cooler, the design incorporates two fans and a full-length metal backplate that usually doesn't come with budget cards.\u00a0(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The board's other accommodations are also spartan: it comes with a single DisplayPort, HDMI, and DVI-D connection to help keep pricing in check.\u00a0EVGA feeds the card with a single 8-pin connector near the top of the aluminum fin stack.EVGA's Nvidia GeForce RTX KO cards are very competitively priced, but AMD's Radeon RX 5600 XT is still in the works, so aside from AMD's internal-benchmarks, we haven't put the cards to the test. If you're on the fence between picking up a value-centric RTX 2060 model or the RX 5600 XT, it's better to wait for reviews to land.\u00a0Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nEVGA\nHDMI\nGeForce\nrtx\nRadeon\nRadeon RX \nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (3)\n\n\n\nPaul AlcornSocial Links NavigationManaging Editor: News and Emerging TechPaul Alcorn is the Managing Editor: News and Emerging Tech for Tom's Hardware US.

In particular, the supercomputer was meant to be delivered with Tesla V100s; however the university has instead opted to hold off on delivery of their accelerators so that they can instead have NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation accelerators, which would make them among the first institutions to get the new accelerators.\nThe revelation is notable as NVIDIA has yet to announce any new Tesla accelerators or matching GPUs. The company\u2019s current Tesla V100s, based on the GV100 GPU, were first announced back at GTC 2017, so NVIDIA\u2019s compute accelerators are due for a major refresh. However it\u2019s a bit surprising to see anyone other than NVIDIA reveal any details about the new parts, given how buttoned-down the company normally is about such details.\nAt any rate, according to Indiana University the group expects to have their new accelerators installed by later this summer, with Big Red 200 running in CPU-only mode for now. The Next Platform article goes on to state that the newer accelerators will deliver \u201c70 percent to 75 percent more performance\u201d than NVIDIA\u2019s current V100 accelerators, which assuming it\u2019s accurate, would make for a hefty generational upgrade in performance. Though as always, with multiple modes of compute involved \u2013 everything from straight FP32 vector math to tensor operations to low precision operations \u2013 the devil is in the details on where those performance gains would most be realized.\nIn the meantime, NVIDIA\u2019s next GTC event is scheduled for mid-March. So if NVIDIA is planning to launch a new Tesla, then I would certainly expect to see it there.\n\n\n                Source:\n                The Next Platform\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n38 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nquorm - Friday, January 31, 2020 - link\nWould this be Turing or Ampere based?\n\n\n\nRyan Smith - Friday, January 31, 2020 - link\nOfficially, we don't know. However given the timing, I would imagine it would be based on NVIDIA's next-gen architecture.\n\n\n\nSaberKOG91 - Friday, January 31, 2020 - link\nI'm going to predict that this will be Ampere, but that Ampere will not see large changes in its design from Turing. It'll be a 7nm die shrink, with PCI-E 4.0 and faster RT performance. The number shaders will probably go up at the highest SKUs. Tensor Cores will be unchanged, but they'll market some new software feature to make them more useful in consumer workloads. And in order to make the launch spicier, Nvidia will announce something related to the display engine, most likely DisplayPort 2.0 or HDMI 2.1.\n\n\n\nKevin G - Friday, January 31, 2020 - link\nPCIe 4.0 is kinda of a surprise that it isn't active in Turing:  Volta supports the PHY speeds for nvLink to POWER9 chips.More ALUs and tensor cores is pretty much a given at the high end but I don't see much of change in the middle.  Rather nVidia is just going to reap the rewards of smaller die sizes to boost profit margins while the performance benefits stem mainly from clock speed increases.  Recall that the GV100 die is a record holder at 818 mm^2 with the TU102 coming in north of 650 mm^2.  Those are stupid large sizes and a die shrink is pretty much necessary to return to yield sanity.One variable is if the highend still throws a lot of silicon towards compute but follows a chiplet philosophy with it being comprised of more than one die + HBM memory.  This would be the more interesting solution in terms of design as the cost penalty has been paid for exotic packaging and design but scales up, very, very well.I think HDMI 2.1 is a sure thing at this juncture.  DP 2.0 is a bit of wild card and may only appear on the last of the chips introduced in this generation.  It'd work out in a weird way as the low end chips often get tasked for high resolution digital signage in the professional space.\n\n\n\nSaberKOG91 - Friday, January 31, 2020 - link\nJust to be clear, Tensor Cores don't exist as separate logic. They are just groups of 8 shaders being used together to carry out operations more efficiently than if they were doing the same calculations as individual instructions. Same thing goes for RT cores. They are just lots of shaders working together with a little bit of extra logic to carry out BVH efficiently.We won't see MCM for Ampere, that won't come until Hopper. \n\n\n\np1esk - Friday, January 31, 2020 - link\n> Tensor Cores don't exist as separate logicDo you have a link to back that up? You might be right, but I can't find it in Nvidia docs.\n\n\n\nYojimbo - Saturday, February 1, 2020 - link\nNVIDIA isn't going to public its trade secrets.\n\n\n\nYojimbo - Saturday, February 1, 2020 - link\nI think you went too far from the one extreme (believing the cores were entirely separate new blocks of transistors) to the other (seeming to believe that the addition of the tensor cores and RT cores is more or less trivial). Most likely the tensor cores are made by giving the shaders alternate, specialized data pathways to make efficient macro operations. But we don't know that for sure. As far as the RT cores, they haven't been around as long and I think even less is known about them. Ideally NVIDIA would want to reuse as much of the compute cores as possible. But, to my understanding, incoherent rays present a big problem for the standard data pathway of SIMD/SIMT hardware. The key thing for both the tensor cores and the RT cores are the data pathways: reducing the I/O bandwidth. But that is the key part of the engineering of the SIMT hardware, as well. It's relatively extremely easy to build number-crunching MAC units. It can be done cheaply and quickly with just a few engineers, as seen by all the AI chip startups and Tesla. But building a GPU that is able to efficiently use those units for general purpose compute in an offload model is a much bigger engineering challenge. The same can be said for the tensor cores and the RT cores. Those data pathways ARE the heart of the cores. They aren't just \"a little bit of extra logic\".\n\n\n\nSaberKOG91 - Saturday, February 1, 2020 - link\nI spent a lot of time reading up on it after our back and forth and found various developers talking about their experiences with Turing on Reddit and other places. These are folks who actually spend the time tracing wavefronts as they are scheduled and staring at assembly code. Their experience changed my mind, which happens occasionally :p These folks have been able to confirm that you can't use Tensor Cores and vanilla CUDA Cores simultaneously which pretty much proves that Nvidia is breaking each SM into 8 groups of 8 shaders, with each group able to be configured as a Tensor Core. As far as RT cores are concerned, they have also been able to confirm that using and RT at all means that the entire SM becomes unavailable for other operations. They also insist that there are new instructions for BVH that would require new hardware. BVH is the part of RT that can't efficiently be calculated by FP operations. Nvidia are using optimized hardware to do the BVH traversal and then using a compressed form of the traversed path to determine the sequence of vector transforms that are necessary to get from the source to the camera. The transforms and any subsequent application of material properties, are all SIMD optimized tasks. BVH relative to the rest of the computational resources within an SM is a tiny fraction of the area that is distributed across groups of shaders. Not some huge chunk like the Nvidia marketing material would have you believe. This is all smoke and mirrors, hiding the fact that Nvidia's approach to ray-tracing is actually quite similar to the one AMD has proposed where they also use the shaders for the bulk of the computation and use other hardware resources to perform the BVH.\n\n\n\nYojimbo - Saturday, February 1, 2020 - link\nInformative. The information on the compressed BVHs can be found in a 2017 NVIDIA research paper, BTW. But there is no guarantee that that is what Nvidia are using. I am skeptical that anyone can know because the underlying operations are not exposed. Did those forums explain exactly how they could determine that?I also think it's inappropriate both to call it smoke and mirrors and to say it is the same as an implementation that we have even less information on (AMD's).I don't think we know how much space the RT cores take up, and I don't think NVIDIA ever claimed any percentage of die space. People took Nvidia's schematics as representing relative die areas. I have argued with various people about that since Turing was introduced. I never took those schematics as meaning to be representative of die areas and I'm not sure why people did. I mean, look: https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13214/Turing_575...Would the NVLink block look just like the decode block, just like the tensor cores, etc? Then there were also the colored ones which were drawn as 1/3,1/3,1/3 of SMs, tensor cores, and RT cores. They were just meant to highlight features in an appealing way. They were never meant to give insight on the workings or layout of the chip or to make any claims of die area.Various parts of the chip likely need to be changed in order to accommodate what are almost certainly different memory access patterns. Perhaps they need a more general solution, or multiple pathways, changes in the cache, etc. Additionally, it will probably be 4 years between when NVIDIA introduced tensor cores and when AMD have an equivalent. If they were smoke and mirrors then AMD wouldn't have let their AI opportunities wallow in the mud for such a long time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)AMD recently launched the Radeon RX 5500 XT, which aims to capture the attention of mainstream gamers with a mid-range budget to spend on a GPU. Following our review, we already know it\u2019s not as powerful as Nvidia\u2019s GeForce GTX 1660, but can it offer enough value to make up for what it lacks in performance? Let\u2019s find out.It\u2019s an exciting time to be in the market for a new GPU, with several new products on the market in the last 12 months. Last year at this time, gamers were eagerly awaiting the reveal of AMD\u2019s Navi architecture and the new line of GPUs that would reinvigorate the company\u2019s Radeon Graphics brand. And Nvidia had not yet launched the RT and Tensor core-free 16-series Turing GPUs for the mid-range market.\u00a0Today, we\u2019ve got myriad options from team red, including the recently launched Radeon RX 5500 XT, which introduces Navi to the high-volume segment of the market, in the $200 price range. AMD is no stranger to this price point. For several generations, the Radeon team has focused its attention on mainstream cards like the RX 480, 580, and 590 (all based on the same Polaris architecture).\u00a0However, Nvidia\u2019s GeForce GTX 1660, which hit store shelves in March of 2019, is a strong contender for your gaming money. That GPU\u2019s successor, the GTX 1660 Super, is somewhat more expensive ($230+), but the original model is still readily available and often sells for $210 or less.\u00a0Now the question becomes, which card should you choose if you\u2019re in the market for a new GPU for roughly $200. We compared the features and benefits of the Radeon RX 5500 XT and the GeForce GTX 1660 in four categories -- featured technology, game performance, power consumption & heat output and Value -- to help you decide which of these two cards is right for you.Featured Technology\u00a0AMD\u2019s NAVI 14 XTX GPU features the same number of cores (1408) as the version of Nvidia\u2019s Turing TU116-300-A1 chip found in the GTX 1660. Although it operates at a higher frequency and produces higher peak floating-point performance (5.2 TFLOPS vs the GTX 1660\u2019s 5 TFLOPS).\u00a0AMD\u2019s NAVI 14 XTX features 6.4 billion transistors, which is 200 million fewer than the Turing TU116, but AMD crammed its chip into a much smaller package. Thanks to TSMC\u2019s 7nm finFET process, AMD\u2019s GPU fits on a 158 mm\u00b2 die. Turing GPUs are also manufactured on TSMC\u2019s finFET process, but Nvidia is working with a larger 12nm process. As a result, the TU116-300-A1 is nearly twice the size of NAVI 14 XTX at 284 mm\u00b2.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The RX 5500 XT also offers faster GDDR6 memory compared to the GTX 1660\u2019s GDDR5 memory modules. Nvidia does provide a larger 192-bit memory bus versus AMD\u2019s 128-bit memory bus configuration, but the faster memory more than makes up for the difference in bus size. Theoretically, the NAVI 14 XTX has 224 GB/s of memory bandwidth to work with, compared to the 192 GB/s that TU116 offers. The Radeon RX 5500 XT is available in 4GB and 8GB configurations. But for this comparison, we\u2019re focusing on the 8GB version. The GeForce GTX 1660 falls right in the middle, with 6GB of graphics memory.By the numbers, AMD\u2019s RX 5500 XT appears to be the stronger of the two GPUs. It\u2019s manufactured on a smaller, more efficient process, offers a higher base and boost clock speed, and has a higher theoretical performance limit. The higher capacity of faster GDDR6 memory also gives it a significant advantage.Swipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 Gigabyte RX 5500 XT Gaming OC 8GGigabyte GeForce GTX 1660 OC 6GArchitecture (GPU)RDNA (Navi 14 XTX)Turing (TU116)ALUs/Stream Processors14081408Peak FP32 Compute (Based on Typical Boost)5.2 TFLOPS5 TFLOPSTensor CoresN/AN/ART CoresN/AN/ATexture Units8888ROPs3248Base Clock Rate1685 MHz1530 MHzNvidia Boost/AMD Game Rate1737 MHz1785 MHzAMD Boost Rate1845 MHzN/AMemory Capacity8GB GDDR66GB GDDR5Memory Bus128-bit192-bitMemory Bandwidth224 GB/s192 GB/sL2 Cache2MB1.5MBTDP130W120WTransistor Count6.4 billion6.6 billionDie Size158 mm\u00b2284 mm\u00b2 AMD offers a variety of software features for the Radeon RX 5500 XT. The company\u2019s Radeon Software allows you to monitor your GPU\u2019s temperature, fan speed and voltage, adjust the graphics settings for your games, access performance reports and game states, and update your GPU drivers. The Radeon Software Adrenalin 2020 edition also lets launch games directly from the Radeon Software dashboard. It even offers integrated media capture and game streaming features, including screenshots, video, and instant gif capture as well as compatibility with many popular streaming services such as Twitch, YouTube, Mixer, Facebook and more.AMD also offers a feature called Game Boost, which monitors your framerate and dynamically adjusts the resolution of your games when it won\u2019t impact the visual experience to maximize performance.\u00a0The Radeon RX 5500 XT also supports a technology called Radeon Anti-Lag, which aims to reduce input lag by managing the queue of work sent to the CPU and ensuring that the CPU can\u2019t get ahead of the GPU. Also, Radeon Image Sharpening combines contrast-adaptive sharpening with GPU upscaling to produce crisper in-game visuals.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Experience software is a reasonable equivalent to AMD\u2019s Radeon Software Adrenalin. It enables you to keep your drivers up to date, offers performance-optimized game setting configurations, and allows you to launch your games from the GeForce Experience dashboard.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s software supports media capture and game streaming features that integrate with popular streaming platforms. The GeForce GTX 1660 takes full advantage of Nvidia\u2019s NVENC hardware encoder technology, which lowers the CPU overhead associated with software encoding. NVENC allows the CPU to send a single set of instructions to the GPU, which the GPU uses to output to your display and broadcast without impeding performance.GeForce Experience also includes Nvidia\u2019s advanced screenshot capture technology, called Nvidia Ansel, which allows you to capture extremely high-resolution (up to 33x 1080p) images of supported games (for regular OS captures, see how to take screenshots in Windows). Ansel also offers free-camera capture, which allows you to snap angles that aren\u2019t possible in-game, and the ability to capture 360-degree images. Ansel even supports RAW EXR output, which allows you to make changes to the image in post-processing, such as create HDR-enhanced images.\u00a0Both AMD and Nvidia offer support for adaptive display technology. The Radeon RX 5500 XT supports both FreeSync and FreeSync 2, whereas the GeForce 1660 is compatible with Nvidia\u2019s more-expensive G-Sync adaptive display technology. Nvidia also supports a select few FreeSync displays. And as for performance, both AMD and Nvidia offer dynamic clock speed boosting technologies that automatically overclock your GPU to maximize the capabilities of your hardware configuration.Winner: Tie. Both AMD and Nvidia offer compelling feature sets for their budget-minded options. Each card supports automated game optimization, game streaming, and driver update software. And they both support performance optimization features that maximize your gameplay experience.Gaming PerformanceWe tested 11 relatively demanding games on both GPUs with maximum and medium settings enabled. In The Division 2, Gears of War 5, Strange Brigade, Far Cry 5, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy XIV, Forza Horizon 4 and Battlefield V both cards managed to drive 60 fps average gameplay with the graphics settings maxed right out.\u00a0More demanding titles such as Borderlands 3 and Metro: Exodus, we had to drop the settings to medium to achieve the coveted bare minimum of 60 fps. Ghost Recon: Breakpoint was also very demanding, and our Radeon was unable to crest 50 fps at max settings. However, the GTX 1660 fell just a sliver short with an average framerate of 58.7 fps on max settings.\u00a0Both cards produce acceptable performance for 1080p gaming, but the GeForce outshined the Radeon by a small margin in all but two of our tests (at medium settings), but the two that AMD won were by less than a 1% margin. The GTX 1660 often held a 5% or better lead over the RX 5500 XT in our max settings tests.\u00a0Winner: Nvidia. Despite having the superior on-paper specifications and equivalent software features, in a competition of might, the GTX 1660 outperformed the RX 5500 XT in almost every test we threw at these two cards. Nvidia\u2019s configuration appears much more capable of handling games with maximum graphics settings enabled than AMD\u2019s. Strangely, the RX 5500 XT is a stronger competitor with medium settings, but why would you settle for medium if you don\u2019t need to?\u00a0Power Consumption and Heat Output\u00a0On the budget end of the GPU market, power consumption shouldn\u2019t really be much of concern. None of the GPUs of this calibre draw anywhere near enough power to make a significant difference in your system\u2019s configuration. Both AMD and Nvidia recommend at least a 450-watt power supply for their respective cards.AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 5500 XT features a TDP rating of 130w, whereas Nvidia\u2019s GeForce GTX 1660 includes a TDP rating of 120w. In practice, the Radeon GPUs actually draw quite a bit less than 130 watts, except under extreme loads. We tested two examples of the RX 5500 XT, a 4GB Sapphire and an 8GB Gigabyte card, and we found that, in-game, the AMD card will average close to 100w.\u00a0The Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1660 sample that we tested in March 2019 needed an average of 126 watts, and peaked at 134 watts, and the Zotac model that we used in the Radeon RX 5500 XT review pulled between 110 and 120 watts in our Metro: Exodus power test.\u00a0Interestingly, the Zotac GeForce GTX 1660 peaked around 100w in our Furmark stress test, whereas the Gigabyte sample drew around 130w for this test. Both the Gigabyte and Sapphire Radeon cards topped 120w in this test, with the Sapphire model touching 136w at its peak.\u00a0You likely won\u2019t be concerned with the power requirements for these cards, but higher power draw does equate to higher heat output, which is likely of higher concern to you.\u00a0Our Gigabyte RX 5500 XT OC 8G proved to be one of the coolest-running GPUs that we\u2019ve seen in this segment. Following three passes of our Metro: Exodus test, the data showed that the GPU never exceeded 63C. Our tests with Gigabyte\u2019s GeForce GTX 1660 OC 6G showed that it peaked at a 68C. It\u2019s also worth noting that the fans on the GeForce were spinning at 2000 rpm, and the Radeon card spun at a leisurely 1800 rpm.Winner: AMD. The power requirements for either of these cards is low enough to be negligible. However, the low heat output from the Radeon RX 5500 XT, likely aided by its smaller 7nm process, gives AMD a leg up in this category.Value Proposition\u00a0Comparing the value of the Radeon RX 5500 XT 8GB to the GeForce GTX 1660 is a somewhat challenging task. If you compare these cards at the same price, the GeForce GTX 1660 is the clear winner.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s offering outperforms the competition handily in gaming tests, which if we\u2019re honest is kind of the point of a graphics card\u2014especially in the $200 range. However, AMD\u2019s option still delivers acceptable performance and costs a few dollars less, which somewhat evens that playing field. Where the Radeon maybe 5% to 10% cheaper, it\u2019s also 5% to 10% slower in many cases.Winner: Nvidia. We can\u2019t call the Radeon RX 5500 XT a bad deal. It\u2019s far and away a better card than you would have bought for the same price a year ago. However, for just a few dollars more you can get better gaming performance from a GeForce GTX 1660.\u00a0Swipe to scroll horizontallyRoundNvidia GeForce GTX 1660 6GBAMD Radeon RX 5500 XT 8GBFeatured Technology\u2717\u2717Gaming Performance\u2717Row 1 - Cell 2 Power ConsumptionRow 2 - Cell 1 \u2717Value Proposition\u2717Row 3 - Cell 2 Total32 Bottom LineWhat a difference a year can make. The last time we did a showdown of the mid-range GPUs, we put the Radeon RX 590 toe to toe with the GeForce GTX 1060 and AMD\u2019s card was the definitive winner. This time around, the tables have turned and Nvidia has captured the mid-tier crown back from AMD.\u00a0But pricing is close and can always change. So if you\u2019re reading this in the weeks and months after first publication (in mid-January 2020), make sure to check your favorite online store to see if the value balance has shifted -- or if something better has come along. Like most areas of PC tech, price cuts and new products are always coming along to change the battle for your hard-earned component dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\ngtx\nGeForce\nGeForce GTX 1660\nRadeon\nRadeon RX \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (18)\n\n\n\nKevin CarbotteSocial Links Navigation\u00a0Kevin Carbotte is a contributing writer for Tom's Hardware who primarily covers VR and AR hardware.

It will be a better card in the long run, as even the 6gb on the 1660 can be a bottleneck in some titles (the 6gb VRAM is also something i'm not keen on with the new RX 5600). If you plan to upgrade every two years, meh.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncryoburner\n\n\nWe can\u2019t call the Radeon RX 5500 XT a bad deal. It\u2019s far and away a better card than you would have bought for the same price a year ago.That's simply not true. A year ago, you could get an RX 580 8GB for about the same price, and a 5500 XT isn't much more than 5% faster. Even 3 years ago, one could get an RX 480 8GB for around $200, which is within 15% of the performance of this card. The only notable advantage the 5500 XT has over those older models is improved power efficiency. The performance gains are relatively poor after 3 years, and even Nvidia's lineup is offering better performance for the money right now.\n\nAlistairAB said:What the heck? You tested the non-super 1660, and the 8GB RX 5500? The two cards nobody should buy?\n\nTest the 1650 Super and the RX 5500 4GB next time. Useless article. If you're not getting one of those, you should be looking at a 1660 Super, or RX 5600 or 5700.Why should no one buy a 1660? Keep in mind that while the 1660 SUPER might perform around 10% faster, at current prices (online, in the US), it also typically costs at least 10% more, so both versions of the card tend to offer similar value for someone buying a graphics card as an upgrade.\n\nAnd in the case of the 5500 XT, the 4GB model's limited VRAM is a notable concern, particularly since the card only uses an x8 PCIe connection, causing performance to tank more than usual when VRAM is exceeded. Neither version of the 5500 XT is all that competitively priced right now. The 4GB model needs to be priced lower than a 1650 SUPER, not higher, and the 8GB model needs to be priced lower than a 1660, which is simply a faster card. Both versions of the card should have launched for around $20 less than they did.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndorsai\n\n\nPersonally I would hesitate to try multiplayer gaming on either of these cards...they seem more low end than mainstream.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalextheblue\n\n\nI'd like to see those cards tested battling while overclocked. IMHO the 5500 XT is a bit overpriced, but they seem to have decent headroom.\nAlistairAB said:Test the 1650 Super and the RX 5500 4GB next time. Useless article. If you're not getting one of those, you should be looking at a 1660 Super, or RX 5600 or 5700.This has already been discussed. If you're running these kinds of settings, there are already games that are hindered by the lack of RAM. The is only going to get worse. This problem is exacerbated if you're on a PCIe 3.0 platform, since Navi 14 only has 8 lanes.\n\nBut yes, if you can get a good deal on one, the Super offers superb bang for the buck.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNP\n\n\nStrangely, the RX 5500 XT is a stronger competitor with medium settings, but why would you settle for medium if you don\u2019t need to? \nI own an nVidia, and will probably buy another geforce card when I need to upgrade, but I still don't under why you assume the answer would be \"Obviously for no reason\" ? \n\nI think there is valid reason for not settling for, but deliberately picking medium. You pick medium, because the added frame rates allow you to perform better in any competitive online FPS you intend to play with either RX 5500XT or GTX 1600 range gpu. \n\nThat either is or is not a consideration for you, but it is nevertheless among considerations that many people would regard of key importance when buying a new gpu.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvalidError\n\n\nThe RX5500 is a pitiful upgrade over what was already available for sub-$200 three years ago. If there was true competition between AMD and Nvidia GPUs, the 4GB RX5500 would be a $120 GPU.\n\nAlso, most people who buy RX5500-class GPUs will be stuck on PCIe 3.0x8 for the foreseeable future where it incurs sometimes significant performance penalties, which makes it a \"nope\" GPU in my book.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmitch074\n\n\nInvalidError said:The RX5500 is a pitiful upgrade over what was already available for sub-$200 three years ago.

By then its price may have dropped a bit.\n\nIn the mean time, I'll pray the my reference RX480 8Gb doesn't fry - still going strong since I bought it in summer 2016.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 18 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Best Photoshop Alternatives Tested: Image Editing for Free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the most out of your processor with this motherboard's Turbo Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAwekeys Antiques Metal keycaps are Viking-themed luxury for your fingertips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD RDNA 4 and Radeon RX 9000-series GPUs start at $549: Specifications, release date, pricing, and more revealed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTested: Intel's Arrow Lake 140T iGPU mostly maintains an edge over AMD's older 880m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia DLSS4, MFG, and full ray tracing tested on RTX 5090 and RTX 5080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m typing this on the world\u2019s largest keyboard, a 178-key beast designed to make you more productive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMontech\u2019s Heritage Pro case is like a designer handbag for your Micro ATX PC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel Battlemage and Arc B-series GPUs: Specifications, release dates, pricing, and everything we know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverclocking Arrow Lake: How I set world records, plus simple tips to push your Core Ultra to the limit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

At NVIDIA, we\u2019re committed to helping esports athletes and competitive gamers unlock their potential and hit those unbelievable shots. Today, we\u2019re announcing the world's fastest esports display, running at 360Hz, powered by NVIDIA G-SYNC.\nOur partners at ASUS have implemented this technology, together with AU Optronics\u2019s panel, in the ASUS ROG Swift 360Hz esports display. This no compromises display offers a 360Hz refresh rate for unparalleled smoothness, lower system latency for faster reaction times, and a 24.5 inch 1080p form factor to keep every pixel of action in your field of view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn0thing, five-time CS:GO Champion said, \u201cWhen I switched between 240 and 360, I could immediately tell that there was a difference\u201d, after experiencing the smoothness and clarity of 360Hz gaming for the first time. Adding, \u201cThis display is great for gamers who want to maximize their potential.\u201d\nFirst introduced in 2013, NVIDIA G-SYNC is best known for its innovative Variable Refresh Rate technology that eliminates tearing by synchronizing the refresh rate of the display with the GPU\u2019s frame rate. Since then, G-SYNC processors have added new display technologies to accelerate esports panels, including dynamic overdrive to enhance player perception, custom-tuned firmware to improve image quality for better target acquisition, and now 360Hz refresh rates for rapid reaction time.\nWhile esports pros previously accepted frame tearing on their display in order to avoid waiting for the next frame to update, with G-SYNC\u2019s 360Hz and Variable Refresh Rate technologies, frames refresh so fast--in less than 3ms--esports pros can get both tear-free frames and incredibly low latency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s focus on delivering industry leading esports products has been guided by deep research in understanding the relationship between PC technology and player competitiveness. Over the last few years, our research team has conducted studies to understand how FPS, Hz, and system latency affect aiming tasks in first person shooters. Based on our research, which was published at SIGGRAPH ASIA in November 2019, we found that higher FPS/HZ and lower system latency makes a significant difference:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd to end system latency measured in ms using click to photon response time in Overwatch. Source: NVIDIA\nThis isn\u2019t a GPU performance chart -- this is a raw player skill benefit. In the world of competitive sports, a 4% difference is a game changer. To put this into context, in the 2016 Summer Olympics, 1% determined the difference between silver and gold in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s 100m and 200m dashes.\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive, Rainbow Six: Siege, Overwatch, and Fortnite are just a few of the competitive games that can achieve 360 FPS on GeForce RTX hardware, enabling gamers to take full advantage of the new 360Hz displays, and to benefit from the improvements our research found.\nTo demonstrate the clarity and enhanced perception of our new 360Hz display technology, we partnered with BlurBusters, a website that\u2019s been helping people get crisper gaming experiences for over a decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHead here to see and try the demo\nThis demo uses images from DOTA 2 to help illustrate the clarity benefits 360Hz provides. As the image scrolls past, the scene, nameplates, and all the action is much much clearer at 360Hz, making it far easier to stay focused on your opponents.\n360Hz also helps you get on target faster by reducing system latency and improving target acquisition through increased display clarity. We worked with Yesber from YPRAC to create an aiming task that showcases these benefits. The objective of this aiming task is to find and eliminate as many targets as possible in 45 seconds. The targets appear out of your field of view, so you will be forced to rotate and find them - combining target acquisition with aiming skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know that the benefits are not as easily seen online when watching a video, as was the case with HDR and VRR, which is why we\u2019ve taken our suite of 360Hz demos to CES, enabling tech press and partners from around the world to experience this technology for themselves.\nLook for coverage from your favorite channels and websites over the coming week and stay tuned for more information on pricing and availability for the ASUS ROG Swift 360Hz G-SYNC display coming later this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

There\u2019s all the standard transport buttons (play/pause, fast forward, rewind, etc.), plus a dedicated shortcut key for Netflix.\nIn addition, the new remote features backlit buttons (helpful when enjoying a movie in the dark), a build-in lost remote locator, and a microphone for voice search and control (Google Assistant is built in to Shield TV).\nBest of all, current NVIDIA Shield TV owners can now buy this updated remote separately.\nThankfully, unlike in the past, this one is reasonably priced.\nYou can buy it now from Amazon.\nIf you\u2019re still shopping for a Shield TV, you can find two new 2019 models for sale that both include the updated remote control:\n\n\nNVIDIA Shield TV 4K HDR Streaming Media Player\n\n\nNVIDIA Shield TV Pro 4K HDR Streaming Media Player\n\n\nAlso consider:\n\n\nApple TV 4K\n\n\n\n\n\nSOURCENVIDIA TAGSAppleGoogle \nMike CarrallMike Carrall is a tech executive by day in Silicon Valley who writes under a pseudonym.

When all you need is YouTube, Netflix and\u00a0Disney Plus, it's overkill. Nonetheless it remains a popular choice for geeks and gamers who want more extras and capabilities, including 4K HDR (now with Dolby Vision), built-in Google Assistant and an array of gaming options that makes\u00a0Apple Arcade\u00a0seem like a one-trick pony, especially for PC gamers.    7.7 Nvidia Shield 2  $150 at Best Buy$150 at B&H Photo-Video$150 at Amazon  Like \n              Cutting-edge streaming with 4K AI upscaling, Dolby Vision\r\n\n            \n              Native Android, cloud gaming and Steam Link options\r\n\n            \n              Improved Android TV interface with Google Assistant\n             Don't like \n              Expensive\r\n\n            \n              Some issues understanding voice commands\r\n\n            \n              Slower than Roku to launch Netflix\n             In addition to the GeForce Now game streaming platform, Android games store and GameStream ability for compatible PCs, another extra makes this device a head-turner for gamers:\u00a0\n  Steam\n. As the Steam Link now lives on in software only, the Shield TV is one of the \"cheapest\" ways to get PC games from Steam to your TV screen. Yes, the Shield TV costs more than most competitors, and the price is tough to justify for \"just a streamer,\" but once again geeks and gamers will find plenty of reasons to splurge.Is it a cigar? Or a USB power bank?      Sarah Tew/CNETThe latest Nvidia Shield TV comes in two versions: the the familiar-looking Pro version ($200) basic Shield TV reviewed here. The Shield TV is the most covert device I can recall from the \n  gaming\n company. It's roughly the size and shape of a runner's baton; at 6.5 inches in length the all-black Shield TV is designed to be tucked behind your television -- and there's not even any lights to tell you it's on. If I were a marketing guy, I'd call this the \"Shield Ghost\" or the \"Ninja\" or something.The Shield TV comes with a total of four ports, with two at each end -- one side houses a standard power socket (no adapter required) and Ethernet, while the other includes an HDMI port and a microSD expansion slot. There is a single reset button, but sadly, there's no room for USB.\u00a0     The end of the 6.5-inch-long device features an HDMI port and a microSD card slot\u00a0 Sarah Tew/CNETUnlike in previous years there's no controller in the box, but you can connect compatible PS4/Xbox One/PC controllers over \n  Bluetooth\n. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0As far as speeds and feeds are concerned, this features an Nvidia Tegra X1+ processor with a 256-core Nvidia GPU and 2GB of RAM. It offers 4K compatibility with both Dolby Vision and HDR10 as well as Dolby Atmos and DTS:X pass-through. The device is also able to upscale streamed content using its proprietary AI upscaling.Here's how the two new Shields compare with the previous version from 2017.Nvidia Shields compared    Shield TV (2019)Shield TV Pro (2019)Shield TV (2017)Price $150$200$200Shape CylinderBoxBoxProcessor Tegra X1+Tegra X1+Tegra X1RAM 2GB3GB3GBStorage 8GB16GB16GBUSB 3.0 ports No22Wi-Fi and Ethernet YesYesYesAndroid TV with Google Assistant YesYesYesPlex Media Server NoYesYes4K HDR video YesYesYesDolby Vision YesYesNoDolby Atmos YesYesPass-through onlyAI upscaling YesYesNoBacklit remote with remote finder YesYesNoGame controller OptionalOptionalIncluded          Sarah Tew/CNETThe remote that comes in the package is completely rebuilt from before and features a new, Toblerone-like triangular shape. While on paper this sounds pretty terrible, it's actually quite comfortable to hold. The button array now includes dedicated volume, settings and \n  Netflix\n shortcuts. It's a Bluetooth device and also comes with a remote finder (though it's menu-based and not a physical button like on the Roku Ultra remote). If you have an older Shield, you can add the new remote for an extra $30.\u00a0Having tested and used Google Assistant and \n  Amazon\n Alexa devices for several years now I'm used to voice assistants getting things wrong, but sadly the tiny mic on the Shield TV remote is one of the worst yet. For instance, if I asked for \"Steam\" -- which most gamers would as users of this device -- each and every time the Shield heard me say \"theme.\" Also, my request for the other Nvidia feature \"Gamestream\" was hilariously misheard as \"famous train.\"Android TV: Google's best TV menus yet      Screenshot: Ty Pendlebury/CNETAs a user of the Sony NSX-GT1 TV, I've seen Google's TV operating systems evolve quite a bit. With the latest 8.x version of Android TV, the Shield is the most user-friendly Google streaming device I've yet experienced. The interface now focuses on content -- in a similar, but less spammy way to the \n  Fire TV\n interface. Users do have some control over the individual columns, as well as the first line of app shortcuts.Android TV may not be at the top of mind for people who don't own a recent \n  Sony\n TV, for example, but the system offers almost every app available, including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Spotify and Disney Plus. Back when we reviewed the 2017 Shield there were quite a few apps missing, but this has since been addressed with big ones like NHL, NBC and Amazon Music now available. The MIA list still includes AT&T TV Now, Nick Jr., USA Now and Napster, however.The interface boasts an attractive high-contrast look, and with some tweaking is easy to navigate. One annoyance of previous Google interfaces -- having to leave an app to adjust settings -- is avoided on the Shield TV with the dedicated settings button and sidebar. \u00a0Shield TV, gaming and youThe Shield includes the beta GeForce Now app for streaming cloud games (also available on mobile devices, PCs or Macs) and the GameStream app for streaming from a Nvidia-toting gaming PC.\u00a0 Then there's the Steam Link app, which doesn't require an Nvidia graphics card.I still use the Steam Link box to stream games from my PC and so was looking forward to seeing the corresponding Nvidia solution: an app running on the Shield. I spent some time setting up both Gamestream and GeForce Now and found them much less user friendly than Steam Link -- for instance, I experienced numerous system time-outs and had to make multiple attempts at creating user accounts -- despite using a wired connection. But when I finally got it working, the first thing it did was suggest I play Steam games!Even if the game was listed as a GeForce Now title, the shortcuts kept directing me to the Steam store to buy it. Once I finally managed to find one that was streaming -- Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed -- I found that the system functioned as if I were a playing local game. It may not be the most taxing game out there, but the controls, using an Xbox One joypad, were responsive and I never experienced any gameplay lag.\u00a0Using the ShieldLike a lot of recent streaming boxes, the Shield TV keeps recently used apps in its buffer memory, so if you only use one streaming service, you'll find that it loads almost instantaneously each time. When testing Netflix, for example, if I closed and opened it again, it loaded straight away. To test load times properly I opened a different program between each of the three different timing runs. As expected from a Google device, the Shield was able to load YouTube in a very quick 5.7 seconds, but its Netflix load time was one of the slowest I've seen in a dedicated streamer.\u00a0Streaming loading times    NetflixYouTubeRestartRoku Streaming Stick Plus 2.928.8338Roku Ultra 2019 27.2130.06Nvidia Shield TV 8.195.758.79    The interface performs in a similar way to other streamers, even if the voice search doesn't always integrate as well as it should. For instance, most apps have a search box but they don't automatically correspond with voice commands initiated via the handset -- if you press the mic, the icon still appears as a separate search in the bottom of the screen.\u00a0I also checked out the image quality of the various apps, with particular attention on Nvidia's AI upscaling feature. HDR content from Netflix (Lost in Space) and Disney Plus (The Mandalorian) looked as impressive as I expected.\u00a0The effects of AI upscaling were more or less noticeable depending on the content, and I found it worked best on YouTube clips. On a Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon clip, for example, the building backdrop and microphone were enhanced and the screen made more HDR-like with the AI settings enabled. These differences were apparent from a normal 6-foot seating distance, while smaller improvements such as facial detail were only visible from a distance of a couple of feet in its default Medium setting. I also noticed some moire in the YouTube clip, but the AI engine didn't clean this up or deal with any other video artifacts like compression. In other words, it's a subtle difference and won't work miracles.Should you buy it?The Shield TV is a very capable streamer and it would also make a decent travel unit due to its portable shape and easy-to-find power connector. Is it the ultimate gaming streamer? No, but it's definitely worth a look if you're a PC gamer. It's fun, it's compact and offers some unique image quality functions that set it apart from cheaper devices like the Roku Streaming Stick Plus and the expensive options like the Apple TV 4K.     7.7 Nvidia Shield 2  $150 at Best Buy  Score Breakdown Design  8Ecosystem  8Features  9Performance  7Value  7              Your guideto a better future DealsReviewsBest ProductsGift GuideCouponsVideosSoftware Downloads About CNET Press Room Newsletters Licensing Sitemap Careers Accessibility Cookie Settings Privacy Policy  Terms of Use Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information instagram youtube tiktok facebook x flipboard  US France Germany Japan Korea \n  \u00a9 2025 CNET, a Ziff Davis company.\n  All rights reserved.\n   \n\n\n",

According to The Next Platform (via Videocardz), Indiana University will be deploying its latest Big Red 200 supercomputer which is reported to be powered by NVIDIA's next-generation GPUs.\nNVIDIA's Next-Gen 'Ampere' GPUs To Power Big Red 200 Supercomputer This Summer, Up To 75% Faster Than Existing HPC GPUs\nAccording to Brad Wheeler, the vice president of information technology and chief information officer at Indiana University, the Big Red 200 supercomputer commemorates the university's 200th anniversary. The Big Red 200 supercomputer is stated to support both conventional HPC and also AI-specific workloads. The supercomputer will be designed in two phases, the first part which is already operational consists of 672 dual-socket nodes which feature AMD's EPYC 7742 processors that rock 64 cores and 128 threads. that's a total of 86,016 cores and 172,032 threads available on the entire supercomputer.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostThe second phase of the supercomputer is the more interesting one. Once it goes operational this summer, it would not only bring more EPYC 7742 processors in operation, but would also feature NVIDIA's next-gen GPUs. The interesting part is that Big Red 200 was originally slated to feature Tesla V100 GPUs based on the Volta architecture, but according to Wheeler, they planned to wait a bit longer for NVIDIA's next-generation parts and that's when the idea to develop the system in two phases arose.\n\nInitially, the peak performance of the Big Red 200 supercomputer was suggested around a total of 5.9 petaflops but now it is expected to deliver 8 petaflops of compute horsepower. Each node in the Big Red 200 supercomputer will be equipped with either one or two next-gen NVIDIA GPUs.\nIt is also mentioned that Big Red 200 gained an additional 2 petaflops of performance even though it uses a smaller number of GPUs than the Volta V100 based design. The reason for going with a smaller number of next-generation GPUs is simply because they offer 70-75% better performance than existing parts and by that, we are comparing it with Volta-based Tesla V100 GPUs as no Tesla GPUs based on the Turing GPU architecture, aside from the Tesla T4, exist.\n\nVolta and Turing share lots of similarities with Turing offering a more refined version of Volta. If the 70-75% performance increase figures are close to the real thing, then we can definitely see close to 50% performance gain or even higher in the consumer variants. Do note that previous rumors had already said that NVIDIA's next-generation GPUs would offer 50% extra performance while being twice as efficient as Turing GPUs.\nIn a\u00a0previous interview,\u00a0NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, had confirmed that the majority of the orders for their next-generation 7nm GPU will be handled by TSMC while a small portion will be sent to Samsung for production. Finally, Jensen was asked about the launch timeframe of their next-generation 7nm GPU, but he simply replied that it wasn't a convenient time for them to disclose any date at the moment. We know from a\u00a0recent interview with NVIDIA's CFO, Colette Kress, that they want to surprise everyone with their own 7nm GPU announcement, but they are waiting for the right time to do so.\n\nThe Ampere GPU wouldn't only\u00a0improve the rasterization and shading performance, but also deliver huge uplifts over Turing in ray tracing performance. Since Turing was the 1st generation implementation of ray tracing on NVIDIA graphics cards, Ampere will further optimize and is expected to offer more ray tracing hardware onboard in the form of RT and Tensor cores.\nWe have already seen the first implementation of NVIDIA's next-generation 7nm Ampere GPU in the\u00a0Orin SOC. Ampere is definitely something we all should get excited about, but 2H 2020 is still a long way to go. With Big Red 200 becoming operational in summer, we can definitely see an official announcement for NVIDIA's next-gen Ampere GPUs at GTC 2020.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n82\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n70\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n21\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n21\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n13\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Just in time for next week\u2019s launch, the company and its partners have begun cutting the prices of their GeForce RTX 2060 cards. This includes NVIDIA\u2019s own Founders Edition card as well, with the company cutting the price of that benchmark card to $299.\nThe timing, of course, is anything but coincidental. AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 5600 XT announcement back at CES already revealed a significant portion of AMD\u2019s hand, particularly that the card would launch at $279, and that the company is expecting the card to outperform NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, their own $279 card. Assuming AMD\u2019s performance claims hold true, then NVIDIA would need to act; either the GTX 1660 Ti or RTX 2060 would need to come down in price for NVIDIA to maintain a competitive edge, and the latter is the direction NVIDIA has decided to take.\nEven at $299, the RTX 2060 is not going to be a precise counter to the $279 RX 5600 XT. But the junior TU106 card packs more performance than the GTX 1660 Ti, as well as the complete Turing architecture feature set, making it the strongest hand NVIDIA can play. As always, we\u2019ll see where things land on Tuesday for both AMD and NVIDIA, but it should make for an interesting fight.\nOn the whole, price adjustments for NVIDIA are quite rare. While prices of NVIDIA cards do tend to fall over time, the company seldom adjusts official pricing in any capacity. Even this week\u2019s cuts aren\u2019t wholly official; NVIDIA hasn\u2019t announced a price cut so much as sent out a reminder that RTX 2060 cards can be found for $299. But regardless, where NVIDIA leads on pricing their board partners will follow, and EVGA, Gigabyte, and others have already begun releasing new cards and shifting the pricing of other cards to reach the new $299 level.\n\n\n\nQ1 2020 GPU Pricing Comparison\n\n\nAMD\nPrice\nNVIDIA\n\n\nRadeon RX 5700\n$329\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n$299\nGeForce RTX 2060\n\n\nRadeon RX 5600 XT\n$279\nGeForce GTX 1660 Ti\n\n\n\u00a0\n$229\nGeForce GTX 1660 Super\n\n\nRadeon RX 5500 XT 8GB\n$199/$209\nGeForce GTX 1660\n\n\nRadeon RX 5500 XT 4GB\n$169/$159\nGeForce GTX 1650 Super\n\n\n\u00a0\n$149\nGeForce GTX 1650\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n60 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\n0ldman79 - Thursday, January 16, 2020 - link\nI've been waiting on the GPU price war.Looks like the first volley has been fired.\n\n\n\nTEAMSWITCHER - Thursday, January 16, 2020 - link\nThis is more of the same..  Nvidia is leveraging their commanding lead to force AMD into price cuts on products they are trying to bring to market.  Profit for companies is like Oxygen for athletes.  Nvidia is suffocating AMD's Radeon \"Technology\" Group.\n\n\n\nKjella - Thursday, January 16, 2020 - link\nWith the CPU side fixed AMD is going to take back market share in laptops giving them plenty reason and breathing room to fund further Radeon development. Obviously nVidia is going to rake in profits where AMD lacks a competing product and dump prices when they make one, but the danger of AMD suffocating seems over. They're not losing money anymore.\n\n\n\nneblogai - Thursday, January 16, 2020 - link\n2060 is made out of a large 445mm2 die- so if they try to suffocate AMD with it, they will also suffocate themselves.\n\n\n\nGreenReaper - Thursday, January 16, 2020 - link\nWorth it to take out AMD. Red vs. Green comes to its inevitable conclusion.\n\n\n\nnt300 - Friday, January 17, 2020 - link\nAMD should easily tripple it's GPU market share within 2020 and 2021 as RDNA2 is looking really great.FYI, AMD's APU's are stronger than ever, AMD ain't going to go anywhere but UP. \n\n\n\nZipSpeed - Friday, January 17, 2020 - link\nRadeon isn't going anywhere.  Especially with Sony and Microsoft paying the R&D for the next-gen consoles, it's only natural this R&D will migrate towards the PC side.  They managed to claw back some marketshare from Nvidia too with the RDNA cards.  At least AMD isn't on life support anymore, and lets be candid, the market NEEDS an AMD to counter Nvidia.\n\n\n\nGastec - Tuesday, January 21, 2020 - link\nYou are looking forward to Nvidia's monopoly? Perhaps a few more wars and natural disasters to go with it?\n\n\n\nKorguz - Wednesday, January 22, 2020 - link\nGreenReaper  doesnt understand what would happen if there was only one video card maker, or for that matter, one cpu maker...  but in some ways we had just that before AMD released Zen, intel got lazy, stagnated the cpu market, and wasnt innovating, and only increasing performance by less then 10% i think it was year over year, all while charging more for each new generation. zen comes out, and look what happened,  10xxx series DROPPED by 1k at the top end over the 99xx series... if intel can do that, then it is a little obvious, they were over charging... \n\n\n\nIrata - Friday, January 17, 2020 - link\nBut that die is on a cheap mature process and all R&D, marketing... costs long since amortized.Why do you think AMD keeps Ryzen 2000 (and even 1000) series around ?The question here is who can afford to hold their breath longer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Soon, its contributions to AI may be just as renowned.\nTaking a step in that direction, a national research organization forged a three-year collaboration with NVIDIA. Together they aim to accelerate AI research and commercial adoption across the country.\nLeading the charge for Italy is CINI, the National Inter-University Consortium for Informatics that includes a faculty of more than 1,300 professors in various computing fields across 39 public universities.\nCINI\u2019s National Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Intelligence Systems (AIIS) is spearheading the effort as part of its goal to expand Italy\u2019s ecosystem for both academic research and commercial applications of AI.\n\u201cLeveraging NVIDIA\u2019s expertise to build systems specifically designed for the creation of AI will help secure Italy\u2019s position as a top player in AI education, research and industry adoption,\u201d said Rita Cucchiara, a professor of computer engineering and science and director of AIIS.\nNational effort begins in Modena\nThe joint initiative aims to train students, nurture startups and spread adoption of the latest AI technology throughout Italy. To get started, the partners will create a local hub at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Unimore) for the global NVIDIA AI Technology Center.\nThe partnership marks an important expansion of NVIDIA\u2019s work with the university whose roots date back to the medieval period.\nIn December, the company supported research on a novel way to automate the process of describing actions in a video. A team of four researchers at Unimore and one from Milan-based AI startup Metaliquid developed an AI model that achieved a significant improvement compared to prior solutions. In a final stage of the project, NVIDIA helped researchers analyze their network\u2019s topology to optimize training it on an NVIDIA DGX-1 system.\nIn July, Unimore and NVIDIA collaborated on an event for AI startups. Unimore\u2019s AImageLab hosted the event, which included representatives of NVIDIA\u2019s Inception program, an initiative to nurture AI startups with access to the company\u2019s technology and ecosystem.\nItaly\u2019s new AI partnership comes at a time when the AImageLab, host for the new NVIDIA hub, is already making its mark in areas such as machine vision and medical imaging.\nWinning kudos in image recognition\nIn September, two world-class research events singled out the AImageLab for recognition. One team from the lab won a best paper award at the International Conference on Computer Analysis of Images and Patterns. Another came third out of 64 research groups in an international competition using AI to classify skin lesions.\nThe Modena hub becomes the latest of more than 12 collaborations with countries worldwide for the NVIDIA AI Technology Center. NVAITC maintains an open database of research and tools developed with and for its partners.\nOverall, the new collaboration \u201cwill bring together NVIDIA and CINI in our shared mission to enable, support and inform Italy\u2019s AI ecosystem for research, industry and society,\u201d said Simon See, senior director of NVAITC.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ResearchTags: Artificial Intelligence | Inception | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA in Europe | NVIDIA Research \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Some people refuse to be evacuated from the danger zone because of Taal volcano eruption, while around 53,000 people in the area have found shelter in public evacuation centers after four days of volcano activity. (Photo by Alejandro Ernesto/NurPhoto via Getty Images)   By Adam Minter Smoke and ash erupted Sunday from the Taal volcano in the Philippines, with the plume rising almost 9 miles into the atmosphere and threatening hundreds of thousands of people. The Philippine government mobilized quickly. By Wednesday, more than 38,000 people were staying in evacuation centers, and many thousands more had dispersed to family throughout the country. Meanwhile, the government began to distribute supplies, including 100,000 protective face masks, in and around the eruption zone. There\u2019s little time to waste: Volcanologists are warning that a hazardous eruption could come at any time.  Thanks to their planning, leaders in the Philippines hope that that eruption, if and when it comes, won\u2019t be nearly as catastrophic as it would have been 10 years ago. Back then, the Philippines, like most emerging-market countries, mostly responded to disasters by cleaning up afterward. Today, preparedness is a national priority, and the Philippines is a model for how emerging-market governments in the world\u2019s most disaster-prone region can be ready for the worst.   Residents affected by the erupting Taal Volcano stay in an evacuation center in Batangas, Philippines, January 15, 2020. REUTERS/Eloisa Lopez   Since 1970, 59% of the global death toll from disasters \u2014 about 2 million people \u2014 occurred in the Asia-Pacific region, according to a United Nations report. Economic losses have also been profound, totaling about $675 billion annually. The region\u2019s disaster outlook is growing worse because of urbanization in vulnerable areas, degradation of the environment and the influence of a warming climate on extreme weather. In 2018, the Asia-Pacific region accounted for almost half of the world\u2019s 281 natural disasters, and eight of the 10 deadliest. Already in 2020, at least 60 people died as a result of flooding in Jakarta, and tens of thousands remain in temporary shelters.  Thanks to its location, the Philippines is more vulnerable to disaster than its neighbors. On average, eight or nine tropical cyclones make landfall on its coasts annually, bringing storm surges, flooding and landslides \u2014 phenomena that are likely to become more frequent and intensify as the climate warms. The country is perched atop the \u201cRing of Fire\u201d \u2014 a geologically active path along the Pacific Ocean \u2014 and is home to 53 active volcanos and fault lines capable of major earthquakes near the country\u2019s biggest cities. Further raising the risk profile is the country\u2019s drive to urbanize: Half the population currently lives in cities, with roughly a quarter of its residents (25 million people) in the Manila metro area. Officials in the Philippines historically didn\u2019t view disasters as recurrent problems worth mitigating or preventing. Rather, their focus was almost entirely concentrated on rapid response after the disaster. That\u2019s neither new nor uncommon in emerging Asian countries. In Jakarta, for example, the Indonesian government has struggled to manage regular, catastrophic floods, much less fund systems to control them. The situation has grown so bad that victims of this month\u2019s floods are filing a class-action lawsuit against the government for failing to plan for them.   Story continues What changed the disaster calculus in the Philippines was the scale of the catastrophes. In 2009, metro Manilla was hit by Typhoon Ketsana, which dumped more than a month\u2019s worth of rain in 12 hours, killed more than 700 people and paralyzed the city\u2019s economy. The government\u2019s tepid response precipitated a political crisis and the passage of legislation that prioritized proactive disaster management and risk reduction. Among other reforms, local governments are now required to prepare maps of areas prone to disasters like landslides, and make them public for planning and zoning purposes.  A logo of a McDonald's store is splattered with mud from volcanic ash in Tagaytay City, Philippines, January 14, 2020. REUTERS/Eloisa Lopez  To finance the shift, the country\u2019s main disaster fund is mandated to spend 70% on prevention, preparedness and mitigation, with 30% allocated to quick response operations. Among other benefits, the funding enables local governments to invest in hazard monitoring and forecasting equipment, including tsunami detection stations and volcano observatories (including those watching the Taal volcano). This spending is mostly administered by local governments, but since 2010 their disaster responses are monitored, integrated and supervised by a high-level agency. This framework not only provides accountability, but also ensures that planning and response to large-scale disasters can be coordinated nationally. Civil society and religious organizations also play a grass-roots role in disaster planning and response.Of course, no system is perfect. In the Philippines, it\u2019s fair to question whether a disaster preparedness system that depends on forging consensus within and among communities can be effective in the event of a major crisis. Likewise, there are legitimate concerns that the government will not fund the system\u2019s needs adequately.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

Flash forward now and everyone has \u201cFiresticks\u201d,\nbut they are inferior especially when compared to the Shield TV. \n\nNot too long ago, NVIDIA did its 3rd refresh of\nits Shield TV updating the inside of the model we have grown to love calling it\n\u201cShield TV Pro\u201d but also giving us a fresh look at what is simply dubbed \u201cShield\nTV\u201d.\u00a0 With this new take Shield TV keeps some\nof the same and changes things up a bit. \n\nFor starters you will notice NVIDIA has drastically changed\nthe design giving us this long cylinder tube.\u00a0\nThere definitely isn\u2019t any of the other streamers looking like this so\nits in a league of its own. In any event its weights less than 5oz and is 1.57\ninches all around with ports on both ends. One end has HDMI 2.0 and microSD\nwhile the other has Gigabit Ethernet and Power. \u00a0No green lights or indicators and its intention\nis to not be seen or heard. Frankly I have mines on the floor behind my TV\nstand. You wouldn\u2019t know its there laying next to the wires unless you were\nlooking for it. I did like showcasing the NVIDIA Shield, but I guess it saves\non shelf space with this. \n\nThe \u201cnew\u201d Shield TV has an updated NVIDIA Tegra X1+ processor w/ 256-core GPU, 2GB RAM and 8GB of storage. If you opt for the \u201cPro\u201d edition you will get 3GB RAM and double the storage at 16GB. They both have 802.11ac 2\u00d72 MIMO 2.4 GHz/5GHz Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0+ LE and as mentioned earlier Gigabit Ethernet. I typically use the Ethernet but its been smooth so far with streaming. \u00a0You get Dual USB 3.0 on the Pro while its been opted out this regular edition. \nA New Remote Has Entered the Arena\n\nWith the 2017 Shield TV we got a slightly modified remote and a badly needed remodeled Shield controller but looks like NVIDIA heard the cries for those that rely solely on the remote. No controllers are included with either model this time, but the Shield Remote has gotten a huge facelift.\u00a0 Its bigger, triangle shaped and can stand straight up or on its side. Either way it makes it easier for gripping. It has backlit buttons which come on soon as you pick it up thanks to motion detection and it has Bluetooth and IR functionality. Thanks to IR you can program it to work with your TV or sound system.\n2019 vs 2017\n I have mines controlling the volume on my Sonos Beam. If anyone owns a Sonos this is a godsend as Sonos devices don\u2019t come with remotes and you must rely on your smartphone.\u00a0 The new remote is one of my favorite additions even though that Netflix button is rather huge and gets pressed on more than you want to accidentally. There is a remote locator in case you misplace it as well.  The settings button can be reprogrammed to various options from opening settings to taking screenshots. \nBetter Performance, More Support\n\nBesides a shiny new remote, NVIDIA has added some tweaks that will try and give you the best high def experience possible from a streaming media box. Dolby Vision / Dolby Atmos have been decoded in the box to help give you some of the best sounding and looking content around that supports it for course. In the other models it supports the ability for it to pass-thru. Another feature they added is AI Upscaling. NVIDIA wants to make your HD content (1080p and below) look close to 4K. You can notice the difference if you are looking for it but its definitely there. If you aren\u2019t sure if you can tell or not, Shield TV has a tester option where you can toggle between the two on and off. I tried it with Rouge One on Netflix(not Disney+) and you can see added brightness and a bit more detail. It looks better on newer content and animation is the best indication of change. I imagine over time it will adapt more and more.  You can also toggle how much change or detail you want. As depending on the content it may look better or worst with upscaling. \n\nI still use the Shield TV with my typical apps such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, Vudu, Google Movies, YouTube, Plex, HBO Go, Disney+ and more often now YouTube TV.  Still holds up smooth for casting sites from my PC to it as well for other videos as well. \n\nBest Media Streamer Out There\nWith a starting price of $149.99, it makes the Shield TV more feasible for consumers to go out and purchase compared to its $200+ level it had out before. I gather removing the controller helped especially if some weren\u2019t even using it. Plus, you can pretty much use any Bluetooth controller such as an Xbox One controller with the Shield TV at this point.\u00a0 Its still one of the most expensive streaming devices up there with Apple TV but it has some of the best support out of all and continues to expand. \nIf you feel the need for more storage and slightly more speed you can get the Shield TV Pro $199.99.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tYou May Also Like\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAudio/Video\nLet Us Entertain You \n\n\n\n\n\nComcast will feature First Ever Super Bowl in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos \n\n\t\t\t\t\tComcast has been bringing a great experience to its Xfinity X1 customers\u2026\n\t\t\t\t\nJason MillionFebruary 5, 20253 minute read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAudio/Video\nLet Us Entertain You\nTelevisions \n\n\n\n\n\nTCL Launches Mini LED QM7K with new Halo Control System and Bang & Olufsen Speakers \n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis year TCL had let us know instead of releasing all their\u2026\n\t\t\t\t\nJason MillionMarch 10, 20255 minute read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently On YouTubeTeam G Style \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlberto Lima\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI\u2019m a die-hard Brooklynite with the swagger and snark to match.

Boasting an unheard of refresh rate for a gaming display, this will be possibly the fastest monitor you can buy on the market. It will also come packed with Nvidia's proprietary G-sync technology for a tear-free image. \nThis new 360 Hz display (which has yet to be given a name) is around 37% faster than current 240 Hz monitors, boasting an additional 120 frames per second. With a response time of less than three milliseconds, this really is shaping up to be an excellent monitor. Sadly, it will be limited to 24.5 inches and 1080p resolution, though that will ensure players will properly experience its insane refresh rate.\nFor competitive gamers and esports players alike, high refresh monitors are a way of life. Framerate is key in titles like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, DOTA 2, League of Legends, and Overwatch, so players of these games tend to grab specialty monitors from the likes of Dell, Asus, BenQ, and AOC. Boasting refresh rates well above convention equipment, they offer a tangible edge to players that can perceive the difference.\nRELATED: BenQ ZOWIE XL2740 27-Inch 240Hz Gaming Monitor Review \n\n\nHaving owned a 240 Hz display for a few years now, I definitely prefer higher refresh rates. They won't make you a better player by default, but having faster technology in your display will ensure that games can render images most consistently and smoother. It even helps with general fluidity of games, making action titles feel lightning fast.\nStill, there is only so high a refresh can go before the difference is imperceptible. Many note that most players don't feel anything beyond 144 Hz, so 360 seems like an arbitrary increase to sell some new tech. It definitely sounds impressive from a pure numbers standpoint, but it might not provide a tangible benefit to people that aren't professional gamers.\nEven if the number is just a randomly selected one, G-sync technology is absolutely a game-changer. Being able to have a display sync to a variable framerate makes all the difference when certain engines aren't optimized well. Maybe you won't need to grab this specific display to get that feature, but definitely track down something with either G-Sync or Freesync capabilities. You'll be surprised at how great it is.\nSource: Nvidia\nREAD NEXT: Nvidia Reveals 360Hz G-Sync Monitor \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame News\n\n\n\n\nTech\n\n\n\n\nCES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMarvel Rivals Is Bringing Back Its Spider-Punk 2099 And Steam Power Iron Man Skins\n\t\t\n\n\nMarvel Rivals\n\nThat Spider-Punk skin was too good to leave behind with the beta.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMagic: The Gathering Is Making Fans Choose Between Cats And Dogs With Its New Secret Lair Drop\n\t\t\n\n\nMagic: The Gathering\n\nIt's dogs, by the way.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSaints Row Is Dead Because The Games Were \"So Expensive For What They Were\", Says Saber Interactive CEO\n\t\t\n\n\nSaints Row\n\nKarch says that Saints Row is too expensive and \"The days of throwing money at games other than maybe the GTAs of the world is over.\"\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSilent Hill Isn't Just A Town, It's A State Of Mind\n\t\t\n\n\nSilent Hill f\n\nKonami is bringing back the survival horror icon with a distinctly Japanese twist. \n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 day ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tEveryone At Larian Loves This Baldur's Gate 3 Fan Animation Featuring Shadowheart And Karlach\n\t\t\n\n\nBaldur's Gate 3\n\nA TV show based on the BG3 companions sounds amazing!\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCould Double Exposure Be The End Of Life Is Strange?\n\t\t\n\n\nTriple-A Games\n\nThe controversial return of Max Caulfield selling poorly leaves plenty of questions about the franchise's future.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 day ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSteam Gets Second Game In As Many Months That Adds Malware To Your PC\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPokemon Go's Bottle Caps Risk Devaluing Shundos\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMagic: The Gathering is Reprinting Craterhoof Behemoth In Tarkir: Dragonstorm\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Our Team\nOur Audience\nAbout Us\nPress & Events\nContact Us\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising\nCareers\nTerms\nPrivacy\nPolicies\n\n\nTheGamer is part of the\n                            Valnet Publishing Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Copyright \u00a9 2025 Valnet Inc.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The company confirmed the $50 price drop, spotted earlier by PCGamer, in an email Friday.In July 2019, Nvidia released an updated model of the graphics card, the RTX 2060 Super, for $399. The Super card essentially bumps up the specs from its predecessor to deliver a performance lift -- Nvidia says 15% to 20% on average -- at the expense of increased power draw.\u00a0The price drop also comes as rival AMD announced the Radeon RX 5600 XT, which it called the \"ultimate 1080p gaming\" card, at CES 2020. The 5600 will be available worldwide on Jan. 21 for $279.

Those GPUs include mobile variants of the GeForce GTX 1650 Ti and GeForce GTX 1650 Super, neither of which have been announced yet.\n\n\nOne of those GPUs already exists in desktop form, that being the GeForce GTX 1650 Super. It has 1,280 CUDA cores, a 1,530MHz base clock and 1,725MHz boost clock, and 4GB of GDDR6 memory running at 12Gbps on a 192-bit bus. Those are reference specs, with OEM vendors having the freedom to overclock the base and boost clocks on custom models, if they wish.\n\n\n\nSo, how do the mobile variants compare? Twitter user _rogame highlight a couple of Geekbench entries claiming to show the mobile GPUs. Here's a look at the reported specs, along with desktop variants of the nearest comparable models...\n\n\nDesktop GeForce GTX 1650 Super: 1,280 CUDA cores, 1,530MHz base clock, 1,725MHz boost clock, 4GB GDDR6 (12Gbps), 192-bit bus\nMobile GeForce GTX 1650 Ti: 1,024 CUDA cores, 1,490MHz boost clock, 4GB GDDR6 (12Gbps), 128-bit bus\nDesktop GeForce GTX 1650: 896 CUDA cores, 1,485MHz base clock, 1,665MHz boost clock, 4GB GDDR5 (8Gbps), 128-bit bus\nMobile GeForce GTX 1650 Super: 896 CUDA cores, 1,560GHz boost clock, 4GB GDDR6 (12Gbps), 128-bit bus\n\nIn essence, the mobile GeForce GTX 1650 Ti appears to be a cut down version of the desktop GeForce GTX 1650 Super, while the mobile GeForce GTX 1650 Super is similar to the desktop GeForce GTX 1650, but with a slower boost clock and faster memory.\n\n\nAs to the Geekbench scores, here's a look (click to enlarge)...\n\n\n\n\nGeForce GTX 1650 Ti (Left), GeForce GTX 1650 Super (Right) - Source: Geekbench via _rogame (Twitter)\n\n\n\nThe GeForce GTX 1650 Ti listing is shown on the left-hand side and the GeForce GTX 1650 Super is shown on the right. Note that these represent two different versions of Geekbench. The former was run on Geekbench 4.3.4 and the latter on Geekbench 5.0.4.\n\n\n\nWe do not have our own collection of Geekbench scores to pit the leaked results against. However, if you look through the database, the OpenCL scores on desktop GeForce GTX 1650 Super models averages 52,356. That means the mobile variants is around 17 percent slower. That's not bad, considering it has fewer CUDA cores.\n\n\nIt's a bit more difficult to navigate the Geekbench 4 results based on GPU performance. Generally speaking, though, the mobile GeForce GTX 1650 Super scores within range of the desktop GeForce GTX 1650. This also makes sense, since the the number of CUDA cores is the same.\n\n\nWhile nothing is certain, we anticipate NVIDIA announcing these GPUs during GTC in March.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, geforce gtx 1650 ti, geforce gtx 1650 super\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

At $6,000 and $4,000 respectively, that's an expensive pair of space heaters. \nPNY claims the two new GPUs, which share a core count and boost clock, only sacrifice a little bit of performance to achieve a passively coolable 250W TDP. I've never heard of 250W being passively cooled within a standard 2-slot form factor, but there's a first time for everything. Particularly if you own a wind tunnel.\nThe boost clock has been lowered by 8% down to a still very respectable 1,620 MHz, and the base clocks have been dropped by about 12%. The memory clock has also received a small hit of 7% to bring it from 14 Gbps to 13 Gbps.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nQuadro RTX 8000\nQuadro RTX 8000 Passive\nQuadeo RTX 6000\nQuadro RTX 6000 Passive\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n4608\n4608\n4608\n4608\n\n\nBase Clock\n1395 MHz\n1230 MHz\n1440 MHz\n1275 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1770 MHz\n1620 MHz\n1770 MHz\n1620 MHz\n\n\nSingle-Precision\n16.3 TFLOPS\n14.9 TFLOPS\n16.3 TFLOPS\n14.9 TFLOPS\n\n\nRT Cores\n72\n72\n72\n72\n\n\nRTX-OPS\n84T\n80T\n80T\n80T\n\n\nTensor Cores\n576\n576\n576\n576\n\n\nMixed Matrix\n130.5 TFLOPS\n119.4 TFLOPS\n130.5 TFLOPS\n119.4 TFLOPS\n\n\nMemory Capacity\n48 GB GDDR6\n48 GB GDDR6\n24 GB GDDR6\n24 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Clock\n14 Gbps\n13 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n13 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n672 GB/s\n624 GB/s\n672 GB/s\n624 GB/s\n\n\nTDP\n295W\n250W\n295W\n250W\n\n\n\nAll jokes aside, these cards still need air blown across the heat spreaders by system fans, like the ones in leaf blowers \u2013 ok, so I lied about setting the jokes aside \u2013 that makes them server rack only, so PNY has removed their usual display ports.\n\nDespite potentially increased operating temperatures, PNY is offering its regular three-year limited warranty.\nThe Quadro RTX 8000 Passive and Quadro RTX 6000 Passive are presently for sale to commercial customers, with a public release expected sometime soon.

Things have been quiet on that front until now, as we're seeing the first additional evidence confirming the existence of the GeForce RTX 2080 Super with Max-Q Design.\r\n\n\nConfirmation of this news comes by way of TUM_APISAK, which unearthed a Geekbench entry for the mobile GeForce RTX 2080. In this particular instance, the GPU is paired up with an Intel Core i9-10980HK processor (Comet Lake-H), which indicates that is likely a desktop replacement gaming laptop.\n\n\n\n\nIntel announced its Comet Lake-H processors at CES 2020, and the Core i9-10980HK is an 8-core/16-thread part. According to Intel, these chips will have\u00a0boost clocks in excess of 5GHz, but this particular example was clocked at 4.92GHz. According to a\u00a0post to Twitter by Intel's Gregory Bryant, laptops featuring 10th\u00a0generation Intel Core-H processors \"will ship later this quarter\", so that gives us a timeframe for when we should begin seeing laptops featuring GeForce RTX 2080 Super with Max-Q Design along with other members of the GeForce RTX/GTX Super family.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to our previous reporting, this is what the GeForce RTX/GTX Super family will look like:\n\n\n\n\n\nN18E-G3R -- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080M SUPER (8GB of GDDR6)\nN18E-G2R -- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070M SUPER (8GB of GDDR6)\nN18E-G1R -- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060M SUPER (8GB of GDDR6)\nN18P-G62 -- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660M SUPER (4GB of GDDR6)\nN18P-G61 -- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650M SUPER (4GB of GDDR6) \u00a0\n\n\n\nAs you can see by the above specs, all of the cards will come equipped with GDDR6 memory, and all which feature higher clock speeds than their standard counterparts. It will be an interesting battle to see brewing in the mobile GPU realm. AMD has already\u00a0announced its Radeon RX 5500M, and we'll be eager to see if the company has even more powerful variants on deck to counter NVIDIA\u2019s offerings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, (nasdaq:nvda), turing, geforce rtx 2080 super\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

That is what high-end server GPUs such as the NVIDIA Tesla V100S utilize. Now, PNY is showing off passively cooled NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 and Quadro RTX 6000 cards that NVIDIA manufactures and PNY resells.\nBackground on Passively Cooled GPUs\nSince a handful of our readers can get confused by the idea of a passively cooled GPU, it is not that the GPU does not require an active fan. Instead, this industry term refers to a GPU or PCIe device that does not have an active fan attached. These passively cooled GPUs put out too much heat to not require heavy airflow.\nPassively Cooled NVIDIA GPU Airflow Directions\nThe industry has solutions that utilize chassis fans which keep GPUs cool while maintaining redundancy. You can see examples of these systems in Inspur Systems NF5468M5 Review, Gigabyte W291-Z00 Review,\u00a0Supermicro 4028GR-TR 4U 8-Way GPU SuperServer Review, and Gigabyte G481-S80 Review. GPU fans fail at a non-zero rate, especially with consumer and even blower-style coolers. Taking a system apart to replace the fan can be tedious. Systems designed for chassis cooling of passively cooled GPUs usually have hot-swap fans to make servicing fans easy without having to remove GPUs.\nPNY Passively Cooled NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 and Quadro RTX 6000\nThe specs of passively-cooled NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 and Quadro RTX 6000 cards PNY resells are very similar with the key difference being the amount of GPU memory each card has.\nPNY Passive NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 And Quadro RTX 6000 Spec Table\nThe cards themselves come in what NVIDIA calls the \u201cNVIDIA Form Factor 4.0 for PCIe Card Server Products.\u201d That means the cards are 4.376\u201d x 10.5\u201d and fit in dual-slot PCIe layouts. The cards also support the NV-Link edge connector. You can read about a modern PCIe NV-Link solution in our\u00a0Dual NVIDIA Titan RTX Review Compute with NVLink Performance.\nWe have not reviewed the Quadro RTX 6000 yet, however, you can read our NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 GPU Review to learn more about the actively cooled version. Here is a comparison of the standard and passively cooled versions:\nPNY Passive NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 And Quadro RTX 6000 Spec Comparison\nOne item we noticed immediately was that the passively cooled versions are 45W lower TDP. That almost 12% decrease in maximum power consumption aligns with an about 7-9% decrease in performance. Generally, passive PCIe GPUs need to be in the 225-250W range which is what systems are designed to cool. The Tesla V100 and V100S, by comparison, are also 250W PCIe GPUs.\nFinal Words\nFor those doing deep learning work and who need more GPU memory, having the Quadro RTX 8000 in dense configurations can be beneficial. As we see more professional rendering and creation applications take advantage of the additional compute and AI inferencing capabilities of the cards, we are going to see professional cards get larger. Making trade-offs in terms of performance and power consumption to densely pack GPUs into the server and high-end workstation form factors make a lot of sense. PNY is one of the major resellers of these cards, especially to VARs and what we call \u201cchannel cobblers\u201d who configure custom solutions for customers.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSNVIDIAQuadroRTX \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleIntel Xeon Gold 6252 Benchmarks and ReviewNext articleNetgear GS110EMX Review A Managed GS110MX Switch Cliff RobinsonThey call me \"the STH news guy\" for a reason.  \n \nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBolt Graphics Zeus The New GPU Architecture with up to 2.25TB of Memory and 800GbE \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nIntel Falcon Shores GPU Not Coming to Market in an AI Hit \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nThis is the Massive AMD Instinct MI300A Heatsink in the Gigabyte G383-R80-AAP1 \n\n  \n\n\n\n3 COMMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            January 23, 2020\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            11:43 am                                            \n\n\n\nYou must be joking,  they have all of that power but use pcie 3.0   -.-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRodi\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            January 24, 2020\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            3:34 pm                                            \n\n\n\nYou are the one joking.

This GPU features several top of the line features that helps set the company apart from competitors. NVIDIA states that its Turing GPU architecture gives their hardware 6 times the performance of previous generations of graphics cards, supports real-time ray tracing, and AI enhanced graphics. These features enable games to run much smoother and enable much higher quality graphics. This piece of hardware currently retails for $1199.00, but there are several much cheaper options on the market.\nRelated: Halo: Combat Evolved PC Beta Testing Finally Begins Next Month\nTweakTown (via Reset Era) reports that NVIDIA's new line of graphics cards have been leaked online. These new GPUs are the GA103 and Ga104. Reportedly these cards will be powering the upcoming GeForce RTX 3080 and the 3070 respectively. The more powerful of the two cards, the GA103, will have some truly powerful new specs. It could possibly support up to 20 GB of GDDR6, 320-bit memory interface, 60 SMs, and 3480 stream processors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers have been talking about these leaks and trying to determine other details. Several have lamented the fact that these new graphics cards will completely outmatch the graphics cards they already own. Others were extremely excited to see if the cards will release before games like Cyberpunk 2077. Most everyone in the message boards seem to be concerned as to what the price will wind up being. Particularly users are worried what the price increase will be when the more upgraded forms of these cards release. Still, it's a major leap forward in technology and represents a larger-than-usual innovation for GPUs over just a short span of time, possibly indicating that PC gaming will have more to say about the way next-gen consoles are angling themselves more like computers than ever before.\nGraphics cards have become the pillar of PC gaming. As technology continues to grow and change graphics cards must continually improve to support more complicated and realistic video games. NVIDIA is also constantly competing with rival company AMD to create the most powerful cards in the industry. The more that these companies compete and innovate the more that gamers demand more powerful systems. If these leaks prove to be true, then PC gamers will hopefully be satisfied for a long time.\nNext: Horizon: Zero Dawn is Officially Coming to PC\nSource: TweakTown (via Reset Era) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n\n\nTech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDwarfs vs Dwarves: Is Disney Right Or...

As shown in the image above, it bears the university's color scheme and is called Big Red 200, which is a tribute to the 200th anniversary of IU. In addition to oozing school pride, Big Red 200 is notable because it will rock NVIDIA's next-generation Ampere GPUs.\n\n\nNVIDIA has not yet released Ampere, but is expected to soon. We have covered various leaks and rumors on the subject, as it pertains to NVIDIA's efforts in the gaming space, but Ampere will also find a home in datacenters and supercomputer applications. Or at least that is the expectation, based on what information has been shared.\n\n\nBig Red 200 is being deployed in two phases. The first phase is already up and running and consists of 672 dual-socket nodes powered by AMD's EPYC 7742 \"Rome\" processors, each with 64 physical cores and 128 threads of computing muscle. That works out to a staggering 86,016 cores and 172,032 threads\u2014plenty enough to play Crysis, before anyone asks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second phase will commence this summer. It will add more Rome processor nodes to the equation, and also next-generation NVIDIA GPUs, according to Brad Wheeler, vice president for information technology and chief information officer at IU. All of this hardware goodness will combine to drive nearly 8 petaflops of performance.\n\n\nBig Red 200's infusion of next-generation GPUs is interesting because that was never a foregone conclusion. As Wheeler explains it, the original intention was to outfit the supercomputer with Tesla V100 GPUs based on NVIDIA's Volta architecture. At present, NVIDIA considers the Tesla V100 as the \"most advanced datacenter GPU every built to accelerate AI.\"\n\n\nThat would have resulted in 5.9 PFLOPs of performance. However, Wheeler says IU \"decided to take the machine in two phases\" when an opportunity from NVIDIA presented itself \"at the last minute.\" By waiting just a bit longer, IU could implement NVIDA's next-generation hardware in Big Red 200, and so the decision was made to go that route.\n\n\nWheeler also says IU was able to purchase fewer GPUs while still adding around 2 petaflops of additional performance by waiting for NVIDIA's next-generation GPUs. As an added bonus, going with the latest hardware could bring in more money for research.\n\n\nOne final word on the subject\u2014since the plan is to add new hardware to Big Red 200 this summer, it now seems increasingly likely that NVIDIA will announce Ampere during GTC in March.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                supercomputer, Cray, big red 200, indiana university\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

The Pro model is largely an update of the previous SHIELD TV, but the non-Pro model marked a big form factor shift to a dongle. Both of these new devices come with a completely redesigned remote, which is finally available to purchase separately. \nThis is great news if you need an extra remote for your new SHIELD TV. More importantly, though, the new remote works with older SHIELD TVs as well. As great as the past generation SHIELD TVs are (and they are great), the remotes were not a strong suit. The redesigned remote seems to be an improvement in every way. So if you didn't upgrade your SHIELD TV, you can still upgrade part of it for $29.99.\nNVIDIA SHIELD TV/Pro XDA Forums\nAs a refresher, the updated remote includes back-lit buttons, a locator feature, a customizable menu button, actual volume buttons, and a harder-to-lose-in-the-couch thicker design. NVIDIA is sending out a SHIELD Experience update today that adds support for the new remote on older SHIELD TV models. SHIELD Experience 8.0.2 also adds support for the Xbox Elite 2 controller, support for Sanscrit USB DAC, the Channels DVR app can now store recorded content on NAS, and a number of new and updated apps.

More info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new NVIDIA SHIELD TV picked up its first discount this week, but one could argue that the separation of its new remote might be a bigger deal. We have been waiting since launch last October for this to happen and the day has finally come. You can now buy the new NVIDIA SHIELD Remote for $29.99.\nThe new SHIELD Remote is a big improvement over the previous two models. It actually stays connected at all times, offers quick interactions without the lag of old, has easily replaceable AAA batteries, lights up when you touch or use it, has IR for TV control, a mic for Assistant actions, and a triangular shape that you\u2019ll quickly get used to.\nThis new SHIELD Remote will work with all older SHIELD TV boxes, according to NVIDIA. That means you may not have to upgrade your SHIELD TV in order to get an improved experience. I can tell you that I most definitely ordered one this morning for my older SHIELD in my bedroom.\nAt $29.99, NVIDIA\u2019s store is offering free shipping. At this time, they are the only retailer selling it. Should it pop-up at Amazon or Best Buy, we\u2019ll update this post.\nShop NVIDIA SHIELD Accessories\n\n\nShare FacebookTwitterReddit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\n\nNews\n\n\n\nTags\n\nNVIDIA\nSHIELD TV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Post\nNVIDIA SHIELD TV (2019) Gets First Discount and is $20 Off (Updated)\n\n\nNext Post\nOfficial Successor to Vine Launches, Available Now on Android and iOS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollapse\nShow\nComments\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\nBe nice to each other.\r\n\r\n\nPrivacy Manager\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\nContact\nAdvertise\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n Sign-up for the Droid Life Newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        2025 \u00a9 Droid Life\r\n      \n\r\n        Website | Murmur Creative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n",

A few months back, it was reported that NVIDIA was working on its Turing GeForce SUPER refresh for gaming notebooks and it looks like we are super close to the launch of these high-performance mobility discrete GPUs.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER Mobility Spotted For Enthusiast-Class Gaming Notebooks - Max-Q & Standard Variants With 8 GB GDDR6 VRAM, Up To 150W+ TGP\nEarlier, it was revealed by the folks over at NotebookCheck that NVIDIA was working on SUPER variants for the mobility Turing lineup too. A leaked slide from an internal presentation revealed that there would be at least five variants which would include:\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER Mobile (N18E-G3R)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER Mobile (N18E-G2R)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER Mobile (N18E-G1R)\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER Mobile (N18P-G62)\n\nThe entry of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER mobile was spotted by TUM_APISAK. The specific variant is in a Max-Q design which runs at lower clock speeds than the standard variant but offers better performance per watt for longer battery life and cooler/quieter operation in gaming laptops. The RTX 2080 SUPER Max-Q is configured with 48 SMs which equals 3072 CUDA cores and 8 GB of GDDR6 memory. The Max-Q solution is listed with a maximum frequency of 1230 MHz but as told earlier, Max-Q variants operate at lower clock speeds than standard mobile GPUs.\n\nThe discrete RTX SUPER Max-Q mobility GPU was running alongside an Intel Core i9-10980HK CPU which is part of the upcoming 10th Gen Comet Lake-H series family. We detailed this CPU earlier today and you can find more details here. It looks like gaming notebooks with Intel CPUs will once again be the best option for high-end enthusiasts who want the best graphics performance as the fastest Ryzen 4000 'Renoir' based laptops are currently outfitted with RTX 2060 or the RX 5600M / RX 5700M graphics chips. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER & RTX 2080 SUPER mobility GPUs are literally steps above the GPUs featured in Ryzen gaming notebooks & only Intel-based laptops would make full use of them.\n\nThis also takes us back to that one controversial slide that Intel showcased at CES 2020 where they were comparing a Ryzen 3000 mobility based laptop configured with RTX 2060 to an Intel 9th Gen Core i7 laptop with RTX 2060 but also an Intel 9th Gen Core i9 laptop with RTX 2080. Intel really did mishandle a rather simple explanation that while they offer more performance with the same tier configuration, they also offer the best performance tier gaming laptops. And with this leak, it can be confirmed that Intel CPUs based gaming notebooks or indeed getting the best mobile gaming GPUs in the market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe top three variants, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER, RTX 2070 SUPER and RTX 2060 SUPER mobility would have both Max-Q and standard variants. The Max-Q variants will have an 80W TGP (Total Graphics Power) while the standard variant of the RTX 2080 SUPER mobility would have a 150W+ TGP. The RTX 2070 SUPER & RTX 2060 SUPER mobility would have a 115W TGP. All three RTX 20 SUPER mobile discrete GPUs would feature 8 GB of GDDR6 memory.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX SUPER Mobility GPU Lineup Specs:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti NotebookNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 RefreshNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 RefreshNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPERNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER\n\n\n\n\nCodenameN18P-G62N18E-G1-BN18E-G1RN18E-G2RN18E-G3R\n\n\nArchitectureTuring TU116Turing TU106Turing TU104Turing TU104Turing TU104\n\n\nProcess Node12nm FinFET NVIDIA12nm FinFET NVIDIA12nm FinFET NVIDIA12nm FinFET NVIDIA12nm FinFET NVIDIA\n\n\nSMs1630364048\n\n\nCUDA Cores10241920230425603072\n\n\nStandard Max Boost Clock1485 MHz1285 MHz1485 MHz1380 MHz1560 MHz\n\n\nMax-Q Max Boost Clock1200 MHzTBCTBC1155 MHz1080 MHz\n\n\nVRAM4 GB GDDR66 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus128-bit192-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit\n\n\nMemory Clock12 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Bandwdith192 GB/s336 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s\n\n\nTGP (Total Graphics Power)35W (Standard)\n55W (Max-Q)115W (Standard)115W (Standard)115W (Standard)\n80 (Max-Q)150W+ (Standard)\n80 (Max-Q)\n\n\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER, as it is called, would have a Max-Q variant configured at 35W TGP and a standard variant at 50W TGP. The other variant would also be similar in terms of TGP but would be a new entry-level SKU for the mobility market. Both of these variants would feature 4 GB of GDDR6 memory. Expect the GeForce RTX SUPER Notebook Refresh GPUs to launch alongside the Intel 10th Gen processors in the coming months.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n159\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n95\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n69\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n54\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

While in this mode, GPU frequency is reduced and uses less power. For laptop users, Max Frame Rate also works alongside with\u00a0Battery Boost\u00a0and\u00a0Whisper Mode. If either of these modes are enabled at the same time as Max Frame Rate, the NVIDIA Control Panel will cap the framerate to the lowest of the limits.\nReducing System Latency:\u00a0Enable Max Frame Rate and set your power management mode to \u201cPrefer maximum performance\u201d to reduce latency. While in this mode, the GPU is kept at higher frequencies to process frames as quickly as possible. To maximize latency reduction in GPU bound scenarios where FPS is consistent, set Max Frame Rate to a framerate slightly below the average FPS and turn Low Latency Mode to Ultra.\nStaying in VRR Range:\u00a0Set the Max Frame Rate slightly below the maximum refresh rate of your display to stay within the Variable Refresh Rate range - providing a no-tear, low system latency experience! For the smoothest, no tear experience, set the\u00a0low latency mode\u00a0to Ultra and turn VSYNC on.\n\nOther\u00a0features in version\u00a0441.87\nIn addition to the Max Frame Rate feature, this driver also introduces a few other features:\nVariable Rate Super Sampling (VRSS)\u00a0is a new feature that improves image quality in Virtual Reality games.\nImage Sharpening Improvements\u00a0allow you toggle the GPU scaling independent of whether Image Sharpening is enabled or not.\nFreestyle \u2018Splitscreen\u2019 Filter\u00a0allows gamers to apply filters to only a portion of the screen.\nNew G-SYNC Compatible Displays\nGame Ready for Wolfenstein: Youngblood with Ray Tracing\nTo download this driver for your system, you can visit Nvidia's\u00a0driver download page.\nThe full release notes can be read here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\u00a9 Techniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft reminds admins to prepare for WSUS driver sync deprecationMicrosoft to deprecate WSUS driver synchronization in 90 daysNew Windows zero-day exploited by 11 state hacking groups since 2017Microsoft: March Windows updates mistakenly uninstall CopilotMicrosoft says button to restore classic Outlook is broken\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDriver\nFrame Rate\nGeForce\nNVIDIA\nWindows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLawrence Abrams   \n              Lawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce GTX 1650 (Image credit: Nvidia)The rumor mill on an upcoming Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Ti had been running dry since the graphics card's first appearance in a Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) filing in April. Now, as spotted today by a hardware leaker on Twitter, we're seeing a Geekbench 5 entry added last week that corroborates the GTX 1650 Ti's speculated specifications.The listing places the GTX 1650 Ti alongside the unreleased Intel Core i7-10750H, a six-core, 12-thread processor. The 'H' suffix means that the CPU is a mobile chip meant for laptops, so the GTX 1650 Ti here is most likely a mobile variant as well. As the GTX 1650 and GTX 1650 Mobile have shown us, the specifications between the desktop and mobile versions of Nvidia's graphics cards can vary.(Image credit: Primate Labs Inc.)Nvidia's TU117 die has 16 Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) for 1,024 CUDA cores. The GTX 1650 employs the TU117 silicon but only has 14 of the 16 SMs enabled, which puts 896 CUDA cores at the graphics card's disposal. The Geekbench 5 listing says the GTX 1650 Ti has 16 Compute Units, implying that the graphics card has the fully-enabled TU117 die for 1,024 CUDA cores.The GTX 1650 Ti seemingly features a 1.49 GHz boost clock and 4GB of GDDR6 memory. Remember, if this is mobile version as believe, it's possible and likely that the desktop version will have higher clock speeds.\u00a0As for the memory interface, the GTX 1650 and GTX 1650 Super both feature a 128-bit memory bus. We expect the Ti version to have the same. Sadly, Geekbench 5 doesn't list the memory speed.The graphics card in question put up a OpenCL score of 44,246 points on Geekbench 5. The GTX 1650 Mobile typically scores up to 42,000 points, so we're roughly looking at a 4.8% difference for this specific benchmark.\u00a0Of course, we'll need to take these unconfirmed results with a grain and salt. Additionally, this card hasn't been released yet, so there's still time for improvement.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nCUDA\ngtx\nBenchmark\nGeekbench\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (8)\n\n\n\nZhiye LiuSocial Links NavigationNews Editor and Memory ReviewerZhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

Now we have the 2070S, 2080S, and 2080 Ti all on average 15 percent fps apart.GPU performance improvements have slowed down a lot over the last couple of years, performance at any given price point used to increase by 30-50% year-on-year. If performance isn't going up as fast as it used to be, you have less headroom left to maintain widely-spaced tiers and things get tighter.\n\nI don't mind having more choices as long as they offer a clear and sensible price-performance progression.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngggplaya\n\n\nI really hope they make this in a half height card like the 1050ti.

But the Super does, and the Ti will, be more power hungry. I'm not sure how practical cooling that would be in half-height form-factor.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngggplaya\n\n\nKing_V said:I think that this would be unlikely, the non-Super, non-Ti 1650, maybe, given its 75W power envelope.

The 1650 super and ti would have Turing nvenc.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncryoburner\n\n\nKing_V said:If there's a desktop version, exactly where is this going to slot in?That's the same thought I first had, until I saw they were talking about laptop hardware. If this is something actually coming to market at this point, then I suspect it will be mobile only. On the desktop, there's only around a 15% performance difference between a 1650 SUPER and a 1660, so there wouldn't really be room for another product in there, especially with the 1660 also offering additional VRAM for as little as $200 now.\n\nMore importantly, the 1650 SUPER is based on the same TU116 processor as the 1660, 1660 SUPER and 1660 Ti, and has 25% more graphics cores than a full TU117 processor would have, so there's no way a 1650 Ti built on that chip could even come close to the 1650 SUPER's level of performance. It would have to be around 15-20% slower than a 1650 SUPER, and that doesn't really fit with their existing naming conventions this generation. So, I can't see a 1650 Ti happening on the desktop.\n\nAlistairAB said:Oh god no... the current cards all all way too close together as is.

The SUPER cards kind of filled in the gaps though, while bringing price reductions with them. Still, a 2080 Ti can be around 40% faster than a 2070 SUPER when not limited by CPU performance, and close to 50% faster than a 5700 XT. If someone really wants to game at native 4K and has money to burn, there's substantially more performance to be had there.\n\nAnd there's certainly more than a 5% performance difference separating each card between the 1650 SUPER and the 1660 Ti. The only place that might be true is when comparing the 1660 Ti with the SUPER variant, but that's more of a price reduction of TI-level performance than anything. Going from the 1650 SUPER to the 1660 can be a 10-15% performance difference, plus additional VRAM that should keep the card relevant longer, and the jump between the 1660 and the 1660 Ti provides a similar performance difference, even if that's been filled in with the 1660 SUPER now. Again though, the 1660 Ti is up to around 30% faster than a 1650 SUPER. And as I pointed out already, chances are the 1650 Ti isn't even coming to the desktop.\n\nReally, it should be seen as a positive having levels of cards priced relatively close together though, as it allows people to fit as much graphics performance into their build as they can afford, rather than having $100+ separating each performance level.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 8 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Flower\u2019s beastly 2800W power supply lands at $899 \u2014 enough juice to power a couple of RTX 5090 GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei's Microsoft Windows license for PCs expires this month, company launching PCs with Harmony OS: Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 50-series GPU scalping extends to system integrators \u2014 over $3,000 for a RTX 5090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO gets a $1 million salary plus $68 million in bonuses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNES consoles appear to run faster with age \u2014 APU frequency increased by up to 182 Hz after 35 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech giants call Trump tariffs 'big headache' \u2014 Foxconn CEO teases increased production in US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe week in chip news: Intel gets a new CEO, China chip smuggling, AMD dominates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi Pico powers $75 PicoCalc portable programming handheld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel's new CEO warns employees about 'tough decisions', but Wall Street cheers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI skips RDNA 4 and will not manufacture AMD Radeon 9000-series GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

LG are entering the fray this year with 12 G-Sync Compatible OLED TVs. That's right. Proper OLED TVs, not extortionate over-priced G-Sync Compatible monitors monitors. \n\nYou may remember that LG added G-Sync Compatible support for a couple of their 2019 OLED TVs at the end of last year. It was only available on select models, however (the 55in and 65in B9 and E9 models and the 55in, 65in and 75in C9), and involved manually updating the TV's firmware before you could take advantage of its newfound variable refresh rate technology. \nThankfully, LG's 2020 crop of OLED TVs will be G-Sync Compatible from the outset, offering tear-free gaming in your living room that's (comparatively) hassle-free. You'll still need to enable G-Sync Compatibility on your PC, of course, but at least you won't have to muck about with firmware updates as well. \nWhat's more, the 2020 G-Sync Compatible OLEDs will also be available in a wider variety of sizes than the 2019 crop, with models starting from 48in all the way up to a whopping 88in. This should hopefully mean there are some vaguely affordable models in there as well - or at least a couple that are (hopefully) a heck of a lot cheaper than the BFGD monitors currently available, such as the \u00a35000 HP Omen X Emperium. \nOf course, all the BFGD monitors confirmed so far are full-blooded G-Sync Ultimate displays - that is, proper G-Sync and all the HDR bells and whistles that go with it. LG's OLED TVs, on the other hand, are actually just regular adaptive sync displays and don't specifically require an Nvidia graphics card in order to take advantage of their variable refresh rates, which is why they're only G-Sync Compatible rather than full G-Sync. \nThat said, Nvidia have still given them full G-Sync Compatible status after testing their variable refresh rate tech internally, and as a result they're also classifying them as BFGDs, too - presumably so they have something else to point to whenever someone periodically brings them up in conversation. \nLG haven't confirmed exactly which of their 2020 OLEDs will be G-Sync Compatible yet, but I'll update this article with more info as soon as I get it. Either way, it's suddenly made Acer's newly-announced 55in OLED monitor seem very old hat indeed. \nFor more news from this year's CES, check out our CES 2020 tag.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nKatharine Castle: Katharine was RPS' editor-in-chief from 2021 to 2024.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n\n\n\nThe past 12 months brought some interesting developments to the PC, such as AMD's first and second round of graphics cards based on its 7-nanometer Navi GPU architecture, lower solid state drive (SSD) pricing with bigger capacities to boot, the advent of PCI Express 4.0 hardware, the launch of third-generation Ryzen processors, and a return to relative affordability for DDR4 RAM, to give a few examples. But 2019 has come to a close, and it's onward (and hopefully upward) to 2020. What will the new year bring in the hardware space?That's a good question, and though I do not have a crystal ball to peer into, I can make some educated guesses based on current developments, as well as various leaks and rumors that have been making the rounds. PC gaming will continue to thrive, that much I can say with supreme confidence. More specifically, however, there are some hardware developments in the making that could give PC gaming a boost in 2020, while others will only offer a nudge. Here is what to expect.AMD does real-time ray tracingFor all of 2019, real-time ray tracing in games has been the sole domain of Nvidia, primarily by way of its GeForce RTX series graphics cards. Technically, Nvidia's recent GeForce GTX cards also support ray tracing, though they lack dedicated hardware (RT cores) to make it practical, for the most part. Either way, Nvidia has stood alone in the realm of ray-traced visuals, but that will probably change in 2020.I say \"probably\" because it could be early 2021 before AMD launches a version of Navi with hardware support for ray tracing, depending on how things play out. What we know for certain, however, is that ray tracing is headed to Navi. We know this because Sony confirmed that the custom Navi GPU in its upcoming PlayStation 5 console will feature ray tracing support. And if that wasn't enough, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su indicated in January 2019 that ray tracing hardware for PCs was already \"deep in development.\"It's just a guessing game as to whether a version of Navi with hardware dedicated to ray tracing will emerge on the PC before the PS5 launches at the end of next year, or if it comes out sometime after. My guess is the former. It's hard to imagine another round of higher end Navi GPUs being released without ray tracing support, and it would be unusual for a game console to be technologically superior to the best PC hardware available. So as I write this, I've changed my mind\u2014forget about \"probably,\" AMD will be doing ray tracing on the PC in 2020. Take it to the bank.(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia will launch 7nm GPUsUp to this point, Nvidia has not really had to push the envelope in terms of process nodes, because AMD has not been able to pluck the performance crown out of team green's hands\u2014the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti is still the best graphics card, and if a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Super comes to pass, Nvidia will extend its lead at the top-end even further. Nevertheless, I believe Nvidia will make the transition to 7nm in 2020.AMD is not standing pat. Even though its Radeon RX 5700 XT is not the fastest graphics card on the planet, it's a burly card in its own right. The next version of Navi will kick things up a notch, and Nvidia will respond in kind with another GPU of its own. By making the move to 7nm, Nvidia will be able to pack more features and power into its next-generation Ampere GPUs (or whatever they end up being called).The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Contrary to what the leaks and rumors might suggest, nobody really knows what the actual specifications will be for Nvidia's next-gen GeForce RTX 3080, based on Ampere. Anyone who claims otherwise is making stuff up. However, we can expect more RT cores for ray tracing, more CUDA cores for general purpose graphics, and more Tensor cores for machine learning chores. Higher clocks are likely too, perhaps enabling Nvidia's GPUs to consistently run at more than 2GHz for the first time. Wouldn't that be nice?\u00a0PCI Express 4.0 still won't matter muchI'm calling it now, PCI Express 4.0 will not have a meaningful impact on PCs in 2020. Look, put the Nerf gun down, I'm just the messenger here. Or I suppose soothsayer would be more accurate. Either way, it's not my fault PCIe 4.0 isn't really a big deal in the realm of gaming, it's just the way it is, and will continue to be throughout 2020.That's not say hardware developers should turn their nose up at PCIe 4.0. AMD is already embracing the spec with its third-generation Ryzen processors and accompanying X570 chipset. The primary benefit is having more high-speed lanes, which paves the way for multiple bleeding edge SSDs and more bandwidth for graphics cards. However, PCIe is not much of a bottleneck for graphics, and even though current PCIe 4.0 SSDs are capable of 5,000MB/s file transfers, and faster SSDs are coming soon, it makes virtually no difference in gaming, even when compared to a SATA-based SSD that tops out at around 580MB/s.I think there's a chance Intel finally jumps on board the PCIe 4.0 bus with its 10nm desktop CPUs \u00a0(more on that in a moment), it just won't be a game changing development, at least not in 2020.(Image credit: Intel)Intel finally does 10nm on the desktopRemember when Cannon Lake was supposed to usher in the era of 10nm CPUs for Intel, only to be delayed and ultimately scrapped? Well, even though Cannon Lake is dead in the water, Intel will launch 10nm desktop CPUs in 2020. In fact, I have it from a rock solid source that Intel will \"absolutely\" launch 10nm desktop CPUs in 2020, and they will be \"pretty cool ones\" at that.It doesn't take a leap of faith to believe these will materialize. Yes, Intel's been stretching its 14nm node for what feels like 100 years now, but we finally saw volume shipments of 10nm silicon on the mobile side, with Intel's Ice Lake processors.What's harder to guess is when exactly 10nm desktop CPUs will materialize. I predict they will come out closer to the middle of the year, if not the second half. In the meantime, Comet Lake-S will see another round of 14nm manufacturing to tide us over.AMD will launch 7nm+ Zen 3 CPUs\u00a0While Intel will finally find its way to 10nm in 2020, AMD will roll out fourth-generation Ryzen 4000 processors based on its Zen 3 CPU architecture before the year is over. These CPUs will be based on a refined 7nm+ manufacturing process, and should yield faster clocks, better power efficiency, and perhaps more cores (though Zen 2 already pushed the mainstream category to 16 cores/32 threads).After that, AMD will roll out its Zen 4 CPUs, likely based on either a 6nm or 5nm process node. We'll hear about these towards the end of 2020, though I don't expect them to materialize on retail shelves until sometime in 2021.(Image credit: AMD)New SSDs will push faster speeds and higher capacities\u00a02020 will see the introduction of even more SSDs, which will be faster and higher in capacity. They'll also deliver more bang for your buck, except at the high end. At the very top, SSD makers will push the envelope with even faster PCIe 4.0 models\u2014all current PCIe models are powered by Phison's PS5016-E16 controller, and Phison says it has a next-gen controller in the wings that will push speeds to 6,500MB/s.I'm more excited about seeing SSDs grow in size at more affordable price points. Whereas capacities beyond 2TB are mostly a luxury right now, I think 2020 will see 3TB and 4TB SSDs become cheaper and more feasible. Unless more fires break out and NAND prices go up again.\u00a0DDR5 will finally come to desktops\u00a0DDR5 modules will arrive in 2020 (at long last!), and with them will come double the density and double the bandwidth of DDR4. That will make for some impressive gains in synthetic benchmarking, though I doubt the real-world impact will be anything significant, at least not right away. It will take some time for system platforms to really leverage DDR5, and 2020 is too soon to expect big gains in actual performance.DDR5 could also usher in bigger memory kits, though that will be of limited benefit as well (for gaming PCs, anyway). After all, those who need oodles of RAM can already buy 256GB memory kits. That said, bigger and faster DDR5 memory kits could push down pricing on DDR4 RAM, so that's something to potentially look forward to.\u00a0\n\n\nPaul LillySocial Links NavigationPaul has been playing PC games and raking his knuckles on computer hardware since the Commodore 64.

Supers are retailing now for around $500, which means base 2070s are already dropping in price. If you can find one for around a $50 - $150 discount, now is a perfect time to scoop one up.\u00a0A great example you can usually get your hands-on right now on an EVGA card at a discounted price on Amazon. Its a great OEM card geared towards overclocking enthusiasts (we know who you are). We will sort out and track all the prices as retailers push out deals. This guide is updated regularly, so be sure you to stay tuned if you don't find anything today.\u00a0Best CPU for gaming | Best gaming motherboards | Best DDR4 RAM |\nBest SSD for gaming | Best graphics card | Best gaming monitor\u00a0The cheapest GTX 2070 dealsThe best EVGA RTX 2070 dealsOne of the biggest names for Nvidia GPUs, EVGA has seven RTX 2070 models of varying names. The XC models deserve the most attention as they strike a good balance between price and features, though we did quite like the EVGA RTX 2070 Black card as you can see in our review.At the top, in terms of factory clocks, is the FTW3 model then there are four XC models of varying clock speeds and prices, which all appear to use the same cooling setup except a few models have RGB lighting. Last are the Black and Gaming cards, both of which have reference clocks and no RGB lighting. The RTX 2070 Gaming is also a blower-style cooler, in case you want to stuff it in a smaller enclosure where the open-air coolers would be more problematic.The best Asus RTX 2070 dealsAsus also has a good collection of RTX 2070 models, going for the lucky seven as well for now. There are three ROG Strix models, ranging from the slightly factory overclocked 8G Gaming (1650MHz) to the full-throttle 8G Gaming (1845MHz). The Strix cards all sport a large cooler with three fans and should keep temperatures frosty.A step down from the Strix cards are the Dual models, which drop one fan and shrink the cooler length a bit, but they have a very wide 3-slot design. They're all still factory overclocked (from 1650MHz to 1740MHz on the O8G). The Turbo model fills out the list, with a blower-style cooler and also sporting the same mild factory overclock of 1650MHz. The Dual O8G appears to be the best deal if your PC can handle a triple-slot card.The best Gigabyte RTX 2070 dealsGigabyte has seven different 2070 models as well ... but is it a conspiracy or just coincidence? We may never know. Nearly all of them are triple fan designs, with the exception of the 2070 Mini. The Windforce 2070 model might seem like a step up from the baseline, but it's actually sporting reference clocks (1620MHz), but Windforce actually refers to the fan design and is thus part of all the Gigabyte cards. The Gaming model appears to be the same design with slightly altered colors, while the Aorus branded cards carry the highest overclocks (up to 1815MHz on the Aorus Xtreme).All of Gigabyte's cards, with the exception of Mini, also include RGB lighting with RGB Fusion integration that allows customization of the lights. Gigabyte also has a standard 3-year warranty (in the US at least), but the Aorus cards bump that up to four years. Just beware that outside of the Mini (170mm), these are long cards that may not fit in all cases (280mm, 290mm for the Aorus models).The best MSI RTX 2070 dealsNot to be outdone by its competitors, MSI checks in with a full suite of ten RTX 2070 models. (So much for the conspiracy theory.) These range from reference clocked cards like the Aero and Ventus to beefy factory overclocked models like the Duke and Gaming Z.The Gaming Z has the highest boost clock of 1830MHz. In the middle are a slate of Armor models with dual fans, while the Gaming models include RGB lighting. The Aero is also equipped with a blower fan if that's what you're after. Again, the Duke and Gaming Z cards are quite large, so they may not fit some cases.The best PNY RTX 2070 dealsAt the other end of the spectrum from MSI sits PNY, with only two 2070 models. They're solid enough performers, but it's really going to come down to pricing more than anything. The blower sports reference clocks but has an MSRP that's the same as the Nvidia Founders Edition. The XLR8 model, on the other hand, matches the Founders Edition on clocks and has a dual-fan cooling setup.We'd give the blower a hard pass, as other blowers cost quite a bit less, but the XLR8 is certainly worth a look. The PNY models may not be as flashy as the competition (there's no RGB lighting to speak of), but sometimes that's a good thing. Less is more is the motto here.The best Zotac RTX 2070 dealsZotac offers an even half dozen RTX 2070 models, and if you\u2019re chasing the highest factory overclock speeds, the AMP Extreme model takes the cake. It's clocked at 1860MHz boost, which means it's likely running at 2000MHz in most games (give or take). The GDDR6 gets a small bump to 14.4Gbps as well, which is a rarity for factory overclocks. This is also a big old beast with three 90mm fans needed to keep it cool, but it measure 308mm in length and occupies 2.5 slots, so it's certainly not going to fit in any daintier cases. The Amp Extreme Core is the same design, but with a slightly less aggressive 1815MHz boost clock.If you're not after a massive card, Zotac offers two Mini 2070 models that measure just 211mm, and they still include dual fans. One has reference clocks (1620MHz boost), while the other bumps that up to 1650MHz. Not that you couldn't manually overclock any RTX 2070 to get similar results. Rounding out the collection are a blower model along with dual-fan Amp, which is arguably Zotac's best combination of performance (1740MHz), features, and price.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\nAsus\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred's love of computers dates back to the dark ages when his dad brought home a DOS 2.3 PC and he left his C-64 behind. He eventually built his first custom PC in 1990 with a 286 12MHz, only to discover it was already woefully outdated when Wing Commander was released a few months later. He holds a BS in Computer Science from Brigham Young University and has been working as a tech journalist since 2004, writing for AnandTech, Maximum PC, and PC Gamer. From the first S3 Virge '3D decelerators' to today's GPUs, Jarred keeps up with all the latest graphics trends and is the one to ask about game performance.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest in Graphics Cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsus appears to have quietly changed the design of its Q-Release PCIe slot after claims of potential GPU pin damage \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree lucky folks in India can win the dubious honour of buying an RTX 5080 GPU at Nvidia MSRP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup allegedly trying to smuggle Nvidia Blackwell chips stare down bail set at over $1 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI will be crammed in more of the graphics pipeline as Nvidia and Microsoft are bringing AI shading to a DirectX preview next month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia says it's sold twice as many RTX 50-series cards as RTX 40-series in the first 5 weeks.

The feature uses a foveated rendering approach which focuses sharpness toward the center of the lens without wasting extra processing power toward the edges where the image will be blurred by the lens anyway.\n\nTaking advantage of the Variable Rate Shading capability of the \u2018Turing\u2019 architecture in Nvidia\u2019s RTX GPUs, the company today announced and released a new feature called Variable Rate Supersampling (VRSS). The feature allows games to be supersampled for added sharpness and clarity, but only toward the center of the lens. This allows GPU rendering power to be spent where it matters most.\nFor VR enthusiasts, supersampling is a well known technique for increasing clarity when there\u2019s GPU horsepower to spare. Traditional supersampling techniques render the entire image at a higher resolution than the target display, which can make a surprising difference to the clarity of fine details in today\u2019s VR headsets. But traditional supersampling is computationally expensive, and if you crank the knobs too high, you\u2019ll start missing frames (which leads to an uncomfortable experience in a VR headset).\nVRSS is designed to be a more efficient supersampling method that\u2019s specific to VR. It takes advantage of the fact that the lenses of most VR headsets have a narrow \u2018sweet spot\u2019\u2014a small region where lens clarity is the greatest\u2014while the image gets blurrier toward the edges of the lenses. The human eye itself also only sees in high detail in a small sweet spot in the center (called the fovea). It therefore doesn\u2019t make much sense to spend extra processing power sharpening the blurry parts of the image, which is exactly the premise of VRSS.\nSEE ALSOHands-on: Samsung\u2018s Android XR Headset is a Curious Combo of Quest & Vision Pro, With One Stand-out AdvantageImage courtesy NVIDIA\nVRSS uses Variable Rate Shading, a feature baked into RTX cards, to create a \u2018foveated\u2019 supersampling region at the center of the image while leaving the rest of the image alone. This means that GPU\u00a0processing power can be more efficiently used to sharpen the center of the view. Nvidia says VRSS allows for more sharpness in the foveal region with less processing power.\nNVIDIA test system specs: GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, Intel Core i7-6700K, 32GB, Windows 10, HTC Vive Pro | Image courtesy NVIDIA\nRunning on an Nvidia test system, the company claims that VRSS achieves 4x supersampling in Boneworks while maintaining a 120 FPS average, compared to roughly 75 FPS when using a traditional 4x supersample.\nThe feature is also designed to dynamically enable and scale according to available GPU power. If there\u2019s extra processing power not being used, VRSS will supersample up to 8x, or disable itself entirely if necessary.\n\nVRSS is available with the newest Nvidia drivers released today (you can download and install them through the GeForce Experience application). You\u2019ll need to enable the feature in the Nvidia Control Panel; Nvidia recommends setting VRSS to \u2018Adaptive\u2019, and warns that using the \u2018Always On\u2019 feature may result in framerates dropping below the headset\u2019s native rate.\nImage courtesy NVIDIA\nUnlikes previous foveated supersampling techniques from NVIDIA, like Lens Matched Shading, VRSS\u00a0luckily doesn\u2019t require\u00a0specific integration with Nvidia GameWorks tools. However, there are some technical requirements:\u00a0games must be based on DX11 or use forward renderers and support MSAA to work with VRSS.\nCurrently Nvidia is only enabling the feature for games which it has specifically tested, which is 26 at present:\n\nBattlewake\nBoneworks\nEternity Warriors VR\nHot Dogs, Horseshoes and Hand Grenades\nIn Death\nJob Simulator\nKilling Floor: Incursion\nL.A.

I use it HEAVILY on my game QuestORama (available on SideQuest) to squeeze the most out of the hardware. It\u2019s not terrible, but it\u2019s not the eye tracking compression we really need. \nI hope it works better then that video shows. When VRSS is on, the image just looked more blurry. But the compression of the video on YouTube can be very unreliable at times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscarlet\n\n\n\nprobably youtube, SSAA by definition will not blur an image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaphael\n\n\n\nNo.  It was clearer with VRSS on.  Maybe you need new eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrip\n\n\n\nAs far as I know Quest doesn\u2019t have foveated rendering at all.  Only Oculus Go, unless I missed something.  Also to answer your (possibly rhetorical) question the key is the \u201cRTX\u201d prefix, not the \u201c20\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor Bambi\n\n\n\nQuest absolutely has FFR. https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/quest/latest/concepts/mobile-ffr/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchadows\n\n\n\nThis is basically the opposite of what Occulus and Pimax do with their FFR.\nThe image isn\u2019t degraded the more you\u2019re distancing from the center, but the opposite, the image is enhanced to more you go toward the center (well in reality there is just 2 resolutions here: normal and supersampled, not a gradient).\nIt helps lowering the cost of supersampling, by not applying it to less sensible area of the image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJerald Doerr\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard see on a phone screen\u2026 But after checking it out on my TV can see it does what AA should do\u2026  Gets rid of the shimmer/over contrasty look makes  looking through a chain chain-link look good instead of all shimmery/pixelated on the edges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ilbaize\n\n\n\nlatest drivers installed and there\u2019s no option in the 3D management settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJerald Doerr\n\n\n\nummmmm\u2026 I did the same thing.. than remember I don\u2019t have a 20xx card\u2026\u2026 im a 1080\u2026.   so I feel a bit dumb asking\u2026. do you have a 20xx and the options still not coming up?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLucas Cooper-Bey\n\n\n\nSame here. Im glad it not just me. 2080ti. Now what?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSerpher\n\n\n\nTried newest drivers with RecRoom and\u2026 nothing. No such option available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexbagboy\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s under program settings not global settings. Showed up for me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJarom Madsen\n\n\n\nDang. Ok, RTX cards, NOW you have my attention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrip\n\n\n\nRight!?  I will put an RTX GPU on the credit card the moment DCS World is added to the list of supported titles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchadows\n\n\n\nAt least, this time it is managed at driver level. No need for the devs to implement it because they did implemented VRS (also brought with Turing architecture) which would have helped in basically the same way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Jakobs\n\n\n\nDamn, you have to set it manually for every freaking game\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrip\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s just a couple clicks though.  The problem is that Nvidia aren\u2019t allowing us to test it ourselves to see if it works, they are blocking it from being used on any game they haven\u2019t tested and approved.  There really should be a big red button with warnings that things are likely about to go horribly wrong rather then outright locking us out of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Jakobs\n\n\n\nI agree with you that they should allow you to set it manually for any game you want. But I hate having to tweak settings on a game to game base, especially if it\u2019s outside the game (I install VR games from within VR).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeshaya\n\n\n\nUgh I wish older cards could handle that, that seems like such a useful feature\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchadows\n\n\n\nDoes someone know how it coexist with the game or SteamVR supersampling?\nIs it possible to \u201cundersample\u201d a little (nothing as drastic as VRS used for FFR currently) to lower quality on the edges, and supersampling would apply above the undersampled resolution, or does the VRSS apply on the 100%  resolution, not considering SteamVR + game supersampling ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrip\n\n\n\nI would assume you could/would set the basic resolution lower, then let the supersampling utilized the saved computing power for the center region of the displays.  Whether or not you\u2019ll be able to set the resolution to less than native and have VRSS active at the same time I can\u2019t say, but you certainly should be able to.  Maybe they\u2019ll assume that anyone with an RTX card has no need to downsample though, they don\u2019t know flight sims like we do!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndota\n\n\n\nthumbs up\nyes foveation is the right way to go in VR/AR\nwith foveation even less capable cards can go VR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJerald Doerr\n\n\n\nOK\u2026. I do have to say I\u2019m sure this is something the 1080 and even lower cards could do just like RTX/ Path tracing but Nvidia locks us out to sell 20xx cards\u2026. smart\u2026\u2026 but not cool\u2026 \n And yes\u2026.. I fully understand 10xx can pathtrace but WAy slower\u2026.   this is just simple AA\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncrusnik\n\n\n\nNo, multiple different rendering resolutions in the same frame without rendering the whole frame in each resolution is not possible to do without hardware support \u2013 which was introduced in the RTX series.\nAlso pathtracing has been a thing for 40+ years. It\u2019s been generally done on CPUs until recently and has been super slow. RTX adds hardware features which significantly improve raytracing performance. That\u2019s the game changer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJerald Doerr\n\n\n\nOh yeah, data\u2026 That makes since\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npaleion\n\n\n\nFantastic, will try this out later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexbagboy\n\n\n\nHere are instructions on how to enable it on other games through nvidia profile inspector, this indie game developer figured it out. \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/ekweh1/ces_nvidia_drivers_adds_variable_rate_shading_for/fdkdqym/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x\n I will do some testing later on but I was able to enable it in DCS World, VTOL VR and Dirt Rally 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJose Veiras\n\n\n\nThis is a great technical new path for game developers, but will only blow your mind of gamers if: the game is integrated with an eye tracking device like Tobii Eye Tracking, because the idea is to dynamically set the foveated rendering area around the position on screen where the user is looking, using only the center of the screen will accentuate the tunnel vision, and the user is pretty close to a massive screen or is using a VR headset that supports eye tracking like HTC Vive Pro Eye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n39,929FansLike13,574FollowersFollow66,541FollowersFollow27,800SubscribersSubscribe  \n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Headlines\n\n\n\n\nDespite Years of Reports to the Contrary, PC VR Just Won\u2019t Die\u2014In fact, It\u2019s Growing\n\nMar 18, 2025 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMeta Releases Quest Camera Access for Developers, Promising Even More Immersive MR Games\n\nMar 18, 2025 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLearn How to Train Your Dragon in Pet Simulator \u2018Eggy\u2019, Coming to Quest 3 Next Month\n\nMar 18, 2025 \n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures & Reviews\n\n\n\n\nVR Design Unpacked: Why \u2018Embodiment\u2019 is More Important Than \u2018Immersion\u2019\n\nMar 7, 2025 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFirst Impressions of \u2018Surreal Touch\u2019 Third-party Vision Pro Controllers\n\nJan 7, 2025 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Playbook for Making Great VR Trailers Without Mixed Reality Capture \u2013 Inside XR Design\n\nDec 31, 2024 \n\n\n   \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

VRSS will only activate when the GPU is not already fully utilized. This means activating this feature shouldn\u2019t prevent you from maintaining frame rate. This is important in VR because dropping frames can make you feel sick.\nSupported Titles\nThis is a driver-level feature, so it doesn\u2019t need integrated by developers. However,\u00a0it will only work on a specific list of 24 games which have been tested by NVIDIA. As of writing, these are the supported titles:\nBattlewakeBoneworksEternity Warriors VRHot Dogs, Horseshoes and Hand GrenadesIn DeathJob SimulatorKilling Floor: IncursionL.A. Noire: The VR Case FilesLone EchoMercenary 2: Silicon RisingOnwardPavlov VRRaw DataRec RoomRick and Morty: Virtual Rick-alityRobo RecallSairento VRSerious Sam VR: The Last HopeSkeet: VR Target ShootingSpace Pirate TrainerSpecial Force VR: Infinity WarSpiderman: Far from HomeSpiderman: Homecoming \u2013 Virtual Reality ExperienceTalos Principle VRThe Soulkeeper VR\nUpdate The Driver\nTo use VRSS, you\u2019ll need to be on driver version 441.87 or later, as that was the version which added the feature. This is a stable release \u2014 so there is no need to download Beta drivers.\nIf you use the GeForce Experience tool, you can update your driver using it as usual.\nOtherwise, you can download the latest driver from NVIDIA\u2019s website.\nEnable In NVIDIA Control Panel\nTo open the NVIDIA Control Panel, right click your desktop to find the shortcut. Once it opens, navigate to the Manage 3D settings tab.\n\nWithin 3D Settings, select the \u2018Program Settings\u2019 tab and scroll down to the very bottom setting.\n\nSet it to \u2018Adaptive\u2019 in order to have the driver enable it when performance allows, and increase and decrease it based on what your card can currently handle.\nThat\u2019s it! VRSS will now be enabled for the game you selected. Note that you\u2019ll need to manually do this for each supported game you want to use VRSS. Hopefully NVIDIA adds an option to enable it for all VRSS supporting games in the future.\nDon\u2019t forget to check out our\u00a0CES 2020 Coverage Hub right\u00a0here\u00a0for all of the latest announcements for VR and AR tech from the show!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVR Experiences\n\nVR Exploration Experience Brink Traveler Adds Lake Tahoe\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nSarah Thwaites\n\n\n    Today\n \n\n\n\nWeekly Newsletter\nGet a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news.\n\n\nCheck your inbox to confirm!(it might also be in your spam folder)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFitness\n\nMeta CTO Explains The Reason For Killing Move, Quest's Fitness Tracking Feature\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nDavid Heaney\n\n\n    Today\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeadsets & Tech\n\nVarjo XR-4 To Require $2500/Year Subscription For Advanced Mixed Reality Features\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nDavid Heaney\n\n\n    Today\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUnlock the full potential of UploadVR and support our independent journalism with an ad-free experience by becoming a Member.\n\nBecome a Member\nNot Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly Newsletter\n\n\nSign up to get a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news, straight to your inbox.\n\n\nCheck your inbox to confirm!(it might also be in your spam folder)\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLatest Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVR Experiences\n\nVR Exploration Experience Brink Traveler Adds Lake Tahoe\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nSarah Thwaites\n\n\n    Today\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nFitness\n\nMeta CTO Explains The Reason For Killing Move, Quest's Fitness Tracking Feature\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nDavid Heaney\n\n\n    Today\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nHeadsets & Tech\n\nVarjo XR-4 To Require $2500/Year Subscription For Advanced Mixed Reality Features\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nDavid Heaney\n\n\n    Today\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nVR Gaming\n\nRaise A Dragon In Pet Sim Eggy, Launching Next Month On Quest\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nJames Tocchio\n\n\n        17 March\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nApp Development\n\nQuest SDK v74 Brings Thumb Microgestures & Improved Audio To Expression\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nDavid Heaney\n\n\n        17 March\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nGlasses & AR Tech\n\nSnap Spectacles See Peridots Play Together & Now Use GPS\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nIan Hamilton\n\n\n        17 March\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nDeals & Discounts\n\nQuest's Spring Savings & Steam's Spring Sale Offer Discounts On Blockbuster VR Games\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nDavid Heaney\n\n\n        16 March\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSocial VR\n\nThis Working TARDIS From Doctor Who Travels Through Resonite\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nK.

A head-to-head comparison helps explain whether a CPU or a GPU is best for your high-performance ML solution.Tammy Carter      At its Data-Centric Innovation Day in April 2019, Intel unveiled the new 2nd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors  (formerly Cascade Lake). The parts divide across the Platinum, Gold,  Silver, and Bronze lines. At the top of the line is the Platinum 9200,  also known as Advanced Performance (AP). The 9282 has 56 cores per  processor in a multichip module (two dies in one package, resulting in  double the core count and double the memory). Measuring 76.0 \u00d7 72.5 mm,  it\u2019s Intel\u2019s largest package to date. Focusing on density,  high-performance computing, and advanced analytics, this packaged server  can only be purchased from OEMs who buy from Intel and make  modifications. One of the new features of the second-generation  Xeon processors is Intel Deep Learning Boost (Intel DL Boost), also  known as the Vector Neural Network Instruction (VNNI). VNNI combines  three instructions into a single instruction, resulting in better use of  computational resources and cache, while reducing the likelihood of  bandwidth bottlenecks. Secondly, VNNI enables INT8 deep-learning  inference, which boosts performance with \u201clittle loss of accuracy.\u201d The  8-bit inference yields a theoretical peak compute gain of 4X over the  32-bit floating-point (FP32) operations.Fast-forward to May 13, 2019, when Intel announced that its new high-end CPU outperforms Nvidia\u2019s  GPU on ResNet-50, a popular convolutional neural network (CNN) for  computer vision. Quoting Intel, \u201cToday, we have achieved leadership  performance of 7878 images per second on ResNet-50 with our latest  generation of Intel Xeon Scalable processors, outperforming 7844 images  per second on Nvidia Tesla V100, the best GPU performance as published  by Nvidia on its website including T4.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Employing  the Xeon Platinum 9292, Intel achieved 7878 images/s by creating 28  virtual instances of four CPU cores each (using a batch size of 11) (Table 1).  An open-source deep learning framework, Intel Optimized Caffe, was used  to optimize the ResNet-50 code. Intel recently added four general  optimizations for the new INT8 inference: activation memory  optimization, weight sharing, convolution algorithm tuning, and first  convolution transformation.Nvidia wasted no time in  replying to Intel\u2019s performance claims, releasing the statement, \u201cIt\u2019s  not every day that one of the world\u2019s leading tech companies highlights  the benefits of your products. Intel did just that last week, comparing  the inference performance of two of their most expensive CPUs to Nvidia  GPUs.\u201d Nvidia\u2019s detailed reply was a dual-prong response centering on  power efficiency and performance per processor.The 9282 and V100 and T4To  better understand these claims and counterclaims, it\u2019s useful to first  step back and take a quick review of the V100 and the T4. Supporting a  memory bandwidth of 9000 GB/s, the Nvidia V100 has 640 Tensor cores plus  5120 CUDA cores with 16 GB HBM2. The V100\u2019s specified performance is  7.8 TFLOPS of double-precision performance and 125 TFLOPS of Tensor  performance. The next-generation Tesla T4 boasts 320 Turing  Tensor cores and 2560 CUDA cores with 16 GB GDDR6 memory for peak 8.1  TLFOPS of double precision. First introduced as part of the Volta  architecture, Tensor cores are extremely efficient at mixed precision  computation.In its response, Nvidia points out that, since there  are actually two processors in a single Intel package, the comparison  measurement should be on a per processor basis. This approach  effectively halves Intel\u2019s inference score. Intel\u2019s own benchmark  description\u201428 virtual instances multiplied by four cores equals 112  cores\u2014confirms that Intel was using both processors on the multi-chip  die. Second, Intel\u2019s performance numbers are achievable only when  ResNet-50 was written with Caffe, and then optimized by Intel\u2019s  Optimization for Caffe. Nvidia\u2019s TensorRT platform, which is able to  take input from most all of the popular frameworks, including PyTorch,  MxNet, TensorFlow, and Caffe, was used to create the deep-learning  inference applications used in its benchmarks. Third, Intel used  8-bit integer precision, whereas Nvidia used a mixture of 16- and 32-bit  floating point. Next, while the Platinum 9282 has just been announced  and is unavailable to most customers, the V100 was introduced back in  2017, and the T4 in 2018. Finally, there\u2019s the issue of price. Current estimates for just one of the Xeon\u2019s 9282 processors range from $30,000 to $50,000.\u00a0 While  on Amazon, you can score a V100 for $6,479 or a T4 card for $2,799.  Even if you still view Intel\u2019s dual socket as a single processing chip,  the result of the comparison seems to be that Intel\u2019s CPU barely wins on  performance, but it requires a lot more cooling, power, and money.Judging Benchmarks In  considering how to best compare these two platforms, another question  comes to mind: Did Intel pick the best benchmark for comparison? One  measure of complexity for AI models is the number of parameters.  Released in 2015, by Microsoft Research Asia, ResNet-50 first  successfully took the stage at the ImageNet competition that same year. Bidirectional  Encode Representation from Transformers (BERT) is an AI model released  by Google in 2018 for natural language processing tasks, such as  question answering. Compared to ResNet-50, which has 25 million  parameters, BERT uses 340 million parameters\u2014a 13X increase. Due to its  additional complexity, Nvidia claims that using the BERT benchmark would  provide a better test. For this benchmark, notice that NVIDIA used a dual-socket Xeon Gold 6240 with 384 GB of RAM running at 2.6 GHz (Table 2).  It was run with FP32 precision, inside an Intel TensorFlow (TF) Docker  container. A batch size of four yielded the best CPU score, so the GPU  used the same batch size. The GPU also used TensorFlow with automatic  mixed precision enabled. Some would argue that using the Xeon  Gold 6420 with 18 cores instead of the Xeon Platinum 9282 isn\u2019t exactly  comparing apples to apples when considering the previous ResNet-50 test.  The price and limited availability of Xeon 9282 may have helped  determine why Nvidia didn\u2019t use a Xeon Platinum 9282 for the test.  Although this benchmark uses dual Xeon processors, Nvidia didn\u2019t apply  the \u201cperformance per processor\u201d metric and didn\u2019t compare the Xeon Gold  to the powerhouse Volta 100. Perhaps these choices were also made to  compensate for lack of access to a Xeon 9282.Continuing to press  the point that GPUs are better, Nvidia added a comparison of a  recommender system known as Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) from  the MLPerf training benchmark (Table 3). Used in applications  such as those suggesting posts you might like on Facebook and Twitter,  and recommending content for you on YouTube and Netflix, NCF utilizes  the prior interaction of users to the offered items to formulate its  recommendations.The systems used for these comparison tests were  the same as used for the BERT benchmark. On the CPU, the Intel Benchmark  for NCF on TensorFlow provided the benchmark results. The cynical might  notice that this test only used one Xeon processor. Nvidia notes that  the tests used a single-socket CPU configuration because it yields a  better score than using dual processor. The Bottom LineWhile  all of this competitive posturing is interesting, the real question is  how do the results apply to our embedded military and aerospace arena?  Included among the 50 new Intel SKUs are three \u201cGold\u201d chips that support  long lifecycles and better thermal performance: the 6238T (22 cores,  1.9 GHz, 125 TDP), 6230T (20 cores, 2.1 GHz, 125 TDP) and 5220T (18  cores, 2.2 GHZ, and 105 TDP). Fortunately, the Gold 6238T is very  similar to the Gold 6240 that Nvidia used in its benchmarking.Curtiss-Wright, in partnership with Wolf Advanced Technology,  recently announced its new OpenVPX Turing products based on the TU104  GPU. The TU104 GPU is the foundation of Nvidia\u2019s Quadro and Tesla  products, including the Tesla T4 compared in the Nvidia benchmarks, and  the Quadro RTX5000E featured in the VPX3-4935 3U and VPX6-4955 6U  OpenVPX boards (see figure). The Tesla T4 has 2560 CUDA cores and 320 Tensor cores,  while the RTX5000E boasts 3072 CUDA cores plus 384 Tensor cores. At 11.2  peak TFLOPS FP32, the RTX5000E improves on the performance of the T4  (8.1 TFLOPS).The VPX3-4935 3U OpenVPX module, which features Nvidia Turing GPU technology, is designed for intense processing and AI in 3U HPEC systems.Yes, with the introduction of the VNNI in its new  processors, Intel has achieved up to a 14X improvement in inference  performance over its first-generation Intel Xeon processors. Even  Nvidia, conceded that \u201cIntel\u2019s latest Cascade Lake CPUs include new  instructions that improve inference, making them the best CPUs for  inference.\u201d However, NVIDIA further added that CPUs aren\u2019t in the  same league with Nvidia GPUs, which feature dedicated  deep-learning-optimized Tensor cores. The benchmarks above back up this  observation. Since GPUs were designed to perform parallel processing,  it\u2019s no surprise that they\u2019re more efficient than CPUs in AI training  and inference applications, due to the parallel nature of the  processing. In the end, the Xeon CPUs are general-purpose processors  that can do a decent job at inference if needed. Nvidia GPUs, though,  which are designed to be the ideal solution for inference workloads, are  faster and more energy-efficient for parallel workloads and AI  applications.Therefore, we can only conclude that the answer is no, you should not send a CPU to do a GPU\u2019s job.
