However, the following three stocks -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.38%), ASML Holdings (ASML 0.27%), and NVIDIA (NVDA -3.24%) -- have all absolutely trounced the market this year, despite their hardware-focused businesses and a pandemic-fueled recession.\n\nTSM Year to Date Total Returns (Daily) data by YCharts\nWhat's their secret? Each of these companies plays in some of the best long-term growth markets of 5G and artificial intelligence (AI) computing. While the COVID-19 pandemic is clearly weighing on demand for certain tech products, the 5G and AI races are proving to be sectors in which everyone is still competing, and demand for these leading-edge products isn't slowing down.\nBut merely playing in growth industries alone isn't enough. On top of that, these three companies also have deep competitive advantages over rivals that have made them truly unstoppable stocks. Here's how these three companies have built and maintained these killer advantages, and why they should continue winning in 2020 and beyond.\u00a0\n\nThree tech stocks with formidable moats. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing: the world's best manufacturer\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing just had its earnings report last week, and the results were something to behold. Consider this: Taiwan Semi's largest segment is in producing chips for smartphones, making up 47% of its sales.  Amid the coronavirus recession, smartphone units are expected to decline by the mid-teens for 2020. Even worse for Taiwan Semi, it was just prevented from shipping chips to its second largest customer in China's Huawei as of May 15, because of new U.S. trade rules. \n\n\n\n\n\nYet in spite of all this, TSM delivered blockbuster results\u00a0for the second quarter, while also raising guidance for the remainder of the year.  TSM now anticipates growing its revenue by over 20% this year, above last quarter's full-year guidance of mid- to high teens. \nWhat's TSM's killer advantage that has allowed it to not just survive but thrive amid the smartphone lull and Huawei ban?\nAs chips have become smaller and smaller, and packed with more and more transistors, they run up against the limits of Moore's Law, which states that chips can become twice as powerful every 18 months to two years. Recently, chips have gotten so small and densely packed that it has made their manufacturing increasingly difficult. \nAs the world's leading foundry that makes different chips for a diverse array of customers, Taiwan Semi was able to pool its collective knowledge and leap ahead of Intel (INTC 0.93%) in the race to a leading-edge 7nm chip in 2018. As companies and entire countries are clamoring for leading chips to cement their own advantages, Taiwan Semi's capabilities are now in extremely high demand.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo even as Huawei fell by the wayside, demand from other chip companies has easily filled in the gap, leaving TSM's outlook unchanged. And Taiwan Semi isn't slowing down either; it expects to move on to 5nm chips and sell them before the year is out.\nWhile other semiconductor manufacturers are still struggling to bring 7nm chips to market, it appears as if the manufacturing gap between TSM and rivals is widening, not narrowing. \nASML: Taiwan Semiconductor's most important vendor\nWhat enables TSM's efficient scaling of smaller and smaller chips? Much of the credit goes to another company with its own killer advantage: ASML Holdings.\nASML is the sole provider of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV), a technology that was 20 years in the making with no certainty any company would ever get it right. Fortunately, ASML managed to crack the code just in time for the 7nm node, when EUV would become a differentiator over multi-patterning. Since the technology was so hard to achieve, ASML basically has a monopoly on EUV technology today. \n\n\n\n\n\nEUV is so important because it dramatically cuts down the number of manufacturing steps -- which can number in the hundreds -- that are needed to produce tiny chips with billions of transistors. As such, ASML has seen demand for EUV greatly increase over the past two years, and keep in mind these machines go for $100 million to $150 million a pop.\nLike TSM, ASML also recently had its second-quarter earnings release, and the results were impressive. Despite some delays in the first quarter due to logistics constraints, ASML management has left its initial positive 2020 growth projections unchanged. Due to the opening back up of the supply chain, ASML saw a 35% growth over the first quarter, and had every shipment been recognized within the quarter, quarter-over-quarter revenue growth would have been an even greater 50%. CEO Peter Winnick said:\n\nWith significant work-from-home and remote learning activities continuing, segments such as data center and communication infrastructure continue to be strong. Demand for consumer-related electronics, for example, smartphones may be under some near term stress due to the economic impact from COVID and our customers indicate they see continued strength in end markets requiring advanced nodes. And this is reflected in our stable demand. \n\nWhile overall electronics sales may be muted, companies are still aggressively rolling out 5G, and data center customers are investing to keep up with the work-from-home economy. That means leading-edge nodes enabled by ASML's EUV technology should see consistent demand, pulling ASML's stock along with it.\nNVIDIA: CUDA keeps competitors away\nAnother stock that has skyrocketed in spite of the pandemic is NVIDIA. Once again, NVIDIA is defying the COVID-19 recession because of its competitive advantages within key segments that are doing well in the pandemic:\u00a0 video games and AI computing.\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA emerged as a leader in graphics chips (GPUs) in the early 2000s, and 20 years and $20 billion in research and development investment later, it's a lead that the company still maintains to this day. In a video gaming world that is far larger now and still growing quite fast, NVIDIA's gaming chip growth rate should accelerate amid the COVID-19 pandemic into next year.\nHowever, in 2006, NVIDIA developed its CUDA platform -- a single architecture that combines hardware, software, and algorithms, which opens up GPUs to the capabilities of parallel processing other forms of data besides visual graphics. As it turns out, GPUs are ideally suited to the accelerated computing capabilities for AI that can't be achieved with typical CPU processors alone. \nThe CUDA platform incorporates not only NVIDIA's advanced chips but also system software, programmable algorithms, libraries, systems, and services. This first-mover, interconnected walled garden platform provides a strong \"moat\" for NVIDIA compared with other competitive chips that may be more easily interchangeable. And NVIDIA continues to widen its moat under founder and CEO Jensen Huang, who continually reinvests in better and better GPUs, such as the company's brand-new AI A100 chip unveiled in May. \nWhile the graphics segment is gearing up for the next wave of gaming consoles hitting the market later this year, NVIDIA's data center AI chips are already taking off, with the company's data center segment up 80% year-over-year in Q1, despite the COVID-19 outbreak. Clearly, NVIDIA's formidable position in these in-demand segments gives it a killer advantage to survive the COVID-19 pandemic and thrive on the other side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBilly Duberstein owns shares of ASML Holding and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.

With almost seven in 10 consumers saying that they will continue to order food online even as COVID-19 restrictions are eased, UOB has tied-up with Getz to help F&B businesses provide home delivery services more cost effectively. Under the collaboration, F&B merchants using Getz\u2019s food delivery solution will only need to pay transaction fees capped at a maximum of four per cent of their online sales \u2013 a discount of up to 50 per cent from Getz\u2019s usual rates. This enables them to retain more income from each online food order they have delivered through Getz\u2019s network of logistics providers. For F&B merchants without an online presence, the UOB-Getz tie-up will also enable them to set up their online store, complete with digital payment capabilities, in less than a week. Getz\u2019s solution also enables F&B operators to overcome their cash flow concerns, a top concern for more than one in two small businesses in Singapore (55 per cent), according to a UOB survey. Using the Getz solution, they will receive payment in just two business days, thereby providing some cash flow relief. Mr Mervyn Koh, Country Head of Business Banking Singapore, UOB, said, \u201cAs a result of the business disruptions caused by COVID-19, many F&B companies have suffered significant falls in revenue. Even as many went online, many smaller companies found setting up their online storefront and managing the cost of using food delivery services an added stress during already challenging times.  \u201cAs such, we not only wanted to help more of our nation\u2019s restaurants, cafes and hawker stalls generate revenue by going online, but also enable them to retain most of the profits from their toil. Through the collaboration, we not only help F&B businesses overcome their immediate cost challenges but also support them in enhancing their business models for the long term by having multiple revenue streams and a wider customer base.\u201d Under the collaboration, UOB will also support F&B merchants who are using Getz\u2019s solution with their marketing efforts. The Bank will feature these F&B merchants on UOB\u2019s The Dining Advisor online marketplace which attracts more than 43,000 diners monthly. The Bank will also offer UOB cardmembers promotional codes to order from these merchants, helping them attract new customers and build customer loyalty. These promotional codes will be featured on The Dining Advisor and the Bank\u2019s all-in-one mobile banking app, UOB Mighty.   Story continues Mr Steve Wah, Managing Director, Getz, said, \u201cWhile more F&B businesses are going digital to cater to the change in consumer dining habits, many are finding it a challenge to stand out and to attract new customers. As such, it is important for them to market their business in order to receive online orders. Our collaboration with UOB enables us to provide our F&B merchants an edge as they will be able to reach an existing pool of consumers who are actively looking for dining options.\u201cIn addition, merchants will also be able to use Getz\u2019s solution to create a digital customer relationship management system. This will help them to market to their customers more easily and cost-effectively, thereby helping to improve customer retention for more sustainable sales growth across their in-store and online channels.\u201dA F&B business who has taken up the solution is Mr Sylvester Soon, second-generation owner of Melben Seafood Restaurant. \u201cWhile the economy has re-opened gradually, my experience during the circuit breaker period highlighted the importance of having an online sales channel to increase my business\u2019 resilience. Through Getz\u2019s solution, I was able to double my online sales, thus helping to minimise the impact of the circuit breaker on my overall sales revenue. I was also able to manage my online food orders and the delivery processes efficiently and easily.\u201cI am looking forward to the cost savings that I will be able to gain from fulfilling food deliveries under UOB\u2019s and Getz\u2019s collaboration. The savings will make a big difference in ensuring that it is profitable for me to continue offering food delivery options to my customers in the long run. The collaboration will also give us a boost in our marketing efforts, enabling Melben Seafood Restaurant to reach new customers,\u201d Mr Soon said.Mr Paul Ho, chief officer at iCompareLoan, said, \u201cride hailing and food-hailing apps are especially useful in a crisis like this.\u201dGojek integrates with DBS Paylah! platform to expand access DBS Bank and Gojek on 15 July announced that more than 1.7 million DBS PayLah! users can now book and pay for their Gojek rides directly through the PayLah! platform. The move will provide more convenient access to transport services and boost the adoption of digital payments.The integration of Gojek\u2019s services into the DBS PayLah! platform deepens the strategic partnership between the two companies, which was inked in 2018 at the time of Gojek\u2019s launch in Singapore, where all five million DBS/POSB customers enjoyed exclusive early access to Gojek\u2019s services. More than 100,000 Gojek rides were booked by PayLah! users in the first month of the launch.The post Getz and UOB collaboration helps lower food delivery costs for F&B appeared first on iCompareLoan Resources.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 2080 Ti Founders Edition (Image credit: Nvidia)Chinese publication IThome reported today that Nvidia is ostensibly discontinuing the GeForce RTX 2070, RTX 2070 Super, RTX 2080 Super, and RTX 2080 Ti. We've reached out to Nvidia, but the chipmaker has told us that it doesn't comment on rumors or speculation.If we look at it objectively, it makes sense to start phasing out Turing-powered models to dedicate resources for the new and upcoming Ampere graphics cards. If Nvidia's continues to use the same development cycle for Ampere, the chipmaker should already have working samples of Ampere. And if things progress as they are, mass production would likely commence in August.IThome's next claim is a bit controversial, though. The media alleges that Nvidia has purportedly suggested that its partners raise the prices on the aforementioned Turing graphics cards at the beginning of this month. The rumored reasons behind the chipmaker's recommendation are the rising interest in cryptocurrency mining and insufficient supply on TSMC's part. As a reminder, TSMC manufactures the Turing silicon for Nvidia on the foundry's 12nm FinFET process node. However, TSMC also has many other big-name clients, including Apple, AMD, and Qualcomm, so the foundry's services are always in high demand.Nvidia might start gradually withdrawing the GeForce RTX 2080 and RTX 2080 Ti graphics card from the market to make way for the next best thing. If the information is accurate, the chipmaker could announce the GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3080 Ti in September, which is the rumored month for Ampere's launch. IThome thinks that the announcement will take place on September 17, but the new outlet wouldn't swear by it though.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (8)\n\n\n\nZhiye LiuSocial Links NavigationNews Editor and Memory ReviewerZhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

Are they crazy? I wouldn't buy one now if they lowered prices on them.\n\nAnd I would hate to have some 1500+ 2080Ti card right now knowing it will be worth about 500 as soon as the 30x0 series launches.\n\nCue a mountain of \"2080Ti for sale... only used once... only bought last week... i'm not really using it as much as i was going to... i don't game as much as i used to... won in a competition... never opened\" fake adverts in next two months!\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkyBill40\n\n\nPretty sure the prices are already on the rise, albeit slowly.

Down. You'll get stuck eating a big chunk of depreciation if you buy now. Wait for the prices to bottom out, and then buy one if you must and can't afford RTX 30.\nInvalidError said:AMD said it has sorted out its Navi power-efficiency issues, though even if it has, that does nothing about soaring GPU prices.The proto renders JayzTwoCents shows in a recent video (one with 3 fans and one with 2 fans) both have 2x8-pin connectors. That may but subject to change, but what if it isn't? If their 3070 competitor has 2x8-pin, apparently they are still having some sort of power issues when Nvidia's AIB's are showing cards on their websites with a single 8-pin\n.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 8 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Flower\u2019s beastly 2800W power supply lands at $899 \u2014 enough juice to power a couple of RTX 5090 GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei's Microsoft Windows license for PCs expires this month, company launching PCs with Harmony OS: Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 50-series GPU scalping extends to system integrators \u2014 over $3,000 for a RTX 5090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO gets a $1 million salary plus $68 million in bonuses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNES consoles appear to run faster with age \u2014 APU frequency increased by up to 182 Hz after 35 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech giants call Trump tariffs 'big headache' \u2014 Foxconn CEO teases increased production in US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe week in chip news: Intel gets a new CEO, China chip smuggling, AMD dominates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi Pico powers $75 PicoCalc portable programming handheld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel's new CEO warns employees about 'tough decisions', but Wall Street cheers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI skips RDNA 4 and will not manufacture AMD Radeon 9000-series GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

This tops the previous record of $1.038 million ($810 psf) chalked up by a 1,280 sq ft, five-room flat in the block in July 2019. According to Aaron Wan, group district director at PropNex Realty and the agent representing the seller, the deal was closed within a day and the buyer is paying for the entire transaction in cash. Wan says the seller recently purchased a new condominium unit.    The five-room flat is located at Block 441A, Clementi Avenue 3 (Picture: Aaron Wan/PropNex Realty) The five-room HDB flat was on the market for about 10 days and garnered two separate viewings during that time. The buyers are an elderly couple who are downsizing from their landed property in West Coast, says Wan. He adds that the seller was in the process of moving into a temporary rental home and could offer a more flexible timeline that appealed to the buyers.  The record-setting flat is located within Clementi Towers, a HDB development comprising blocks 441A, 441B, 442, and 443. Only 441A has four- and five-room flats, while the other three blocks comprise three- and four-room flats. According to HDB data, the flats have 91 years left on its lease. Clementi Towers is part of the Clementi integrated transport hub which includes Clementi Mall, Clementi MRT Station and Clementi Bus Interchange.     This is not the first time a unit in Block 441A has transacted for more than a million dollars. The first resale unit in the block to cross the threshold was a 1,248 sq ft, five-room flat that changed hands for $1.005 million ($805 psf) in 2016. At the time, it was rare for HDB flats to fetch above $1 million, barring some prime units at Pinnacles @ Duxton and some executive maisonettes. Another 1,248 sq ft, five-room flat in Block 441A went for $1 million ($801 psf) in January this year.    The top-floor HDB flat overlooks parts of West Coast (Picture: Aaron Wan/PropNex Realty) According to Wan, this particular block of flats benefits from its connectivity to the shopping mall and transport hub, and central location in the estate. Nearby schools include Clementi Primary School, Pei Tong Primary School, Nan Hua Primary School and Clementi Town Secondary School. In addition, the block features relatively spacious five-room flats that are uncommon on the resale market. \u201cBuyers who are looking for a sizeable home in the area find that five-room HDB flats are more affordable compared to some private developments in the area,\u201d says Wan.

Although partial operations of the solar project were started in July 2018, the 750MW solar park was officially inaugurated by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 10, 2020.    The prime minister said that not only Madhya Pradesh is getting electricity from the 750 MW Rewa Solar Project but it is a matter of joy that the project is providing 24 percent of its power to Delhi Metro also.    It\u2019s a public-private partnership (PPP) project and considered one of the largest single-site solar power plants in India.    The project developer - RUMSL is a Joint Venture of Madhya Pradesh Urja Vikas Nigam and Solar Energy Corporation of India. The Rewa solar park development partners include Mahindra Renewables, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mahindra Susten, ACME Jaipur Solar Power, a subsidiary of Acme Solar, and Arinsun Clean Energy (now Spring Energy) were selected by RUMSL as the successful bidders to develop each of the three generating blocks on a BOOT basis within the Rewa solar park in the first half of 2017.    It has three blocks of solar installations of 250MW capacity each. Each such unit in the solar park is developed and operated by a separate private company on a build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) basis for a period of 25 years. Each 250MW block within the Rewa solar park features photovoltaic solar panels mounted on fixed frame aluminum structures.    The inverters near the solar installations are connected to 2MVA 440V/33kV ONAN transformers. The pooling station within the solar park comprises three 33/220 kV 100MVA step-up transformers.    A 220/400kv grid sub-station located on an 18ha-plot within the project premises receives the electricity output of the solar park and transmits the same to the National Grid through a 32km long 400kV transmission line connecting the Vindhyachal-Jabalpur transmission line.    The total investment on the project is estimated to be approximately $530 million. The World Bank also approved $100m under this project to cover the financing of the shared infrastructure, including access roads, water supply, telecommunications, pooling stations inside the solar parks as well as the transmission lines connecting to the external substation for the Rewa as well as the Mandsaur solar parks.    The solar park is spread over an area of 1,500 hectares in the Gurh Tehsil in the Rewa District of Madhya Pradesh. Each generating unit within the solar park occupies approximately 500 hectares.    The three 250MW solar blocks were awarded at tariffs as low as Rs 2.9 per unit which is considered to be the lowest tariff ever awarded for a solar project in India.   Story continues   The project will deliver renewable electricity at one of the lowest tariff rates in the country and offset approximately 1.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually.The majority of the equipment used in the solar park was provided by Chinese suppliers.Photos: Twitter, Rewa district administrationALSO READ:5 big lies you are told about investing10 longest bridges in the world: Majority of them are in ChinaThe truth about what stands between youth and decent jobsChina tops here too: nations that produce most goldGet the latest news!

Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

One of the upcoming big three video games spotlighted by Ubisoft was Watch Dogs: Legion. This game brings the Watch Dogs universe to London, and we shared the official gameplay overview trailer and summary of the game and its attractions. Since that time more details of Watch Dogs: Legion, and its PC performance, have emerged and are worth covering.\n\nWatch Dogs: Legion on PC\nWatch Dogs: Legion will be coming to Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, PS5, PC, and Stadia on 29th October this year. Concentrating on the PC version, it will be Ubisoft's first PC game with support for real-time ray tracing ever released.\nDigital Foundry (DF) was lucky enough to take the PC version of the game for a test run as it would be \"a great playground to show off ray traced reflections\". Furthermore, it thought that running the PC game with maxed out settings and raytracing on an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti packing PC would give some indication of how the game might appear on the next gen consoles due in time for Xmas.\n\nYou can check out the portion of the embedded DF video about the PC settings used, from about 4mins in. Reviewer Tom Morgan notes that Ubisoft showed off the game at 30fps locked and in his attempt to ramp the game up to play at 60fps on the aforementioned RTX 2080 Ti packing PC \"proved a stretch too far\".\n\nSome things must be noted before being too disappointed though. DF mentions that the DLSS 2.0 option wasn't applied and tested due to time constraints. With this AI and deep learning powered technique we could see significant frame rate boosts in the game. Secondly one might expect Ubisoft to do a bit more performance tuning before the release date.\n\nYou can play as any of the game's approx 9 million characters\nAn impressive feature of Watch Dogs: Legion that I haven't seen given much publicity is the scale and variety of the characters in the game, and that you can play as any one of them. Any of the approx 9 million procedurally generated NPCs in the game can be scanned and then be recruited into DedSec - becoming a playable character. Each character has a plethora of bio information as well as a certain look that makes them who they are. The characters do tend to fit into base archetypes though, such as Spy or Hooligan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you play through you will be able to level up your characters over time via the usual RPG mechanics of skill trees and perks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\nMicrosoft imagines Xbox 2042 with 1 exaFLOP processor\n\n                    Meanwhile, EA/DICE have revealed three big new maps for Battlefield 2042. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n7\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\n\n                    And Nvidia's GeForce Now service becomes Xbox friendly (via updated Microsoft Edge). \n                \n\n\n\nRockstar outlines Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy PC specs\nAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT Halo Infinite graphics card revealed\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator GOTY announced \u2013 a free update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 15 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

Noh is one of a group of senior government officials facing a public backlash over multiple home ownership in one of the world's hottest property markets, where median apartment prices have rocketed more than 50% in three years, KB Bank data shows.  His move to sell his Gangnam crib, the size of about three parking spaces but worth about 1.1 billion won ($915,000) by current market prices, came just ahead of Friday's government announcement that South Korea will further tighten property rules and impose heavier taxes on multiple homeowners in its latest effort to calm the market. But more than 20 rounds of cooling measures in the past three years have failed to stop runaway prices. Effective or not, the new steps announced by finance minister Hong Nam-ki - including raising real estate taxes on multiple home-owners to up to 6% per year - will keep public focus an issue that is wiping out a surge in President Moon's approval ratings from the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. His approval rating dropped to 47%, a Gallup Korea survey showed on Friday, down from last week's 50% - the lowest in four months. In early May, Moon's approval rating hovered around a lofty 70% after the ruling Democratic Party won an absolute majority in a parliamentary election.  \"Today's measures will not have much effect on stabilising the property market as the real estate tax hike will not be applied immediately,\" said Kwon Dae-jung, real estate professor at Myongji University. \"The sale of high-ranking officials' houses is them doing the right thing morally, but that will not directly contribute to stabilising the property market. It can indirectly affect the market by hinting that the government will strengthen its regulations but that's about it - just giving signals.\" Anger over the failure to calm runaway home prices has extended to government officials with multiple residences, under pressure to sell second homes to show they are committed to policy focused on imposing heavier tax penalties and mortgage curbs for multiple home owners. For some voters, frustration has already turned to resignation. Park Byung-jin, a 40-year-old office worker in Incheon, west of Seoul, says he has lost hope in Moon's policies.   Story continues \"I'm not even angry. They have been keeping all the good homes, and telling us not to buy anything is extremely unconvincing,\" he said.'DEEPLY ASHAMED'Chief of staff Noh has found himself at the centre of the controversy, because he hadn't sold his Gangnam apartment - small at about 46 square metres in size, but in an ageing building with huge development potential - some six months after instructing senior government officials to unload second homes.Noh, who didn't immediately answer calls seeking comment, announced the sale in a Facebook post on Wednesday. \"With this opportunity, I will try to look back on myself and treat myself strictly going forward,\" he wrote.His statement came the day before Finance Minister Hong - announcer of Friday's new taxes - himself committed to selling a second property.\"As a cabinet member, I'm deeply ashamed of myself in front of fellow citizens, and my acquaintances, amid controversy over multiple homes owned by public servants,\" Hong said in a Facebook post.Of 64 senior government officials required disclose their assets, some 18, or 28%, owned more than one property as of June this year, according to data analysed by the Citizens' Coalition for Economic Justice, a civic group.Apart from Noh, at least five other officials in top government posts own homes in Gangnam and other expensive districts, according to the group.The sales announced by Noh and Hong this week came after a stark warning by Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun on Wednesday, ordering government ministries to look into homeownership status among senior officials.\"Our policies won't win people's trust if senior officials own multiple properties,\" Chung told a meeting of top government officials.($1 = 1,202.2700 won)(Reporting by Cynthia Kim and Joori Roh; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Dozens of would-be travelers acted as passengers in an activity organized by Taiwan\u2019s Civil Aviation Administration to raise awareness of procedures to follow when passing through customs and boarding their plane at Taipei International Airport. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying)  Associated Press  Updated 8 July 2020 2 min read          TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) \u2014 Like almost every region, Taiwan has been hit hard by restrictions on international travel imposed because of the coronavirus. Some residents have found comfort in boarding a flight that didn\u2019t take off, just to revisit some memories and plan for the day when they can fly again.  The fantasy flight was organized by Taiwan\u2019s Civil Aviation Administration to raise awareness of coronavirus prevention and control procedures to follow when passing through customs and boarding a plane at Taipei International Airport. Participants won a lucky draw held online, with each allowed to bring a guest, putting the total number who boarded at 66. As with normal flights, they had to check in, obtain boarding passes and go through immigration and security procedures before being allowed on the plane. \u201cPeople who want to fly abroad have long been suffering,\u201d said Wang Chih-ching, deputy director of the airport. The event and the publicity generated will help future travelers better prepare for when international flights resume in earnest, Wang said. The online draw drew 10,000 entries. After taking their seats, the passengers \u2014 all wearing masks \u2014 were served food and drinks, participated in a pop quiz and were treated to a good luck salute from fire engines that sprayed water. After they exited without the plane having left the ground, passengers were given a demonstration about security by customs officials accompanied by a sniffer dog. Lucky draw winner Joyce Nieh and her friend Jessica Liu, both mobile game graphic designers, took selfies to mark the occasion. \u201cFinally, we\u2019re in a plane ... pretending that we\u2019re flying abroad,\u201d Nieh said. \u201cI had to cancel all my international travel plans,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were lucky to win the opportunity to participate.\u201d Taiwan has largely contained the spread of the coronavirus but social distancing and travel restrictions remain in place. The government has reported 449 confirmed cases and seven deaths. More such fantasy flights are planned for coming days.

Reuters \u2022 yesterday   State Bank of India shelves $1.7 billion fund raising as yields elevated, sources say MUMBAI (Reuters) -State Bank of India, the country's largest lender by assets, is shelving plans to raise funds this fiscal year, discouraged by elevated bond yields despite a policy rate cut and liquidity boost from the central bank, three sources aware of the matter said on Monday.  The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

The two companies recently announced a collaboration to build a new computing system for cars, powered by NVIDIA's DRIVE AGX Orin technology. This new high-performance car computer will be used in new vehicles from Mercedes-Benz starting in 2024. NVIDIA's technology will allow these cars to drive regular routes autonomously and will include advanced safety and convenience features. But that's only half of it.\u00a0\nThe software in these new cars will be completely upgradeable, just like a mobile phone.\u00a0In a press release, Mercedes-Benz stated, \"Customers will be able to purchase and add capabilities, software applications and subscription services through over-the-air software updates during the life of the car.\"\u00a0\nTurning the car into a software service could open the door to a whole new avenue of growth for NVIDIA's automotive business. Here's a look at the size of NVIDIA's automotive segment, and what this deal could mean for growth. Potential investors need to know that this deal will take some time to come to fruition, but that it could pay off handsomely because of how it's structured.\n\nImage source: Daimler.\n\n1. Don't expect big revenue from this deal just yet\nNVIDIA's automotive segment made up 5% of total revenue in the fiscal first quarter. It fell slightly from $166 million in the year-ago quarter to $155 million in the most recent quarter. NVIDIA has made numerous partnership announcements in recent years with top carmakers and other developers of self-driving cars. The early-stage work being done on self-driving cars has led to a gradual increase in NVIDIA's automotive business, as this table shows.\n\n\n\nSegment\nFiscal 2018\nFiscal 2019\nFiscal 2020\n\n\nAutomotive\n$558 million\n$641 million\n$700 million\n\n\nGaming\n$5.51 billion\n$6.25 billion\n$5.52 billion\n\n\nData center\n$1.93 billion\n$2.93 billion\n$2.98 billion\n\n\nOther\n$1.71 billion\n$1.90 billion\n$1.72 billion\n\n\nTotal\n$9.71 billion\n$11.72 billion\n$10.92 billion\n\n\n\nData source: NVIDIA.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company has more than 370 partners using NVIDIA DRIVE to develop the computing systems needed to put a self-driving car on the road.\u00a0NVIDIA and Mercedes-Benz have been working together for several years. In 2017, the two companies announced a partnership to bring an AI-powered car to market.\u00a0NVIDIA spent four years working on an all-electric SUV with a computerized dashboard using an AI infotainment system. The Mercedes-Benz EQC cockpit was unveiled in 2018.\u00a0\nThe latest deal with Mercedes could be the biggest yet for NVIDIA in the self-driving car space, but given that these new cars won't launch until 2024, NVIDIA is not likely to see a significant financial benefit in the near term.\u00a0However, several Wall Street analysts have weighed in with estimates about what kind of opportunity this presents NVIDIA in the long run.\n2. Making software for cars could be very profitable\nThe partnership with Mercedes-Benz is a taste of what might be coming in the consumer car market. NVIDIA says the market for AI hardware, software, and in-car services is $5 billion currently. If this technology is rolled out to a fleet of 100 million cars, the market opportunity approaches $700 billion.\u00a0\nSo, where does that leave NVIDIA? The most lucrative part of this partnership is the potential to generate recurring revenue from selling software upgrades, either through one-time purchases of applications by the vehicle owner or a subscription service.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed by either company, but one analyst with Needham believes the ability for the vehicle owner to purchase over-the-air software add-ons could be financially beneficial for NVIDIA. Since NVIDIA is providing the software platform, there will likely be some kind of revenue-sharing agreement between NVIDIA and Mercedes-Benz.\u00a0\nAn analyst with Credit Suisse believes NVIDIA's revenue from this agreement could reach $1 billion to $2 billion annually, which could translate to $0.80 to $1.60 in EPS. NVIDIA's adjusted EPS was $5.79 in fiscal 2020, so this one deal with Mercedes-Benz could be marginally accretive to the bottom line over time.\u00a0\nKeep in mind, these estimates are just for Mercedes. If NVIDIA reaches agreements with other car manufacturers, this could easily become a multibillion-dollar opportunity for the graphics specialist.\u00a0This Mercedes deal is just another sign that this growth stock\u00a0has still got a lot in the tank.\n\n\n\nJohn Ballard owns shares of NVIDIA.

At last the rumours that had been bubbling beneath the surface for years precipitated the news that had been expected. Now, a previously unpublished slide from WWDC has been shared that casts some light on the GPUs that the new 'Apple Silicon' Macs are going to be using.\n\nThe slide above was shared by Longhorn on Twitter and is from a WWDC 2020 presentation dubbed Bring your Metal app to Apple Silicon Macs. \"The future will be very interesting,\" commented the Tweeter. \"MacOS Arm64 according to Apple removes support for AMD GPUs too, Apple GPUs all the way.\" \nThe presentation the slide is from goes some way to explaining to developers how they will translate or port your graphics-intensive app over to Apple Silicon - including Apple GPUs. It highlights that the Tile Based Deferred Rendering (TBDR) GPU architecture for Apple Silicon Macs is a significant step up from the Immediate Mode Rendering pipeline of older Macs. However, modern third party GPUs from the likes of AMD, Nvidia, IMG, Intel, and Qualcomm are tiled architecture compatible/capable too.\n\nWhatever the case, it is important that Apple has made clear its intentions to optimised Metal performance on Apple Silicon Macs by leveraging its own GPU designs, named after the Metal API.\n\nWhile one might be comfortable accepting that Apple's Metal GPUs are going to be fine and dandy in its consumer portables and desktops, there are questions about whether third party GPU architectures will be supported by higher-end Macs, like the MacBook Pro and Mac Pro machines. Currently GPUs from the likes of AMD do a lot of heavy lifting for Apple's pro-targeted machines and it will be very interesting to see if Apple has the confidence and capabilities to simply use its own processors, or will support AMD/Nvidia some way, like eGPU or accelerator AICs.\nOn the flip side could PC enthusiasts, one day, be buying Apple Metal GPU packing graphics cards to accelerate their 3D/XR games, apps and experiences?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\nDell updates XPS and Alienware desktops with Alder Lake CPUs\nAsus shares its Intel Z690 motherboard guide\nMore Intel 12th Gen Core performance numbers emerge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 52 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

High-end GPUs aren't something you can just start making overnight - just ask Intel, they've attempted it enough times!Does this mean they're just doing away with the workstation market altogether?\n            \n            \n            \n\n\n\n\n                    Posted by deleted - Tue 07 Jul 2020 11:09\n                \n\n\n\n\n            This is sounding more and more proprietary lock in and anti consumer by the moment. I get that in a small system like a macbook air you really will have to use an on die GPU but to make no indication that any other manufacturers would be included highlights that Apple wants to fully close the ecosystem.It excites me because there is a strong chance that Apple might really be starting to find out how dangerous doing something like that is.

Property prices have already risen by 66% within a mile of Crossrail stations. The London property market is starting to pick up steam after months of uncertainty due to the current health crisis.     Research from Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) forecasts an upward trend in London\u2019s housing market in the next four years. While sales remain subdued currently, there are signs of growing sales activity since the market reopened, says Widya Lesta, head of international residential at JLL. \u201cWith recovery in transaction volume, we should expect prices to increase in London by the middle of next year. It is already deemed the best performing real estate market in the UK.\u201d  While most buyers rush to inner London for bargain properties, savvy investors know that lucrative investments lie in outer regions \u2014 where massive regeneration projects are underway in conjunction with the opening of the Crossrail. One example is Southall in West London which is enjoying a sustainable growth for the last five years. For instance, the average price of a property sold at Southall was GBP298,715 back in 2015. Fast forward to March 2019, the average sold price soared to GBP397,354 ($697,500) \u2014 a 33% jump from in four years. Over the corresponding period, the average house price in London increased 14% from GBP402,898 to GBP459,800. In just the last 12 months, average prices of houses sold in Southall increased 4.07%. And with the arrival of the Crossrail later this year, anticipation is running high as the Berkeley Group spearheads one of the most ambitious redevelopment schemes this side of London: Southall Waterside.     Image: Berkeley Group It is Berkeley\u2019s most ambitious regeneration program to turn an 88-acre (35.6ha) former gasworks into a luxury complex with 3,750 residences. It will have generous green spaces and a vibrant community when completed. \u201cSouthall is an area where house prices are still affordable with plenty of growth potential as this is the first phase in a 10-year scheme,\u201d says Doris Tan, Regional Director of Benham and Reeves. \"Southall Waterside by Berkeley is a much-anticipated project and has generated a lot of interest among investors from all over the world,\u201d adds Tan. \u201cWe are proud to be involved in this stunning project. If you buy now, I believe it will definitely be an opportunity to reap benefits in the near future.\"     Photo: Southall Waterside, day view (computer generated image is indicative only) Berkeley Group\u2019s regeneration projects: 10 years of unprecedented success Being one of the pioneers in the residential and luxury rental sector, Berkeley Group has achieved success over the past 10 years by turning tracts of idle land into real estate hotspots. \u201cWe specialise in regenerating these areas,\u201d says Rob Willis, Business Development Manager for Berkeley Group Singapore. \u201cAnd what we have seen is that time and time again, regeneration has had a positive impact on capital values.\u201d   Story continues Willis points to Berkeley Group\u2019s Royal Arsenal Riverside as an example. Prices were at GBP250 psf in 2010, and now 10 years later, it is closer to GBP1,000 psf.The same can be said about Woodberry Down: A one-bedroom apartment priced at GBP275,000 in 2012 was commanding up to GBP540,000 in 2018 \u2014 \u201ca 96% increase in just six years\u201d, says Willis.Kidbrooke Village in Greenwich is another example. A studio or \u201cManhattan suite\u201d that cost GBP262,000 in 2010, fetched a price of GBP350,000 by 2018.\"These examples show how regenerating a place increases its value, regardless of market conditions,\" says Willis.Chart 1. Where regeneration by Berkeley has driven capital values (Royal Arsenal Riverside).  Chart 2. Historic price growth for a 1-bedroom apartment (Woodberry Down)  Chart 3. Where regeneration by Berkeley has driven capital values (Kidbrooke Village)  One of the latest projects offshore property investors should focus on is Southall Waterside, Berkeley\u2019s most ambitious regeneration program that will turn an 88-acre gasworks into a luxury complex that houses 3,750 residences.Your doorway to the capital and the rest of the UKSouthall Waterside conveniently sits between Heathrow and the West End. It provides fantastic access to the whole of London in the East and to the rest of the UK in the West.\u201cOne of the key offerings of Southall is accessibility across London, and also out into the West of the UK,\u201d says Willis. \u201cThis will be further enhanced by the opening of Crossrail next year. This means you can be located in Southall, but be in Paddington, Zone 1, in just 14 minutes.\"Furthermore, the project is at the epicenter of London's international business scene \u2014 making it attractive to professionals who wish to stay close to their place of work or business.\u00a0 The headquarters of blue-chip companies such as Microsoft, Visa and Vodafone are just 14 minutes away by Crossrail.The headquarters of other multinational firms such as Facebook, Google and Regus are only 19 minutes from Southall via Tottenham Court Road.Of course, there's Canary Wharf, London's business hub, which is only 31 minutes away.\"By car, you can get to Stockley Park in just 23 minutes, where you can find big-name tech brands like Apple, Toshiba, Canon, and Sharp,\" adds Willis.He sees Southall Waterside \u201cin high demand\u201d from employees and students throughout London and the UK.A promising long-term investment\u00a0 When it comes to opportunities, Southall Waterside offers a promising capital growth \u2014 similar to the previous Berkeley regeneration projects.\"A regeneration project like this offers a fantastic chance to invest because you can then grow with the development as it becomes one of the key villages in West London,\" Willis comments.According to him, property owners who wish to rent out their investment property may expect rental returns of around 4.4% to 4.7%, which is a competitive rate for such a location.In addition, Southall Waterside will benefit from the massive GBP1.9 million investment in infrastructural works from roads, public spaces and improvements to the Crossrail station at Southall that will provide easy access to London's top business and employment destinations.Exclusive residence with world-class amenitiesIn terms of facilities, Southall Waterside will offer the same services found in Berkeley\u2019s Zone 1 and Zone 2 developments.There will be a residents-only lounge suitable for work-from-home renters, a luxury spa, gym, 24-hour concierge, an electric car charging station and a cycle store.Southall Waterside will also feature a 1.2km frontage along the Grand Union Canal, including a canal-side community facility where people can meet and dine at their leisure.

In other words, investors can essentially rent out their units right away.Southall Waterside will comprise suites, one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments that offer spacious living. For example, a Manhattan suite has a total living area of 500 sq ft, which is ideal for a studio sized apartment.A two-bedroom apartment has an equally large living area and bedrooms, making them appealing to prospective renters. Even the one-bedroom units offer plenty of space in terms of working and living area.Lastly, investors will receive a 10-year warranty and a two-year policy with a Customer Service on hand 24 hours a day to deal with inquiries.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

From a previous all time high set in October 2018, shares had fallen more than 50% over the following few months and many would have been nervous, thinking the hype was over and that it was time to settle down for the long haul after a 1,000% move in less than three years. But this is the world of high tech and if there\u2019s one thing that Wall Street loves, it\u2019s a comeback story in a high growth stock.\nSo when shares fell again in Q1 with the onset of COVID-19, there were few surprised that the stock was able to recover quickly. A 40% drop in less than a month would have rattled many but for those inclined to look back at recent history, an equally fast recovery was always on the cards. By this past May, shares were back at pre-COVID levels and closed out yesterday\u2019s session up a full 120% from Q1\u2019s low at fresh all-time highs.Get breaking market news alerts:Sign Up\nSilver Lining\nThe California based company makes chips and processors for gaming consoles and has been constantly at the forefront of the industry with their graphics processing units (GPUs) in recent years. The COVID driven lockdown drove a two-fold jump in demand for many of their offerings over the past few months. On the one hand you have the overnight spike in the number of people working from home while on the other the shelter-in-place orders across the major cities fuelled a massive rise in gaming time.\nThis opportunity was not missed on Wall Street. Bank of America zeroed in on this tailwind last month when their analyst Vivek Arya pointed at demand for the company\u2019s Turing card exceeding supply as market penetration increased. Later that same month, Mizuho followed Bank of America by maintaining their Buy rating on the basis of continued demand for their GPUs with big things expected in the second half of the year.Remove Ads\nSusquehanna posted what was at the time a street high price target of $450 on Nvidia share\u2019s in the last week of June when they were trading around $370. They were particularly bullish on the recent Mellanox acquisition and forecasted double digit percentage growth on their assets in the coming years.\nNot to be outdone, Bank of America were out with a new street high target of $460 this week after a GPU survey run by video game distributor Steam. Their analyst Vivek Arya, who struck that bullish tone back in June, sees the coming release of next-generation consoles as driving a widespread upgrade to new GPUs which will pump demand and drive up Nvidia\u2019s revenue forecasts.\nData Center Strength\nNvidia\u2019s strength isn\u2019t just in video game console units either. They have an impressive data center business line which accounted for 37% of their total revenue in their fiscal Q1 earnings report which was released towards the end of May. Revenue from this component alone was up 80% year on year and is viewed by many as the dark horse, growing somewhat unnoticed while their GPUs and chip updates plus releases grab the headlines.\nHaving smashed analyst expectations with that latest earnings release, they go into the second half of the year with $9 billion in cash. This will give investors confidence that they can ride out any upcoming volatility shocks to the equity markets, an important attribute given the alarming rise in coronavirus cases across the country.\nSo while the college textbooks may say to be wary of a stock that\u2019s printing multiple all-time highs as part of a multi-week 100% rally while its RSI is hovering close to 70, the 21st century investor is seeing the opportunity at play here and the momentum the stock is carrying. Unless video games go extinct in the next few weeks, any pullback should be considered a buying opportunity.\nWhere Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here 7 Energy Stocks to Buy and Hold ForeverWith the proliferation of data centers and electric vehicles, the electric grid will only get more strained.

It is terrifying to be honest because the ending will not be good, and there will a lot of damage on the way lower. People will unsuspectingly think they are getting bargains when a stock like SHOP is trading at $800, only for them to go even lower. It happens, a lot, I have seen it happen a lot, it is an unforgiving process. I use to trade some of the biggest momentum growth orient names when I was on the buy-side desk. The unwinding process is brutal. \u00a0\nNo matter how you describe it, the NASDAQ Qs are trading at the upper end of the range, and as I have noted five prior times, every time it gets to this point, it pulls back sharply. I said this the other day, for subscribers and even pointed out some bearish betting in the QQQs. So I am looking for a pullback to around $245 at the moment.\u00a0 Premium content \u2013\u00a0Markets Setting Up For 5-6% Dip\n\nS&P 500 (SPY)\nThere is a substantial level of resistance at the downtrend in the S&P 500 around 3,180. Meanwhile, the RSI is trending lower still, while the advance-decline is also now beginning to turn lower as well. Both bearish momentum indicators.\u00a0\n\n50-Day Moving Average\nThe number of stocks above their 50-day moving average in the S&P 500 has fallen sharply, and could even be heading lower.\u00a0\n\n20-Day\nMeanwhile, the number of total stocks above their 20 days moving average is now down to 42%. It confirms the view that there are just a handful of stocks driving the Q insanity.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, what may be even more critical is that 10-year is now attempting to break support around 63 basis points, and if that happens, it will signal a further decline for yields. Think Risk-off\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\nNvidia is perhaps one of the scariest stocks leading the charge because there is no fundamental underpinning to the move higher, and it is likely to end disastrously as well. The stock is now trading on the other side of the rising wedge and has an RSI over 70. I still think the stock pulls back to $350.\u00a0 Premium content \u2013\u00a0Nvidia Is Priced For Perfection, May Have Topped Out?\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\nAmazon has gone vertical, and if there is any company that is likely to disappoint investors when they report results, it is Amazon. We have been there and done that. I still think it heads back to $2460.\n\n\nUnlock Deeper Insights with Exclusive Member-Only Video Content on The Market Chronicles YouTube Channel \u2013 Just $34.99/Month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10:23\n\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIIr1ooRsSukPL7rKNr0VHQ/join\n\nPlease check out my content on Substack and Seeking Alpha:\nhttps://www.themarketchronicle.com/\nhttps://seekingalpha.com/affiliate_link/Youtube81624\n\n#sp500 #stocks #stockmarket #cpi #fed #qqq #spy #rates \n\nThis report contains independent commentary to be used for informational and educational purposes only.

Follow AuthorsJul 15, 2020, 03:00am EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.Graphcore, a UK-based startup, launched its first Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) for AI acceleration in 2018. Today it introduced its second-generation product for AI, a massively parallel chip with 59.4 billion transistors that delivers some 250 Trillion Operations per Second (TOPS). However, the company\u2019s potential to challenge NVIDIA, the leader in data center AI, lies not just in the new chip\u2019s performance, but in the new IPU-Machine, Poplar software and interconnect fabric. Together, these elements promise to provide the scalability necessary to handle massive AI models. While we must await real application performance comparisons to assess the platform\u2019s true capabilities, Graphcore\u2019s new offering potentially represents the first candidate capable of challenging NVIDIA\u2019s new Ampere-based A100, at least for very large-scale AI models. Time will tell if that is good enough to overcome NVIDIA\u2019s massive lead in software and AI ecosystem, but investors certainly believe in the company\u2014they have bid up Graphcore\u2019s value to nearly $2B.\n\nThe Colossus MK2 IPU (GC200)\n\nThe new Colossus MK2, manufactured by TSMC, is a 59.4 B transistor parallel processor that delivers some 250 Trillion Operations per Second (TOPS) across 1472 cores and 900MB of In-Processor-Memory (a 3X increase). All of this is interconnected across a 2.8Tb/s low latency fabric. Most of the architectural design of the MK1 generation carries over to the MK2 platform. Like its predecessor, the processing tiles contain cores and on-die SRAM, interconnected over the same fabric, which can extend off-die to communicate with other IPU domains.\n\n\nThe MK2 has a few new features beyond just more cores and memory. New sparsity optimizations help avoid wasted cycles for a range of data patterns including block, scalar, static and dynamic sparsity. According to Graphcore, these optimizations stand to increase performance by a factor of two or more. The MK2 IPU also gets a performance boost from its set of novel floating-point implementation techniques developed by Graphcore, called AI-Float. These are used to tune energy and performance for AI computation, including stochastic rounding to enable FP16 to match FP32 performance on master weights, and FP16.16 to match FP16.32 precision for forward and backward propagation. The chip also supports 62.5 TFLOPS in single-precision FP32.\n\nThe IPU-Machine\nGraphcore productized its MK1 silicon in a two-IPU PCIe board to ease adoption and speed time to market. With the MK2 version, Graphcore took this productization a step further. The company announced a 1 Rack-Unit appliance, called the M2000 IPU-Machine, that contains four MK2 chips. At a system level, the larger on-die IPU memory is now supplemented by up to 448GB of \u201cStreaming Memory\u201d DRAM on the IPU-Machine. Since deep learning model size is doubling every 3.5 months (according to OpenAI.org), this memory architecture could be a game changer. It provides 100 times the bandwidth and 10 times the capacity found in High Bandwidth Memory (HBM2), at a significantly lower cost.\nFigure 1: The Graphcore IPU-Machine includes four IPUs, Integrated 100GbE scale-out fabric, PCIe and ... [+] additional DDR memory.Graphcore\nThe 1U boxes are interconnected over 100Gb Ethernet with ROCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) for low-latency access. Using Ethernet avoids the bottlenecks and costs of PCIe connectors and enables a flexible CPU to accelerator ratio. The IPU Fabric connects to other IPUs by tunneling its protocol and data over Ethernet, maintaining the same programming model and Bulk Synchronous Processing (BSP) inter-tile synchronization, regardless of the size of the deployment. The IPU-Machine carries a list price of $32,450, which may sound expensive to the uninitiated. However, this is a good value when one compares the platform\u2019s performance to the competition.\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nThe second generation IPU fabric\nBuilt-in fabrics are becoming a necessity for AI training accelerators, since model sizes are increasing dramatically. The Graphcore fabric enables a flexible disaggregation model, allowing the user to configure an array of accelerators on the fly without being constrained by a fixed ratio of CPUs to accelerators (as they would be on most other systems). By leveraging 100Gb Ethernet, elastic configurations are easy to deploy and simple to use, enabling scaling up to 64,000 IPUs. This disaggregated scaling model is one of the most significant features of the second generation Graphcore IPU platform, enabling a wide range of deployment options.\nFigure 2: Graphcore envisions entire data centers filled with interconnected IPU-Machines in ... [+] interconnected IPU-PODs. Multi-tenancy support could make this attractive to cloud-scale service providers such as Microsoft Azure.Graphcore\n\n\nPerformance\nGraphcore says the new 4-chip IPU-Machine delivers 7-9 times the performance of the 2-chip predecessor PCIe card in training neural networks, and over 8 times the performance in inference processing. So, a chip-to-chip comparison would likely put the MK2 at roughly a 3-4 times improvement over the MK1.Figure 3: User can expect roughly 7-9X more performance per 4-chip IPU-Machine over that of the 1st ... [+] generation 2-chip MK1 PCIe card.Graphcore\nConclusions\nGraphcore already offers its first-generation accelerators in the Microsoft Azure cloud, as well as in Dell-EMC servers. Delivering the new Colossus MK2 IPU in a plug-and-play hardware and software platform could prove to be a good strategy for wider adoption of Graphcore technology, as customers and partners can use these building blocks to deliver any scale of infrastructure desired. I believe that Graphcore is one of the few startups so far that can challenge the status quo in AI acceleration and advance parallel processing in a meaningful way. It remains to be seen if Graphcore can also extend this platform to inference processing, where cost-effectiveness and software ecosystems represent potential hurdles for any startup. It also remains to be seen which large customers may become clients, and how well the new platform can perform in real-world applications. But from what we know today, it looks like the new MK2 and IPU-Machine could become a contender.

These are all pressing issues that affect residents of Florida in one way or another, UF said.\nThe university and Nvidia said the machine will deliver 700 petaflops of AI performance. A petaflop is a quadrillion floating-point operations per second, a common measure of supercomputing performance. \u201cIt\u2019s a number-crunching beast,\u201d UF alumnus and Nvidia founder Chris Malachowsky (pictured, below), said in a press briefing, adding that there will also be \u201cuses and applications we haven\u2019t thought of.\u201d\nTo build the new machine, UF said it will beef up the capabilities of its existing HiPerGator supercomputer, which is based on Nvidia technology and was previously ranked among the world\u2019s top 200 most powerful computers when it first went online in 2015.\nTo do so, Nvidia will provide UF with newer, more advanced hardware in the shape of its A100 Tensor Core high-performance graphics processing unit, which is based on the company\u2019s modular DGX SuperPOD architecture and is specifically designed for AI and inference workloads. The plan is to integrate 14 new A100 DGX systems, which are powered by a combined 1,120 A100 GPUs, with HiPerGator in order to boost its existing capabilities.\nNvidia\u2019s A100 DGX systems also provide specialized software for running workloads such as data analytics, AI training and inference acceleration, and recommendation systems that combine sound, vision, speech and contextual understanding of the environment to perform a range of tasks.\nThe new machine\u00a0will pack 4 petabytes of high-performance storage and integrate with a Mellanox HDR 200Gb/s InfiniBand network for high throughput and extremely low-latency network connectivity, UF said.\nChris Malachowsky\nThe initiative is being made possible thanks to a $25 million donation from Malachowsky and an additional $25 million gift in hardware, software, training and services from Nvidia. In addition, UF will invest $20 million of its own money to create what it calls an \u201cAI-centric supercomputing and data center.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created a replicable, powerful model of public-private cooperation for everyone\u2019s\u00a0benefit,\u201d said Malachowsky, who now serves as an Nvidia Fellow.\nUF has ambitions to become one of the leading AI universities in the U.S., and aims to create more than 30,000 \u201cAI-enabled graduates\u201d by 2030. Malachowsky reckons that UF\u2019s location in Florida makes it ideally suited to do so, as the region is \u201ca living laboratory for some of society\u2019s most pressing issues,\u201d he said.\nSome of the issues include managing the effects of rising sea levels, which is a pressing concern in a state with more than 1,300 miles of coastline, Malachowsky said.\nTo fulfill those ambitious, UF plans to recruit 100 new faculty positions in AI and its related fields. It will also collaborate with a number of historically Black colleges and universities and Hispanic-serving institutions in order to promote wider accessibility to its supercomputer resources for every demographic. And it will establish a new Equitable AI program that aims to create new standards and certifications for developing AI tools that are cognizant of bias, unethical practices and legal and moral issues, it said.\nUF Provost Joe Glover said in a briefing that the university is pushing a new concept of \u201cAI across the curriculum,\u201d adding that it\u2019s \u201cimportant to train the next generation of an AI-enabled workforce.\u201d\nConstellation Research Inc. analyst Holger Mueller told SiliconANGLE that universities like UF are key players in AI, both in areas of research and in education.\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0good to see Nvidia helping the Univeristy of Florida\u00a0with this initiative,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cFor the U.S. to play a key role in the AI era, it needs to train its knowledge workers in the discipline and most of them come from higher education institutions.\u201d\nNvidia will continue to support UF\u2019s concept through a range of initiatives. For example, the Nvidia Deep Learning Institute will collaborate with the university to help it design a new curriculum and coursework for students studying AI disciplines. It will also establish a new Nvidia AI Technology Center at the university, where UF graduates will work together with Nvidia\u2019s experts to advance AI.\nWith reporting from Robert Hof\nPhotos: UF\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. \u00a0\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\n\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

According to Wccftech (by way of Japanese news site Ithome), Nvidia has not only just stopped production on the RTX 2080 Ti, RTX 2080 Super, RTX 2070 Super, and RTX 2070, but those four cards will also be delisted by major vendors soon. That\u2019s most of Nvidia\u2019s current high-end and ultra-enthusiast segment of GPUs. If this feels a little bit like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, you\u2019re not alone. Around the same time as Nvidia\u2019s RTX 20-series launch in October 2018, a surge in cryptocurrency mining created a graphics card shortage. As a result, prices skyrocketed. It also didn\u2019t help that Nvidia had announced it would be stopping production on its GTX 10-series cards to make way for the RTX 20-series. So not only were those cards in short supply, they were even more expensive than when they were first released. The GTX 1080 Ti, for instance, debuted with an MSRP of $700, but during the discontinuation and shortage, it went for as high as $1,000 or more from second-hand sellers. That\u2019s also the current cost of the RTX 2080 Tis.\n\n\n Assuming reports of Nvidia ceasing production of the 20-series cards are true, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see the same thing happen again, as cryptominers are starting to snatch up GPUs. Cryptocurrency miners prefer GPUs to CPUs these days because GPUs have more Arithmetic Logic Units (ALU), which perform mathematical computations. That means they can perform more calculations, which leads to more output during the mining process. Some cryptominers run dozens of these things at a time, so it\u2019s easy to see why a GPU shortage happened two years ago, and why it can possibly happen again. According to Bitcoin, the Bitcoin market reached its highest difficulty jump of all time today, which means it\u2019s much harder for miners to make a profit. Many will likely shut down their machines temporarily until it falls again. Bitcoin forecasts that asset prices could reach as high as $19,044 by the end of this year, so it seems like as long as the mining difficulty stays low, then more miners will be encouraged to buy up whatever RTX 20 graphics cards are left in the market, driving up prices for actual consumers looking to purchase just one card for their PC.\n\n\n\nBut I don\u2019t really speak Bitcoin. All I understand is, \u201cHey, this thing might get discontinued soon, so better get it now before prices go up.\u201d It\u2019s possible that all four of those RTXs will see similar price increases like the 10-series did. Given that the 1080 Ti jumped around $300-$400 in price near the end of 2018, the 2080 Ti could end up being $1,500-$1,600 by the end of the year. Insert sobbing emoji here. It\u2019s also curious that Nvidia would only discontinue the RTX 2080 Ti, RTX 2080 Super, RTX 2070 Super, and RTX 2070, though I imagine it has everything to do with the architecture of the next-gen graphics cards. Ampere is supposedly a major upgrade from the current Turing architecture, and the RTX 3080 (name not confirmed at Nvidia at this time) might be 30% faster than the RTX 2080 Ti. If that\u2019s true, then it\u2019s likely the RTX 3080 will be able to output more than 60 frames per second in most games paired with the right CPU\u2014with ray tracing on, too. Because the RTX 20 cards are targeted for those who want to spend the big bucks on performance, it makes sense to release those first and leave the RTX 2060 Super, RTX 2060, GTX 1660 Ti, GTX 1660 Super, GTX 1660, GTX 1650 Super, and three GTX 1650 variants as its mid-range to lower-end options.\n\n\n\nI expect expect the RTX 3080 to be way more expensive than the RTX 2080 Ti when it was launched. If there was a $300 MSRP jump between the GTX 1080 Ti and RTX 2080 Ti, then there could be another $300 jump from the RTX 2080 Ti to the RTX 3080, which would put the RTX 3080 at an MSRP of $1,300\u2014assuming it does actually have the performance increase to justify the price hike. We\u2019ve also heard rumors of a RTX 3070 Ti and RTX 3070, which could cost between $400-$500, which is how much the RTX 2070 Super and RTX 2070 cost currently. AMD is rumored to announce its next-gen GPUs before the end of this year as well, so  we might need to wait just a little bit longer for official product launches. Still, it feels weird to hear that these RTX cards could be headed for obsolescence really soon, just two years after their initial release.\n\n\n\nGPUsNvidia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily

The GPU company has finally topped the CPU company's market cap (the total value of its outstanding shares) by $251bn to $248bn, meaning it is now technically worth more to its shareholders. Look at it this way: that's a lot of leather jackets for Jen-Hsun.That rise comes off the back of massive gains over the past year, during which its share value has increased by over 70%. That's quite something for the fabless company, not the least bit because it doesn't actually manufacture its own chips, but also because previous highs during the cryptocurrency boom, which were deemed by many to be unsustainable at the time, have been monumentally beaten.Nvidia's share price is now $408.64. That crushes a peak of $281 back in September 2018, before the shockwaves of the cryptocurrency mining boom brought Nvidia's stock price crashing back down. And this time its share price isn't intrinsically-tied to a flash in the pan mining movement.So what is it that has brokers bending over backwards for Nvidia stocks? All that data centre positioning and compute-focused technology CEO, Jen-Hsun Huang, is always emphatically talking about is sure to have won over many to the green team's camp. However, it's also worth noting that market cap is entirely a measure of a company's perceived worth, and not how much money it generates. That's what revenue is a measure of\u2014and Nvidia's $10.9bn barely holds a candle to Intel's $72bn total revenue in that regard.So this is as much a marker of Nvidia's expected performance going forward as to what it means for today, and there are a few potential explanations for why everyone's set their expectations so high (via Seeking Alpha).Screen queens(Image credit: Future)Best gaming monitor: pixel-perfect panels for your PC\nBest 4K monitor for gaming: when only high-res will do\nBest 4K TV for gaming: big-screen 4K PC gamingNvidia makes a lot of money off of its data centre business but GeForce is still the major money maker. Nvidia Ampere GeForce GPUs are expected to arrive later this year, some bearing the RTX 3080 name have already been spotted, and it's expected that general excitement surrounding the next-gen consoles (yes, those AMD RDNA 2-powered ones) will actually bolster the PC gaming market and Nvidia's sales, too.There's also the existing push into the data centre with the Ampere compute architecture and the A100, which Nvidia loves to show off within its AI-inference accelerating DGX system. It's fit with eight Nvidia A100 cards, 320GB of HBM2 memory, 15TB of PCIe 4.0 SSDs, and two AMD EPYC CPUs.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.But let's not forget the competition.

That's an awfully well-rounded lineup for the red team, so Nvidia will have its work cut out for it if it wants to stay ahead.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

The new variant will be making use of the Turing TU116 GPU, the same GPU that powers the higher-end GeForce 16 series cards.\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 With TU116 GPU Pictured - Turing NVENC & GDDR6 Onboard\nThe NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 graphics card has the most variants in the Turing family. There were already three variants making this the fourth entry in the GeForce GTX 1650 family (excluding GTX 1650 SUPER). The latest of the three variants was introduced at the end of last month, the GeForce GTX 1650 Ultra, which is an AIB specific part featuring the TU106 GPU core & GDDR6 memory. Now a new variant has been confirmed which will make use of the TU116 GPU core while two other GPU variants based on the TU117 core already exist in the market.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB MemoryThis specific NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 graphics card makes use of the Turing TU116-150 SKU. The specifications include 896 CUDA Cores, 56 TMUs, and 32 ROPs. The card features a 1410 MHz base clock and a 1635 MHz boost clock. These clocks could be specific to the Gigabyte variant that was spotted by Momomo_Us (Via Videocardz).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe 4 GB memory comes in GDDR6 flavor and is featured along a 128-bit bus interface at 12 Gbps. So that's a total bandwidth of 192 GB/s which should be enough to keep the card running with further room for memory overclock as the GDDR6 chips tend to overclock to around 14 Gbps with relative ease.\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX \"Turing\" Family:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 D6NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Rev 2.0NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 UltraNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 SUPERNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 SUPERNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti\n\n\n\n\nGPU ArchitectureTuring GPU (TU117)Turing GPU (TU117)Turing GPU (TU116)Turing GPU (TU106)Turing GPU (TU116)Turing GPU (TU116)Turing GPU (TU116)Turing GPU (TU116)\n\n\nProcess12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN\n\n\nDie Size200mm2200mm2284mm2445mm2284mm2284mm2284mm2284mm2\n\n\nTransistors4.7 Billion4.7 Billion6.6 Billion10.8 Billion6.6 Billion6.6 Billion6.6 Billion6.6 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores896 Cores896 Cores896 Cores896 Cores1280 Cores1408 Cores1408 Cores1536 Cores\n\n\nTMUs/ROPs56/3256/3256/3256/3280/3288/4888/4896/48\n\n\nGigaRaysN/AN/AN/AN/AN/AN/AN/AN/A\n\n\nCache1.0 MB L2 Cache1.0 MB L2 Cache1.0 MB L2 Cache1.0 MB L2 Cache1.0 MB L2 Cache1.5 MB L2 Cache1.5 MB L2 Cache1.5 MB L2 Cache\n\n\nBase Clock1485 MHz1410 MHz1410 MHz1410 MHz1530 MHz1530 MHz1530 MHz1500 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock1665 MHz1590 MHz1590 MHz\n1635 MHz (OC)1590 MHz1725 MHz1785 MHz1785 MHz1770 MHz\n\n\nCompute3.0 TFLOPs3.0 TFLOPs3.0 TFLOPs3.0 TFLOPs4.4 TFLOPs5.0 TFLOPs5.0 TFLOPs5.5 TFLOPs\n\n\nMemoryUp To 4 GB GDDR5Up To 4 GB GDDR6Up To 4 GB GDDR6Up To 4 GB GDDR6Up To 4 GB GDDR6Up To 6 GB GDDR5Up To 6 GB GDDR6Up To 6 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Speed8.00 Gbps12.00 Gbps12.00 Gbps12.00 Gbps12.00 Gbps8.00 Gbps14.00 Gbps12.00 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Interface128-bit128-bit128-bit128-bit128-bit192-bit192-bit192-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth128 GB/s192 GB/s192 GB/s192 GB/s192 GB/s192 GB/s336 GB/s288 GB/s\n\n\nPower ConnectorsN/AN/AN/AN/A6 Pin8 Pin8 Pin8 Pin\n\n\nTDP75W75W75W75W100W120W125W120W\n\n\nStarting Price$149 US$149 US$149 US$149 US?$159 US$219 US$229 US$279 US\n\n\nPrice (Founders Edition)$149 US$149 US$149 US$149 US?$159 US$219 US$229 US$279 US\n\n\nLaunchApril 2019April 2020July 2020June 2020November 2019March 2019October 2019February 2019\n\n\n\nGigabyte has named this card the GeForce GTX 1650 OC (Rev 2.0). This means that users buying the GeForce GTX 1650 should check in the labels and codename on the box which is 'GV-N1656OC-4GD R2.0'. Specifically, the Rev 2.0 tag since one of the big features that the updated GeForce GTX 1650 is going to offer would be support for the Turing NVENC video encoder and decoder which is much better than the Volta NVENC featured on the TU117 based GPUs.\n\nSince the card is a revision of an existing graphics card, the GeForce GTX 1650 Rev 2.0 will stick with the existing prices which are set around $149 US. The card is also a factory overclocked variant and makes use of a single 6-pin connector suggesting a slightly higher TDP of 90W. Gigabyte's GeForce GTX 1650 OC Rev 2.0 will come with a single fan cooler in a dual-slot design and will feature three display outputs (HDMI, DVI, Display Port).\nRecent reports have suggested that NVIDIA has halted the production of its higher-end GeForce RTX GPU lineup to prepare for the Ampere GeForce RTX launch. Only small quantities of the said GPUs are left in the retail channel and AIBs are now preparing to do the same with the lower-end lineup too. This is also one reason why we are seeing so many GeForce GTX 1650 variants as AIBs ship as much lower-end GPUs as they can prior to the launch of the next-gen entry-level parts.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n160\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nAhead of the launch of a new graphics card like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080, especially when it's as hotly anticipated as Team Green's newest, some preposterous rumors are inevitably going to spill out. In fact, that's half of the fun of following the PC hardware scene in the first place \u2013 however, now's not the time to get people alarmed about having to spend extra money for no reason.\u00a0Late last week we spotted a rumor about Nvidia submitting a new 12-pin PCIe cable to PCI-SIG for approval, which has led to some outlets, including TechRadar, jumping to the conclusion that the Nvidia Ampere GeForce lineup \u2013 which is likely hitting the market in just a few months \u2013 will require this new connector. That's probably not going to happen.\u00a0You probably don't have to worry about adding in the expense of an all-new power supply to the already substantial cost of an expensive graphics card \u2013 which is good when so many people are negatively affected by a global pandemic.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)So there's a huge power supply shortage right nowIf you go on Newegg right now and look for PC power supplies, particularly in the 850-1000W range that the kind of people buying flagship-level graphics buy, you'll notice that there's a massive shortage going on right now. Many models are simply out of stock, and those that aren't are seeing some pretty massive price increases.\u00a0Take the EVGA 850 G5, for instance \u2013 which just so happens to be the power supply we use in our personal gaming machine. This power supply has technically been succeeded by the EVGA SuperNOVA GA \u2013 which is only available through a third party seller on Newegg with a paltry 29% positive rating \u2013 but you'll have to pay $195 (about \u00a3150, AU$280) for this model, compared to the $149 (about \u00a3120, AU$210) list price of its successor. And, in case you haven't guessed, the SuperNOVA GA is definitely out of stock on EVGA's own website. Oh, and it's out of stock until July 31 on Amazon, too.\u00a0And, it's more than just a cursory glance at power supplies on digital stores, too. There are posts on Toms Hardware's forums, Reddit, EVGA forums and more of customers either not being able to procure a new power supply or even get their faulty power supply replaced by the manufacturer.\u00a0Your guess is as good as ours as to why this is happening \u2013 there are a lot of supply issues everywhere right now \u2013 but it doesn't look like the power supply market is ready to tackle the kind of demand that forcing everyone to upgrade would cause.\u00a0Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.(Image credit: Pexels)What happened to longevity?In the PC hardware enthusiast scene, there's a lot of excitement about upgrading to the latest and best processors and graphics cards when they come out \u2013 we know we here at TechRadar are definitely in that camp \u2013 but you don't really see a lot of excitement about upgrading to new power supplies. That's because, well, they last a long time.\u00a0Searching around the internet, it looks like the general advice is to replace your power supply \"when it dies\", and for people that only built their computers a couple of years ago, having to upgrade their power supply to get the latest and greatest GPU would definitely be a tough pill to swallow \u2013 not to mention pretty awful for the environment \u2013 just check this report by the World Economic Forum if you need a reminder.\u00a0We can definitely attest to that PSU upgrade cycle. Before the PC we built when Nvidia Turing launched, the computer this editor used for their personal gaming and work uses used the same power supply since about 2009, with no hint of it dying when they eventually replaced it. That ThermalTake power supply lasted a good 9 years, through multiple graphics cards upgrades \u2013 from the AMD Radeon HD 5870 to the Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 and everything in between.But, still, all of this advice is taken from forums or a TechRadar editor's personal experience. We haven't put any of these claims through any amount of rigorous testing, but it should give you an idea of the general vibe when it comes to upgrading power supplies, and how long they're typically expected to last.\u00a0(Image credit: Future)You probably have nothing to worry aboutThe Tom's Hardware report that we then reported on suggests that a new 12-pin power connector has been submitted by Nvidia to the PCI-SIG standards body for approval. However, you shouldn't take that as confirmation that this connector is definitely going to be a thing, or even that it's actually been submitted.\u00a0However, let's just assume that Nvidia did submit this connector in for approval. According to Tom's Hardware, the rumor circles around upcoming Ampere graphics cards, which would theoretically include the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080. The problem there, however, is that Ampere is the graphics architecture behind Nvidia's next-generation GPUs for data scientists and AI \u2013 not just GeForce.\u00a0We're talking about GPUs that are way more powerful than anything us consumers will see in even the best gaming PCs, and thus could theoretically use the added power that this new 12-pin PCIe connector would provide. The way we look at it, that's way more likely than Nvidia pushing a new power standard on mainstream consumers and impact the sales of its next-generation gaming cards, especially when AMD RDNA 2 likely won't do the same thing.\u00a0There have been rumors that the next-generation Nvidia flagship will consume up to 350W, and you can take that for what it's worth. It's unlikely that this will actually happen \u2013 that's more power than the Titan RTX consumes. Even the AMD Radeon R9 Fury X \u2013 which AMD had to ship with a liquid cooler \u2013 had a TDP of 275W. \u00a0Even if we did get a 350W RTX 3080 Ti \u2013 which would be a marketing nightmare for Nvidia \u2013 it wouldn't necessitate a connector allowing for 648W of PCIe power. As Tom's Hardware points out in its story, the current configuration of two 8-pin PCIe connectors allows for 375W of power.So, if these new graphics cards don't actually require the added power, launching these graphics cards with the new power connector \u2013 even if it is just the Founders Edition cards \u2013 seems like a good way to limit how many will actually sell.\u00a0Another possibility, however, is that this new power connector will be used on aftermarket card designs. Many of these tend to add extra power connectors anyways in order to facilitate higher clock speeds and the resulting bump in power consumption.\u00a0At the end of the day, no one will know what the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is going to look like, how many power connectors it will have or even what the TDP will be until Nvidia spills the beans. And, while there will inevitably be a ton of rumors to fill the gap until launch day, there are definitely some with more merit \u2013 and the \"12-pin power connector on the RTX 3080 Ti\" is definitely one that's less likely to actually be true.\u00a0We'll show you how to build a PC\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nBill ThomasSocial Links NavigationBill Thomas (Twitter) is TechRadar's computing editor.

The Pro model comes with two USB ports that let you extend storage, so if you want to attach an external hard drive to your Shield TV (2019) then you should get the Pro version.Extensible goodness: NVIDIA Shield TV Pro (2019) ($200 at Amazon)Store everything: Seagate Portable External Hard Drive 5TB ($110 at Amazon)Get the Shield TV Pro (2019) if you want expandable storageNVIDIA allows you to mount a USB storage device as a removable drive for accessing media files or use it instead as dedicated internal storage for downloading apps and games.This time around, NVIDIA is offering two different options of the Shield TV, and only one of those has USB ports for connecting external hard drives. The regular Shield TV (2019) has just an HDMI and microSD card slot, and there's no way to attach an external drive.So if you're looking to pick up the Shield TV and are interested in connecting your external drive for streaming music or movies from the device, you should pick up the Shield TV Pro (2019).

IThome argues that because stock of these Turing GPUs will be dwindling, obviously enough with things winding down, plus apparently TSMC, the foundry that makes the cards, is focusing elsewhere anyway, with supply issues therein too.Couple this with a reported increase in demand for crypto-mining GPUs \u2013 yes, that\u2019s a thing again apparently \u2013 and you\u2019ve got supply and demand issues pulling in nasty directions, with graphics cards thinner on the ground as a result. Meaning one thing: rising prices for these RTX 2070 and 2080 models.As we said, though, the price rise element of this rumor certainly needs a good deal of salt tossed around, but the state of play with production of these GPUs being wound down is obviously perfectly believable given that RTX 3000 graphics cards are expected to be launched soon anyway.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The most recent rumor we\u2019ve heard is that Nvidia is targeting a September launch \u2013 and AMD may be as well \u2013 with mass production cranking up in August, and indeed IThome has floated a date of September 17 for the launch of Ampere GPUs.If that date is about on the money, that gives us two more months of Turing products being on sale \u2013 but perhaps only a few weeks before the prices of these current-gen models start rising (perhaps being the key word here).These are the best graphics cards\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

The 451.67 Game Ready version is timed with the release of Death Stranding, which is coming to Steam on July 14th, plus it adds optimizations for Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition and F1 2020.\nThis is the second public release of NVIDIA\u2019s Release 450 branch. The previous version (451.48) added support for DirectX 12 Ultimate, as Sebastian mentioned two weeks ago, as well as Vulkan 1.2 and CUDA 11. It also fixed a handful of security issues. This version, 451.67, does not list any security fixes yet, although that could lag a day or two. It does have a handful of normal bug fixes, though, such as for a random crash that occurs in Detroit: Become Human. If you have a laptop GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, and you experienced blue-screen crashes, then there is a fix for you, too. There are a few other fixes, but they are relatively minor.\nThere was also a GeForce Experience update. If you could not see the release notes because of a server-side Java exception, then you can check them out on NVIDIA\u2019s website. While you are there\u2026 there being either GeForce Experience or the NVIDIA website\u2026 then you can grab the new drivers, too.\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousTeamGroup T-Force Vulcan 500GB; Still Room For SATA? \n\nNextA Titan-ic Dual Quadro RTX 8000 Review \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nScott Michaud\nScott joined PC Perspective in May 2011.

The company has broken a total of 16 performance records in AI-specific benchmarks & also beaten its main competitors in the specific machine learning performance category by a huge lead.\nNVIDIA Ampere A100 GPU Breaks 16 AI World Records, Up To 4.2x Faster Than Volta V100\nThe results come in from MLPerf which is an industry benchmarking group formed back in 2018 with a focus purely on Machine Learning performance. The benchmark suite consists of a total of eight tests and NVIDIA has posted records in all with record training speeds.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB MemoryThis is the third consecutive and strongest showing for NVIDIA in training tests from\u00a0MLPerf, an industry benchmarking group formed in May 2018. NVIDIA set six records in the first MLPerf training benchmarks in December 2018 and eight in July 2019.\nNVIDIA was the only company to field commercially\u00a0available\u00a0products for all the tests. Most other submissions used the\u00a0preview category\u00a0for products that may not be available for several months or the\u00a0research category for products not expected to be available for some time.\nNVIDIA Blogs\nNVIDIA also reported eight additional records with its DGX SuperPOD system which is a massive cluster of DGX A100 HPC systems connected together through HDR InfiniBand. The DGX SuperPod consists of 140 DGX A100 systems with a total of 1,120 NVIDIA Ampere A100 GPUs, 170 Mellanox Quantum 200G Infiniband switches, 4 PB of storage and 15km of optical cable.\n\nThat's around 7.7 million Ampere CUDA cores inside the DGX SuperPod system which is mind-blowing. The system is part of the DGX V expansion plan, adding nearly 700 Petaflops of computing horsepower to the system which is currently deployed at NVIDIA's HQ in Santa Clara, California.\nThe AI Performance Benchmarks - Ampere vs Volta & More\nNVIDIA has compared their Ampere A100 Tensor Core GPU accelerator to its predecessor, the Volta V100. The comparison also includes Google's 3rd Generation TPU and Huawei's Ascend HPC chips. MLPerf themselves have more detailed benchmarks listed and also include a preview of upcoming AI accelerators such as Intel's Cooper Lake-SP Xeon CPUs and Google's 4th Gen TPU. With that said, let's take a look at the benchmarks themselves.\n\nAccording to MLPerf, their benchmark suite includes tests that target the performance workloads that are most relevant in the machine learning and AI categories. The NVIDIA Ampere A100 simply destroys the Volta V100 with a performance speed up by a factor of 2.5x. Even at its minimum lead, the Ampere A100 delivers a 50% boost over the Volta V100 GPU which is impressive. The chip-scale here was normalized to a single GPU to deliver a fair comparison between Ampere and Volta.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe Huawei Ascend chip was able to finish just one test in time and that too with poor performance than the Volta V100 while Google's TPU V3 only managed to complete two tests in time. In one test, the chip secured a 20% lead over NVIDIA Volta V100 while in the second test, it was 10% slower than the V100.\nCompared to the Cooper Lake-SP 8-socket configuration which completes the image classification test in 1104.53 minutes, a dual NVIDIA A100 system can complete the same test in just 33.37 mins. NVIDIA also goes ahead to compare the performance of its Ampere A100 to the unreleased Google TPU V4 which is still in the research stage and at least a year away from availability.\n\nNVIDIA also shows how the performance of their GPU accelerators has improved over time with the latest full-stack innovations for AI. Compared to MLPerf 0.5 running on Volta V100, the MLPerf 0.7 suite running with Ampere A100 delivers a mind-blowing 4.2x performance gain.\nThis goes off to show just how impressive of a chip the NVIDIA Ampere A100 GPU is in real-world benchmarks within a suite that is recognized by all major players in the AI community. The Ampere A100 GPU was also regarded as the fastest GPU ever recorded in another benchmark even when compared to the Turing GPU which had hw-accelerated techniques enabled to deliver better perf but still couldn't match the Ampere A100 and its huge performance output. All these benchmark capabilities make us all the more excited to see Ampere in consumer form which should definitely be happening a few months from now.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n160\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Specifically the growing hype around the battle between Nvidia, and their upcoming GeForce RTX 30 series, and AMD with their upcoming Navi 2X series. The latest in a string of rumors suggests that gamers wanting sky-high frame rates may not have long to wait, as Nvidia's flagship cards may be launching in\u00a0less than a couple of months. \nThe leak\u00a0comes from Chinese site ITHome, and claims that the hotly anticipated GeForce RTX 3080 and more-powerful RTX 3080 Ti cards will both launch on September 17th 2020. This is slightly later than suggested by another recent leak from Overclocking.com,\u00a0who stated that a small run of Founders Edition RTX 30 Series cards\u00a0would be made available in August.\u00a0Potentially both rumors could be right,\u00a0if Nvidia holds\u00a0a limited launch in August, and full launch in September.\nRELATED:\u00a0NVIDIA GeForce 3080 Graphics Card Image Leaks\nAs part of ramping up the production and sales of the new high-end cards, the rumor also states that Nvidia are planning to discontinue several of the current generation equivalents. With the RTX 2070, RTX 2070 Super, RTX 2080 Ti, and RTX 2080 Super cards all believed to be in-line for delisting soon, making way for the newer, faster, and more power hungry cards.\nHaving the launch in September would fit with past launches, as the current generation RTX 2080 was announced at a similar time, during the Gamescom 2018 event. It would also provide Nvidia with a solid\u00a0timing advantage\u00a0over AMD if another release rumor is correct. Wjm47196, a Chiphell\u00a0user with a history of accurate leaks,\u00a0has suggested\u00a0that AMD's Navi 2X is further away than expected from launch, and may not see release until October or November.\nWhile the hype around the new graphics card battle grows, so do the calls for gamers looking for an upgrade to wait. The remaining Turing based RTX 20 series cards are expected to sell out quickly due to\u00a0their use in cryptocurrency mining, as has happened previously. When combined with the current\u00a0limited chip supply. it seems unlikely that gamers will get clearance bargains. While the increased competition between Nvidia and AMD\u00a0over the next-gen\u00a0launches of Ampere and Navi 2X cards could result in lower than expected pricing,\u00a0neither range is likely to be\u00a0cheap.\nHowever, with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 rumored to be 20% faster than the existing RTX 2080 Ti card, it may well\u00a0turn out that the extra cost is\u00a0justified by the jump in performance. As with all the current information available though, it comes from rumors and alleged leaks, so gamers will have to wait to know for sure.\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3080 Ti\u00a0are rumored to launch on 17th September, no official date has been announced.\nMORE:\u00a0Nvidia RTX: Top 5 Games That Utilize RTX The Best (& 5 That Do Not)\nSource: ITHome\u00a0/ Wccftech

If you are looking for numbers, the planned SuperPOD of 140 Nvidia DGX A100 systems, boosting the existing HiPerGator supercomputer, will deliver 700 petaflops of AI performance. It is hoped that the project will make UF one of the leading AI universities in the US, a national leader.\n\nInterestingly the UF/Nvidia Ai supercomputer development is being funded by a $25 million from alumnus and Nvidia co-founder Chris Malachowsky, $25 million in hardware, software, training and services from Nvidia, plus a $20 million investment by the university. Malachowsky, an Nvidia Fellow, commented that the project \"created a replicable, powerful model of public-private cooperation for everyone's benefit\". I guess most big universities must have a super-rich yet generous tech giant founder among their alumni\u2026\n\nAccording to the Nvidia Blog, the new AI supercomputer will be used to tackle a multitude of challenges using AI tools and techniques. \"Major challenges such as rising seas, aging populations, data security, personalized medicine, urban transportation and food insecurity,\" will be just some of the areas where the processing power of the Nvidia SuperPOD will be targeted.\nTo realise the project Nvidia's NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute will collaborate with UF on developing new curriculum and coursework for both students and the community. The UF will become the site of the latest Nvidia AI Technology Center. Last but not least, Nvidia solution architects and product engineers will partner with UF on the installation, operation and optimization of the supercomputer.\n\nIn total UF's boosted HiPerGator 3 supercomputer will integrate 140 Nvidia DGX A100 systems powered by a combined 1,120 Nvidia A100 Tensor Core GPUs. It will include 4 petabytes of high-performance storage. An Nvidia Mellanox HDR 200Gb/s InfiniBand network will provide the high throughput and extremely low-latency network connectivity.\nFor the UF, it will benefit greatly with 100 new faculty positions in AI and related fields in addition to the 500 recently hired faculty across disciplines, many of whom will weave AI into their teaching and research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\nDell updates XPS and Alienware desktops with Alder Lake CPUs\n\n                    And you can spec up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090, or an AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n2\nCorsair Xenomorph PC system with AMD Ryzen 6000 APU spotted\n\n                    8C/16T 'Rembrandt' APU features an RDNA2 iGPU and is joined by DDR5-4800 memory. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n15\nFramework laptop modular marketplace goes live\n\n                    A handy place to pick and choose upgrades, replacement parts, and modules. \n                \n\n\n\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\nHP lists AiO PCs with \"AMD Ryzen 7000 Series\" CPUs\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 5 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

Check those out below.\n\nRelated Story Death Stranding Looks Hauntingly Beautiful In VR With New Work-In-Progress Mod\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAkio Sakamoto, CTO at KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS, also stated:\nDEATH STRANDING already has the reputation of being a visual stunner, but NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 helps make the PC debut something special. The extra performance NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 delivers in DEATH STRANDING allows gamers to unlock the vast graphical potential of the PC platform by increasing the graphics settings and resolution, delivering on the vision we have for the game.\n[ORIGINAL STORY] Death Stranding PC will be the next title to support NVIDIA's Deep Learning Super-Sampling 2.0 technique, according to a press release leaked early by the Latin American website PCMRACE. The article has been now taken down, presumably at the behest of NVIDIA, but the Internet remembers.\nAmong the highlights is the long-awaited Death Stranding, a title that unfolds a grim post-apocalyptic future, devised by the creator of the Metal Gear series, Hideo Kojima. The game explores a society that seeks to reconnect and features the performances of actors like Norman Reedus, in addition to being able to enjoy even more beautiful landscapes on PC, thanks to NVIDIA's DLSS 2.0 technology.\nPC gamers can finally enjoy this award-winning work by legendary game maker Hideo Kojima on reconnecting a destroyed humanity and harnessing the power of GeForce GPUs to run at 60 FPS. The PC version is also compatible with NVIDIA DLSS to improve visual quality and offer more frames per second, as well as to play the game on ultra-wide screens, along with the new photographic mode.\nThis is also interesting because Death Stranding is based on the Decima Engine, the same one used by Guerrilla Games for Horizon Zero Dawn which is also about to launch on PC. Then again, Sony seems to have partnered with AMD on the PC release of Horizon Zero Dawn, so it's far from a given that we'll see DLSS 2.0 on that game as well.\nIn related Death Stranding PC news, Japanese website GameSpark recently had a brief interview with Kojima Productions developers Ukio Sakamoto and Akiyoshi Saito, who confirmed that there won't be any interaction with PlayStation 4 players through the game's indirect online features. Each platform will be kept separate instead.\nWe also learned the story of the Death Stranding PC collaboration with Valve that led to the Half-Life crossover.\nWhen I visited Valve before Kojipro, a story was raised saying, \"If we could collaborate in the future.\" As Kojima Productions, we value collaboration and relationships among developers, so we will consider it positively. Of course, the most important thing is to provide surprises and surprises to all users so that they can enjoy themselves. This collaboration with \"Half-Life\" was planned and implemented as an Easter egg, but I am surprised and delighted with the great response. In addition, I would like to announce the details of future collaboration plans again, so please wait for a while.\nDeath Stranding PC is out on July 14th.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nDeath Stranding PC Is Free to Grab on the Epic Games Store\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath Stranding 2 Isn\u2019t Just a Regular Sequel, Says Hideo Kojima\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath Stranding Film Adaptation Announced, Kojima to Produce\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath Stranding 2 Announced for PS5 with an Epic Kojima Trailer at The Game Awards\n\nNathan Birch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n147\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n126\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n84\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nA Mac Studio Cluster Of Four Units, All Featuring Apple\u2019s Latest M3 Ultra, Consume Less Than Half The Power Of A Network Switch When Running At Idle\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n39\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n857\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

A2 provides up to 16 GPUs in a single VM and is the first A100-based offering in the public cloud.\nGoogle designed the A2-family of VMs to boost training and inference computing performance for its customers. The A2 features the NVIDIA A-100 Tensor Core graphics processing unit based up\u00a0the newly NVIDIA Ampere architecture. According to the blog post, the A-100 offers up to 20 times the compute performance compared to the previous generation GPU, and comes with 40 GB of high performance HBM2 GPU memory. Also, A2 VMs come with up to 96 Intel Cascade Lake vCPUs, optional Local SSDs for workloads requiring faster data feeds to GPUs and up to 100 Gbps of networking.\u00a0\nWhen customers have more demanding workloads, the A2 offers the a2-megagpu-16g instance with 16 A100 GPUs, which include a total of 640 GB of GPU memory, 1.3 TB of system memory and all-in-all connected through NVSwitch with up to 9.6TB/s of aggregate bandwidth.\n\r\n\u00a0\nSource: https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/announcing-google-cloud-a2-vm-family-based-on-nvidia-a100-gpu\nNote that A2 also offers smaller configurations allowing customers to match their need for GPU compute power. Customers can choose between five configurations, from one to 16 GPU\u2019s, with two different CPU- and networking-to-GPU ratios - each GPU to be partitioned into as many as seven GPU instances, owing to Ampere\u2019s multi-instance group (MIG) capability.\nIan Buck, general manager\u00a0and vice president of Accelerated Computing at NVIDIA, wrote in a recent company blog post about the availability of the A-100 on GCP:\n\nIn cloud data centers, A100 can power a broad range of compute-intensive applications, including AI training and inference, data analytics, scientific computing, genomics, edge video analytics, 5G services, and more.\n\nWith the A2 family, VMs Google further expands its portfolio of predefined and custom VMs ranging from compute- to accelerator optimized machines. Moreover, the company continues to compete with other cloud vendors such as Microsoft, which recently released new general purpose and memory-optimized VM families on various Intel Chipsets (AVX-512) \u00a0\u2013 and AWS, which recently released EC2 Inf1 instances based on its Inferentia chips. Many of these new VM types are targeted for customers with AI and Machine Learning workloads.\nHolger Mueller, principal analyst and vice president at Constellation Research Inc., told InfoQ:\n\nThe battle for cloud leadership is primarily fought in the AI battle, and that is all about getting the AI load of enterprises attracted to each vendor's cloud. In the middle are platform vendors like NVidia, that provide\u00a0a cross-cloud platform and on-premise option. So with Google bringing the newest Nvidia platform to its Google Cloud, it makes it easier for CxOs to move AI workloads across on-premises and to the (Google) cloud.\n\nAlso, he said:\n\nWith Google being the #3 vendor, it has to be more open and more creative at attracting load - and this is another example of the Google strategy. In contrast, the larger AWS and Azure strategy is still to move to cloud proprietary compute architectures for AI loads. CxOs need to be aware\u00a0that lock-in is still a desirable outcome for most technology vendors and needs to balance the risks between convenience, speed and lock-in.\n\nCurrently, the A2 VM family is in alpha, and customers can request access by signing up. Moreover, Google states that public availability and pricing information will come later in the year. And finally, the company also announced forthcoming Nvidia A100 support for Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud AI Platform, and other services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRate this Article\n\n\nAdoption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStyle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Author Contacted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                \n                    \n                This content is in the Cloud topic\n            \n\nRelated Topics:\n\n\nDevelopment\n\n\nArchitecture & Design\n\n\nDevOps\n\n\nAI, ML & Data Engineering\n\n\nGoogle\n\n\nIaaS\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform\n\n\nMachine Learning\n\n\nVM\n\n\nCloud Computing\n\n\nCloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Editorial\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Sponsored Content\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular across InfoQ\n\n\n\n\n                                Node.js 23.6 Now Runs TypeScript Natively\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n                                SharePoint Framework 1.21 Adds Minor Updates for UI Components\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n                                OpenAI Introduces Software Engineering Benchmark\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n                                Vercel Fluid: a New Compute Model and an Alternative to Serverless?\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n                                Checklist for Kubernetes in Production: Best Practices for SREs\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n                                Understanding What Really Matters for Developer Productivity: a Conversation with Lizzie Matusov\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite Your Way to a QCon or InfoQ Dev Summit!\nJoin the InfoQ article competition to win a complimentary ticket to QCon or InfoQ Dev Summit!

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia A100 PCIe (Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia's Ampere A100 GPU has been out since May, but we had no idea of how it performed until today. Jules Urbach, founder and CEO of OTOY, has tweeted what seems to be the first benchmark of the A100.The A100 scored 446 points on OctaneBench, thus claiming the title of fastest GPU to ever grace the benchmark. The Nvidia Titan V was the previous record holder with an average score of 401 points. The A100 delivered up to 11.2% higher performance than the Titan V. Urbach highlighted that the A100 run was with RTX disabled.It doesn't come as a complete shock that the A100 would topple the Titan V if you look closely at the A100's composition. The GA100 silicon measures 826 millimeters-squared and flaunts 54.2 billion transistors, which is possible, thanks to TSMC's 7nm FinFET manufacturing process. The silicon comes equipped with 128 streaming multiprocessors (SMs), amounting to 8,192 CUDA cores. The A100 doesn't leverage the full die, but its specifications are impressive nonetheless.\u00a0The A100 is equipped with 6,912 CUDA cores and 432 Tensor cores. The GPU's other imposing traits include 40GB of HBM2E memory across a 5,120-bit memory interface for a bandwidth up to a whopping 1,555 GBps. The Titan V's 5,120 CUDA cores and 12GB of HBM2 memory look paltry beside the A100.(Image credit: Jule Urbach/Twitter)OctaneBench benchmarks graphics cards with the OctaneRender, and one of its requirements is Nvidia CUDA. Therefore, you won't find any Radeon GPUs from the Red Team on the leaderboard. You will find a generous lot of GeForce, Quadro and Tesla devices on the list though.The GeForce RTX 2080 Ti ranks 14 on the OctaneBench leaderboard with an average score of 302. The A100 is up to 47.7% faster. Keep in mind that GA100 silicon is tailored for Nvidia's data center products. It's delusional to think it will make its way to Nvidia's forthcoming consumer graphics cards, presumably dubbed RTX 3080 and RTX 3090. The A100 is the successor to the GV100 (Volta), so it could end up in a Titan GPU.Multiple rumors claim that mainstream Ampere graphics cards may employ the GA102 die. Obviously, it'll be smaller in comparison to the GA100 and ultimately features less SMs. Thus far, the GA102 die is rumored to have up to 84 SMs that results in 5,376 CUDA cores. This might be the silicon that Nvidia uses for the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti or GeForce RTX 3090. In any event, it's unlikely that the GA102 will outperform the GA100 given the CUDA core deficit. It could be a close fight if Nvidia gives the GA102-based GPUs some crazy clock speeds.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Ampere will undoubtedly bring an important performance upgrade over Turing.

One foot squared equals 92,903.04 millimeters squared. Your example of (2.7 ft) by (2.7 ft) is larger than 677,000 millimeters squared (which is 820 times GA100's die area as stated in the article). Be educated.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit_user\n\n\nescksu said:We have to consider the fact that A100 is designed as a compute card for specialised applications such as AI. Its not exactly a gpu, not a quadro.I'm not familiar with the benchmark, but I got the impression it merely uses CUDA for computation. In that sense, the specs should be entirely predictive of the resultant performance.\n\nThe Titan V has 653 GB/sec of memory bandwidth and 14.9 TFLOPS of fp32 compute (at boost clocks).\nThe A100 has 1555 GB/sec of memory bandwidth and 19.5 TFLOPS of fp32 compute (at ??? clocks).\n\nSo, if the workload is compute-limited, then it should be at least 30.9% faster (possibly more, depending on whether the A100 figures I saw were base or boost). However, if it's limited by memory bandwidth, then it should be 138% faster! Either way, 11.2% is really disappointing. I think it likely points to bottlenecks in the software, but we don't really know. It's definitely not good news - that's for sure!\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonGato\n\n\nDoofusOfDeath said:That can't be right.

When quizzed as to whether it planned to remove its introductory fee, Nvidia told PC Gamer that \u201cwe\u2019ll think about this next year.\"However, it's unlikely Ampere will be available on GeForce Now any time soon. Although Nvidia\u2019s first Ampere-based GPUs are expected to launch in September, it's worth remembering that Team Green's Turing architecture didn\u2019t arrive on the streaming service until a few months after the architecture\u2019s initial late-2018 debut.PC Gamer speculates that if Nvidia's aspirations for GeForce Now are met, \"Ampere will arrive in the cloud sooner than Turing made the leap.\"Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.If online speculation are anything to go by, Ampere on GeForce Now will be worth waiting for.

Replacing the GeForce RTX 2060, the NVIDIA RTX 3060 series will be positioned in the mainstream segment with pricing around $300 to $400 US which is pretty much what the existing lineup costs, however, these cards are positioned in a heated segment with AMD also actively working on replacing its mainstream lineup soon.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Series Mainstream Graphics Cards To Feature GA106 GPU Core, Will Hit Retail Around $300-$400 US - GA107 Entry-Tier Ampere Gaming GPU Taped Out Too\nThe latest rumors are once again being tweeted out by Kopite7kimi who has revealed that NVIDIA has taped out two new GPUs in the past few weeks. These include the Ampere GA106 and GA107. Both GPUs are based on the Ampere graphics architecture and focused on the consumer segment which includes entry and mainstream graphics cards.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\nGA106 and GA107 had taped out a few weeks ago.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) July 8, 2020\n\nIf these NVIDIA Gaming GPUs are indeed taped out a few weeks back, then this would suggest that we shouldn't expect these cards to enter the retail segment anytime soon. The same was true for the GeForce RTX 2060 which was introduced four months after the GeForce RTX 2080. NVIDIA may initially be planning to target the high-end enthusiast cards from AMD based on its RDNA 2 GPUs.\n\nLooking at what we know about the GA106 GPU, it is expected to power the GeForce RTX 3060 series graphics cards. By series I mean to say that the GeForce RTX 3060 might include more than just one graphics card.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Gaming Graphics Cards Alleged Specifications:\nThe reason is that Kopite7kimi's rumor suggests that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 itself is going to feature the GA106-300 GPU. We don't know the exact specifications for this specific chip but we do know that the '300' SKU is usually not the top chip. The Turing TU106 GPU had several variants that included:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (TU106-200)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 (TU106-400)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER (TU106-410)\n\nIn the case of Turing, the GeForce RTX 2070 featured the top TU106 SKU but in the previous rumor, it was stated that RTX 3070 series would be utilizing the GA104 GPU which is a step up from Turing. But that would leave room open for several SKUs in the mainstream segment. It is likely that GA106 300 would power the standard GeForce RTX 3060 but there could be two more SKUs planned out. A GeForce RTX 3060 Ti / SUPER could launch with the full-fat GA106-400 SKU while a lower-end RTX 3050 SUPER could be introduced with the GA106-200 SKU.\n\nBut while these are just possibilities, there needs to be a necessity such as competition or demand in a particular segment for such cards to be produced in the first place. The RTX 3060 is a given but the rest of the two SKUs depend mostly on what AMD has up their sleeves. Currently, the RTX 2060 series cards are placed in vastly different segments. NVIDIA had already stated that its GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER doesn't replace the GeForce RTX 2060. The RTX 2060 features a cut-down core, lower 6 GB VRAM, and a much lower price point of $279 US while the GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER features the beefed-up TU106 core with 8 GB VRAM and a much higher price point of $399 US.\nAlso, it's interesting that most previous rumors pointed to the GA106-300 SKU featuring 6 GB VRAM while the RTX 2060 SUPER features 8 GB VRAM. While the specifications are not set in the stone yet, it will definitely feel like a downgrade in terms of memory size for users upgrading from a GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER to the GeForce RTX 3060 even if the latter offers better performance. So its slightly early to say whether we will once again see 6 GB memory on the RTX 3060 or will NVIDIA finally up the VRAM on its mainstream lineup too.\n\nMaybe, RTX 3070 (Super or Ti?) , GA104-400RTX 3070, GA104-300RTX 3060, GA106-300.Actually, I don't know the codename is GA or A? lol~\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) June 9, 2020\n\nA possibility is that the standard RTX 3060 replaces the RTX 2060 with 6 GB VRAM and the RTX 3060 Ti/SUPER replaces the RTX 2060 SUPER with 8 GB VRAM at a much higher price point. Again, these cards will be positioned in vastly different segments like the existing mainstream lineup.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Gaming Graphics Cards Alleged Specifications:\nThe GeForce RTX 3050 series cards based on the Ampere GA107 GPU will be the last chips to hit the market segment. These cards will be interesting in the sense that they will be positioned in the low-end desktop segment. NVIDIA had quite a rough start with its GTX 1650 series with the Turing GPUs but slightly redeemed its position with the launch of the GTX 1650 SUPER. The cards will be priced at around $150-$200 US but NVIDIA couldn't let the $200-$300 segment open for AMD to dominate since it will also be launching its RDNA 2 entry-level GPUs sometime next year.\n\nCurrently, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 series cards are well-positioned within the $200-$300 market segment but unlike Turing, all Ampere cards are expected to feature RTX capabilities. This means that we are unlikely to get a GeForce GTX lineup with Ampere. If we do get one, then we could get some sense of how the lineup will be positioned in the market but if not, then NVIDIA would have to play some pricing games in the sub $300 segment. Once again, a higher tier RTX 3050 Ti / SUPER card based on the GA106 GPU would make sense for a price of around $229-$249 US that replaces the GTX 1660 SUPER.\nAlso, it's not likely that all of these GPUs and graphics cards will launch at the same time. Certain models will arrive first, followed by mainstream and low-end offerings. The refreshed parts may arrive much later in Ampere's roadmap so most of the lineup can be changed in the future.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere Gaming GPU' Rumored Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameGPUCores (SMs)MemoryMemory BusBandwidth\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Titan RTX (2nd Gen)Ampere GA102-4005376 (84)24 GB GDDR6X384-bit~816 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA Titan RTX (1st Gen)Turing TU102-4004608 (72)24 GB GDDR6384-bit672 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti / NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090Ampere GA102-3005248 (82)12 GB GDDR6X384-bit~1.00 TB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 TiTuring TU102-3004352 (68)11 GB GDDR6352-bit616 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080Ampere GA102-2004352 (68)10 GB GDDR6X320-bit~760 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Turing TU104-4002944 (46)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiAmpere GA104-4003072 (48)8 GB GDDR6X256-bit~512 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPERTuring TU104-4102560 (40)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ampere GA104-3002944 (46)8 GB GDDR6256-bit~512 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070Turing TU106-4002304 (36)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiAmpere GA106-400TBDTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPERTuring TU106-4102176 (34)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ampere GA106-300TBDTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Turing TU106-2001920 (30)6 GB GDDR6192-bit336 GB/s\n\n\n\nWe just have to wait and see how NVIDIA goes with the pricing this time around but with AMD adjusting its\u00a0high-end and mainstream Radeon RX RDNA 2 graphics cards\u00a0for launch in Q4 2020, we might see some aggressive prices by NVIDIA for its own Ampere lineup this time around.

If you\u2019re not using deep neural networks, there\u2019s a good chance you use gradient boosting.\nData scientists use open-source XGBoost libraries in industries such as:\n\nFinancial services \u2013 Predicting loan performance and other financial risks\nRetail \u2013 Predicting customer churn\nAdvertising \u2013 Predicting click rate\n\nAmazon EMR and NVIDIA GPU instances\nAmazon EMR is the industry-leading cloud big data platform for processing vast amounts of data using open-source tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Flink, Apache Hudi, and Presto. With Amazon EMR, you can run petabyte-scale analysis at less than half the cost of traditional on-premises solutions and over three times faster than standard Apache Spark. Data scientists use Amazon EMR to run open-source deep learning and ML tools such as TensorFlow and Apache MXNet, and use case-specific tools and libraries. You can quickly and easily create scalable and secure clusters with the latest GPU instances for distributed ML training with a few clicks on the Amazon EMR console.\nFor more information about getting started with Amazon EMR, see What Is Amazon EMR?\nG4 instance on Amazon EMR\nAmazon EMR continually evolves GPU offerings and collaborates with partners like NVIDIA to improve the platform\u2019s performance. Our latest development is the support for the EC2 G4 instance type featuring an NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPU with 16 GB of GPU memory, offered under the Nitro hypervisor with 1\u20134 GPUs per node. It also includes up to 1.8 TB of local non-volatile memory express (NVMe) storage and up to 100 Gbps of network bandwidth.\nThe T4 Tensor Core GPU offering from NVIDIA is a cost-effective and versatile GPU instance for accelerating ML models training and inferencing, video transcoding, and other compute-intensive workloads. G4 instances are offered in different instance sizes with access to one GPU or multiple GPUs with different amounts of vCPU and memory\u2014giving you the flexibility to pick the right instance size for your applications.\nAccelerated XGBoost open-source library integrated into Apache Spark by NVIDIA\nWhile ML at scale can deliver powerful, predictive capabilities to millions of users, it hinges on overcoming two key challenges across infrastructure to save costs and deliver results faster: speeding up preprocessing massive volumes of data and accelerating compute-intensive model training.\nTo tackle these challenges, NVIDIA is incubating RAPIDS, a set of open-source software libraries, and the RAPIDS team works closely with the Distributed Machine Learning Common (DMLC) XGBoost organization to upstream code and make sure that all components of the GPU-accelerated analytics ecosystem work together smoothly. We used the XGBoost4J-Spark open-source library, which enables training and inferencing of XGBoost models across Apache Spark nodes. With GPUs, you can exploit data parallelism through columnar processing instead of traditional row-based reading designed initially for CPUs. This allows for cost savings and higher performance.\nHigher performance at lower cost with Amazon EMR on GPU instances\nWe benchmarked the latest RAPIDS-Spark XGBoost4j open-source library on an EMR cluster with EC2 G4 instances running Apache Spark. We ran the benchmark using a 1 TB open-source dataset called Criteo on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) directly. Criteo is commonly used for predicting click-through rates on display ads. We used Amazon S3 as a data store.\nThe following graphs show our improvements in training time and costs.\n\nAn EMR cluster running G4dn instances is 5.4 times cheaper and 4.5 times faster than an EMR cluster running EC2 R5 memory-optimized instances. The EMR cluster with g4dn GPU instances gave us almost the same training time but at half the cost of running the training on an EMR cluster running EC2 P3 instances. The following table summarizes our findings.\n\n\n\nType\nNumber of Instances\nHardware per Instance\nInstance Type\nAmazon EC2 Cost per Hour\nAmazon EMR Cost per Hour\nTraining (Minutes)\nTraining Costs\n\n\nGPU\n16\n4x T4\ng4dn.12xlarge\n$3.912\n$0.27\n6\n$6.69\n\n\nGPU\n6\n8 x V100\np3.16xlarge\n$24.48\n$0.27\n5\n$12.38\n\n\nCPU\n16\n64 vCPU\nr5a.16xlarge\n$4.608\n$0.27\n33\n$42.93\n\n\n\nSolution overview\nYou can use the following step-by-step walkthrough to run the example mortgage dataset using the open-source XGBoost library on EMR GPU clusters. For more examples, see the GitHub repo.\nImplementing this solution includes the following steps:\n\nCreate an EMR notebook and launch Amazon EMR with NVIDIA GPU nodes.\nRun the open-source XGBoost library and Apache Spark examples on the notebook.\nView the training and transform results and benchmark.\nLaunch example applications with the Apache Spark spark-submit\n\nCreating an EMR notebook and launching Amazon EMR with NVIDIA GPU nodes\nAn EMR notebook is a serverless Jupyter notebook. Unlike a traditional notebook, the contents of an EMR notebook\u2014the equations, visualizations, queries, models, code, and narrative text\u2014are saved in Amazon S3 separately from the cluster that runs the code. This provides an EMR notebook with durable storage, efficient access, and flexibility.\nTo create your notebook and launch Amazon EMR, complete the following steps.\n\nOn the Amazon EMR console, choose the Region you want to launch your cluster in (typically the same Region as your S3 bucket where you store large training datasets).\nChoose Notebooks.\nChoose Create notebook.\nCreate a new cluster with notebook instances by setting the GPU node.\n\nFor this use case, we add three EC2 g4dn.xlarge GPU nodes to the new cluster.\n\nIf you want to customize your cluster with advanced configuration, you can create a GPU cluster separately, then create an EMR notebook and connect to the existing GPU cluster. You can enter the following code in the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to launch a GPU cluster with two EC2 G4dn instances as core nodes in one command line:\n\naws emr create-cluster --termination-protected --applications Name=Hadoop Name=Spark Name=Livy --tags 'name=nvidia-gpu-spark' --ec2-attributes '{\"KeyName\":\"your-key-name\",\"InstanceProfile\":\"EMR_EC2_DefaultRole\",\"SubnetId\":\"your-subnet-ID\",\"EmrManagedSlaveSecurityGroup\":\"your-EMR-worker-security-group-ID\",\"EmrManagedMasterSecurityGroup\":\"your-EMR-leader-security-group-ID\"}' --release-label emr-5.30.0 --log-uri 's3n://your-s3-bucket/elasticmapreduce/' --instance-groups '[{\"InstanceCount\":2,\"InstanceGroupType\":\"CORE\",\"InstanceType\":\"g4dn.xlarge\",\"Name\":\"Core - 2\"},{\"InstanceCount\":1,\"EbsConfiguration\":{\"EbsBlockDeviceConfigs\":[{\"VolumeSpecification\":{\"SizeInGB\":32,\"VolumeType\":\"gp2\"},\"VolumesPerInstance\":2}]},\"InstanceGroupType\":\"MASTER\",\"InstanceType\":\"m5.xlarge\",\"Name\":\"Master - 1\"}]' --configurations '[{\"Classification\":\"spark-defaults\",\"Properties\":{\"spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled\":\"false\"}}]' --auto-scaling-role EMR_AutoScaling_DefaultRole --ebs-root-volume-size 10 --service-role EMR_DefaultRole --enable-debugging --name 'nvidia-gpu-spark' --scale-down-behavior TERMINATE_AT_TASK_COMPLETION --region us-east-1\n\nReplace the values for KeyName, SubnetId, EmrManagedSlaveSecurityGroup, EmrManagedMasterSecurityGroup, and S3 bucket with your logs, name, and Region.\nYou can also use the AWS Management Console to configure the EMR cluster. For instructions, see Get Started with XGBoost4J-Spark on AWS EMR on GitHub.\nRunning the XGBoost library and Apache Spark examples on your EMR notebook\nWhen the cluster is ready, go to the Amazon EMR notebooks, choose the notebook instance, and choose Open in Jupyter. Start the notebook instance if it\u2019s not running.\nDownload the example notebook EMR_Mortgage_Example_G4dn.ipynb from Rapids/spark-examples on GitHub and upload it to the EMR notebook instance. For more Scala example code, see the GitHub repo.\nEnter the mortgage example notebook to run the GPU-accelerated Apache Spark code on the open-source XGBoost library towards a small mortgage dataset on Amazon S3. If the notebook kernel isn\u2019t set to Apache Spark, choose Kernel, Change Kernel to set Apache Spark as the kernel. The EMR notebook is now talking to the EMR cluster running Apache Spark using Apache Livy. The following diagram illustrates this architecture.\n\nYou can customize your Apache Spark job configurations, such as number of executors, number of cores, and executor memory base on your GPU cluster. Each GPU maps to one executor.\nViewing the training and transform results and benchmark\nIn the EMR notebook, you can view the Apache Spark job progress and the benchmark results. You can save the trained model to a local folder or S3 bucket. The following screenshot shows our job progress.\n\nThe following code shows the benchmark results:\n\n------ Training ------\r\n==> Benchmark: Elapsed time for [train]: 37.881s\r\nmodel: ml.dmlc.xgboost4j.scala.spark.XGBoostClassificationModel = xgbc_d5a83fea59b5\r\n \r\n------ Transforming ------\r\n==> Benchmark: Elapsed time for [transform]: 0.115s\r\n\u2026\r\n------Accuracy of Evaluation------\r\nevaluator: org.apache.spark.ml.evaluation.MulticlassClassificationEvaluator = mcEval_daa2cccd95a4\r\naccuracy: Double = 0.9875007589803053\r\n0.9875007589803053\r\n\u2026\n\nLaunching example applications with the spark-submit script\nAlternatively, you can SSH into the EMR primary node and use the Apache Spark spark-submit script to launch the application directly on a cluster. Follow the walkthrough on the GitHub repo to use Apache Maven to create a jar containing the example code for the mortgage dataset and its dependencies, and launch the application using the Apache Spark spark-submit script CLI.\nCleaning up\nTo avoid ongoing charges for resources you created for this benchmarking, delete all the resources you created. This includes the data on the S3 bucket, EMR cluster, and EMR notebook.\nConclusion\nGet started on Amazon EMR today, or reach out to AWS for help if you want to migrate your big data and applications to AWS.

This definitely marks a major win for NVIDIA as DLSS 2.0 brings a lot more than just performance improvements but will also help deliver better image quality doing so.\nDeath Stranding PC Performance Preview With NVIDIA's GeForce RTX GPUs & DLSS 2.0 Technology, 60+ FPS With RTX 2060 & 100+ FPS With RTX 2080 Ti at 4K\nDeath Stranding will be the latest title to add support for DLSS 2.0 which is a premier technology featured on NVIDIA's GeForce RTX graphics cards. With DLSS 2.0, NVIDIA has made several strides by not only delivering higher performance with the graphical feature enabled but also delivering much higher image quality than what's rendered at normal.\nRelated Story NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nJust like every DLSS title, users will get the ability to set the DLSS settings to either performance or quality mode. This particular performance preview was measured with DLSS set to quality mode as even the entry-level RTX cards can deliver 60+ FPS at 4K resolution. The overall GPU performance numbers at 1080p, 1440p, 2160p are provided below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nAt 4K with DLSS on, you can see a marked improvement over DLSS off. For comparison, the RTX 2080 Ti sees a massive 40% improvement and delivers 105.5 FPS with all in-game settings maxed out which is super impressive. Even the GeForce RTX 2060 delivers a huge performance jump of up to 47% and delivers a smooth 60.1 FPS on average.\nFor users with higher refresh rate monitors, at 1440p, you can get up to 144 FPS at max settings with the RTX 2080 Ti & the RTX 2080 SUPER. The rest of the cards deliver over 100+ FPS which is going to make the game run like a breeze on any modern PC equipped with an RTX graphics card. At 1080p, you will see average FPS hovering above 140+ FPS with the RTX 2080 Ti hitting almost 200 FPS on average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nIn addition to performance improvements, NVIDIA has also shared several images showcasing how DLSS 2.0 helps to deliver higher quality in Death Stranding by smoothing out what would otherwise be jagged edges & simultaneously delivering higher level of details on various in-game assets.\n\u201cDEATH STRANDING\u00a0already has the reputation of being a visual stunner, but NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 helps make the PC debut something special. The extra performance NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 delivers in\u00a0DEATH STRANDING allows gamers to unlock the vast graphical potential of the PC platform by increasing the graphics settings and resolution, delivering on the vision we have for the game.\u201d - Akio Sakamoto, CTO KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS. via NVIDIA GeForce\nFor those wondering about the system requirements, the developer has already laid out its own recommended requirements to run the game at various tiers. For 1080p 30 FPS, the minimum you would require is a modern day Quad Core CPU from Intel or AMD along with a 4 GB graphics card that's around the Radeon RX 480 or the GeForce GTX 1050 Ti in terms of performance. 8 GB of ram is a requirement for all PCs and you would require at least 80 GB of storage space to install Death Stranding.\n\nRegardless, given the screenshots and the trailer that NVIDIA has shared, Death Stranding looks to be an absolutely phenomenal title in terms of its graphics quality. This makes the title even more impressive given the lowly system requirements that you need to make it run. It shows that Death Stranding is a well optimized titles but we will definitely reserve our conclusion till we have tested out the final product which launches on 14th of July.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Rolls Out GeForce Driver 572.60 To Fix Black Screen Issues Related To RTX 50 Series GPUs\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n160\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nWe've been seeing an onslaught of rumors surrounding the next-generation Nvidia Ampere GeForce graphics cards, and it's probably not going to stop any time soon. However, while most of these leaks have revolved around the RTX 3080, this time we may have caught a glimpse of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060.\u00a0This particular leak comes from known hardware leaker @kobite7kimi over on Twitter, where they posit that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 will be packed with the GA106-300 GPU. That's about as specific as this leak gets \u2013 we still haven't seen any gossip about how many CUDA cores or VRAM the RTX 3060 will have \u2013 but that doesn't mean the speculation stops there.\u00a0Maybe, RTX 3070 (Super or Ti?) , GA104-400RTX 3070, GA104-300RTX 3060, GA106-300.Actually, I don't know the codename is GA or A? lol~June 9, 2020We'll show you how to build a PCCheck out the best gaming PCsHere are the best processorsAs pointed out by the fine folks over at Wccftech, the '-300' part of the GPU name is the significant information here. Looking back at the Nvidia Turing lineup, there were 3 GPUs built off of the TU106 GPU found in the RTX 2060 \u2013 including the RTX 2070 and the RTX 2060 Super. Given that the RTX 2070 was the TU106-400 and the RTX 2060 was the TU106-200, the RTX 3060 may end up being a cut-down version of another graphics card \u2013 even though we have no idea what it will actually be.\u00a0At the end of the day, it's pretty safe to assume that we're going to be getting an RTX 3060 \u2013 or a 2160, or whatever Nvidia wants to call it, what even is reality anymore \u2013 all that remains to be seen is how powerful it will be, how much it will cost and when it'll launch.\u00a0And all of that information is currently up in the air. But with all the Nvidia that are circling around the internet right now, it's starting to look as if an actual reveal could be right around the corner \u2013 after all the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 and the rest of the Turing lineup was revealed in August 2018, and that two-year anniversary is right around the corner.\u00a0RTX for everyoneOne of the most frustrating parts of the Nvidia Turing lineup is the fact that if you don't have the cash for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 or above, you just can't get in on the ray tracing or DLSS action. That needs to change.\u00a0The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 suggested by these leaks will almost certainly not be at the bottom of the product stack, but it shouldn't be the bottom of the RTX stack, either.\u00a0Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Nvidia DLSS is downright magical for making sure that folks are able to get amazing gaming performance at higher resolutions, without having to compromise on visual quality. It simply makes sense to open that technology to the people that will need it the most \u2013 the budget segment.\u00a0The Wccftech article we mentioned above takes it for granted that the Nvidia Ampere lineup will implement RTX features across the product stack, but that has been in no way confirmed \u2013 none of the RTX 3000 rumors have been.\u00a0However, with AMD RDNA 2 hitting the market later this year, bringing with it hardware-accelerated ray tracing on Team Red's GPUs, Nvidia might not really have much of a choice.\u00a0Don't get us wrong, we'd absolutely love to see RTX open up to everyone, we just don't think it's safe to assume that those capabilities will be open to the entire product stack. We'll just have to wait and see what Nvidia does, and just how much competition it will get from AMD in the budget realm.\u00a0Here are the best gaming headsets\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill ThomasSocial Links NavigationBill Thomas (Twitter) is TechRadar's computing editor.

But nothing brings that experience down faster than the realization that a part may not fit or work with the PC builder's current configuration. That's the threat PC builders may face if they upgrade to upcoming Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, according to a new rumor. If the rumor proves accurate, some buyers may have to spend some extra money on top of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti's likely hefty price. \nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, as well as the entire line of GeForce RTX 30 cards using Nvidia's new Ampere architecture, are rumored to use a new 12-pin power interface. First reported by Chinese outlet FCPowerUp, the 12-pin connector for the 3080 and other cards would be used to meet the hardware's increased power demand compared to previous generations of cards.\u00a0FCPowerUp has since shared a technical design document seemingly confirming that Nvidia is at least considering using the 12-pin connector.\nRELATED:\u00a0NVIDIA GeForce 3080 Graphics Card Image Leaks\nBut the issue with the 12-pin power connector isn't the size of it, which could still be accommodated by PSUs and cabling that most PC builders already have, but due to the pin layout within the connector. TechRadar speculates that this new pin format could mean many PC builders will be forced to upgrade their PSUs alongside their new graphics cards.\u00a0The idea being that many PC gamers' PSUs do not currently support Nvidia's rumored 12-pin connector for its GeForce RTX 30 series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems logical that some type of modular cables or adapters could be used in order to support the new 12-pin format, but it's certainly possible that non-modular PSUs won't work if adapters aren't provided.\u00a0There's clearly a possibility that some PC builders could be put in a tough position, but more details about Nvidia's new cards need to be revealed before anything can be said with certainty.\nOn paper, Nvidia's decision is still understandable. With graphics cards increasingly requiring more and more power, a step forward is necessary. And judging by the technical specifications of the 12-pin connector, which would deliver as much as 600 Watts of power, it would absolutely be a somewhat future-proofed step forward.\nIt just begs the question as to whether this specific 12-pin connector is necessary. Or whether Nvidia may be choosing an unconventional connector for reasons beyond just power requirements. It's also worth considering whether other card manufacturers will support the 12-pin connector or if it'll be limited to Nvidia's Founders Editions. There are a lot of questions left to answer and PC builders hopefully won't be waiting long to find out the truth.\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and the 30 series of Ampere cards are expected later this year.\nMORE:\u00a0Nvidia RTX: Top 5 Games That Utilize RTX The Best (& 5 That Do Not)\nSource: FCPowerUp, TechRadar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming News\n\n\n\n\nPC Gaming\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHow to Change Characters in Assassin's Creed Shadows\n\t\t\n\n\nVideo Games\n\nPlayers will need to wait until the game's ninth chapter before they can switch freely between Yasuke and Naoe in Assassin's Creed Shadows.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nTom Bowen\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t'I Just Want The Right Circumstances' Evil Dead Star Bruce Campbell Reveals Conditions For Returning To The Franchise\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nAdemilade Shodipe-Dosunmu\n\n\n22 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSonic X Shadow Generations May Not Feature a Chao Garden, But It Scratches the Itch\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nZackari Greif\n\n\n1 hour ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHow GDC Main Stage: A Developer's Concert Went From Experiment to Annual Tradition\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nJosh Cotts\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe Fallout Series Has Built-In Potential For a Call of Duty-Like FPS\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nJ.

NVIDIA doesn't make them easy to find, but you can do it. Here's how to avoid GeForce Experience on Windows. \n                        It's Your Choice\n               \nWe're not bashing GeForce Experience here. It has some neat features like the ability to automatically optimize graphics settings for your PC games and record your gameplay. It also can automatically search for and install driver updates. You'll have to find and install updates manually if you skip the GeForce Experience application.\nBut GeForce Experience is also a heavier application that requires you sign in with an account. You even have to sign in with an account just to get driver updates. If you'd like to install your drivers the classic way---just the drivers themselves and the NVIDIA Control Panel tool---you can. \n                        How to Download NVIDIA's Drivers Without GeForce Experience\n               \nYou can download the drivers from NVIDIA's website. Either head to the newer\u00a0GeForce Drivers page and use the \"Manual Driver Search\" section or use the classic NVIDIA Driver Download page.\nWhichever page you use, you'll have to know the model of your graphics card, whether you're using a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows, and which type of driver you want. (Not sure which GPU you have or what type of Windows operating system you have? Scroll down for instructions on how to find out.)\nThe \"Game Ready Driver (GRD)\" features optimizations for the latest games and is intended for gamers, while the \"Studio Driver (SD)\" prioritizes stability and is intended for creative professionals\nUse the fields to select your drivers and click \"Search.\" When you're done, click the \"Download\" button to get the drivers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        How to Install the Drivers Without GeForce Experience\n               \nDownload the driver's EXE file and double-click it to install like any other application. Let the installer extract its files and begin installation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the installer extracts its files and starts, you'll be prompted to choose the kind of installation you want. By default, it will try to install the \"NVIDIA Graphics Driver and GeForce Experience\" software.\nBe sure to select \"NVIDIA Graphics Driver\" instead to avoid installing NVIDIA GeForce Experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        How to See Which NVIDIA GPU You Have\n               \nTo check which NVIDIA GPU you have on your Windows 10 PC, open the Task Manager. You can do so by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Esc or by right-clicking the taskbar and selecting \"Task Manager.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the \"Performance\" tab at the top of the Task Manager window. If necessary, click \"More Details\" at the bottom of the Task Manager to expand the Task Manager and view the tabs.\nSelect the \"GPU\" entry in the sidebar here. Look for the name of your GPU near the upper-right corner of the Task Manager window.\nIf you have multiple GPUs in your system, click each and examine their names. If you have a gaming laptop, there's a good chance you have both NVIDIA graphics and Intel graphics. Look for the name of the NVIDIA GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        How to See Whether You're Using 64-bit Windows\n               \nTo check whether you're using a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows, head to Settings > System > About. You can open the Settings window from the Start menu or by pressing Windows+i.\nLook for the \"Device specifications\" section on this screen. To the right of \"System type,\" you'll see whether you're using a \"64-bit operating system\" or a \"32-bit operating system.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Remember, You'll Have to Update Them Manually\n               \nYou're now responsible for updating your own NVIDIA drivers. They won't automatically check for updates or download and install new versions of your GPU drivers for you. That feature requires the NVIDIA GeForce Experience software. \n                        How to Uninstall GeForce Experience\n               \nBy the way, if you already have the NVIDIA GeForce Experience software installed, you can uninstall it while leaving your drivers installed.\nJust head to Control Panel > Uninstall a Program, search for \"nvidia,\" and uninstall the \"NVIDIA GeForce Experience\" application. Leave the other NVIDIA driver entries installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Or Just Use Windows Update\n               \nIf you don't play PC gamers, you can always just get your drivers via Windows Update. Don't install anything from NVIDIA and Windows will automatically install drivers for your GPU. However, the drivers won't be the most up-to-date for the latest PC games and you don't get utilities like the NVIDIA Control Panel.\nHaving the latest drivers is important for gamers, but the average PC user can get by with the drivers from Windows Update. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\n\n\nWindows 10\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

The classic Shield TV held its place as one of the best streaming devices for a few years \u2014 until Nvidia finally gave it an upgrade, and split the line into two devices: The Shield TV and the Shield TV Pro.\u00a0\nAt $149.99, the standard Shield TV is $50 cheaper than the Pro model, and it offers an all-new tube design. But is it actually worth buying? Or should you pay a bit extra for the more expensive model? I've been testing the Nvidia Shield TV to find out.\n\n\nDesign and setup\nThe current Shield TV Pro may offer the same rectangular shape as the original Shield TV model, but the cheaper version has been completely redesigned from the ground up. Gone is the black box look. Instead, what we get here is a tube-shaped device that Nvidia says is designed to be tucked behind a TV or in the corner of a shelf. It's not a bad look, and while it's a little strange trying to place a cylindrical device, most buyers will be able to find a decent spot to hide it.\nPart of what makes the Shield TV concealable at all is the fact that it's relatively small. The device measures in at 6.5 inches wide and 1.6 inches thick, which isn't that big at all. It's around the same size of a can of spray deodorant. Port-wise, the tube has an HDMI and MicroSD card slot on one side, and an Ethernet and power port on the other. That's pretty much everything you'll need, and the ability to expand the device's storage through the MicroSD card slot is a nice touch.\nThe remote has also been redesigned. Gone is the relatively flat look of the original Shield TV's remote, in favor of a prism shape. It's relatively thick compared to the previous generation remote, but it still feels fine in the hand. Unfortunately, also gone is the rechargeable battery, in favor of replaceable AAA batteries. That seems like a step backwards.\nThe controls on the remote are pretty basic, but that's not a bad thing as this makes the remote relatively easy to use. You get backlit playback controls, volume functions, Android software controls, and a big Netflix button on the bottom.\u00a0\nSetting up the Shield TV is fairly simple. You start by plugging it into a power port, and then into an HDMI input on your TV. Once the device switches on, you just need to log into your Google account and download the apps that you want to use.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                        Christian de Looper/Business Insider\n                        \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifications\n\nDimensions: 1.57 x 1.57 x 6.5 inches\nWeight: 4.83 oz\nStorage: 8GB\nCPU: Nvidia Tegra X1+ processor\nRAM: 2GB\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5.0, Gigabit Ethernet\nVideo resolution: up to 4K Ultra HD\nHDR: Dolby Vision and HDR10 support\nAudio: Dolby Atmos and DTS-X surround support\nVoice control: Google Assistant built-in, works with Amazon Alexa\n\nDay-to-day use\nIn day-to-day use, the Nvidia Shield TV is very easy to navigate. Android TV is generally a heavy operating system, and some TVs with Android built-in are often sluggish. Thankfully, the Shield TV is well-equipped to perform thanks to its Tegra X1+ processor and 2GB of RAM.\nThe end result is fast and responsive software with access to an extensive library of streaming apps and services, including Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, Peacock, and HBO Max. One of the only major apps that isn't currently available is Apple TV Plus.\u00a0\u00a0\nOf course, the device's impressive processing power has another purpose \u2014 it enables support for 4K resolution and High Dynamic Range (HDR) playback. In practice, this means that as long as your TV and the content you're watching support these standards, you'll get crisp video and more colorful content with higher contrast.\u00a0\nUnlike Roku's streaming devices, the Shield TV also supports the Dolby Vision HDR format. This standard can offer better HDR performance and scalability when paired with a Dolby Vision capable TV. Several streaming services support Dolby Vision content, including Netflix, Disney Plus, and Vudu.\u00a0\nThe Shield TV also supports upscaling, allowing HD content (720p and 1080p) to appear more detailed and sharp, without having to be in native 4K. Nvidia's process utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze the picture in real-time, resulting in higher quality upscaling than many TVs.\nAI-enhanced upscaling can be activated in the Settings menu. Once activated, you get three options for detail enhancement: low, medium, and high. I recommend turning AI-enhanced upscaling on and setting detail enhancement to high. It's important to note that the tech really only works on video at 30 frames per second or lower, so since some apps, like YouTube, often stream at more than 30 fps, there will be times when the tech won't be enabled.\u00a0\nBut, for HD movies and shows on Netflix or Prime Video, the feature works great. Series that aren't in 4K, like \"The Office,\" benefit nicely from Nvidia's AI upscaling process. Details are noticeably sharper, and content simply doesn't have the same pixelation that it otherwise would.\nBecause the Shield TV is based on Android TV, it ties neatly into Google's overall ecosystem. For example, it has Google Assistant built right into it, which can be used to find out information from the web, control smart home devices, and control content on your TV. It works pretty well, and it's fast on the Shield TV.\nUsing the voice remote is a good experience. While the previous generation remote looked better, its slimness meant that it could easily slip between couch cushions \u2014 and that's not a problem here. The added physical buttons for volume controls, and the backlit keys, are a nice touch as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                        Christian de Looper/Business Insider\n                        \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial features\nOne of the things that makes the Nvidia Shield TV unique among streaming players is that it supports game streaming through the GeForce Now streaming platform. Those really into game streaming should probably save up a little more and go for the slightly more expensive Shield TV Pro, considering it has extra RAM. That said, the standard device still supports game streaming if you buy a compatible controller or have one handy.\nGame streaming with GeForce Now actually works really well, but there are a few caveats. For starters, you really need to have a good internet connection to get a truly seamless experience, and to get the most out of the service, you'll still need to own or purchase games from platforms like Steam in order to play them.\u00a0\nLastly, GeForce Now only supports streaming at 1080p \u2014 so don't expect to get 4K gaming on your TV through the Shield. All that said, if you don't mind dealing with those issues, gaming on the Shield TV is a fun experience. It's worth checking if the games you're interested in are supported before you get too excited, but the selection is generally pretty good.\n\n\nProblems with the Shield TV\nPerhaps the main issue with the Shield TV is that it's relatively expensive, despite the fact that it's the cheaper of the two Shield TV devices. If you're in the market for an inexpensive streaming device, it may be worth looking at products from companies like Roku and Amazon, which offer a number of media sticks and boxes that are cheaper than the Shield TV.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                        Christian de Looper/Business Insider\n                        \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nThe bottom line\nIf you're looking for an Android TV-based streaming device, you can't do much better than the Shield TV series. The standard Shield TV offers many of the same features found on the Pro version, including 4K HDR playback, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support, AI upscaling, Google Assistant, and GeForce Now gaming capabilities. The Android TV platform works well and, while not for all tastes, the device's unique tube-shaped design makes it easy to store the player out of view.\u00a0\nWhich model should you get?\nThe Shield TV ($149.99) and Shield TV Pro ($199.99) both offer similar specifications and features. With that said, the more expensive Shield TV Pro does step things up with two USB Ports, 3GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, support for high-resolution audio upsampling, and Plex Media Server capabilities. The Pro model also uses a more traditional rectangular design.\nIf you're interested in gaming and media server functions, it could be worth paying the extra $50 for the Pro model. When it comes to general streaming playback, however, the regular Shield TV is just as capable and costs less money.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWhat are your alternatives?\nThough the Shield TV's powerful processing is impressive, if you want a smart streaming device on a budget, then it's worth looking at Roku's lineup instead. The Roku Ultra offers reliable 4K HDR streaming, Dolby Atmos capabilities, and a voice remote for a retail price of $99.99. With that said, Roku's player doesn't feature Dolby Vision, built-in Google Assistant, or GeForce Now gaming.\nIt should also be noted, that while strong performers in their own right, Roku and Amazon media players are currently missing support for a few key streaming services, including HBO Max and Peacock.\nIf you want a powerful streaming device with those apps, along with Android TV, easy integration with Google's ecosystem, Dolby Vision HDR, AI-upscaling, and advanced gaming capabilities, then the Shield TV is a better option.\nPros: Powerful performance, great upscaling and video support, HDR10 and Dolby Vision capabilities, gaming options\nCons: Expensive, design takes some getting used to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nChristian de Looper\n\nFreelance Writer\n\n\n\n\nChristian de Looper is a freelance technology reporter who covers smartphones, smart home, computers, wearables, and other gadgets for Business Insider.

An unknown GPU from Nvidia, believed to be the GeForce RTX 3080, scored an impressive 18,257 in\u00a03D Mark Time Spy tests. That\u2019s an impressive 30.98% leap over the RTX 2080 Ti, which is currently Nvidia\u2019s most powerful mainstream gaming graphics card.Nvidia's decision to switch to Samsung's 8nm process could also explain some of the more unusual rumors about Ampere's excessive power draw. A recent GeForce RTX 3080 Ti leak suggested the GPU would have a TDP of 320W, for example, which could be due to the fact that Nvidia will have to increase power consumption due to the use of less-efficient parts.\u00a0Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The same leak revealed that the flagship Ampere GPU, which is expected to be shown off within the next couple of months,will feature 5376 CUDA cores running at up to 2.2GHz, an improvement over current Turing GPUs that top out at toughly 2.1GHz.\u00a0Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 rumored specs spilled, alongside 3070 Ti with faster GDDR6X memory\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nCarly PageSocial Links NavigationCarly Page is a Freelance journalist, copywriter and editor specialising in Consumer/B2B technology.

It captured two prizes against a crowded field, and inspired them to continue using AI to help others.\nThe app\u2019s AI model uses the NVIDIA Jetson Nano developer kit to detect a user doing the tree pose, a position known to increase shoulder muscle strength and improve balance. The Jetson Nano performs image classification so the model can tell whether the pose is being done correctly based on 100+ images it was trained on, which the team took of themselves. Then, it provides feedback to the user, letting them know if they should adjust their form.\n\n\u201cIt can be taxing for patients to go to the physical therapist often, both financially and physically,\u201d said Howk.\nContinuing exercises at home is a crucial part of recovery for physical therapy patients, but doing them incorrectly can actually hinder progress, she explained.\nBringing the Idea to Life\nIn the months leading up to the hackathon, Howk, a rising senior at the University of Alabama, was interning in Los Angeles, where a yoga studio is virtually on every corner. She\u2019d arrived at the competition with the idea to create some kind of yoga app, but it wasn\u2019t until the team came across the NVIDIA table at the hackathon\u2019s sponsor fair that they realized the idea\u2019s potential to expand and help those in need.\n\u201cA demo of the Jetson Nano displayed how the system can track bodily movement down to the joint,\u201d said Marti, a rising sophomore at UC Davis. \u201cThat\u2019s what sparked the possibility of making a physical therapy app, rather than limiting it to yoga.\u201d\nNone of the team members had prior experience working with deep learning and computer vision, so they faced the challenge of learning how to implement the model in such a short period of time.\n\u201cThe NVIDIA mentors were really helpful,\u201d said Champaneri, a rising senior at UC Davis. \u201cThey put together a tutorial guide on how to use the Nano that gave us the right footing and outline to follow and implement the idea.\u201d\nOver the first night of the hackathon, the team took NVIDIA\u2019s Deep Learning Institute course on getting started with AI on the Jetson Nano. They\u2019d grasped the basics of deep learning. The next morning, they began hacking and training the model with images of themselves displaying correct versus incorrect exercise poses.\nIn just 36 hours since the idea first emerged, PocketPT was born.\nWinning More Than Just Awards\nThe most exciting part of the weekend was finding out the team had made it to final pitches, according to Howk. They presented their project in front of a crowd of 500 and later found out that it had won the two prizes.\nThe hackathon attracted 197 projects. Competing against 65 other projects in the Medical Access category \u2014 many of which used cloud or other platforms \u2014 their project took home the category\u2019s grand prize. It was also chosen as the \u201cBest Use of Jetson Hack,\u201d among 11 other groups that borrowed a Jetson for their projects.\nBut the quartet is looking to do more with their app than win awards.\nBecause of the fast-paced nature of the hackathon, PocketPT was only able to fully implement one pose, with others still in the works. However, the team is committed to expanding the product and promoting their overall mission of making physical therapy easily accessible to all.\nWhile the hackathon took place just before the COVID outbreak in the U.S., the team highlighted how their project seems to be all the more relevant now.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t even realize we were developing something that would become the future, which is telemedicine,\u201d said de Souza, a rising senior at Northwestern University. \u201cWe were creating an at-home version of PT, which is very much needed right now. It\u2019s definitely worth our time to continue working on this project.\u201d\nRead about other Jetson projects on the Jetson community projects page and get acquainted with other developers on the Jetson forum page.\nLearn how to get started on a Jetson project of your own on the Jetson developers page.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Deep Learning Institute | Jetson | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It was announced about a year ago, but it's starting to show up in more and more high-profile laptops, like Samsung's 15-inch Notebook 9, Huawei's MateBook X Pro, and the ASUS ZenBook. The MX150 also promises considerably increased performance over integrated processor (CPU) graphics, but what can it actually be used for? Let's take a look.See our laptop buyer's guideWhat does the NVIDIA MX150 replace?NVIDIA GeForce MX150 The NVIDIA GeForce MX150 with 2GB of GDDR5 VRAM is primarily intended to replace the GeForce 940MX, which can still be commonly found in many laptops. In general, the new discrete GPU is about 25 percent more powerful than the older model. The MX150's Pascal architecture allows (in many cases) for a lower or similar thermal design point (TDP) without sacrificing any of the 384 CUDA cores, and it also has support for newer APIs.This is essentially the mobile version of NVIDIA's GT 1030 desktop GPU, an enticing low-cost product intended to add a bit of graphics acceleration to your home PC.Is the NVIDIA MX150 meant for gaming?Is the NVIDIA MX150 meant for gaming? Make no mistake, the MX150 is not intended as a high-end gaming chip, though it can certainly provide an enjoyable experience. A lot of well-optimized, popular games should be more than playable (as long as the rest of your hardware can keep up) at 1080p, but don't expect to hit 144 frames-per-second (FPS) in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds with ultra settings. For an idea of how well an MX150 performs with some of the most popular games today, check out this video from YouTube user yasin erkan:In most cases, 30FPS can be averaged as long as you don't mind tweaking in-game settings to sacrifice a bit of detail. For a low-cost option, I'd say this is certainly acceptable performance.NVIDIA didn't just market the MX150 for play; you're going to get the same performance boost for video and photo editing apps, making it a suitable piece of hardware for anyone who often needs to make some quick edits when they're on the go.

Benchmark testing reveals the promised performance boost over the 940MX. With the 15-inch HP Spectre x360 using a 940MX, a Geekbench CUDA test brought back a score of 28,868. In comparison, the new Samsung Notebook 9 with MX150 brought back a score of 48,536.Testing with Geekbench OpenCL, the 940MX in Lenovo's IdeaPad 320S got a score of 30,539, while the MX150 in Acer's Aspire 5 got a score of 45,812.While it's certainly a step up against the previous mobile GPU, the MX150 begins to pale even against the full-sized but low-end GTX 1050. You can expect a Geekbench CUDA score somewhere around 80,000 for a GTX 1050, which is almost double the score of the MX150.Buying an NVIDIA MX150NVIDIA GeForce MX150 Unfortunately, not all MX150 GPUs are the same, and NVIDIA hasn't really been clear on a designation. Reported by Notebookcheck, MX150s come in 25W and 10W variants, each with a considerable difference in performance.To save room, some slim Ultrabooks are receiving the 10W chip that has \"1D12\" in the device ID. This chip has, in some cases, up to 25 percent less performance than the standard 25W chip, which has \"1D10\" in the device ID.MateBook X Pro using the 10W MX150 Our own testing of the Huawei MateBook X Pro (using the 10W chip) and the Samsung Notebook 9 (using the 25W chip) shows a big difference in performance. The former received a Geekbench CUDA score of 41,593 compared to the latter's score of 48,536.The bottom line here is that if you're in the market for a laptop with an MX150 inside and want the best performance possible, do some research to ensure you're getting the 25W version.As for comparing notebooks with full-sized GPUs, it really comes down to price. If you can find a laptop with a GTX 1050 inside for a similar price as one with an MX150, know that you'll be getting considerably more performance from the former device. The performance gap with 10-series GPUs only increases from there.If you're an AMD fan, you can likely find a laptop with a comparable Radeon RX 540 for a bit cheaper depending on the CPU and other hardware inside. The RX 540 is a real performer in the right circumstances, though it's commonly paired with an ancient CPU that can't stand up to an MX150 and eighth-gen Intel Core CPU combo. Best thing to do is read plenty of reviews before making a final decision.More resourcesCheck out these other links for more information about GPUs!The ultimate GPU buyer's guideEverything you need to know about the GPUHow to upgrade your PC's graphics cardBest GPUs for crypto miningBest graphics card for gaming in 2018How to track GPU performance data on Windows 10\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nCPU GPU Components\nHardware\nComputers Desktops\n\n\nCale HuntSocial Links NavigationContributorCale Hunt brings to Windows Central more than eight years of experience writing about laptops, PCs, accessories, games, and beyond.

It looks like NVIDIA isn't the only one who's going all steam ahead with its next-gen Ampere GPUs but its AIB partners are also following suit and readying their own custom designs for next-gen GeForce RTX 30 series cards.\nRelated Story NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDPOne such card, the ASUS ROG STRIX GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, has leaked out. It is reported that the custom design was showcased during an internal ASUS presentation where the graphics card was presented. The title of the picture reads next-gen ROG Strix which means that this might be our first look at the upcoming cooler for ASUS's flagship cards.\n\nWhat's interesting about this picture is the fact that it actually lists the RTX 3080 Ti branding & not RTX 3090 as many rumors have been saying over the past few weeks. As for the design of the card, the ASUS ROG STRIX GeForce RTX 3080 Ti looks rather impressive with a more aggressive look that comes with three axial-tech based fans and a massive heatsink underneath the shroud.\nThe front of the custom card has a dual-tone design with frames that seem to be made out of aluminum extending out & giving the card a more premium feel which looks similar to ASUS's Poseidon series offerings. The heatsink underneath is made up of a large aluminum fin stack that makes use of at least 6 heat pipes. The card seems to fall in the 2.5 slot tier and has extra width to it for the extended PCB to make way for all the custom electrical components that the board will feature.\nASUS may also be investing in some cool features such as an OLED display and we can see the addition of a large LED panel on the side of the card. There are no additional details such as the specifications or the launch date of the card but we are hoping to learn them soon enough if the cards are already getting custom designs built around them this early.\n\nAside from that, there are already some interesting takeaways to consider from this leak if it is indeed true. First of all, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti wasn't part of any of the rumors that we have been hearing for a while now. The majority of the rumors have talked about three graphics cards that would form up the top section of the Ampere consumer lineup, these include the GeForce RTX 3080, the GeForce RTX 3090, and a new RTX Titan graphics card.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere Gaming GPU' Rumored Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameGPUCores (SMs)MemoryMemory BusBandwidth\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Titan RTX (2nd Gen)Ampere GA102-4005376 (84)24 GB GDDR6X384-bit~816 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA Titan RTX (1st Gen)Turing TU102-4004608 (72)24 GB GDDR6384-bit672 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti / NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090Ampere GA102-3005248 (82)12 GB GDDR6X384-bit~1.00 TB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 TiTuring TU102-3004352 (68)11 GB GDDR6352-bit616 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080Ampere GA102-2004352 (68)10 GB GDDR6X320-bit~760 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Turing TU104-4002944 (46)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiAmpere GA104-4003072 (48)8 GB GDDR6X256-bit~512 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPERTuring TU104-4102560 (40)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ampere GA104-3002944 (46)8 GB GDDR6256-bit~512 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070Turing TU106-4002304 (36)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiAmpere GA106-400TBDTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPERTuring TU106-4102176 (34)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ampere GA106-300TBDTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Turing TU106-2001920 (30)6 GB GDDR6192-bit336 GB/s\n\n\n\n\nWe did raise the possibility of the RTX 3090 graphics card being an internal naming scheme for the RTX 3080 Ti which is why we've been hearing those rumors for a while now with no mention of the Ti card. The RTX 3080 non-Ti has been pictured in several leaks which showed us its entire shroud and what lies underneath it too.\nWe also got to hear some alleged specifications for the card which mention that the RTX 3080 Ti tier product would end up using the GA102 GPU core with 5248 CUDA cores and feature up to 12 GB of GDDR6/X memory. That's also up for debate until we get to see more conclusive leaks but for now, enjoy your first look at the custom Ampere graphics card that will be launching in the coming months.\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA GeForce 'Ampere' GPU are you waiting for the most?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Rolls Out GeForce Driver 572.60 To Fix Black Screen Issues Related To RTX 50 Series GPUs\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n160\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The upcoming holiday season will see the release of both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, which will have beefier specs that will make them twice as powerful as their current-generation counterparts. \nOn the other hand, the PC graphics card market is also seeing a growing hype on the battle between Nvidia's upcoming GeForce RTX 30 series and AMD's Navi 2X series. Recently, Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3080 Ti\u00a0was bombarded with several\u00a0leaks and speculation given that there has been little official information regarding\u00a0it. Now, for those interested to know what the unofficial information has to say, here is everything we know so far about the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti.\nRELATED: Leaked Nvidia GeForce RTX 3800 Ti Design Has PC Enthusiasts Worried \n                        Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Release Date\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf rumors about the upcoming Nvidia flagship cards are to be believed, then it appears that gamers won't have to wait for too long to see the official unveiling of the GeForce RTX 30 series. In a leak from the Chinese site ITHome, it has been claimed that the highly-anticipated GeForce RTX 3080 and the more powerful RTX 3080 Ti will both be released on September 17, 2020. Of course, the release date stated in this leak is slightly later than what Overclocking.com said, which is that both cards will be made available in August.\nHowever, it wouldn't be unlikely for Nvidia to hold a limited launch in August, with a full launch in September. But, looking at Nvidia's history in releasing its flagship GPUs, it appears that the September release date is more in line with the company's pattern of launching new products. It is worth remembering that the current generation RTX 2080 was announced during Gamescom 2018, which took\u00a0place at the end of August 2018. Of course, given that no official release date has been announced, there is no way of knowing whether these leaks would prove to be true, especially given the impact of the ongoing pandemic. \n                        Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Price\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that\u00a0Nvidia's\u00a0upcoming GeForce RTX 30 series will be the top of this line GPUs\u00a0of the company, it is expected that both the RTX 3080 and the more powerful RTX 3080 Ti will be on the more expensive end of the spectrum. Again, Nvidia still hasn't released any details regarding these GPUs but for reference, the current generation RTX 2080 Super is priced at $699, while RTX 2080 Ti retails for $1,199. Although it is still a mystery whether the new line will be priced similarly,\u00a0it wouldn't be unlikely for the upcoming RTX 30 line to be slightly more expensive than that.\nIt is worth noting that, looking at Nvidia's history, there was a huge price jump when the company transitioned\u00a0to the Turing cards, which were more expensive than the Pascal cards that it replaced. It is likely that this could also be the case this time around. However,\u00a0there have been rumors that Nvidia may be moving manufacturing from TSMC to Samsung. If true, then this could give Nvidia access to Samsung's 7nm extreme ultraviolet, which could reduce production costs. Of course, there is no official confirmation from Nvidia that this is true, so players shouldn't get their hopes up for now. \n                        Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Specs\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on reports from unofficial sources, it appears that Nvidia's RTX 30 series will likely\u00a0facilitate\u00a0the company's return to leading the industry in terms of performance. For comparison, the RTX 3080 is believed to be capable of 21 teraflops of performance, which is nine times more powerful than the Xbox Series X. On the other hand,\u00a0a leak that is believed to have been obtained from the RTX 3080 Ti claims that it will be 30-40% more powerful than the RTX 2080 Ti,\u00a0allowing the new card to render games in 4K at 60fps with relative ease.\nIt is also believed that the RTX 3080 will ship with 10GB of VRAM, while the RTX 3080 Ti will come with 12GB of memory. Comparing the RTX 3080 Ti with its competitors also showed that Nvidia may be ahead than its chief competitor, AMD. In a leaked benchmark, AMD's Big Navi GPU, which houses the company's RDNA 2 architecture, only performed 10-15% better than Nvidia's RTX 2080 Ti. If true, then the RTX 3080 Ti performed about 20-25% better than AMD's Big Navi when tested against Nvidia's current GPU.\nIn the end, there is still not much known about Nvidia's upcoming\u00a0RTX 30 line. However, given that the hype for this new line of cards\u00a0only keeps growing, it is likely that Nvidia will make some sort of announcement soon. Of course, if any of the leaks and speculation are to be believed, then it appears that Nvidia is packing some pretty high-end technology for its new line, which could give its competitor AMD a run for its money.\nMORE: Nvidia GeForce 3080 Ti Might Be Smaller Than PC Gamers Expect \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGR Originals\n\n\n\n\nPC Gaming\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tStar Trek Fleet Command Codes (March 2025)\n\t\t\n\n\nPC Gaming\n\nIn this article, you'll find all the latest codes for Star Trek Fleet Command, including instructions on how to use them to receive awesome freebies.\n\n\nPosts\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nArtur Novichenko\n\n\nMar 7, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDiscord Could Start Showing Up In-Game\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nSarah Fields\n\n\n20 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t'A Shadow Drop is Possible' Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake Release Plans Leaked\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nDalton Cooper\n\n\n4 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAssassin's Creed Shadows Isn't the Only Reason March 20 is an Important Day for Video Games\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nLauren Beeler-Beistad\n\n\n4 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhy The Rumored Oblivion Remake Would Be Perfect for a Shadow Drop Release\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nShayna Josi\n\n\n5 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tInterview: inZOI Director Talks Inspiration, Design, and Unique Features\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nJosh Cotts\n\n\n2 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNintendo Switch Game Pulled from Sale\n\t\t\n\n\nSwitch\n\nA popular game gets pulled from sale on the Nintendo eShop mere days after its release, with its publisher giving the reason for suspension.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHow to Get A Ranged Weapon for Yasuke in Assassin's Creed Shadows\n\t\t\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows\n\nDiscover how to quickly find a ranged weapon for Yasuke in Assassin's Creed Shadows. \n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 hour ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tEA Sports College Football 25 Is Down to Just $10, Grab It While You Can\n\t\t\n\n\nGame Deals\n\nOne of the best-selling sports games of all time is down to a super-low price. \n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMagic: The Gathering Tarkir Dragonstorm Preview: The Perfect Return to a Beloved Plane\n\t\t\n\n\nVideo Games\n\nMagic: The Gathering will soon release Tarkir: Dragonstorm, of which Game Rant previews new cards, mechanics, foil types, and more.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10:18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAssassin's Creed Shadows: All Corrupt Daikon Locations\n\t\t\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows\n\nA complete guide to locating all six Corrupt Daikon and completing Kuma's side quest in Assassin's Creed Shadows. \n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tExperience 4K Streaming Goodness With This 75-inch Toshiba TV Now Down By $200 For A Limited Time\n\t\t\n\nEnjoy 4K content on the 75-inch Toshiba C350 TV now that it's discounted!\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMinecraft Has A Golden Opportunity To Get In On The Joke\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRainbow Six Siege X Hands-On Preview: Ushering in a New Era\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSim Shows Up to Funeral Dressed Like Pro Wrestler\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Our Team\nOur Audience\nAbout Us\nPress & Events\nContact Us\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising\nCareers\nTerms\nPrivacy\nPolicies\n\n\nGame Rant is part of the\n                            Valnet Publishing Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Copyright \u00a9 2025 Valnet Inc.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA is bringing ray tracing to older GeForce GTX GPUs\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA has partnered with Unity and Unreal to integrate ray tracing into both game engines, and the chip vendor is also bringing the tech to older GPUs. NVIDIA will roll out a driver update next month that will bring ray tracing to its GeForce GTX cards, with everything from the GTX 1060 and above slated to receive the update that enables DXR on these cards.As DXR is a series of APIs, it doesn't matter what hardware it runs on. NVIDIA mentioned that it always knew there was a possibility for ray tracing to be on older hardware, with the vendor stating that the first demo was performed on a Titan Z. That said, the RT cores offer 2x to 3x better performance in terms of image quality, but the tech itself works on Pascal-based GTX cards as well.NVIDIA is essentially taking a two-pronged approach here \u2014 it is teaming up with leading game engines to make it easier for devs to build games with real-time ray tracing, and it is also making the technology itself available on more cards. RTX sales have been slow, so by bringing DXR to Pascal cards, NVIDIA is exponentially increasing the install base that can leverage ray tracing.That said, the image quality on GTX cards won't be quite as realistic as the RTX GPUs as they lack the dedicated RT cores. NVIDIA mentions that the image quality will be based on the effect that is used \u2014 and how that is optimised \u2014 within a particular game. Global illumination, for instance, would not work so well as it needs dedicated RT cores.For games like Battlefield V that use a lot of reflections, NVIDIA says you should be able to bring down the ray count by reducing the number of surfaces that are reflecting \u2014 which means you should get playable framerates with a GTX card. Devs will be able to scale the level of ray tracing tech so that the older GTX cards will still be able to play the games, with the RTX cards offering the best image quality with more fidelity and better effects.Here's the full list of GPUs that will be getting the update:GTX 1060 6GBGTX 1070GTX 1070 TiGTX 1080GTX 1080 TiTitan XTitan XPGTX 1660GTX 1660 TiNVIDIA mentions that the driver will start rolling out in April, and it should be a pretty sizeable update considering what's on offer.

(Image Credits: Reddit u/dertpert88)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card based on the Ampere Gaming GPU has allegedly been benchmarked within the 3DMark Time Spy Extreme benchmark. The graphics card will be one of the several high-end Ampere graphics cards which will be introduced in the coming months with huge boosts in graphics performance over their Turing based predecessors.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ampere Gaming Graphics Card Allegedly 35% Faster Than GeForce RTX 2080 Ti in 3DMark Time Spy Benchmark\nThe latest performance details come from Kopite7kimi who also posted rumored performance numbers of the GeForce RTX 3090 / RTX 3080 Ti graphics card yesterday. Today, the same leaker has reported the performance of the GeForce RTX 3080 in the 3DMark Time Spy benchmark and the numbers look insane when compared to the RTX 2080 Ti.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSAs per the rumor, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 features a Time Spy Extreme graphics score that is almost 8600 points. The same leaker also pointed to almost 10,000 points for the RTX 3090 / 3080 Ti in the same benchmark. This would suggest that the performance gap between the flagship part and the RTX 3080 would only be around 16% whereas the difference between the RTX 2080 and Ti was around 25% in the Time Spy benchmark but in games, the difference was just 20%.\n\nTSE: almost 8600\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) July 31, 2020\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 'Ampere' Rumored Time Spy Extreme Benchmarks\n\nGraphics Score\n\n\n020004000600080001000012000\n\n\n\n\n\n020004000600080001000012000\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090/RTX 3080 Ti\n\n10k\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\n8.6k\n\n\nMSI GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Lightning Z (OC)\n\n7.7k\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Founders Edition\n\n6.4k\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER\n\n5.5k\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080\n\n5k\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen compared to the Turing cards, the GeForce RTX 3080 looks to be around 35% faster than a stock GeForce RTX 2080 Ti which would make it the biggest performance jump over the previous generation Ti offering. We also compared the score to my heavily overclocked RTX 2080 Ti graphics card (Lightning Z) and found the difference to end up around 12%.\n\nConsidering that most Geforce RTX 2080 Ti's feature unlocked boost clocks, the actual difference between the RTX 3080 and RTX 2080 Ti could be around 20-25% which is more in line with the previous statement from the same leaker who reported the performance jump of the RTX 3080 over the RTX 2080 Ti being around 20 percent.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ampere Gaming Graphics Card Alleged Specifications\nMoving on to the specs for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080, the rumors report that the card will be featuring the GA102-200-KD-A1 SKU. This cut down SKU will feature the same 4352 CUDA cores as the RTX 2080 Ti that will be arranged in a total of 68 SMs.\n\ncodename: GA102-200-KD-A1\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) July 31, 2020\n\nThe card is reportedly going to feature 10 GB of memory that is also going to be GDDR6X, running at 19 Gbps across a 320-bit bus interface with a bandwidth of 760 GB/s. Do note that there has been no indication of a faster spec'd GDDR6 at this point in time, unlike the previous generation where the GDDR6 memory was designed and announced way ahead of the Turing graphics lineup launch.\nA fan-made render of the upcoming GeForce RTX 30 series 'Ampere' graphics cards. (Image Credits: dertpert88 via Reddit)\nThe switch to GA102 from TU104 on the RTX 2080 is definitely an interesting one. A high-end SKU would also result in higher wattage and thermals but I believe this could be done to raise the bar up on the sub $500 segment which should comprise of GA104 based RTX 3070 tier graphics cards.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere Gaming GPU' Rumored Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameGPUCores (SMs)MemoryMemory BusBandwidth\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Titan RTX (2nd Gen)Ampere GA102-4005376 (84)24 GB GDDR6X384-bit~816 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA Titan RTX (1st Gen)Turing TU102-4004608 (72)24 GB GDDR6384-bit672 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti / NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090Ampere GA102-3005248 (82)12 GB GDDR6X384-bit~1.00 TB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 TiTuring TU102-3004352 (68)11 GB GDDR6352-bit616 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080Ampere GA102-2004352 (68)10 GB GDDR6X320-bit~760 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Turing TU104-4002944 (46)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiAmpere GA104-4003072 (48)8 GB GDDR6X256-bit~512 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPERTuring TU104-4102560 (40)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ampere GA104-3002944 (46)8 GB GDDR6256-bit~512 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070Turing TU106-4002304 (36)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiAmpere GA106-400TBDTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPERTuring TU106-4102176 (34)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ampere GA106-300TBDTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Turing TU106-2001920 (30)6 GB GDDR6192-bit336 GB/s\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of design, we have already seen leaked pictures of the cooler and heatsink for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card. It features a massive heatsink block with a dual axial-fan design & rumors have also pointed out to a new 12-pin power connector on the reference models which we talked about earlier.\nRecent reports have\u00a0suggested that NVIDIA has halted the production of its higher-end GeForce RTX GPU lineup to prepare for the Ampere GeForce RTX launch.

In its most basic form, you have laptops coming out like the Razer Blade 15 Studio Edition which can have some whopping specs like RTX Quadro GPUs. But it's partnered by the Studio drivers, which are built to offer the best performance and optimization in a wide range of applications.Those like Adobe Premiere Pro, Blender, Autodesk Arnold, and a host of other applications, are all working in partnership with NVIDIA to get the most out of your system through the Studio program. Just in the same way, the GeForce gaming drivers are there to ensure the best optimization for the best graphics cards in all the latest games.But, you don't need a fancy new laptop nor a $2,000 workstation GPU to take advantage of these options. What you already have in your PC might well be supported hardware, and you can flip the switch and get the Studio drivers whenever you want, or the reverse and put GeForce gaming drivers on your Studio-equipped Quadro. Here's how.Which GPUs are supported by NVIDIA StudioSource: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)You might think it only applies to the newest, most expensive GPUs or those super-fancy Quadro cards, but you'd be wrong.From NVIDIA:\"NVIDIA Studio Drivers are compatible with GeForce GTX 10-series, GeForce RTX 20-series, TITAN V, TITAN RTX, and all Quadro products released since 2012.\"So, eight-year-old Quadro workstation GPUs are supported, as are more budget-oriented gaming cards like the GTX 1060, right up to the likes of the RTX 2080 Ti, Titans, and the new RTX Quadro series.Assuming your GPU fits the above criteria, it's pretty straight forward to switch between the Studio and gaming drivers.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.How to switch between NVIDIA Studio and gaming driversThe easiest thing to do is make sure you have NVIDIA GeForce Experience installed on your PC. Make sure you're logged in, open it up, and follow these steps. This run-through assumes you're installing Studio drivers in place of your existing gaming drivers.Click on the drivers tab.Source: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)Click on the three dots to the right of the check for updates button.Source: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)Select Studio Driver.Click the green download button.Source: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)Choose express installation (unless you know what you're doing with a custom installation) and let the software run its course.When it's done, you'll now have NVIDIA's Studio drivers installed on your previously gaming-tailored GPU. If you're using a Studio system already and want to put the GeForce gaming drivers on your system, or you want to revert back, simply follow the steps above but select Game Ready Driver instead.That's all there is to it. If you'd rather not use GeForce Experience, you can get the drivers directly from NVIDIA's support page but you'll have to go here every time you want to switch and go through the process. GeForce Experience is a handy way to keep tabs on drivers, whichever you choose, and making sure you've got the latest release.\n\n\n\nGaming or creating\nGigabyte RTX 2060 Super\n\n\n$400 at Amazon\nGo Studio on your gaming graphics cardYou don't need a fancy Quadro to get the benefits from NVIDIA's Studio program; your regular gaming graphics card can get the drivers and get you on the right track.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nNvidia\nHardware\nComputers Desktops\n\n\nRichard DevineSocial Links NavigationManaging Editor - Tech, ReviewsRichard Devine is a Managing Editor at Windows Central with over a decade of experience.

And Moore\u2019s Law is Dead said the source of such a claim comes from \u201csomebody who\u2019s been right before several times,\" but one should still take it with a grain of salt.\u00a0The\u00a0best gaming PCs\u00a0you can buy nowMicrosoft Edge just got a killer feature to beat Chrome \u2014 try it nowJust in: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 may require this big PC upgradeThe Big Navi graphics card, according to the leaked information, will also come with two clusters of compute units measuring in at 36CUs each. A total of 72CUs translates to 4,608 stream processors, which when combined with a 384-bit bus, GDDR6 video memory, and a maximum clock speed of 2,510MHz, could see Big Navi trounce the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti.\u00a0For reference, the RTX 2080 Ti comes with 4,352 CUDA cores, a 352-bit bus, uses GDDR6, and runs up to 1,545MHz. It\u2019s a mighty graphics card but it would appear Big Navi could have it on the ropes.\u00a0\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nWatch On \nAMD Big Navi vs Nvidia RTX 3080The GeForce RTX 3080, thought to be the next high-end graphics card from Nvidia, is set to deliver up to 30 percent more performance than the RTX 2080 Ti Founder's Edition. So if Big Navi could be up to 50 percent faster than the RTX 2080, there\u2019s a chance it could snap at the heels of the RTX 3080. \u00a0Big Navi will use AMD\u2019s next-generation RDNA 2 graphics architecture, which promises a boost over the already capable RDNA core architecture found in the Radeon RX 5700 XT. The GeForce RTX 3080 will use Nvidia\u2019s new Ampere graphics architecture, which promises boosted performance and improved ray-tracing capabilities.\u00a0So both upcoming GPUs, slated for a release around September time, will have new graphics foundations to tap into. And that\u2019ll likely be what determines which comes out on top, as specs are one thing but how they\u2019re brought to bear in games and rendering tasks is another.\u00a0Sign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.AMD has gone some way to improving the efficiency and performance of its graphics cards, having moved from its Graphics Core Next architecture to RDNA. Clearly it\u2019s impressed the likes of Sony and Microsoft, who\u2019ve both opted for an RDNA 2-based GPU in their respective PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles.\u00a0GCN-based Radeon graphics cards tend to get beaten by equivalent Nvidia GPUs. But the newer RDNA Radeon models can hold their own against all but Nvidia\u2019s most-powerful graphic cards, albeit without offering ray-tracing hardware.\u00a0But Big Navi could change all that. If it launches ahead of the next-generation Ampere GeForce cards it could steal a lot of Nvidia\u2019s thunder. Even if it doesn\u2019t, AMD will have a high-end graphics card to bring to the GPU arena.\u00a0And that means more competition, which means better graphics cards at more competitive prices for PC gaming enthusiasts. While the next-generation consoles will dominate discourse around gaming in the second half of the year, PC gamers still have a lot to look forward to as the fall creeps closer. \u00a0Today's best Monitor deals - stock checked every 30 minutes: $9.99 $5.99ViewIBM Genuine Lenovo Thinkcentre M70e...IBM Genuine Lenovo Thinkcentre M70e Internal Computer Speaker 8Ohm 1W 54Y8252 $32.99 $19.95ViewJUN-ELECTRON for Raspberry Pi 4 Touch...JUN-ELECTRON for Raspberry Pi 4 Touch Screen with Case, 3.5 inch Touchscreen with Fan, 320x480 Monitor TFT LCD Game Display $26.99 $19.99ViewAmazon Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) Adjustable...Amazon Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) Adjustable Stand with USB-C Charging Port - Cloud Blue $26.99ViewEcho Show 5 (3rd Gen) Adjustable Stand...Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) Adjustable Stand with USB-C Charging Port | Charcoal $26.99ViewAmazon - Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen)...Amazon - Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) Adjustable Stand with USB-C Charging Port (Echo Show not included - Accessory Stand Only) - Charcoal $149.99View27\" SB0 Essential Monitor - SB270 G0BIShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (0)\n\n\n\nRoland Moore-ColyerSocial Links NavigationRoland Moore-Colyer a Managing Editor at Tom\u2019s Guide with a focus on news, features and opinion articles.

Forward-looking statements are based on the then current expectations, beliefs, assumptions, estimates and forecasts about the business and the industry and markets in which the Company operates and are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations, including, among others: risks commonly associated with the development of new technologies, including that the Company\u2019s technology, product designs and prototype are at an early stage and additional work will be required to confirm potential applications and feasibility of its technologies or bring product designs to market; the Company may not be able complete product development as currently expected; potential applications of the Company\u2019s technology are based on limited studies and may not be representative of the broader market; the risk that prototypes and designs may not achieve expected results; the Company may not be able to commercialize its technology; the Company may not be able to source components for its products on a cost-effective basis; the Company may not have access to necessary financing on acceptable terms or at all; pending or future patent applications may not be approved as contemplated or at all; and other risks inherent with technology and product development and the business of the Company. Such forward-looking statements should therefore be construed considering such factors. Other than in accordance with its legal or regulatory obligations, the Company is not under any obligation and it expressly disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise.

These two GPUs will likely be aimed at delivering graphics cards that sit somewhere around the $500 mark, while the RTX 3080 and alleged GeForce RTX 3090 hit prices closer to $1,000.Check out the\u00a0best gaming PCs5 big PS5 questions Sony needs to answer nowPlus: Watch Dogs 2 is free on PC this weekend \u2014 how to get itThe GeForce RTX 2070 Ti is expected to use the GA104-400 SKU, a lower-spec version of the GA102-200 the RTX 3080 could have. And it\u2019s set to have 3,072 CUDA cores and use 8GB of GDDR6X video memory.\u00a0As its lesser sibling, kopite7kimi claims the GeForce RTX 2070 will use the GA104-300 SKU and will come with 2,944 CUDA cores, which TechRadar pointed out is the same number of cores as the current high-end GeForce RTX 2080. It will also have 8GB of video memory but use the slightly slower GDDR6 VRAM.\u00a0It\u2019s worth noting that there are no sources references in kopite7kimi tweet. So we\u2019d advise you have a healthy degree of scepticism around these specs.\u00a0But the idea of there being two versions of the RTX 3070 to sit below the RTX 3080 does seem pretty legitimate. With the current 20-series RTX GPUs, Nvidia has the GeForce RTX 2070 and RTX 2070 Super that sit below the RTX 2080 and RTX 2080 Super; Nvidia seemingly dropped the Ti suffix for its more powerful RTX 2070.\u00a0While the GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 will aim to deliver the most powerful \u00a0graphics possible, the RTX 3070 and RTX 3070 Ti may look to offer high-end performance at prices that won\u2019t break the banks of dedicated PC gamers.\u00a0Sign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.We\u2019d not be surprised to also see a GeForce RTX 3060 arrive somewhere down the road, given Nvidia's history of releasing cards at lower price points. This GPU could satisfy the needs of mainstream PC gamers looking for a strong graphics card that\u2019ll handle next-generation games the Xbox Series X and PS5 will usher in, but don\u2019t want to spend much more than $1,500.\u00a0The leaks and rumors so far point towards Nvidia revealing its next-generation GeForce graphics cards, which will be built on the new Ampere GPU architecture, around August or September time. The latter month is also when AMD is expected to reveal a powerful GeForce-killing graphics card.\u00a0Today's best Monitor deals - stock checked every 30 minutes: $9.99 $5.99ViewIBM Genuine Lenovo Thinkcentre M70e...IBM Genuine Lenovo Thinkcentre M70e Internal Computer Speaker 8Ohm 1W 54Y8252 $32.99 $19.95ViewJUN-ELECTRON for Raspberry Pi 4 Touch...JUN-ELECTRON for Raspberry Pi 4 Touch Screen with Case, 3.5 inch Touchscreen with Fan, 320x480 Monitor TFT LCD Game Display $26.99 $19.99ViewAmazon Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) Adjustable...Amazon Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) Adjustable Stand with USB-C Charging Port - Cloud Blue $26.99ViewEcho Show 5 (3rd Gen) Adjustable Stand...Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) Adjustable Stand with USB-C Charging Port | Charcoal $26.99ViewAmazon - Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen)...Amazon - Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) Adjustable Stand with USB-C Charging Port (Echo Show not included - Accessory Stand Only) - Charcoal $149.99View27\" SB0 Essential Monitor - SB270 G0BIShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (1)\n\n\n\nRoland Moore-ColyerSocial Links NavigationRoland Moore-Colyer a Managing Editor at Tom\u2019s Guide with a focus on news, features and opinion articles.

Liverpool needed to know the possible impact to traffic flow and movement of pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles.\nThe city already hosts closed-circuit televisions to monitor safety and security. Each CCTV captures lots of video and data that, due to stringent privacy regulations, is mainly combed through after an incident has been reported.\nThe challenge before the city was to turn this massive dataset into information that could help it run more efficiently, handle an influx of commuters and keep the place liveable for residents \u2014 without compromising anyone\u2019s privacy.\nTo achieve this goal, the city has partnered with the Digital Living Lab of the University of Wollongong. Part of Wollongong\u2019s SMART Infrastructure Facility, the DLL has developed what it calls the Versatile Intelligent Video Analytics platform. VIVA, for short, unlocks data so that owners of CCTV networks can access real-time, privacy-compliant data to make better informed decisions.\nVIVA is designed to convert existing infrastructure into edge-computing devices embedded with the latest AI. The platform\u2019s state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms are developed at DLL on the NVIDIA Metropolis platform. Their video analytics deep-learning models are trained using transfer learning to adapt to use cases, optimized via NVIDIA TensorRT software and deployed on NVIDIA Jetson edge AI computers.\n\u201cWe designed VIVA to process video feeds as close as possible to the source, which is the camera,\u201d said Johan Barthelemy, lecturer at the SMART Infrastructure Facility of the University of Wollongong. \u201cOnce a frame has been analyzed using a deep neural network, the outcome is transmitted and the current frame is discarded.\u201d\nDisposing of frames maintains privacy as no images are transmitted. It also reduces the bandwidth needed.\nBeyond city streets like in Liverpool, VIVA has been adapted for a wide variety of applications, such as identifying and tracking wildlife; detecting culvert blockage for stormwater management and flash flood early warnings; and tracking of people using thermal cameras to understand people\u2019s mobility behavior during heat waves. It can also distinguish between firefighters searching a building and other building occupants, helping identify those who may need help to evacuate.\n\nMaking Sense of Traffic Patterns\nThe research collaboration between SMART, Liverpool\u2019s city council and its industry partners is intended to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and accessibility of a range of government services and facilities.\nFor pedestrians, the project aims to understand where they\u2019re going, their preferred routes and which areas are congested. For cyclists, it\u2019s about the routes they use and ways to improve bicycle usage. For vehicles, understanding movement and traffic patterns, where they stop, and where they park are key.\nUnderstanding mobility within a city formerly required a fleet of costly and fixed sensors, according to Barthelemy. Different models were needed to count specific types of traffic, and manual processes were used to understand how different types of traffic interacted with each other.\nUsing computer vision on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 at the edge, the VIVA platform can count the different types of traffic and capture their trajectory and speed. Data is gathered using the city\u2019s existing CCTV network, eliminating the need to invest in additional sensors.\nPatterns of movements and points of congestion are identified and predicted to help improve street and footpath layout and connectivity, traffic management and guided pathways. The data has been invaluable in helping Liverpool plan for the urban design and traffic management of its central business district.\nMachine Learning Application Built Using NVIDIA Technologies\nSMART trained the machine learning applications on its VIVA platform for Liverpool on four workstations powered by a variety of NVIDIA TITAN GPUs, as well as six workstations equipped with NVIDIA RTX GPUs to generate synthetic data and run experiments.\nIn addition to using open databases such as OpenImage, COCO and Pascal VOC for training, DLL created synthetic data via an in-house application based on the Unity Engine. Synthetic data allows the project to learn from numerous scenarios that might not otherwise be present at any given time, like rainstorms or masses of cyclists.\n\u201cThis synthetic data generation allowed us to generate 35,000-plus images per scenario of interest under different weather, time of day and lighting conditions,\u201d said Barthelemy. \u201cThe synthetic data generation uses ray tracing to improve the realism of the generated images.\u201d\nInferencing is done with NVIDIA Jetson Nano, NVIDIA Jetson TX2 and NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX, depending on the use case and processing required.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Embedded Computing | Jetson | Metropolis | Public Sector \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Marconi100 will support European researchers, through the PRACE\u00a0initiative, and Italian researchers through the Italian Supercomputing Resource Allocation initiative (ISCRA), equipping them with additional computing resources to face the socioeconomic challenges of our time such as climate change, renewable energy, sustainable economics, and precision medicine.\u00a0\nIn addition, by drastically cutting the time to insights through digital simulation, supercomputing can accelerate knowledge and decision support and can be of great help in dealing with risk management situations, like measuring environmental impact, or crisis management situations such as earthquakes or other extreme events like the current pandemic.\nIn particular, one of the first projects for Marconi100 is research around COVID-19 therapies that are able to reduce the pathogenic aggressiveness of the virus. For example, it will digitally simulate the behavior of proteins that allow the virus to replicate to better identify molecules and pharmaceutical compounds able to inhibit it. CINECA is already a partner in many projects at both national and international levels and participates in the Exscalate4CoV project, funded by the European Commission under emergency procedure.\n\"The Marconi100 project is part of a long, fruitful collaboration with the Inter-university Consortium involving also our centers of excellence in Europe,\" said Enrico Cereda, GM, IBM Italy. \"With the same technology as two of the top three supercomputers in the world, Marconi100 will follow in their footsteps and offer the community of researchers the computing power necessary to accelerate the discovery of a cure against COVID-19. As the activity of the Summit system shows, without the availability of these architectures it would take much longer, incompatible with the urgent need to find a solution. We are proud to be at CINECA's side, and the country's, in this and other important scientific challenges.\"\n\"With the installation of the Marconi100 accelerated cluster, the Marconi project is completed for the persistent evolution of the CINECA calculation system started in 2016 which, today, allows us to have an aggregate computing power of about 50 petaflops. The Marconi100 partition, with the experience gained by IBM with the US Department of Energy's Summit and Sierra projects, will allow us to provide the national and European scientific community access to a supercomputing system of great production stability and high quality of service,\" President of CINECA Eugenio Di Sciascio said.\n\"This confirms the centrality of the CINECA Consortium in the development of research in the academic and industrial field as it happens with Exscalate4CoV, a project led by the pharmaceutical company Domp\u00e9, engaged in research and evaluation of proteins for the fight against coronavirus,\" CINECA GM David Vannozzi said.\nCINECA is partner of more than 20 international projects for the development of the European HPC infrastructure and its technological and application ecosystem, in the field of plasma physics with the Eurofusion project, whose aim is to determine a significant progress in fusion energy production; in matter and materials science with the MAX - Material Science at Exascale project; in industrial engineering with the Exellerat Engineering project; in solid earth physics with the Cheese Solid Earth project: projects that will benefit from the high processing capacity provided by Marconi100.\nIBM POWER9 Accelerates Discovery\nThe design and integration of the Marconi100 accelerated cluster are the result of IBM's experience building the world's two smartest AI supercomputers: the US Dept of Energy's Summit and Sierra.\nSimilar to these two systems, the architecture of Marconi100 uses IBM POWER9 processors and NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs as well as high-performance NVIDIA Mellanox InfiniBand interconnect in a high-performance, high-scalability Dragonfly+ topology. Marconi100 also benefits from eight petabytes of IBM Elastic Storage Server with IBM Spectrum Scale to sustain high-performance IO throughput and offer a balanced computational and IO architecture.\nThe use of an accelerated computing architecture is anticipated to improve productivity for many applications, affecting a significant performance increase at both at the individual server node level as well as an aggregated cluster connected through the high-performance InfiniBand network.\u00a0\nIn terms of energy sustainability, the increased processing power will not lead to an increase in consumption. The new system will be able to count on greater energy efficiency for the same processing capacity by a factor equal to about three times CINECA's pre-existing system.\nSam Ponedal\nsponeda@us.ibm.com\r\n916-217-0145\n\n \n\nSOURCE IBM\n\n\nMarconi100 IBM POWER9\nSubscribe to email\nRelease Categories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmore articles\n\n\nArtificial intelligenceGenerative AI  | Mar 17, 2025\nHow IBM Sterling Order Management is Transforming Retail Operations\n\n\nResearch and innovation  | Mar 13, 2025\nIBM and Basque Government announce plan to install Europe's first IBM Quantum System Two at the IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center in Spain\n\n\nCorporate  | Mar 12, 2025\nIBM Annual Report 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With this series, we\u2019re taking an engineering-focused look at individual autonomous vehicle challenges and how the NVIDIA DRIVE AV Software team is mastering them. Catch up on our earlier posts,\u00a0here.\nDriving requires the ability to predict the future. Every time a car suddenly cuts into a lane or multiple cars arrive at the same intersection, drivers must make predictions as to how others will act to safely proceed.\nWhile humans rely on driver cues and personal experience to read these situations, self-driving cars can use AI to anticipate traffic patterns and safely maneuver in a complex environment.\nWe have trained the PredictionNet deep neural network to understand the driving environment around a car in top-down or bird\u2019s-eye view, and to predict the future trajectories of road users based on both live perception and map data.\n\nPredictionNet analyzes past movements of all road agents, such as cars, buses, trucks, bicycles and pedestrians, to predict their future movements. The DNN looks into the past to take in previous road user positions, and also takes in positions of fixed objects and landmarks on the scene, such as traffic lights, traffic signs and lane line markings provided by the map.\nBased on these inputs, which are rasterized in top-down view, the DNN predicts road user trajectories into the future, as shown in figure 1.\nPredicting the future has inherent uncertainty. PredictionNet captures this by also providing the prediction statistics of the future trajectory predicted for each road user, as also shown in figure 1.\nFigure 1. PredictionNet results visualized in top-down view. Gray lines denote the map, dotted white lines represent vehicle trajectories predicted by the DNN, while white boxes represent ground truth trajectory data. The colorized clouds represent the probability distributions for predicted vehicle trajectories, with warmer colors representing points that are closer in time to the present, and cooler colors representing points further in the future.\nA Top-Down Convolutional RNN-Based Approach\nPrevious approaches to predicting future trajectories for self-driving cars have leveraged both imitation learning and generative models that sample future trajectories, as well as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks for processing perception inputs and predicting future trajectories.\nFor PredictionNet, we adopt an RNN-based architecture that uses two-dimensional convolutions. This structure is highly scalable for arbitrary input sizes, including the number of road users and prediction horizons.\nAs is typically the case with any RNN, different time steps are fed into the DNN sequentially. Each time step is represented by a top-down view image that shows the vehicle surroundings at that time, including both dynamic obstacles observed via live perception, and fixed landmarks provided by a map.\nThis top-down view image is processed by a set of 2D convolutions before being passed to the RNN. In the current implementation, PredictionNet is able to confidently predict one to five seconds into the future, depending on the complexity of the scene (for example, highway versus urban).\nThe PredictionNet model also lends itself to a highly efficient runtime implementation in the TensorRT deep learning inference SDK, with 10 ms end-to-end inference times achieved on an NVIDIA TITAN RTX GPU.\nScalable Results\nResults thus far have shown PredictionNet to be highly promising for several complex traffic scenarios. For example, the DNN can predict which cars will proceed straight through an intersection versus which will turn. It\u2019s also able to correctly predict the car\u2019s behavior in highway merging scenarios.\nWe have also observed that PredictionNet is able to learn velocities and accelerations of vehicles on the scene. This enables it to correctly predict speeds of both fast-moving and fully stopped vehicles, as well as to predict stop-and-go traffic patterns.\nPredictionNet is trained on highly accurate lidar data to achieve higher prediction accuracy. However, the inference-time perception input to the DNN can be based on any sensor input combination (that is, camera, radar or lidar data) without retraining. This also means that the DNN\u2019s prediction capabilities can be leveraged for various sensor configurations and levels of autonomy, from level 2+ systems all the way to level 4/level 5.\nPredictionNet\u2019s ability to anticipate behavior in real time can be used to create an interactive training environment for reinforcement learning-based planning and control policies for features such as automatic cruise control, lane changes or intersections handling.\nBy using PredictionNet to simulate how other road users will react to an autonomous vehicle\u2019s behavior based on real-world experiences, we can train a more safe, robust and courteous AI driver.\n\n\nCategories: DRIVE Labs | DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It provides a structure to ensure that workers are wearing personal protective equipment and complying with hygiene protocols amidst the hectic pace of hospital operations, compounded by the pandemic. The system can also provide information on the availability of beds and other equipment.\nShort for \u201cData Analytics Real-World Visual Information System,\u201d DARVIS uses the NVIDIA Clara Guardian application framework, employing machine learning and advanced computer vision.\nThe system analyzes information processed by optical sensors, which act as the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the machine, and alerts users if a bed is clean or not, or if a worker is missing a glove, among other contextual insights. Upon providing feedback, all records are fully anonymized.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about compliance,\u201d said Jan-Philipp Mohr, co-founder and CEO of the company. \u201cIt\u2019s not about surveilling workers, but giving them feedback where they could harm themselves. It\u2019s for both worker protection and patient security.\u201d\nDARVIS is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program that helps startups working in AI and data science accelerate their product development, prototyping and deployment.\nThe Smarter the Hospital, the Better\nAutomation in hospitals has always been critical to saving lives and increasing efficiency, said Paul Warren, vice president of Product and team lead for AI at DARVIS. However, the need for smart hospitals is all the more urgent in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, he said.\n\u201cWe talk to the frontline caregivers, the doctors, the nurses, the transport staff and figure out what part of their jobs is particularly repetitive, frustrating or complicated,\u201d said Warren. \u201cAnd if we can help automate that in real time, they\u2019re able to do their job a lot more efficiently, which is ultimately good for improving patient outcomes.\u201d\nDARVIS can help save money as well as lives. Even before the COVID crisis, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated the annual direct medical costs of infectious diseases in U.S. hospitals to be around $45 billion, a cost bound to rise due to the global pandemic. By optimizing infection control practices and minimizing the spread of infectious disease, smart hospitals can decrease this burden, Mohr said.\nTo save costs and time needed to train and deploy their own devices, DARVIS uses PyTorch and TensorFlow optimized on NGC, NVIDIA\u2019s registry of GPU-accelerated software containers.\n\u201cNVIDIA engineering efforts to optimize deep learning solutions is a game-changer for us,\u201d said Warren. \u201cNGC makes structuring and maintaining the infrastructure environment very easy for us.\u201d\nDARVIS\u2019s current centralized approach involves deep learning techniques optimized on NVIDIA GPU-powered servers running on large workstations within the hospital\u2019s data center.\nAs they onboard more users, the company plans to also use NVIDIA DeepStream SDK on edge AI embedded systems like NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX to scale out and deploy at hospitals in a more decentralized manner, according to Mohr.\nSame Technology, Numerous Possibilities\nWhile DARVIS was initially focused on tracking beds and inventory, user feedback led to the expansion of its platform to different areas of need.\nThe same technology was developed to evaluate proper usage of PPE, to analyze worker compliance with infection control practices and to account for needed equipment in an operating room.\nThe team at DARVIS continues to research what\u2019s possible with their device, as well as in the field of AI more generally, as they expand and deploy their product at hospitals around the world.\nWatch DARVIS in action:\nhttps://youtu.be/9oDJsUaTT9w\nLearn more about NVIDIA\u2019s healthcare-application framework on the NVIDIA Clara developers page and stay up to date with our\u00a0latest healthcare news.\nImages courtesy of DARVIS, Inc.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | COVID-19 | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Clara \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Despite headwinds from a global pandemic, it will further enable RBC to transform client experiences.\nThe voyage started in the fall of 2017. That\u2019s when RBC, Canada\u2019s largest bank with 17 million clients in 36 countries, created \u00a0its dedicated research institute, Borealis AI. The institute is headquartered next to Toronto\u2019s MaRS Discovery District, a global hub for machine-learning experts.\nBorealis AI quickly attracted dozens of top researchers. That\u2019s no surprise given the institute is led by the bank\u2019s chief science officer, Foteini Agrafioti, a patent-holding serial entrepreneur and Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering who co-chairs Canada\u2019s AI advisory council.\nThe bank initially booted up Borealis AI into a mix of systems. But as the group and the AI models it developed grew, it needed a larger, dedicated AI engine.\nBrokering a Private AI Cloud for Banking\n\u201cI had the good fortune to help commission our first infrastructure for Borealis AI, but it wasn\u2019t adequate to meet our evolving AI needs,\u201d said Mike Tardif, a senior vice president of tech infrastructure at RBC.\nThe team wanted a distributed AI system that would serve four locations, from Vancouver to Montreal, securely behind the bank\u2019s firewall. It needed to scale as workloads grew and leverage the regular flow of AI innovations in open source software without requiring hardware upgrades to do so.\nIn short, the bank aimed to build a state-of-the-art private AI cloud. For its key planks, RBC chose six NVIDIA DGX systems and Red Hat\u2019s OpenShift to orchestrate containers running on those systems.\n\u201cWe see NVIDIA as a leader in AI infrastructure. We were already using its DGX systems and wanted to expand our AI capabilities, so it was an obvious choice,\u201d said Tardif.\nAI Steers Bank Toward Smart Apps\nRBC is already reporting solid results with the system despite commissioning it early this year in the face of the oncoming COVID-19 storm.\nThe private AI cloud can run thousands of simulations and analyze millions of data points in a fraction of the time that it could before, the bank says. As a result, it expects to transform the customer banking experience with a new generation of smart applications. And that\u2019s just the beginning.\n\u201cFor instance, in our capital markets business we are now able to train thousands of statistical models in parallel to cover this vast space of possibilities,\u201d said Agrafioti, head of Borealis AI.\n\u201cThis would be impossible without a distributed and fully automated environment. We can populate the entire cluster with a single click using the automated pipeline that this new solution has delivered,\u201d she added.\nThe platform has already helped reduce client calls and resulted in faster delivery of new applications for RBC clients, thanks to the performance of GPUs combined with the automation of orchestrated containers.\nRBC deployed Red Hat OpenShift in combination with NVIDIA DGX infrastructure to rapidly spin up AI compute instances in a fraction of the time it used to take.\nOpenShift helps by creating an environment where users can run thousands of containers simultaneously, extracting datasets to train AI models and run them in production on DGX systems, said Yan Fisher, a global evangelist for emerging technologies at Red Hat.\nOpenShift and NGC, NVIDIA\u2019s software hub, let the companies support the bank remotely through the pandemic, he added.\n\u201cBuilding our AI infrastructure with NVIDIA DGX has given us in-house capabilities similar to what the Amazons and Googles of the world offer and we\u2019ve achieved some significant savings in total cost of ownership,\u201d said Tardif.\nHe singled out as key hardware assets the NVLink interconnect and NVIDIA\u2019s support for enterprise networking standards with maximum bandwidth and reduced latency. They let users quickly access multiple GPUs within and between systems across data centers that host the bank\u2019s AI cloud.\nHow a Bank with a Long History Stays Innovative\nThough it\u2019s 150 years old, RBC keeps in tune with the times by investing early in emerging technologies, as it did with Borealis AI.\n\u201cInnovation is in our DNA \u2014 we\u2019re always looking at what\u2019s coming around the corner and how we can operationalize it, and AI is a top strategic priority,\u201d said Tardif.\nAlthough its main expertise is in banking, RBC has tech chops, too. During the COVID lockdown it managed to \u201cpressure test\u201d the latest systems, pushing them well beyond they thought were their limits.\n\u201cWe\u2019re co-creating this vision of AI infrastructure with NVIDIA, and through this journey we\u2019re raising the bar for AI innovation which everyone in the financial services industry can benefit from,\u201d Tardif said.\nVisit NVIDIA\u2019s financial services industry page to learn more.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Data Science | Financial Services | Machine Learning | NGC | NVIDIA DGX | NVLink \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But what, exactly, is an AI cockpit, and how will it change the way we move?\nAI is enabling a range of new software-defined, in-vehicle capabilities across the transportation industry. With centralized, high-performance compute, automakers can now build vehicles that become smarter over time.\nA vehicle\u2019s cockpit typically requires a collection of electronic control units and switches to perform basic functions, such as powering entertainment or adjusting temperature. Consolidating these components with an AI platform such as NVIDIA DRIVE AGX simplifies the architecture while creating more compute headroom to add new features. In addition, NVIDIA DRIVE IX provides an open and extensible software framework for a software-defined cockpit experience.\nMercedes-Benz released the first such intelligent cockpit, the MBUX AI system, powered by NVIDIA technology, in 2018. The system is currently in more than 20 Mercedes-Benz models, with the second generation debuting in the upcoming S-Class.\nThe second-generation MBUX system is set to debut in the Mercedes-Benz S-Class.\nMBUX and other such AI cockpits orchestrate crucial safety and convenience features much more smoothly than the traditional vehicle architecture. They centralize compute for streamlined functions, and they\u2019re constantly learning. By regularly delivering new features, they extend the joy of ownership throughout the life of the vehicle.\nAlways Alert\nBut safety is the foremost benefit of AI in the vehicle. AI acts as an extra set of eyes on the 360-degree environment surrounding the vehicle, as well as an intelligent guardian for drivers and passengers inside.\nOne key feature is driver monitoring. As automated driving functions become more commonplace across vehicle fleets, it\u2019s critical to ensure the human at the wheel is alert and paying attention.\nAI cockpits use interior cameras to monitor whether the driver is paying attention to the road.\nUsing interior-facing cameras, AI-powered driver monitoring can track driver activity, head position and facial movements to analyze whether the driver is paying attention, drowsy or distracted. The system can then alert the driver, bringing attention back to the road.\nThis system can also help keep those inside and outside the vehicle safe and alert. By sensing whether a passenger is about to exit a car and using exterior sensors to monitor the outside environment, AI can warn of oncoming traffic or pedestrians and bikers potentially in the path of the opening door.\nIt also acts as a guardian in emergency situations. If a passenger is not sitting properly in their seat, the system can prevent an airbag activation that would harm rather than help them. It can also use AI to detect the presence of children or pets left behind in the vehicle, helping prevent heat stroke.\nAn AI cockpit is always on the lookout for a vehicle\u2019s occupants, adding an extra level of safety with full cabin monitoring so they can enjoy the ride.\nConstant Convenience\nIn addition to safety, AI helps make the daily drive easier and more enjoyable.\nWith crystal-clear graphics, drivers can receive information about their route, as well as what the sensors on the car see, quickly and easily. Augmented reality heads-up displays and virtual reality views of the vehicle\u2019s surroundings deliver the most important data (such as parking assistance, directions, speed and oncoming obstacles) without disrupting the driver\u2019s line of sight.\nThese visualizations help build trust in the driver assistance system as well as understanding of its capabilities and limitations for a safer and more effective driving experience.\nUsing natural language processing, drivers can control vehicle settings without taking their eyes off the road. Conversational AI enables easy access to search queries, like finding the best coffee shops or sushi restaurants along a given route. The same system that monitors driver attention can also interpret gesture controls, providing another way for drivers to communicate with the cockpit without having to divert their gaze.\nNatural language processing makes it possible to access vehicle controls without taking your eyes off the road.\nThese technologies can also be used to personalize the driving experience. Biometric user authentication and voice recognition allow the car to identify who is driving, and adjust settings and preferences accordingly.\nAI cockpits are being integrated into more models every year, making them smarter and safer and constantly adding new features. High-performance, energy-efficient AI compute platforms, consolidate in-car systems with a centralized architecture to enable the open NVIDIA DRIVE IX software platform to meet future cockpit needs.\nWhat used to be fanciful fiction will soon be part of our daily driving routine.\nLearn more about autonomous driving on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(Image Credits: creper9000 at Reddit)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 series Ampere gaming graphics cards are looking to offer a major design update over traditional graphics cards if the rumors are correct. The latest rumor comes from the Chinese tech outlet, FCPOWERUP, who are well known for their reporting on power supplies & have stated that NVIDIA is going to utilize a brand new power interface on its next-gen gaming lineup.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series (Ampere Gaming Graphics Cards) To Make Use of New Power Interface, A Huge Reference Design Update Over The Existing Generation\nThe rumor follows up with what we've already heard about the power consumption figures of the next-generation lineup which are expected to exceed 300W. According to the source, NVIDIA will be equipping its reference GeForce RTX 30 series gaming graphics cards with a new power interface that comes in a 12 Pin design. We have already seen the cooler and the heatsink which is a huge update over the traditional reference design that NVIDIA has offered over the years. Even Turing's reference design went the untraditional path by offering a dual-axial fan-based design but Ampere might offer an even bolder and crazier design.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe blueprint of the 12V 12-pin connector is provided and from first look, it looks like traditional 2x 6-pin connectors hooked up together. The connector looks similar to the Molex Micro-Fit series of power connectors which are 19mm wide and have a 3mm pitch. This is the same width as the two 6-pin power connectors that current PSUs offer but offers a current capacity of 8.5A compared to 6A of mini-Fit 5556 connectors. At a perfect efficiency rate, the mini-fit would deliver 600 Watts of power but that's not always the case and the actual power delivered to the GPU is around 400W at 6 Amps. The primary bottleneck with the traditional connectors is the 20AWG specifications for the pins.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere Gaming GPU' Rumored Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameGPUCores (SMs)MemoryMemory BusBandwidth\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Titan RTX (2nd Gen)Ampere GA102-4005376 (84)24 GB GDDR6X384-bit~816 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA Titan RTX (1st Gen)Turing TU102-4004608 (72)24 GB GDDR6384-bit672 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti / NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090Ampere GA102-3005248 (82)12 GB GDDR6X384-bit~1.00 TB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 TiTuring TU102-3004352 (68)11 GB GDDR6352-bit616 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080Ampere GA102-2004352 (68)10 GB GDDR6X320-bit~760 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Turing TU104-4002944 (46)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiAmpere GA104-4003072 (48)8 GB GDDR6X256-bit~512 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPERTuring TU104-4102560 (40)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ampere GA104-3002944 (46)8 GB GDDR6256-bit~512 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070Turing TU106-4002304 (36)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiAmpere GA106-400TBDTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPERTuring TU106-4102176 (34)8 GB GDDR6256-bit448 GB/s\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ampere GA106-300TBDTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Turing TU106-2001920 (30)6 GB GDDR6192-bit336 GB/s\n\n\n\n\nThe source also reports that there's a secondary 4-pin interface next to the main 12-pin connector whose purpose is unknown at the moment. The source does mention that the new power delivery interface would be utilized by a GeForce RTX 30 Ampere Gaming graphics card bearing the PG142 board number. We can't say for sure which particular GPU this board would utilize but judging by the power requirements, it is possible that this might be the high-end GA102/GA104 GPU powered gaming cards which include RTX 3080 Ti / RTX 3090, RTX 3080, RTX 3070 Ti / RTX 3070.\n\nThis design may also just be specific to NVIDIA's reference 'Founders Edition' models while AIBs will still ship their custom designs with traditional mini-fit power connectors. It seems like users with good PSUs can still plug in two 6-pin power connectors given they meet the high efficiency required to sustain an enthusiast-grade graphics card. But then again, anyone running a $500 US+ graphics card would already be rocking a pretty decent quality PSU.\nSo it looks like the addition of this new 12-pin power connector won't require any big changes and you will indeed be able to run the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series Ampere gaming graphics cards without having to worry about buying a new PSU that falls in the standard of your brand new graphics card.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n160\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The next-gen GPUs from the green team are (some say) right around the corner, and it appears as though you won't need to physically buy a brand new graphics card to experience what the architecture has to offer\u2014you can sign up to GeForce Now for $5/month instead.\"We want GeForce Now to be an opportunity for gamers to experience the latest gaming technology from Nvidia.\" Andrew Fear, Sr. product manager, GeForce Now, tells me. \"Therefore, you can expect to see Ampere on GeForce Now in time.\"The GeForce Now cloud gaming service first launched with Pascal generation graphics cards loaded into its servers\u2014Nvidia's enterprise-grade Tesla GPUs most often. These were later replaced with RTX graphics cards capable of delivering the RTX feature set, such as real-time ray tracing and DLSS, via the cloud and down to your device.However, that upgrade to the Turing architecture was some time after the architecture's initial late-2018 release\u2014ray tracing and DLSS were first made available to Founders tier members of the GeForce Now service back in February.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: the top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest graphics card: your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: get into the game ahead of the restNvidia offers two tiers of membership for its GeForce Now service: Founders and Free. RTX graphics, priority access, and extended session length separates the wheat from the chaff, and a $5/month introductory fee for 12 months.When asked whether the introductory offer would expire anytime soon, thus raising the price of the Founders tier, Fear told me \"we'll think about this next year.\"Everything from heatsinks to 3DMark benchmarks have been cropping up across the web in recent weeks, suggesting that an Nvidia Ampere release date is near. Undoubtedly, the first to game on the next-gen will do so with physical hardware, but if Nvidia's aspirations for GeForce Now are met, I'd take a guess that Ampere will arrive in the cloud sooner than Turing made the leap.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

For overall fastest time to solution at scale, the DGX SuperPOD system, a massive cluster of DGX A100 systems connected with HDR InfiniBand, also set eight new performance milestones. The real winners are customers applying this performance today to transform their businesses faster and more cost effectively with AI.\nThis is the third consecutive and strongest showing for NVIDIA in training tests from MLPerf, an industry benchmarking group formed in May 2018. NVIDIA set six records in the first MLPerf training benchmarks in December 2018 and eight in July 2019.\nNVIDIA set records in the category customers care about most: commercially available products. We ran tests using our latest NVIDIA Ampere architecture as well as our Volta architecture.\nThe NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD system set new milestones for AI training at scale.\nNVIDIA was the only company to field commercially available products for all the tests. Most other submissions used the preview category for products that may not be available for several months or the research category for products not expected to be available for some time.\nNVIDIA Ampere Ramps Up in Record Time\nIn addition to breaking performance records, the A100, the first processor based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, hit the market faster than any previous NVIDIA GPU. At launch, it powered NVIDIA\u2019s third-generation DGX systems, and it became publicly available in a Google cloud service just six weeks later.\nAlso helping meet the strong demand for A100 are the world\u2019s leading cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Tencent Cloud, as well as dozens of major server makers, including Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Inspur Electronic Information and Supermicro.\nUsers across the globe are applying the A100 to tackle the most complex challenges in AI, data science and scientific computing.\nSome are enabling a new wave of recommendation systems or conversational AI applications while others power the quest for treatments for COVID-19. All are enjoying the greatest generational performance leap in eight generations of NVIDIA GPUs.\nThe NVIDIA Ampere architecture swept all eight tests of commercially available accelerators.\nA 4x Performance Gain in 1.5 Years\nThe latest results demonstrate NVIDIA\u2019s focus on continuously evolving an AI platform that spans processors, networking, software and systems.\nFor example, the tests show at equivalent throughput rates today\u2019s DGX A100 system delivers up to 4x the performance of the system that used V100 GPUs in the first round of MLPerf training tests. Meanwhile, the original DGX-1 system based on NVIDIA V100 can now deliver up to 2x higher performance thanks to the latest software optimizations.\nThese gains came in less than two years from innovations across the AI platform. Today\u2019s NVIDIA A100 GPUs \u2014 coupled with software updates for CUDA-X libraries \u2014 power expanding clusters built with Mellanox HDR 200Gb/s InfiniBand networking.\nHDR InfiniBand enables extremely low latencies and high data throughput, while offering smart deep learning computing acceleration engines via the scalable hierarchical aggregation and reduction protocol (SHARP) technology.\nNVIDIA evolves its AI performance with new GPUs, software upgrades and expanding system designs.\nNVIDIA Shines in Recommendation Systems, Conversational AI, Reinforcement Learning\nThe MLPerf benchmarks \u2014 backed by organizations including Amazon, Baidu, Facebook, Google, Harvard, Intel, Microsoft and Stanford \u2014 constantly evolve to remain relevant as AI itself evolves.\nThe latest benchmarks featured two new tests and one substantially revised test, all of which NVIDIA excelled in. One ranked performance in recommendation systems, an increasingly popular AI task; another tested conversational AI using BERT, one of the most complex neural network models in use today. Finally, the reinforcement learning test used Mini-go with the full-size 19\u00d719 Go board and was the most complex test in this round involving diverse operations from game play to training.\nCompanies using NVIDIA AI for conversational AI and recommendation systems.\nCompanies are already reaping the benefits of this performance on these strategic applications of AI.\nAlibaba hit a $38 billion sales record on Singles Day in November, using NVIDIA GPUs to deliver more than 100x more queries/second on its recommendation systems than CPUs. For its part, conversational AI is becoming the talk of the town, driving business results in industries from finance to healthcare.\nNVIDIA is delivering both the performance needed to run these powerful jobs and the ease of use to embrace them.\nSoftware Paves Strategic Paths to AI\nIn May, NVIDIA announced two application frameworks, Jarvis (since renamed NVIDIA Riva) for conversational AI and NVIDIA Merlin for recommendation systems. Merlin includes the HugeCTR framework for training that powered the latest MLPerf results.\nThese are part of a growing family of application frameworks for markets including automotive (NVIDIA DRIVE), healthcare (Clara), robotics (Isaac) and retail/smart cities (Metropolis).\nNVIDIA application frameworks simplify enterprise AI from development to deployment.\nDGX SuperPOD Architecture Delivers Speed at Scale\nNVIDIA ran MLPerf tests for systems on Selene, an internal cluster based on the DGX SuperPOD, its public reference architecture for large-scale GPU clusters that can be deployed in weeks. That architecture extends the design principles and best practices used in the DGX POD to serve the most challenging problems in AI today.\nSelene recently debuted on the TOP500 list as the fastest industrial system in the U.S. with more than an exaflops of AI performance. It\u2019s also the world\u2019s second most power-efficient system on the Green500 list.\nCustomers are already using these reference architectures to build DGX PODs and DGX SuperPODs of their own. They include HiPerGator, the fastest academic AI supercomputer in the U.S., which the University of Florida will feature as the cornerstone of its cross-curriculum AI initiative.\nMeanwhile, a top supercomputing center, Argonne National Laboratory, is using DGX A100 to find ways to fight COVID-19. Argonne was the first of a half-dozen high performance computing centers to adopt A100 GPUs.\nMany users have adopted NVIDIA DGX PODs.\nDGX SuperPODs are already driving business results for companies like Continental in automotive, Lockheed Martin in aerospace and Microsoft in cloud-computing services.\nThese systems are all up and running thanks in part to a broad ecosystem supporting NVIDIA GPUs and DGX systems.\nStrong MLPerf Showing by NVIDIA Ecosystem\nOf the nine companies submitting results, seven submitted with NVIDIA GPUs including cloud service providers (Alibaba Cloud, Google Cloud and Tencent Cloud) and server makers (Dell, Fujitsu and Inspur Electronic Information), highlighting the strength of NVIDIA\u2019s ecosystem.\nMany partners leveraged the NVIDIA AI platform for MLPerf submissions.\nMany of these partners used containers on NGC, NVIDIA\u2019s software hub, along with publicly available frameworks for their submissions.\nThe MLPerf partners represent part of an ecosystem of nearly two dozen cloud-service providers and OEMs with products or plans for online instances, servers and PCIe cards using NVIDIA A100 GPUs.\nTest-Proven Software Available on NGC Today\nMuch of the same software NVIDIA and its partners used for the latest MLPerf benchmarks is available to customers today on NGC.\nNGC is host to several GPU-optimized containers, software scripts, pre-trained models and SDKs. They empower data scientists and developers to accelerate their AI workflows across popular frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.\nOrganizations are embracing containers to save time getting to business results that matter. In the end, that\u2019s the most important benchmark of all.\nArtist\u2019s rendering at top: NVIDIA\u2019s new DGX SuperPOD, built in less than a month and featuring more than 2,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, swept every MLPerf benchmark category for at-scale performance among commercially available products.\u00a0 \n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep LearningTags: Conversational AI | Machine Learning | Merlin | NGC | NVIDIA A100 | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | NVIDIA DGX | Recommender Systems | Riva \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

At the high-end level, we looked at the NVIDIA Titan RTX and even reviewed two Titan RTX\u2019s in NVLINK. To match the Titan RTX level, we examined a single NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000, which offered an even up-rated feature set. Today we round out our high-end graphics cards with two NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000\u2019s in NVLINK. The Quadro RTX 8000 matches many of the Titan RTX specifications. Perhaps the biggest delta is with memory, which gets boosted from 24GB to 48GB with ECC support. In an NVLINK configuration, we now have a massive amount of memory at 96GB total.\n\nAt this time, the Quadro RTX 8000 is the pinnacle of PCIe workstation GPU horsepower offered by NVIDIA, suitable for high-end workstations and servers where we can find 8x Quadro RTX 8000\u2019s installed. NVIDIA\u2019s Quadro line of graphics cards is certified for data center use, while the Titan RTX is not. Data-Center use is a big deal not only for certifications but the cooling design is essential in an environment where 8x GPUs can be installed. With the Quadro RTX series, we find blower type cooling fans used, which perform better in tight installations.\nNVIDIA recently announced the New NVIDIA A100 PCIe version but that is focused more on the server market and availability the Quadro RTX 8000 is much better at the time we are writing this.\nIn content creation workstations, having a considerable amount of installed memory can have a significant impact on workflow were very large video or CAD data files are processed quickly with reduced render times. With deep learning and AI workloads, this means a larger number of batches or batch sizes can be evaluated, resulting in faster training times and larger inferencing networks.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 Overview\nWe reviewed a Quadro RTX 8000 in November 2019, which can be found here. For this review, we will double up and test the Quadro RTX 8000\u2019s in NVLINK mode. The primary GPU is the same, and we will show the product pictures here again for completeness.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 is a dual-slot GPU with a length of 10.5\u2033 long. The outside case is very stylish with shinny chrome covering and bright green band across the middle. It is an impressive looking graphics card, be warned, it will attract fingerprints on the chrome surfaces.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 NVLINK Top\nWhile the Titan RTX includes a backplate which we like, the Quadro RTX 8000 does not.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 NVLINK Back\nAt the end of the Quadro RTX 8000, we find the video outputs, which are 4x DisplayPort 1.4 and 1x VirtualLink port for VR head-mounted displays.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 NVLINK Outputs\nPower connections located at the end of the Quadro RTX 8000, which should be more comfortable for server mountings. These are 1x 6-Pin and 1x 8-Pin connections.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 NVLINK Power Connections\nWe will use a Quadro branded SLI Bridge to enable NVLINK on the two RTX 8000\u2019s.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 NVLINK NVLINK Bridge\nLet us move on to look at the specifications for each NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000.\n\n\n\n \n\n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 REVIEW OVERVIEWDesign & Aesthetics9.0Performance10Feature Set9.8Value9SUMMARYWe take another look at the NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000, this time with two of the 48GB GPUs in NVLink configuration for top-end workstation GPU compute9.5OVERALL SCORE\n\n TAGSNVIDIANVIDIA Quadro RTXQuadroRTX \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleSynology C2 Backup Cloud Region for North AmericaNext articleGoogle Cloud NVIDIA A100 Instance Launched William Harmonhttp://www.servethehome.com dual-nvidia-quadro-rtx-8000-review-with-nvlink-performanceWe take another look at the NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000, this time with two of the 48GB GPUs in NVLink configuration for top-end workstation GPU compute \n \nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAcemagic F3A an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 Mini PC with up to 128GB of RAM \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASUS ESC8000A-E13P Review an 8x PCIe GPU Server \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASRock Rack 4U8G-TURIN2 A Fresh Take on a Classic AI Server Design \n\n  \n\n\n\n10 COMMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nemerth\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            July 6, 2020\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            8:58 am                                            \n\n\n\nWhy is the Radeon VII not in the comparison, William?

The source is reliable but they have annotated that with the statement that they are not sure so this is 100% a rumor at this point so grain of salt, face-value et all applies. We would not be surprised if this turns out to be the case because word on the vine is that NVIDIA has moved its gaming Ampere lineup to Samsung's 8nm node and 627mm\u00b2 would be around the maximum limit of the reticle (it can certainly go higher but yields fall off significantly after this point).\nNVIDIA's big Ampere GPU for gaming to have 627mm\u00b2 large die?\nKeep in mind, even if this tweet turns out to be true, we are not sure at this point whether this refers to SKU10, 20 or 30. The RTX 2080 Ti had a 754mm\u00b2 but was based on the 16nm process (12NFF is essentially 16nm FF with optimizations). Shifting to Samsung's 8nm process (which is basically 10nm with optimizations) should allow for a minimum 30% more density holding performance constant and accounting for a slightly increased power draw. This means you are looking at the equivalent of a 895mm\u00b2 GPU as fabricated on the 12NFF process.\n\n627mm2\n\u2014 Elysian Realm (@KittyYYuko) July 8, 2020\n\nBased on the expected power level of this chip [opinion] we expect this to be the Big Ampere GPU for Gaming [/opinion]. This might be the RTX 3090 or the RTX 3080 / Ti variant. One thing is for sure, NVIDIA is planning to roll out some extremely powerful GPUs this lineup and regardless of which SKU this turns out to be, we are in for a massive performance uplift (and hopefully a performance per $ reduction as well).\nAn alleged picture of the RTX 3080 Ti (not confirmed).\nShifting from TSMC to Samsung might also be the logical move here considering 1) Samsung has enough cash reserves to offer the process for cheap and 2) will have ample volume to meet NVIDIA's demands. Samsung's 8nm process is based on the 10nm backbone and will be 10% more energy-efficient than 10nm. 8nm will still be a massive jump in performance from NVIDIA's 12NFF (which is essentially just an optimized version of 16nm) and the company could very easily supplement the lower energy efficiency by feeding it more power (that might explain the high TGP ratings for the RTX 3090\u00a0we saw earlier). Oh and by the way, Igor has also confirmed the move to Samsung.\nCourtesy: Igor's Lab\nWe had initially heard that NVIDIA might decide to do a staggered launch with some high-performance parts (like the purported RTX 3090) going to TSMC 7nm and lower end parts going with Samsung but according to Kopite, all parts and segments are going to be based on Samsung's 8nm Process and they are 100% sure about it. This means that RTX 3090, RTX 3080, 3070 and so on - all SKUs are going to be based on the 8nm process. Since the process is less efficient than TSMC's NVIDIA would need to slightly increase the TGP across the board to still give the massive performance leap we have been seeing in leaked benchmarks (and boy is it something to behold).\nThe source has also previously stated that NVIDIA's future Tegra processors are going to be based on the same process as well. NVIDIA felt the brunt of its dependency on TSMC for the first time when AMD booked all of spare 7nm capacity with its CPUs and GPUs. At the end of the day, it really doesn't matter whether we get the RTX 3000 series on the TSMC 7nm process or Samsung's 8nm - what matters is performance and we fully expect them to retain their performance lead over AMD.\n\n\n\nWhich part do you think this is?\n\n\n SKU30 (RTX 3090/Titan etc)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n SKU20 (RTX 3080/Ti /Super etc)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n SKU10 (RTX 3070/Ti/Super etc)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Leaked die size is not true.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n41\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n41\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n37\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n33\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n21\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The competition measures the time it takes to train one of eight ML models to a qualified target on the following tasks: image classification, recommendation, translation, and playing Go. Forerunners Google and NVIDIA set new AI performance records in this third round (v0.7).\u201cGoogle TPUs set records in six of the eight benchmarks! We need bigger benchmarks, because we can now train the ResNet-50, BERT, Transformer, & SSD benchmarks each in under 30 seconds,\u201c tweeted Google AI Lead Jeff Dean. Google broke performance records in DLRM, Transformer, BERT, SSD, ResNet-50, and Mask R-CNN using its new ML supercomputer and latest Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) chip. Google disclosed in a blog post that the supercomputer includes 4096 TPU v3 chips and hundreds of CPU host machines and delivers over 430 PFLOPs of peak performance.While Google ramped up their cloud TPUs and the new supercomputer to deliver faster-than-ever training speeds, NVIDIA\u2019s new A100 Tensor Core GPU also showcased its capabilities with the fastest performance per accelerator on all eight MLPerf benchmarks. NVIDIA introduced the A100 this May, as the first GPU based on the company\u2019s Ampere GPU architecture. With more than 54 billion transistors, the 7-nanometre processor can execute five petaflops of performance.MLPerf is a consortium of over 70 companies and researchers from leading universities, and the MLPerf benchmark suites are the industry standard for measuring machine learning performance.For complete results of the MLPerf competition including previous round scores, please visit the project website.Reporter: Fangyu Cai | Editor: Michael SarazenSynced Report |\u00a0A Survey of China\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Solutions in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic \u2014 87 Case Studies from 700+ AI VendorsThis report offers a look at how the Chinese government and business owners have leveraged artificial intelligence technologies in the battle against COVID-19.

The automotive industry is changing and development cycles are getting shorter. To advance its technological leadership, Continental has invested in establishing its own supercomputer for Artificial Intelligence (AI), powered by NVIDIA InfiniBand connected DGX systems. It is operating from a datacenter in Frankfurt and offering computing power as well as storage to developers in locations worldwide. AI enhances advanced driver assistance systems and makes mobility smarter and safer, bringing autonomous driving within reach of mid-term business plans.\u201cThe supercomputer is an investment in our future,\u201d said Christian Schumacher, head of Program Management Systems in Continental\u2019s Advanced Driver Assistance Systems business unit. \u201cThe state-of-the-art system reduces the time to train neural networks, allowing for at least 14 times more experiments to be run at the same time.\u201d\n            Available documents\n        \n            \n    \n    select/deselect all\n    \n            \n    \n    Supercomputer 2\n    \n                 JPG 754.18 KB\n            \n            \n    \n    Supercomputer 2 (small version)\n    \n                 JPG 54.38 KB\n            \n        Add to cart\n    \n        Download now\n    \n                        Download now\n                    Share:FacebookXLinkedInRedditXingTumblrEmailDeep Learning, Simulation and Virtual Data Generation is much faster thanks to the supercomputer.Cooperation with NVIDIA secures top quality\u201cWhen searching for a partner, we look for two things: quality and speed,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cThe project was set up with an ambitious timeline, aiming for realization within less than a year. After intensive testing and scouting, Continental selected NVIDIA, which powers many of the fastest supercomputers around the world.\u201d\u201cNVIDIA DGX systems give innovators like Continental AI supercomputing in a cost-effective, enterprise-ready solution that\u2019s easy to deploy,\u201d says Manuvir Das, head of Enterprise Computing at NVIDIA. \u201cUsing the InfiniBand-connected NVIDIA DGX POD for autonomous vehicle training, Continental is engineering tomorrow\u2019s most intelligent vehicles, as well as the IT infrastructure that will be used to design them.\u201d\n            Available documents\n        \n            \n    \n    select/deselect all\n    \n            \n    \n    Continental AI\n    \n                 JPG 5.15 MB\n            \n            \n    \n    Continental AI (small version)\n    \n                 JPG 113.08 KB\n            \n        Add to cart\n    \n        Download now\n    \n                        Download now\n                    Share:FacebookXLinkedInRedditXingTumblrEmailManaging complex driving scenarios is one of the biggest challenges on the way toward autonomous mobility.\n                    Continental\n                Continental\u2019s supercomputer is built with more than 50 NVIDIA DGX systems, connected with the NVIDIA Mellanox InfiniBand network. It is ranked, according to the publicly available list of TOP500 supercomputers, as the top system in the automotive industry. A hybrid approach has been chosen to extend capacity and storage through cloud solutions if needed.Advanced driver assistance systems use AI to enable a vehicle to make decisions, assist the driver and ultimately operate autonomously. Environmental sensors like radar and cameras deliver raw data. This raw data is being processed in real-time by intelligent systems to create a comprehensive model of the vehicle\u2019s surroundings (Sense) and devise a strategy on how to interact with the environment (Plan). Finally, the vehicle needs to be controlled to behave like planned (Act). But with systems becoming more complex, traditional software development methods and machine learning methods have reached their limit. Deep Learning and simulations have become fundamental methods in the development of AI-based solutions.\n            Available documents\n        \n            \n    \n    select/deselect all\n    \n            \n    \n    Supercomputer 1\n    \n                 JPG 1.58 MB\n            \n            \n    \n    Supercomputer 1 (small version)\n    \n                 JPG 89.11 KB\n            \n        Add to cart\n    \n        Download now\n    \n                        Download now\n                    Share:FacebookXLinkedInRedditXingTumblrEmailThe supercomputer will accelerate Continental\u2019s development for AI-based solutions.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bMain use cases: Deep Learning, Simulation and Virtual Data GenerationWith Deep Learning, an artificial neural network enables the machine to learn by experience and connect new information with existing knowledge, essentially imitating the human brain\u2019s learning process. But while a child is capable of recognizing a car after being shown a few dozen pictures of different car types, several thousand hours of training with millions of images resulting in enormous amounts of data are necessary to train a neural network that will later on assist a driver or even operate a vehicle autonomously. The NVIDIA DGX POD not only reduces the time needed for this complex process, it also reduces the time to market for new technologies.\u201cOverall, we are estimating the time needed to fully train a neural network to be reduced from weeks to days,\u201d said Bal\u00e1zs L\u00f3r\u00e1nd, head of Continental\u2019s AI Competence Center in Budapest, Hungary, who works also on the development of infrastructure for AI-based innovations together with his groups in Continental. \u201cOur development team has been growing in numbers and experience over the past years. With the supercomputer, we are now able to scale computing power even better according to our needs and leverage the full potential of our developers.\u201dTo date, the data used for training those neural networks comes mainly from the Continental test vehicle fleet. Currently, they drive around 15,000 test kilometers each day, collecting around 100 terabytes of data \u2013 equivalent to 50,000 hours of movies. Already, the recorded data can be used to train new systems by being replayed, simulating physical test drives. With the supercomputer, data can now be generated synthetically, a high computing power consuming use case that allows systems to learn from travelling virtually through a simulated environment.This can have several advantages for the development process: Firstly, over the long run, it might make recording, storing and mining the data generated by the physical fleet unnecessary, as necessary training scenarios can be created instantly on the system itself. Secondly, it increases speed, as virtual vehicles can travel the same number of test kilometers in a few hours that would take a real car several weeks. Thirdly, the synthetic generation of data makes it possible for systems to process and react to changing and unpredictable situations, ultimately allowing vehicles to navigate safely through changing and extreme weather conditions or make safe prognoses on pedestrian movements \u2013 thus paving the way to higher levels of automation.The ability to scale was one of the main drivers behind the conception of the NVIDIA DGX POD. Through technology, machines can learn faster, better and more comprehensively than through any human-controlled method, with potential performance growing exponentially with every evolutionary step.The supercomputer is located in a datacenter in Frankfurt, which has been chosen for its proximity to cloud providers and, more importantly, its AI-ready environment, fulfilling specific requirements regarding cooling systems, connectivity and power supply. Certified green energy is being used to power the computer, with GPU clusters being much more energy efficient than CPU clusters by design.Share:FacebookXLinkedInRedditXingTumblrEmail\n            Available documents\n        \n            \n    \n    select/deselect all\n    \n            \n    \n    Continental Establishes its Own Supercomputer For Vehicle AI System Training, Powered by NVIDIA DGX\n    \n                 DOCX 171.47 KB\n            \n            \n    \n    Continental AI\n    \n                 JPG 5.15 MB\n            \n            \n    \n    Supercomputer 1\n    \n                 JPG 1.58 MB\n            \n            \n    \n    Supercomputer 2\n    \n                 JPG 754.18 KB\n            \n        Add to cart\n    \n        Download now\n    \n                        Download now\n                    ContactMary ArrafHead of Communications Automotive and Continental North America+1 (248) 393-5509+1 (248) 766-9241mary.arraf@continental-corporation.com\n\n                \n                        Latest Press Releases\n                    \n            \n                                February 12, 2025\n                            Continental Launches Aftermarket Hydraulics Program in US and Canada for Heavy-Duty Trucks\n                                February 05, 2025\n                            Continental to Showcase Mining Products, New Services at MINEXCHANGE SME Annual Conference and Expo\n                                January 06, 2025\n                            Aurora, Continental, and NVIDIA Partner to Deploy Driverless Trucks at Scale\n                                December 16, 2024\n                            Continental Advances Mobility from Road to Cloud at CES\u00ae 2025\n                                December 03, 2024\n                            Continental Sells Zonar to GPS Trackit\n                                December 02, 2024\n                            Continental Announces New X-Life XCP5\n                                October 15, 2024\n                            Continental Expands Plant in Ponta Grossa, Brazil to Manufacture Heavy Duty Steel Cord Conveyor Belts\n                            \n                                    All press releases\n                                \n                        Follow us onFacebookTikTokXYoutubeInstagramLinkedInGlassdoorRSS\n\t\t\t\t\tContact us\n\t\t\t\t\tPressJobs & CareersSuspicious Job OffersIntegrity HotlineOther\n\t\t\t\t\tServices\n\t\t\t\t\tTires Dealer Locator\n\t\t\t\tVendor Self Service Portal\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCompany Websites\n\t\t\t\t\tAutomotive\n\t\t\t\tContiTech\n\t\t\t\tTires\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTerms of Use\n\t\t\t\t\tContactSite NoticeLegal NoticeData Protection\n  \u00a9 2025 Continental AG\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

One thing that we\u2019re noticing is that collective contributions of these partners are foundational to our success as a company.\u201d\nMany of the AI projects driven by the top 10 Nvidia partners have successfully transitioned from proofs of concept to commercial deployments, according to Weinstein. But while the revenue partners brought in for Nvidia was one consideration for the Partner of the Year awards, the executive said the biggest impact came from their investments in product enablement, marketing, demand generation, software, hardware expertise and relationships with independent software developers.\n\u201cWhen you combine all that together in combination with the hardware and the software, what you\u2018re seeing is a full architectural approach from these NPN partners, and then they\u2019re able to deliver to those customers in those industries full-stack AI solutions that are ready for real-time deployment,\u201d he said.\nEliot Eshelman, an executive at Microway, one of the 2019 NPN winners, said Nvidia has become a key partner for the high-performance computing system integrator and that its GPUs along with its Mellanox interconnect technologies have become increasingly prevalent in deployments.\n\u201cWe\u2018re seeing a lot of interest and a lot of movement on Nvidia\u2019s products, in the DGX in particular,\u201d said Eshelman, referring to Nvidia\u2019s purpose-built DGX systems for deep learning workloads.\nEshelman said Nvidia\u2018s strengths aren\u2019t just in hardware but also in software as well as subject matter expertise across several areas.\n\u201cThey\u2018ve got PhDs that focused on particular applications or specific research avenues, but they also have a big software team,\u201d he said. \u201cSo for certainly all of the common deep learning applications and many of the common HPC applications, they offer pre-optimized containers. And that\u2019s another place where they\u2019re seeing success. When you buy into an Nvidia solution, you aren\u2019t just getting the hardware, you\u2019re getting software stack as well. You turn it on, and it\u2019s got all of that that optimized software from their [Nvidia GPU Cloud] hub.\u201d\nThe following are Nvidia\u2018s 2019 Nvidia Partner Network Partner of the Year award winners in the Americas, with descriptions provided by the company:\n\u2014 Booz Allen Hamilton (Leader: Horacio Rozanski, Headquarters: McLean, Virginia) \u2014 \u201cnamed Global Consulting Partner of the Year for an unmatched commitment to providing the U.S. federal government with AI consultation services.\u201d\n\u2014 CDW (Leader: Christine A. Leahy, Headquarters: Vernon Hills, Illinois) \u2014 \u201cnamed HPC Solution Provider Partner of the Year and vGPU Partner of the Year for its contributions in driving GPU solutions in several strategic industries.\u201d\n\u2014 CDW Canada (Leader: J.D. Hupp, Headquarters: Etobicoke, Ontario) \u2014 \u201cnamed Canada Partner of the Year for driving sales and broad adoption of data center and NVIDIA DGX systems across many key industries.\u201d\n\u2014 Future Tech Enterprise Inc (Leader: Bob Venero, Headquarters: Holbrook, New York) \u2014 \u201cnamed Professional Visualization Partner of the Year for the massive expansion of its NVIDIA Quadro business since joining the NPN in the beginning of 2019.\u201d\n\u2014 Government Acquisitions (Leader: Jay Lambke, Headquarters: Cincinnati, Ohio) \u2014 \u201cnamed Public Sector Partner of the Year for driving AI within the U.S. federal government through sales enablement, marketing and engineering.\u201d\n\u2014 Microway (Leader: Stephen Fried, Headquarters: Plymouth, Massachusetts) \u2014 \u201cnamed Higher Education Partner of the Year for providing support and delivery of NVIDIA GPU accelerated servers to higher education institutions throughout the Americas.\u201d\n\u2014 Penguin Computing (Leader: Sid Mair, Headquarters: Fremont, California) \u2014 \u201cnamed HPC Preferred OEM Partner of the Year for its successful deployment of large-scale hybrid NVIDIA GPU accelerated servers to large, high-profile customers.\u201d\n\u2014 SFL Scientific (Leader: Michael Segala, Headquarters: Quincy, Massachusetts) \u2014 \u201cnamed Service Delivery Partner of the Year for delivering AI consulting and development services to partners and customers, enabling development of new AI tools and solutions that use GPUs.\u201d\n\u2014 Thinkmate (Leader: Arthur Ataie, Headquarters: Waltham, Massachusetts) \u2014 \u201cnamed HPC Solution Integration Partner of the Year for several critical customer wins in the HPC market.\u201d\n\u2014 World Wide Technology (Leader: Jim Kavanaugh, Headquarters: Maryland Heights, Missouri) \u2014 \u201cnamed Deep Learning AI Partner of the Year for the significant investments it has made in AI research and development programs.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Executing on this program will mean students at schools across the state and nation \u2013 including K-12, state and local schools, HBCUs, and HSIs \u2013 won\u2019t be left behind in the AI-driven future. The U.S. must continue to invest in AI, and efforts such as this can help light the way.\u201d\n\nCongressman Jerry McNerny, California,\u00a0Congressman Pete Olson, Texas,\u00a0Co-Chairs, AI Caucus\n\n\n\n\n\nUF\u2019s National AI Leadership\nThe partnership will be central to UF\u2019s vision to be a national leader in the application of AI, including an expansive plan to elevate its reach and impact in research, teaching, and economic development. It provides a replicable framework for future public-private cooperation, and a model for addressing society\u2019s grand challenges through interdisciplinary collaboration. By deploying AI across the curriculum, this powerful resource will address major challenges such as rising seas, aging populations, data security, personalized medicine, urban transportation and food insecurity.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cUF\u2019s leadership has a bold vision for making artificial intelligence accessible across its campus,\u201d said Malachowsky, who serves as an NVIDIA Fellow. \u201cWhat really got NVIDIA and me excited was partnering with UF to go broader still, and make AI available to K-12 students, state and community colleges, and businesses. This will help address underrepresented communities and sectors across the region where the technology will have a profound positive effect.\u201d\n\n\n\nExtensive Collaboration with NVIDIA \nNVIDIA\u2019s technology powers two-thirds of the world\u2019s 500 fastest supercomputers, including eight of the top 10. The third-generation HiPerGator will have access to NVIDIA\u2019s most advanced AI software and integrate 140 NVIDIA DGX\u2122 A100 systems with 1,120 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs and high-performance NVIDIA Mellanox HDR 200Gb/s InfiniBand networking to deliver 700 petaflops of AI performance.\u00a0\n\u201cArtificial intelligence is the most powerful technology force of our time,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cFueled by data and machine learning, AI is advancing at an exponential pace, impacting every industry from healthcare to transportation to the sciences. Through their generosity and vision, Chris and UF are providing a mighty foundation for students and faculty to harness this technology and drive discovery.\u201d\nUF is the first institution of higher learning in the U.S. to receive DGX A100 systems, which are designed to accelerate diverse workloads, including AI training, inference, and data analytics.\nNVIDIA will also contribute its AI expertise to UF through ongoing support and collaboration across the following initiatives:\n\nThe\u00a0NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute\u00a0will collaborate with UF on developing new curriculum and coursework for both students and the community, including programming tuned to address the needs of young adults and teens to encourage their interest in STEM and AI, better preparing them for future educational and employment opportunities.\nUF will become the site of the latest NVIDIA AI Technology Center, where UF Graduate Fellows and NVIDIA employees will work together to advance AI.\u00a0\nNVIDIA solution architects and product engineers will partner with UF on the installation, operation and optimization of the NVIDIA-based supercomputing resources on campus, including the latest AI software applications.\u00a0\nEstablishing UF\u2019s Equitable AI program, led by Dr. Juan Gilbert, Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering. The effort is convening faculty members across the university to create standards and certifications in developing tools and solutions that are cognizant of bias, unethical practice and legal and moral issues.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the grand challenges that the scientific and engineering communities face become more complex, the need for artificial intelligence and machine learning to both advance scientific knowledge and manage an increasingly complex technological environment becomes more important. The University of Florida\u2019s new supercomputing facility is an important addition to the AI ecosystem and will provide academic researchers with much needed access to computing power that can advance artificial intelligence far into the future.\u00a0\n\u201cUnlike traditional high-performance computing systems, this academic supercomputer is specialized to leverage AI simulation and inference, which are important tools in accelerating research areas including drug discovery, astrophysics, and natural hazards modeling. By partnering with NVIDIA, the University of Florida is able to leverage this state-of-the-art technology and use it to enhance the education and training of the next generation of researchers, technicians, and leaders.\u00a0\n\u201cThis partnership can and should serve as a model of how universities, industry, and government can combine their respective strengths for the benefit of all. This will be vitally important in strengthening the U.S. supercomputing ecosystem, and by extension, U.S. economic competitiveness\"\u00a0\n\nHodan Omaar, Policy Analyst, Information Technology and Innovation Foundation\n\n\u201cComputing power is at the heart of Artificial Intelligence, and this investment in the fastest AI supercomputer in academia will ensure that the U.S. stays on the cutting edge of research and development. This system, combined with investments in curriculum and critical national, state, and local partnerships, is a model for building an AI economy for all Americans. As the Chair of the Congressional Semiconductor Caucus, I\u2019m glad that American semiconductor companies like NVIDIA are leading the charge.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWith Director Panchanathan now at the helm of the National Science Foundation, I look forward to seeing his vision for bringing AI supercomputing to other research centers such as the TACC in Austin, Texas.\u201d\u00a0\n\nCongressman Michael T. McCaul, Ranking Member of House Foreign Affairs Committee, Co-Chair, Semiconductor Caucus\n\n\n\n\nIntegrated AI Curriculum, Intelligent-Decision Support, Equitable Access\nAs a comprehensive institution, UF has a goal of bringing together students and faculty from across campus\u2014and across the state. It will be among the nation\u2019s first to integrate AI across all disciplines and make it a ubiquitous part of its academic enterprise. It will offer certificates and degree programs in AI and data science, with curriculum modules for specific technical and industry-focused domains. The initiative includes a commitment from UF to hire 100 more faculty members focused on AI. They will join 500 new faculty recently added across disciplines -- many of whom will weave AI into their teaching and research.\n\u201cMore than ever before in my lifetime, people around the country and the globe are looking to universities to expand access to higher education and technology and to level the field of opportunity for all,\u201d UF President Kent Fuchs said. \u201cUF intends to meet that challenge, and this partnership will help us do it.\u201d\nWithin UF Health, UF\u2019s robust academic health center, AI systems are being deployed to monitor patient conditions in real time, making it the first health system to use deep-learning technology to generate patient viability data. Through a novel system known as DeepSOFA, Dr. Azra Bihorac and her team use AI systems to collect and organize a patient\u2019s medical data so that doctors can make better-informed decisions. DeepSOFA is but one example of how AI technology will be put to use to bolster research and improve patient care at UF Health.\u00a0\nTo ensure no community is left behind, UF plans to promote wide accessibility to these computing capabilities and work with other institutions to develop a talent pipeline able to harness the power of AI through several initiatives. These include:\n\nCreating partnerships with industry and other academic groups, such as the Inclusive Engineering Consortium, whose students will work with members to conduct research and recruitment to UF graduate programs. The effort is led by HWCOE faculty member Dr. Damon Woodard. UF will also partner with these institutions to provide training in AI.\n\n\u201cThis initiative will allow us to recruit and equip a diverse, talented cadre of faculty and students across multiple disciplines and bring them together with colleagues from government and the private sector to find solutions to our most important problems,\u201d said Dr. Cammy Abernathy, dean of UF\u2019s Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering.\nUniversity officials expect today\u2019s announcement will spark additional excitement among others who have significant resources and abilities related to AI, and reaffirmed their commitment to serve as a catalyst for those who wish to step up and join in this amazing adventure.\n\n\n\n\nSteve Orlando/\nJuly 21, 2020\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\u00a0\nUniversity of Florida,Gainesville, FL 32611\nnews@ufl.edu\n3523920186\n\n\nNews Categories \n\nAgriculture + Environment\nArts + Media\nBusiness + Economics\nCampus + Community\nEducation\nGovernment + Society\nHealth + Science\n\n\n\nFor Faculty  \n\nFaculty Resources\nSenior Communicators\n\n\n\nFor Media\n\nContact\nSubscribe to News Releases\nUF Facts for Media\nUF Administration\nUF Directory\nHurricane Hub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2025\r\n                                  University of Florida\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nPrivacy Statement\n\n\nAcceptable Use Policy\n\n\nText Only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The property is marketed by the auction team at Knight Frank Singapore and is listed for sale by private treaty.  The strata\u2013detached house comes with a rooftop garden, a basement as well as two dedicated car park lots. According to Lock Sau Lai, manager at Knight Frank Singapore, each bedroom can fit in a king\u2013sized bed and comes with an en suite bathroom. The house also features a family area, a study area and a private outdoor jacuzzi.    Teresa Villas is a freehold cluster house development with eight strata houses (Picture: Albert Chua/The Edge Singapore) Lock says the owner bought the house when the developer launched it for sale. Based on URA caveats, the property was first purchased for $3.3 million ($436 psf) in November 2008. The house used to be fully occupied by the owner, his family and several relatives. \u201cBut the relatives have moved out and the owner feels that the house is too large for just his family of four,\u201d she says.  \u201cIt is rare to find a cluster house of this size on the resale market these days, especially in this particular neighbourhood. Even within the development, half of the cluster houses are smaller, 2\u00bd\u2013storey houses,\u201d says Lock. Teresa Villas is located within a quiet residential neighbourhood that comprises landed houses, some shophouses and flats, she adds. The house was first put up for sale in September last year but marketing efforts were dampened by the year\u2013end holidays and the \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d measures put in place in April, says Lock. However, the number of enquiries for this property has picked up recently following the Phase Two reopening, she says.    The three-storey home features a family area and a study area (Picture: Knight Frank Singapore) Lock continues: \u201cLanded homes are still the preferred choice of locals and new citizens. This particular cluster house provides the space they expect, and is reasonably priced compared to some landed houses in the nearby area.\u201d She expects this house to appeal to buyers looking for a sizeable family home. Families will also appreciate it because the property is centrally located and close to amenities like VivoCity shopping mall in HarbourFront and the eateries and shops located in the nearby Bukit Purmei and Telok Blangah estates. Also in the vicinity are Radin Mas Primary School, CHIJ (Kellock) and CHIJ St Theresa\u2019s Convent.

Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Ron DeSantis said. \u201cAs we look to keep our best talent \u00a0in state, this will be a significant carrot, you\u2019ll also see people around the country want to come to Florida.\u201d\n\nWorking closely with NVIDIA, UF will boost the capabilities of its existing supercomputer, HiPerGator, with the recently announced NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD architecture. The system will be up and running by early 2021, just a few weeks after it\u2019s delivered.\nThis gives faculty and students within and beyond UF the tools to apply AI across a multitude of areas to address major challenges such as rising seas, aging populations, data security, personalized medicine, urban transportation and food insecurity. UF expects to create 30,000 AI-enabled graduates by 2030.\n\u201cThe partnership here with the UF, the state of Florida, and NVIDIA, anchored by Chris\u2019 generous donation, goes beyond just money,\u201d said NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, who founded NVIDIA in 1993 along with Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. \u201cWe are excited to contribute NVIDIA\u2019s expertise to work together to make UF a national leader in AI and help address not only the region\u2019s, but the nation\u2019s challenges.\u201d\n\nUF, ranked seventh among public universities in the United States by US News & World Report and aiming to break into the top five, offers an extraordinarily broad range of disciplines, Malachowsky said.\nThe region is also a \u201cliving laboratory for some of society\u2019s biggest challenges,\u201d Malachowsky said.\nRegional, National AI Leadership\nThe effort aims to help define a research landscape to deal with the COVID-19, pandemic, which has seen supercomputers take a leading role.\n\u201cOur vision is to become the nation\u2019s first AI university,\u201d University of Florida President Kent Fuchs said. \u201cI am so grateful again to Mr. Malachowsky and NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang.\nState and regional leaders already look to the university to bring its capabilities to bear on an array of regional and national issues.\nAmong them: supporting agriculture in a time of climate change, addressing the needs of an aging population, and managing the effects of rising sea levels in a state with more than 1,300 miles of coastline.\nAnd to ensure no community is left behind, UF plans to promote wide accessibility to these computing capabilities.\nAs part of this, UF will:\n\nEstablish UF\u2019s Equitable AI program, to bring faculty members across the university together to create standards and certifications for developing tools and solutions that are cognizant of bias, unethical practice and legal and moral issues.\nPartner with industry and other academic groups, such as the Inclusive Engineering Consortium, whose students will work with members to conduct research and recruitment to UF graduate programs.\n\nBroad Range of AI Initiatives\nMalachowsky has served in a number of leadership roles as NVIDIA has grown from a startup to the global leader in visual and parallel computing. A recognized authority on integrated-circuit design and methodology, he has authored close to 40 patents.\nIn addition to holding a BSEE from the University of Florida, he has an MSCS from Santa Clara University. He has been named a distinguished alumni of both universities, in addition to being inducted last year into the Florida Inventors Hall of Fame.\nUF is the first institution of higher learning in the U.S. to receive NVIDIA DGX A100 systems. These systems are based on the modular architecture of the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, which enables the rapid deployment and scaling of massive AI infrastructure.\nUF\u2019s HiPerGator 3 supercomputer will integrate 140 NVIDIA DGX A100 systems powered by a combined 1,120 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. It will include 4 petabytes of high-performance storage. An NVIDIA Mellanox HDR 200Gb/s InfiniBand network will provide the high throughput and extremely low-latency network connectivity.\nDGX A100 systems are built to make the most of these capabilities as a single software-defined platform. NVIDIA DGX systems are already used by eight of the ten top US national universities.\nThat platform includes the most advanced suite of AI application frameworks in the world. It\u2019s a software suite that covers data analytics, AI training and inference acceleration, and recommendation systems. Its multi-modal capabilities combine sound, vision, speech and a contextual understanding of the world around us.\nTogether, these tools have already had a significant impact on healthcare, transportation, science, interactive appliances, the internet and other areas.\nMore Than Just a Machine\nFriday\u2019s announcement, however, goes beyond any single, if singular, machine.\nNVIDIA will also contribute its AI expertise to UF through ongoing support and collaboration across the following initiatives:\n\nThe NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute will collaborate with UF on developing new curriculum and coursework for both students and the community, including programing tuned to address the needs of young adults and teens to encourage their interest in STEM and AI, better preparing them for future educational and employment opportunities.\nUF will become the site of the latest NVIDIA AI Technology Center, where UF Graduate Fellows and NVIDIA employees will work together to advance AI.\nNVIDIA solution architects and product engineers will partner with UF on the installation, operation and optimization of the NVIDIA-based supercomputing resources on campus, including the latest AI software applications.\n\nUF will also make investments all around its new machine, well beyond the $20 million targeted at upgrading their data center.\nCollectively, all of the data sciences-related activities and programs \u2014 and UF\u2019s new supercomputer \u2014 will support the university\u2019s broader AI-related aspirations.\nTo support that effort, the university has committed to fill 100 new faculty positions in AI and related fields, making it one of the top AI universities in the country.\nThat\u2019s in addition to the 500 recently hired faculty across disciplines, many of whom will weave AI into their teaching and research.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been thrilling to watch all this,\u201d Malachowsky said. \u201cIt provides a blueprint for how other states can work with their region\u2019s resources to make similar investments that bring their residents the benefits of AI, while bolstering our nation\u2019s competitiveness, capabilities and expertise.\u201d\nBroad Support\nThe announcement drew broad support from lawmakers, policymakers and leaders in higher education across the state and the nation.\nIn a statement, U.S. Reps. Jay McNerney, D-Calif., and Pete Olson, R-Texas, co-chairs of the Congressional AI Caucus, said: \u201cExecuting on this program will mean students at schools across the state and nation \u2014 including K-12, state and local schools, HBCUs, and HSIs \u2014 won\u2019t be left behind in the AI-driven future.\u201d\n\u201cBy partnering with NVIDIA, the University of Florida is able to leverage this state-of-the-art technology and use it to enhance the education and training of the next generation of researchers, technicians, and leaders,\u201d said Hodan Omaar, a policy analyst at the Center for Data Innovation. \u201cThis partnership can and should serve as a model of how universities, industry, and government can combine their respective strengths for the benefit of all.\u201d\n\u201cComputing power is at the heart of artificial intelligence, and this investment in the fastest AI supercomputer in academia will ensure that the U.S. stays on the cutting edge of research and development,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, ranking member of House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cThis system \u2026 is a model for building an AI economy for all Americans.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Data Center | Deep Learning | SupercomputingTags: Education | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | NVIDIA DGX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

DBS Bank and Gojek on 15 July announced that more than 1.7 million DBS PayLah! users can now book and pay for their Gojek rides directly through the PayLah! platform. The move will provide more convenient access to transport services and boost the adoption of digital payments.   gojek   Users can now book and pay for their Gojek rides directly and seamlessly on DBS PayLah! and receive curated offers from other PayLah! merchants at the same time The integration of Gojek\u2019s services into the DBS PayLah! platform deepens the strategic partnership between the two companies, which was inked in 2018 at the time of Gojek\u2019s launch in Singapore, where all five million DBS/POSB customers enjoyed exclusive early access to Gojek\u2019s services.  It follows the successful rollout last year of DBS PayLah! as a default in-app payment option in the Gojek app, which enables users \u2013 who may not own a debit or credit card and need an alternative to cash payments \u2013 to enjoy the convenience of digital payments and greater peace-of-mind from not having to manage physical money. More than 100,000 Gojek rides were booked by PayLah! users in the first month of the launch \u201cConsumers can fully appreciate the importance of digital payment options especially as we recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, with personal hygiene and safety now being prioritised highly. This is evident from the exponential increase witnessed in the adoption of our digital banking and payments services,\u201d said Shee Tse Koon, DBS Singapore Country Head. \u201cRide-hailing is among one of the most frequently used services by our DBS PayLah! users. Allowing them to now conveniently book and pay for their Gojek rides via PayLah! further enhances their user experience as there\u2019s no need to toggle between apps. The integration also enables us to better engage PayLah! users via our large range of services and personalised offers curated just for them, to help serve their everyday needs.\u201d  The adoption of digital payments for ride-hailing continues to grow, with Gojek\u2019s daily ride-hailing transactions paid for in cash dropping from 35% to 30% from mid-2019 to mid-2020. According to Gojek, education institutions are common destinations among commuters who continue to choose to pay for their rides in cash. \u201cThese commuters are likely tertiary students who receive their monthly allowance from their parents in cash,\u201d explained Shee. \u201cWe are working with several tertiary education institutions on a financial literacy curriculum, where we teach students financial planning concepts and fundamentals of digital payments via our NAV Planner. This has helped, and will continue to help, shift the traditional cash-based approach so that more students can make use of digital payments.\u201d   Story continues Lien Choong Luen, General Manager of Gojek Singapore, added: \u201cThe integration of a Gojek tile in the DBS PayLah! app is timely and benefits users of both PayLah! and Gojek. Not only will it facilitate more convenient access to our ride-hailing service, it also strengthens the use of cashless payments among our commuters, which is key as we adapt to a new way of living where hygiene, health and safety have become paramount. To create a safer ride environment, we have been encouraging customers to use contactless payments and providing complimentary car sanitisation services to driver-partners. We look forward to working with DBS \u2013 which has been a valued strategic partner \u2013 to find new ways to support and delight our users.\u201dIn April, DBS and Gojek collaborated on several initiatives to extend support to Gojek\u2019s driver-partners and the wider community in Singapore. They include:A three-part financial planning webinar series by DBS for Gojek driver-partners, which covered topics such as managing one\u2019s personal finances and how to plan for your children\u2019s education needs. Enabling the instant transfer of earnings support funds to Gojek\u2019s driver-partners during the circuit breaker period, for which DBS waived all payment processing fees as goodwill. Delivering care packs to 2,000 households in Singapore under the \u201cPAssion CARES for You\u201d initiative, as food ration deliveries to vulnerable households by volunteers were affected in view of restrictions imposed during the circuit breaker period. To commemorate the launch of the new integration, the first 20,000 customers who book a Gojek ride through DBS PayLah! between 13 July and 31 August can redeem a cash rebate of SGD 3. DBS will also offer Gojek riders personalised offers or rebates curated from DBS PayLah! partners such as Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, Gong Cha and Foodpanda.Mr Paul Ho, chief officer at iCompareLoan, said, \u201cride hailing and food-hailing apps are especially useful in a crisis like this.\u201dThe post Gojek integrates with DBS Paylah! platform to expand access appeared first on iCompareLoan Resources.

July 2020 06:30Igor Wallossek\n\n\n\n\nBefore I act as a (future) painter and create a possible package including the dimensions known so far, we should review the rumors and leaks of the last days. Let\u2019s take the usually well-informed Kopite7kimi at the word leak, who mentioned a tape-out of the GA102 chip on Samsung and not TSMC on Twitter. This means that a launch as early as 2020 is more than likely, especially since various activities were already taking place in the background, which also affected the respective board partners. The Base-Design-Kit for the boards and the Thermal Design Guide for the boards with the GA 102 are said to have already been distributed diligently.\n\n\u201cNO TEU. GA102 has taped out. It was based on SAMSUNG 10nm. And the new tegra will use the same process node\n\nIf this time it should be Samsung instead of TSMC, Nvidia might have gambled a little too heavily with TSMC when it came to the price negotiations for the 7 nm production (the GA102) and Samsung was used as an argument for a possible price reduction. Or else Nvidia generally views the whole thing from an economic point of view and initially uses the much cheaper 8 nm node from Samsung, which is actually an improved 10 nm node. Thus, there would still be a full node jump between what Samsung offers and what was previously manufactured at TSMC in 12 nm for Nvidia.\n\nConsidering the economics, an even larger chip in Samsung\u2019s 8 nm node is unlikely to make much economic sense anyway. This makes all the data on the GA102 and the other branches that have been circulated so far sound plausible. I would also like to point out once again that the nodes cannot really be compared with each other.\u00a0 Samsung\u2019s 8 nm node is actually closer to the 10 nm than to the 7 nm, especially since the fin pitch between 10 and 8 nm remains comparable and only the gate pitch has been reduced by 6 percent.\nThe possible package as graphic\nAnd now my small, highly speculative work of art comes into play, which is based on circulated dimensions and is quite in line with my extrapolation at the time. If the latest information is correct, the edge lengths of the chip would result in a chip area of 627.12 mm\u00b2. Assuming that the process of Samsung compared to the old node, the same number of transistors to about 40% of the area, then the extrapolation already made of approx. 6000 to 6100 shaders for the full expansion with this chip size quite realistic. Of course, the number of shaders also refers to their complexity, and nobody can yet say what the ratio of CUDA to RT and especially Tensor cores will be.\n\nSeparate power supply should come\nI had already speculated that from a more efficient operation point of view it would be necessary to decouple the power supply of the CUDA cores from the RT and Tensor cores externally and not to solve this in the GPU via different paths. This would create additional space and increase efficiency. With NVDD and MSVDD (\u201cmiscellaneous\u201d), even this small problem would then be elegantly solved. Especially since the share of MSVDD is supposed to be much higher than that of VDDCI for AMD cards. And what about the already extrapolated 230 watts, which should be delivered to the GPU?\nI think that 60 to 70 watts is the minimum that can be used for the additional arithmetic-logic units in the GA102 full configuration, and if the whole thing is decoupled from the CUDA cores, then the power supply can be made a little simpler there as well. In a previous calculation I had used 16 voltage converter circuits for pure GPU power at 230 watts. In addition, up to 4 additional control loops would be required for the memory, at least with a full 24 GB configuration.\nOf course, you can use the calculator and data sheet to make an estimate of how the possible distribution of the GPU voltages could look like. With a bit of imagination (and luck in guessing), you could set the supply of the shaders with up to 10 phases, whereby each phase would then only address one power stage. The remaining up to 6 phases were then allocated to another partial voltage with the same power stage distribution.\n\nIf you calculate this further, the shaders would only have a maximum of 160 to 170 watts, which would make the ratio between Turing and ampere more realistic again. In the case of notebooks, for example, Dynamic Boost is used, where the power distribution is shifted as required in order to remain within the thermal and power limits. A smart balancing between the possible two partial voltages, where the tensor and RT cores would be weighted at least equally, would actually be only logical.\nThat should be it for today, because we do not want to speculate so much. Just a little. But at least a grain of salt will probably be on it, as always, which then also tastes a little like truth.

The report comes from Ithome who has reported that not only are the majority of the high-end GeForce RTX 20 series graphics cards being discontinued but will soon be delisted by major vendors as they prep up for NVIDIA's next-generation gaming lineup.\nNVIDIA Ends GeForce RTX 20 'Turing' Series Production To Make Room For GeForce RTX 30 'Ampere' Gaming Graphics Cards\nAs per the report, NVIDIA will be ending production of its high-end GeForce RTX 20 series lineup which includes the following graphics cards:\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\nGeForce RTX 2080 Ti\nGeForce RTX 2080 SUPER\nGeForce RTX 2070 SUPER\nGeForce RTX 2070\n\nAll four graphics cards listed are part of NVIDIA's high-end and ultra-enthusiast segment. All cards utilize different Turing GPU, we get the TU102 on the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, the TU104 on GeForce RTX 2080 & RTX 2070 SUPER and the TU106 GPU on the GeForce RTX 2070. The report also claims that not only would the production be halted on these four graphics cards but they will also be de-listed by major vendors including NVIDIA themselves in the coming months.\nIt is additionally reported that ending production on GeForce RTX 20 series graphics cards will lead to severe shortages in the coming weeks due to a rising demand in the mining segment which has started to revive in recent months. This could lead to the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER & RTX 2080 Ti graphics cards to be out of stock much sooner than expected.\n\nThis could be a good thing for next-generation Ampere cards in terms of pricing. During the last generation, large quantities of NVIDIA Pascal GPUs were prepped due to the mining craze and several OEMs and retailers had to price hike the initial Turing cards to clear away inventory of older cards. If the Turing inventory is non-existent at Ampere's launch, then retailers would focus on the new cards and pricing them according to the MSRP suggested by NVIDIA rather than inflating them to sell and clear away older GPUs.\nHowever, at the same time, those who are looking to get a Turing graphics card right now will be disappointed by the fact that a price hike on the GeForce RTX 20 series is being talked around by several retailers across the globe. That and with the resurgence of the mining craze is going to end up inflating prices on all existing high-end cards. The price hike is suggested to occur this month & My drivers report that even the mainstream GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER & the GeForce RTX 2060 will be affected. It is stated that NVIDIA has internally notified its AIB partners to adjust prices with the demand accordingly.\n\nThis more or less proves that while the current inventory is cleared up, we can expect the prices of Ampere based Gaming graphics cards to be much better at launch in the retail segment compared to what we saw the last generation.

Through July 29, buying any GeForce RTX 20-series graphics card from a participating retailer will get you a free copy of Death Stranding, Nvidia announced on Thursday. GeForce RTX-powered gaming laptops and desktops are also eligible.\nDeath Stranding launched as a high-profile PlayStation exclusive last year, as the first game from Metal Gear guru Hideo Kojima\u2019s new studio after his departure from Konami. It\u2019s launching on Windows on July 14, and the PC version supports Nvidia\u2019s fantastic DLSS 2.0 technology, which can greatly enhance a game\u2019s frame rates with minimal to no impact on visual quality. \u201cWith DLSS 2.0\u00a0all RTX GPUs\u00a0will give the game a significant performance boost, enabling\u00a0100+ FPS at 1440p or a smooth 60+ FPS at 4K,\u201d Nvidia\u2019s press release states.\n\nThe free copy comes in the form of a Steam code.\n[ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ]\n\n\n \n\n\nNvidia released a new Game Ready 451.67 driver today to support Death Stranding\u2019s release, as well as Horizon Zero Dawn (another high-profile PlayStation exclusive coming to the PC) and F1 2020.\n\n\n\nThe new driver also adds support for three new G-Sync Compatible monitors: Dell\u2019s S2721HGF and S2721DGF, and Lenovo\u2019s G25-10. \u201cG-Sync Compatible\u201d is Nvidia\u2019s marketing term for Adaptive Sync (read: FreeSync) monitors that pass a stricter Nvidia certification process. Official G-Sync Compatible displays automatically have their variable refresh rate capabilities turned on by the drivers, rather than\u00a0requiring a Control Panel workaround like other FreeSync monitors. When you hook one up to a GeForce graphics card, a G-Sync Compatible display just works.\nGame Ready driver 451.67 should already be available to download via GeForce Experience, or you can download it directly from Nvidia\u2019s website.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Take the 2016 \u201cMannequin Challenge\u201d viral video trend as an example: people remain frozen while a camera passes through them to capture the scene. Viewers would naturally be confused if the camera view returned to a previously captured person but their face appeared totally different \u2014 as if they were wearing a magically transformative mask.This phenomenon has plagued vid2vid methods that generate video frames based only the information available in the immediately preceding frame(s). For AI researchers, achieving vid2vid temporal consistency over the entire rendered 3D world is a challenge. A team of NVIDIA researchers addresses the problem in the paper World-Consistent Video-to-Video Synthesis, which proposes a novel vid2vid framework that utilizes all past generated frames during rendering.Synthesis results using a 2018 vid2vid methodSynthesis results using the NVIDIA team\u2019s vid2vid frameworkThe researchers say that although current vid2vid models have enhanced the generation results in terms of photorealism and short-term temporal stability, methods for generating videos with long-term temporal consistency have lagged. In practical terms, the issue can be problematic for example when a car dash camera revisits a location in a virtual city. Despite using the same semantic inputs, existing vid2vid methods could synthesize a scene that is different from what they generated when the car first visited the location. \u201cThis is because they lack knowledge of the 3D world being rendered and generate each frame only based on the past few frames,\u201d the researchers explain.The team introduces the concept of guidance images: \u201cphysically-grounded estimates of what the next output frame should look like, based on how the world has been generated so far.\u201d Using a series of images captured with known camera positions and parameters, an output image can be generated for a particular viewpoint. This output image is then back-projected to the scene and a guidance image for the following camera position is created to help generate an output that is consistent across views and smooth over time.Inconsistent output using 2018 vid2vid methodAt the centre of the generator network is the novel multi-SPADE ( SPatially-Adaptive (DE)normalization) module, which includes multiple SPADE operations and uses input labels, warped previous frames and guidance images to modulate the features in each layer of the generator.The researchers trained and evaluated their method on three datasets \u2014 Cityscapes, MannequinChallenge, and ScanNet. Both quantitative and visual results showed the effectiveness of new synthesis architecture in achieving world consistency. \u201cThe output video is consistent within the entire rendered 3D world,\u201d the researchers conclude.The team says the new approach could be suitable for applications such as rendering scenes in game engines and enabling simultaneous multi-agent world creation and exploration.The paper World-Consistent Video-to-Video Synthesis is available on GitHub.Journalist: Fangyu Cai | Editor: Michael SarazenSynced Report | A Survey of China\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Solutions in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic\u200a\u2014\u200a87 Case Studies from 700+ AI VendorsThis report offers a look at how the Chinese government and business owners have leveraged artificial intelligence technologies in the battle against COVID-19.

It's by far the most feature complete set top box running Android TV, due in no small part to the company's tireless efforts to fill in the gaps where Google has fallen short with its own operating system.That having been said, the Shield TV is starting to show its age. Much of the competition has caught up to what were once state of the art features, and a hardware profile that is frankly a little on the bulky side in 2019. Knowing that, the new Shield TV is here, complete with a new hardware design and significantly updated upscaling and HDR capabilities.Nvidia Shield TV (2019) (HDR Black) at Amazon for $149.99Well, sort of. It's complicated.NVIDIA Shield TV What I loveAt its core, this new NVIDIA Shield TV is everything I already loved about the best Android TV box ever sold but in more convenient packaging. As useful as the original was for so many enthusiast users, with all of its ports for adding hard drives and keyboards and cameras, I never really used any of it. And I'm pretty far from the only one who viewed those extras as largely unnecessary for my personal use, which is why NVIDIA now has this streamlined version of the Shield TV for the rest of us and the Pro version with all the ports for the folks who want to play around and have some fun.NVIDIA had the opportunity here to make yet another dongle that hung off the back of the TV, but it didn't. In fact, NVIDIA made it clear it wanted to avoid that design altogether to avoid issues with WiFi interference. So instead of a dongle we get a cylinder and a long power cord with no wall wart adapter. The power supply is contained within the cylinder, and all you really need to do is connect an HDMI cable. There are no lights, no sounds, just a plain cylinder you can place wherever you like. The only bit of extra going on is the microSD slot just in case you have local media you want to play or the onboard 8GB of storage isn't enough for your apps. And honestly, I love that. I don't need to display my streaming box, I just need it to work.Image 1 of 2As much as I appreciate the new design for the console itself, the real joy here is in the updated controller. Gone is the slim, glossy remote with too few buttons and a complicated to replace battery. Instead, NVIDIA has designed something with some real presence. It's a triangular wand with dedicated buttons for rewind, pause, volume, a great big Netflix button and a button you can customize to do whatever you want. The keys on the remote light up when it detects motion, and runs on a pair of AAA batteries NVIDIA says will last up to six months. The remote still does voice commands just like its predecessor, and now includes IR controls so you can use it to adjust the volume and power on your TV with just this one remote. Put simply, this is a solid remote, easily the best included with any streaming box I have ever used.Top 5 things you should know about the new NVIDIA Shield TV (2019)NVIDIA's AI-based enhancement mode genuinely works wonders on everything you can use it on.While there doesn't seem to be any grand revelations in the software if you've used Android TV recently, the truth is there's quite a bit going on under the hood. Google Assistant is more tightly integrated, delivering the same level of content from your Google Account you'd get from a dedicated Assistant display like a Nest Hub. The main UI pulls offerings from your favorite streaming services and makes it easy to see things you can watch or play without diving into individual apps. Once you're in those individual apps, however, it's a fairly standard Android TV experience. The only real difference is the dedicated media control buttons on the remote, which make things like fast forward much simpler and faster to access than just about every other Android TV box.The biggest standalone feature here, however, is the way NVIDIA has enhanced every streaming app to make the visuals that much more appealing. NVidia has offered upscaling features in the past, but the added power of the new X1+ processor means the company can start pushing the envelope a little. If you choose to enable it, NVIDIA has an AI-based enhancement mode that genuinely works wonders on everything you use it on. The software analyzes content in the foreground of your stream and applies intelligent sharpening where it makes the most sense to do so. Details like hair and fabric and facial features immediately become sharper and look much nicer, especially on 4K sets. This feature has its limitations, the largest of which being it only works with 30FPS 1080p content at the moment. But because it's a system-level function and not something developers have to opt-in to use in their apps, there's a ton of content available to play with.NVIDIA Shield TV What could be betterWhile I totally get the cylinder design decision, and I think being able to position the console in a way that maximize wifi connectivity for things like game streaming and 4K content, I feel weird setting this thing on the ground. It's not passively cooled, there's a small fan in this cylinder keeping everything running, and that means laying it on the floor puts it that much closer to dust and debris from my living room. Pet hair, for example, collects behind my entertainment center in ways that make me worry I'm going to break this console long term. I may make some sort of mount for this so it connects to the side of my entertainment center instead of laying on the floor or on a shelf, and it's a little awkward for NVIDIA to give me a craft project instead of including something in the box.On the subject of things included in the box, NVIDIA gives you the console and the remote and the power cord and that's it. There's no HDMI cable, no real instruction manual, and it's not immediately clear how to access the batteries in the remote. The packaging is extremely minimalist, which considering this is designed for the less gadget-hungry and more novice techy among NVIDIA's audience is a little frustrating.One feature NVIDIA included in its remote that I haven't talked about yet is the location command for it. And the reason I haven't brought it up is I'm not going to use it, at least not in its current configuration. If you have a Shield TV Gamepad or the Shield TV app installed, you can use one of these to ping the remote and have it beep to find it. But if I have one of those to things at hand already, I don't really need the remote for whatever it is I am doing. What I would really prefer is a Google Assistant instruction to find it. NVIDIA says it's working on one, however, so this might be a short-lived complaint. And If I'm honest, the updated design of the remote makes it considerably more difficult to lose in the couch anyway.NVIDIA Shield TV: Should you buy it? Hell yesWe've been asking for a refresh to the Shield TV for a while now, and what NVIDIA delivered is frankly not what I expected. This simpler, more polished experience is fantastic on nearly every level, and doesn't deviate terribly from the things we already enjoyed about this system. And for its price, the new console checks a lot of boxes. If you want a dead simple streaming box that occasionally includes some fun gaming to it as well, this is without a doubt the box for you. And if you have been waiting to upgrade to a new Shield TV from the original, this and the more capable Pro variant are the only real options to consider.4.5 out of 5 Bottom line? NVIDIA nailed this refresh, and it's going to make a lot of current and future Android TV users very happy.\n\n\n\nStreaming Heavyweight\nNVIDIA Shield TV 2019\n\n\n $149.99 at Amazon $149.99 at Best Buy $149.99 at Newegg\nBottom line: Everything you need to have a great streaming and gaming experience, in a handy tube you can hide pretty much anywhere.\n\n\nNvidia Shield TV (2019): Price Comparison $149.99View $149.99View $149.99ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \n\n\nRussell HollySocial Links NavigationRussell is a Contributing Editor at Android Central.

Those buying a GeForce GTX 1650 GDDR6 graphics card could also end up with some surprises if they don't look closely at the the manufacturer's specifications.First, a little history. The original GeForce GTX 1650 debuted last year with Nvidia's TU117 silicon and GDDR5 memory. Almost a year later, Nvidia upgraded the GeForce GTX 1650 to GDDR6 memory while preserving the same TU117 silicon.\u00a0Recent evidence pointed to the GeForce GTX 1650 GDDR6 undergoing further surgery, with Nvidia repurposing its TU116 and TU106 dies for the graphics card. Today, hardware detective @momomo_us discovered that Nvidia has updated the GeForce GTX 1650 GDDR6's product page to reflect the new variants. While the specifications remain unchanged and performance should too, the die dictate the version of Nvidia's NVENC encoder.One of the biggest gripes about the GeForce GTX 1650 is that, despite being a Turing graphics card, it came with the old Volta encoder. The GeForce GTX 1650 GDDR6's product page details that the TU117 model still comes with the Volta encoder, and the TU106 and TU116 variants use the more recent Turing encoder. Therefore, concerned buyers should consult with the manufacturer for information on which die their graphics card is using.Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 SpecificationsSwipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 GeForce GTX 1650 TU106GeForce GTX 1650 TU116GeForce GTX 1650 GDDR6GeForce GTX 1650GPU ArchitectureTuring (TU106)Turing (TU116)Turing (TU117)Turing (TU117)NVENC EncoderTuringTuringVoltaVoltaShading Units896896896896Texture Units56565656ROPs32323232Base Clock Rate1,410 MHz1,410 MHz1,410 MHz1,485 MHzBoost Clock Rate1,590 MHz1,590 MHz1,590 MHz1,665 MHzMemory Clock12 Gbps12 Gbps12 Gbps8 GbpsMemory Capacity4GB GDDR64GB GDDR64GB GDDR64GB GDDR5Memory Bus128-bit128-bit128-bit128-bitMemory Bandwidth192 GBps192 GBps192 GBps128 GBpsL2 Cache1MB1MB1MB1MBTDP75W75W75W75WTransistor Count10.8 billion6.6 billion4.7 billion4.7 billionDie Size445 mm\u00b2284 mm\u00b2200 mm\u00b2200 mm\u00b2Nvidia said via Twitter that the Volta encoder performs similarly to the Pascal encoder, so quality is comparable. The Turing encoder, however, is up to 15% more efficient and comes with features that aren't present in the previous encoder.Graphics card vendors don't typically specify the die that's employed in the graphics card. However, they should indicate if the GeForce GTX 1650 GDDR6 has the Turing encoder. For example, Gigabyte does so with the GeForce GTX 1650 D6 WindForce OC 4G (rev. 2.0).So, there you have it. Not every GeForce GTX 1650 GDDR6 is cut from the same cloth.

That's pretty much the opposite of a bait and switch. Lots of products see improved revisions over time, and it's not like the existing cards are being advertised as having the better hardware. Anyone making a lawsuit would likely be much better off focusing on products that have clearly been downgraded from the original version.

Designed primarily for AI training and inference workloads, the chip is twenty times more powerful than its predecessor, the Volta GPU. The A100 Ampere chip is also the largest chip built by Nvidia and consists of 54 billion transistors.\nThe chip was built using Nvidia\u2019s third-generation tensor cores. The new GPU also uses multi-instance gpu (MIG) technology. MIG allows one A100 chip to be partitioned into seven small independent GPUs with dedicated system resources to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. In addition, Nvidia\u2019s NVLink interconnect technology allows multiple A100 chips to be connected to train large AI workloads.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle uses this possibility to connect multiple chips. The new instance series also includes an a2-megagpu-16g option that allows customers to use 16 A100 GPUs simultaneously, with a combined CPU memory of 640 gigabytes and 13 terabytes of system memory. It also provides an aggregate bandwidth of 9.6 terabytes per second.\n\nThe A100 GPU is also available in small configurations for customers with smaller workloads. According to Nvidia, the A100 GPU will soon also be available for Kubernetes and Google Cloud\u2018s AI platform.\n\n\n\nTags:\nA100 / Ampere Computing / Chips / Google Cloud / GPU / Kubernetes / Nvidia \n\n\n\n\n\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n\nStay tuned, subscribe!\nE-mailadres*\n\nNieuwsbrieven*\n\nMorning Bytes\n\n\nWeekly Advisor\nEmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nRelated                                \n\n\n\nWhat are Google\u2019s plans for cloud security provider Wiz?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtos expands Google Cloud services with managed security\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Cloud makes digital signatures quantum-safe in KMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Cloud now offers Nvidia Blackwell-supported instances\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor picks    \n\n\n\nAtos under pressure: what does the French rescue mean?\n\nBenelux operations show remarkable resilience\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenAI introduces Responses API for building AI agents\n\n\nOpenAI has launched a new set of APIs and tools, making it easier for...\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is Lip-Bu Tan, the new Intel CEO?\n\nChange is afoot at Chipzilla\n\n\n\n\n\nOracle launches Java 24 with enhanced AI support and post-quantum cryptography\n\nSecurity and AI take center stage in Java 24\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight: Generative AI\n\n\n\n\nHow do you innovate for a future you can\u2019t entirely predict?\n\nFinding the use-cases for (Gen)AI and automation\n\n\n\n\n\nMinIO blueprints exascale AI data infrastructure\u00a0\n\n\nOpen source object storage company MinIO has popped open DataPod, a r...\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDevin is the first AI software engineer: should developers be worried?\n\n\nThe startup Cognition AI has developed a chatbot that uses generative...\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHow do you roll out GenAI in enterprise environments?\n\n\nIBM claims that watsonx provides the building blocks for successfully...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more on Infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEuropean chip industry pressured by rising emissions\n\n\nThe chip industry's energy consumption more than doubled in eight years.

And to celebrate it being one of a handful of playable DLSS games, Nvidia are bundling the game in for free with all RTX card purchases made between now and July 29th.\n\nThe offer applies to all RTX graphics cards, as well as gaming laptops and gaming desktops with an RTX card inside them, too, giving you a choice of everything from the \u00a3285 / $295 RTX 2060 all the way up to the \u00a31000 / $1000+ RTX 2080 Ti. You'll have until August 31st to redeem your free game code, although naturally even if you buy an RTX card today and get it before Death Stranding launches on Tuesday, July 14th, you'll have to wait until the game comes out before you can start playing. \nFrom my own initial tests, even an RTX 2060 can hit a smooth 60fps at 4K with DLSS 2.0 turned on at max settings, so it's not like you're going to need to spend mega money in order to make the most of your free game. \nLooking at the current graphics card landscape more broadly, I'd still recommend an RTX 2060 for anyone looking for a decent graphics card for playing games at 2560x1440 (even if AMD's Radeon RX 5600 XT is technically my number one best graphics card choice due to it being cheaper and just as powerful). The RTX 2060 is perfectly capable of hitting 60fps in most of today's best PC games on High graphics settings at 1440p, and is more than powerful enough for playing games at 60fps+ at 1080p as well. \nIf you want to be absolutely sure you're going to hit a steady 60fps on Ultra settings at 1440p, however, then I'd recommend moving up to an RTX 2070 or RTX 2070 Super. At the moment, prices for the RTX 2070 Super are much higher than normal, making it a bad deal right now. Instead, you'll get a lot more for your money with a regular RTX 2070, and you can find all the lowest prices in our regularly updated graphics card deals hub. Plus, you can see exactly how both graphics cards compare in my RTX 2070 vs RTX 2070 Super benchmark comparison.\nI should also point out that Nvidia will be releasing their next generation of Nvidia Ampere RTX 3000 graphics cards at some point this year as well, so you may just want to put off buying a graphics card altogether and wait for the new ones. As I said at the start, Death Stranding doesn't really need an RTX card to make the most of it. The game doesn't have any ray tracing support, for example, so it's only Nvidia's upscaling DLSS 2.0 tech that you'll get any benefit from. And besides, even a GTX 1060 can run the game perfectly well on max settings at 1080p according to my own performance tests, so I wouldn't say there's really any pressing need to take the plunge on an RTX card now if you're keen to play Kojima's bonkers post-apocalyptic postman simulator. \nInstead, I'm much more tempted by AMD's current free game offer, which gets you a free copy of Assassin's Creed Valhalla when you buy any Ryzen 7 or Ryzen 9 CPU from now until October 3rd. \n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            505 Games parent Digital Bros lays off 30% of staff due to fears that players don't want new IP\n          \n\n\n\n            Death Stranding is leaving Game Pass, while A Short Hike and Limbo join\n          \n\n\n\n            Death Stranding is currently free to keep from the Epic Games Store\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nKatharine Castle: Katharine was RPS' editor-in-chief from 2021 to 2024.

We've seen NVIDIA and AMD actively building next-generation GPUs specifically with AI and HPC in mind but it looks like competition has arrived from British AI chip designer, Graphcore, who has unveiled its second-generation chip for AI which directly competes against NVIDIA's A100 Tensor Core GPU accelerator.\nGraphcore's GC200 Is A Massive 7nm Chip For AI Tasks Which Is Designed To Compete Against NVIDIA's A100 GPU - IPU Delivers Up To 250 Teraflops of AI Compute\nFor this purpose, Graphcore has announced its new Colossus MK2 GC200 IPU or an Intelligence Processing Unit which is designed exclusively to power machine intelligence. Just like its name, the chip itself features a colossus design and delivers an 8x performance bump over its predecessor, the MK1.\nRelated Story Microsoft Partners With Graphcore to Power AI Applications in Azure Cloud\u201cWe\u2019re 100% focused on silicon processors for AI, and on building systems that can plug into existing centers. Why would we want to build CPUs or GPUs if those already work well? This is just a different toolbox.\u201d via Graphcore's CEO, Nigel Toon\n\nThe Colossus MK2 GC200 is fabricated on TSMC's 7nm process node and features a die size of 823 mm2. For comparison, that's almost as big as the NVIDIA A100 GPU accelerator which measures at 826mm2. The chip is not only a behemoth in terms of size but also in terms of density with a total of 59.4 Billion transistors onboard compared to 54.2 Billion transistors on the NVIDIA A100 GPU. It shows a higher density on the Graphcore chip than NVIDIA's flagship chip accelerator.\nTo make the GC200 work, it is configured with 1472 IPU titles, each with an IPU core & In-processor memory. Each IPU core has 6 threads executing in parallel which put the total number of threads in the chip at 8832 (1472 cores / serial processor). For memory, the chip makes use of an on-die solution which offers 900 MB capacity per IPU and a memory bandwidth of 47.5 TB/s. Graphcore has gone with a smaller capacity but the higher-bandwidth solution and stated that you can theoretically get more capacity when using several racks at once and the memory pool would end up higher when compared to a rack composed of A100 GPUs.\n\nFor interconnectivity, the chip uses the IPU-Exchange fabric which provides 8 TB/s bandwidth to all IPUs. The chip is composed of 10 IPU links which a 320 GB/s chip to chip bandwidth. The MK200 also supports PCIe Gen 4 (x16) interface. As for computing output, the MK200 delivers 250 TFLOPs of peak FP16 (with Sparsity) and 62.5 TFLOPs (with Sparsity) of peak FP32 performance. The NVIDIA A100 GPU delivers a total of 312 TFLOPs of FP16 (624 TFLOPs with Sparsity) and 19.5 TFLOPs FP32 (156 TFLOPs with Sparsity).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe IPU-Machine - A 1 PetaFlop Rack With Four MK200 IPUs\nIn addition to the Colossus MK200 IPU, Graphcore is also unveiling its competitor to the NVIDIA DGX A100 rack codenamed the IPU-M2000. This rack is composed of four MK200 IPUs, all of which offer a combined memory pool of 450 GB.\u00a0 The CPU that powers the rack is an ARM Cortex-A quad-core SOC and the system comes with a 1U chassis design featuring an advanced cooling system.\nFrom the looks of it, each IPU has an aluminum fin heatsink block attached over it which features six massive heat pipes that make direct contact with the heatsink block and leads to a massive block at the rear of the rack which is cooled off by central cooling from the rack station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nIn terms of performance metrics, Graphcore has compared eight M2000 IPU-Machine racks to a single DGX-A100. The reason is the performance per dollar metric for these comparisons. The DGX A100 costs $199,000 (MSRP) while eight M2000 racks would cost $259,600, MSRP). Graphcores unveils that their solution offers 12x the FP32 compute, 3x the FP16 compute, & 10x the memory over NVIDIA's solution. Do note that the figures for DGX-A100 are derived without sparsity whereas Graphcore's own numbers are derived with sparsity included.\n\nWith sparsity, the DGX-A100 will stand at around 5.0 TFLOPs in FP16 versus 8 TFLOPs and 1.248 PFLOPs in FP32 versus 2.0 PFLOPs which still gives the M2000 an edge of 60% in performance while costing 30% higher. In addition to these performance metrics, Graphcore says that the GC200 IPU platform is super flexible in the sense that you can have up to 64,000 of these chips running all-together which will be able to deliver a massive 16 Exaflops of compute horsepower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nAs far as availability is concerned, Graphcore states that customers can pre-order the IPU-Machine today with full volume shipments starting sometime in Q4 2020.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Reportedly Compared to Elden Ring for Its Player Freedom\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCS: Legacy, a Fan-Made Standalone Remake of Counter-Strike, Is in the Works\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\nOmar Sohail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple Considered Launching The iPhone 17 Air Without A USB-C Port, Aiming For A Portless Future With An Ultra-Thin Design And Wireless-First Approach\n\nAli Salman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n128\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n83\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n70\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n37\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nA Mac Studio Cluster Of Four Units, All Featuring Apple\u2019s Latest M3 Ultra, Consume Less Than Half The Power Of A Network Switch When Running At Idle\n\n\n\n33\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1480\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1157\nComments\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n1035\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Next LevelIntroducing new \u201cA2\u201d instances, Google is the first provider to offer A100 \u201cAmpere\u201d GPUs as a cloud service.Yevgeniy Sverdlik, Former Editor-in-ChiefJuly 7, 20202 Min ReadNvidia's A100 Ampere GPUNvidiaGoogle Cloud and Nvidia said Tuesday that Google would be the first cloud provider to offer Nvidia\u2019s latest GPU for machine learning as a service.The Nvidia A100 Tensor Core GPU, based on the chipmaker\u2019s new Ampere architecture, represents the largest intergenerational leap in performance in Nvidia\u2019s history. The company said the part performed 20 times better than its previous-gen product.Another way Ampere is different from its predecessors is that it\u2019s designed for both training and inference machine learning workloads. Nvidia designed a different GPU for each of the two types of workload in prior generations.And clients can now kick the tires on Ampere in Google Cloud, as part of a new type of cloud instance the provider also announced Tuesday: Accelerator-Optimized VM, or A2.The beefiest configuration of Google's\u00a0A2 cloud instance comes with 16 Ampere GPUs, all interconnected by NVSwitch, Nvidia\u2019s technology for interconnecting many GPUs to form a single computing fabric. That\u2019s 640GB of GPU memory, 1.3TB of system memory, and 9.6TB/s of aggregate bandwidth.Smaller A2 configurations are available as well.For now, A100 instances are only available in alpha. Google Cloud was also first to launch Nvidia\u2019s older T4 GPUs, in November 2018, also in alpha. T4 beta came about three months later, and general availability was announced after four more months.Related:How Google Cloud Plans to Win Enterprises from AWS and AzureGoogle Cloud may be first to offer Ampere GPUs as a service, but Nvidia had delivered the chips to all the major cloud providers as of mid-May, when it announced the chip publicly, the chipmaker\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, told Bloomberg at the time. The others (AWS, Azure, Alibaba, Oracle, IBM) will likely roll out their own Ampere cloud infrastructure soon.Google Cloud was also first to roll out cloud instances powered by AMD\u2019s Epyc 2 chips, which beat comparable Intel parts on both performance and price. The instances, according to Google, would be the most powerful VMs available to Google Cloud users.Epyc 2 is also the CPU in Nvidia\u2019s own Ampere-based supercomputer for machine learning, the DGX A100, which it announced along with A100 GPUs in May.Read more about:Google AlphabetAbout the AuthorYevgeniy SverdlikFormer Editor-in-ChiefSee more from Yevgeniy SverdlikSubscribe to the Data Center Knowledge NewsletterGet analysis and expert insight on the latest in data center business and technology delivered to your inbox daily.Newsletter Sign-UpYou May Also LikeEditor's ChoiceData center hybrid energy systems illustrationEnergy & Power SupplyCan Hybrid Energy Systems Solve the Data Center Power Problem?Can Hybrid Energy Systems Solve the Data Center Power Problem?Mar 14, 2025Data center in space illustrationNext-Gen Data CentersData Centers in Space: Separating Fact from Science FictionData Centers in Space: Separating Fact from Science FictionMar 12, 2025Verne Helsinki data center campusData Center ConstructionNew Data Center Developments: March 2025New Data Center Developments: March 2025Mar 6, 2025Exclusive DCK ResourcesDecoding Data Center Efficiency Metrics: A Guide to Energy and SustainabilityJan 29, 2025|1 Min ReadData Center Knowledge\u2019s 2024 Salary ReportAug 26, 2024|1 Min ReadDeep Dive: Optimizing AI Data Storage ManagementJul 12, 2024|8 Min ReadStrategies for Sustainable Water Consumption in Data CentersJun 27, 2024|1 Min ReadSee all DCK ResourcesIndustry VoicesData center transformerData Center HardwareData Center Transformers: Functions, Importance, and How to Choose the Right OneData Center Transformers: Functions, Importance, and How to Choose the Right OneMar 18, 2025Data Center ConstructionAI Rush Has TPG-Backed Intersect in Talks on Texas Data CentersAI Rush Has TPG-Backed Intersect in Talks on Texas Data CentersMar 18, 2025Subscribe to the Data Center Knowledge NewsletterGet analysis and expert insight on the latest in data center business and technology delivered to your inbox daily.Newsletter Sign-UpFeatured Technical ExplainersAI chipCloudCloud vs. On-Prem AI Accelerators: Choosing the Best Fit for Your AI WorkloadsCloud vs. On-Prem AI Accelerators: Choosing the Best Fit for Your AI WorkloadsData center server configuration command lines on a computer monitor.Open Source SoftwareOptimize Text Search: Master the grep Command in LinuxOptimize Text Search: Master the grep Command in LinuxData center ETF stock chart illustrationInvestingData Center ETFs: An Introductory Guide to Boosting Your PortfolioData Center ETFs: An Introductory Guide to Boosting Your PortfolioDiscover MoreData Center WorldAFCOMITPro TodayInformationWeekNetwork ComputingWorking With UsAbout UsReprintsAdvertiseContact UsJoin UsNewsletter Sign-UpFollow UsCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nNormally we're very much of the opinion that if you're in the market for new hardware you should just ignore the rumour mill and buy what you need today. But, even if there weren't compelling noises proclaiming the death of enthusiast Nvidia Turing GPUs, we couldn't in good conscience recommend you buy a new high-end graphics card today.With the impending, competing releases of both AMD's Big Navi RDNA 2 and Nvidia Ampere GPUs happening over the next few months, you would be setting yourself up for some seriously painful PC gaming buyer's remorse picking up anything outside of the budget end of the current graphics card generation.\u00a0That's been compounded by the recent rumours of Nvidia effectively setting the enthusiast-class Turing GPUs as end-of-life. The news was first spread by Chinese site ITHome (via WCCFTech), and has subsequently been spread around the tech world. The story, written by Watermelon/Internship (thank you for that gem, Google Translate), reports that the top four GeForce GPUs have been discontinued, meaning that the current stock of RTX 2070, RTX 2070 Super, RTX 2080 Super, and RTX 2080 Ti cards is all that there is and ever will be.We've reached out to Nvidia for comment, but given the green team habitually refuses to be drawn into the rumour game I don't expect we'll hear anything official until it's ready to talk GeForce Ampere.It was suggested last week that Nvidia has recommended a price rise on its GPUs, due to low production and the bizarre suggestion that there was some crypto-mining resurgence. But it was also claimed that the lack of RTX 2080 Super and 2080 Ti stock was down to an issue with getting hold of TSMC capacity.\u00a0Given the fact TSMC is likely in the process of manufacturing a whole lot of AMD and Apple silicon right now, and potentially some Nvidia chips unless Samsung has all of the upcoming Ampere production, encouraging the No.1 semiconductor company to get a few more Turing chips out the door was always going to be tough.So if you had felt encouraged to pick up an Nvidia 20-series GPU because it was going to net you a free copy of Death Stranding, then I'd probably enter a little upgrade hiatus.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Screen queens(Image credit: Future)Best gaming monitor: pixel-perfect panels for your PC\nBest 4K monitor for gaming: when only high-res will do\nBest 4K TV for gaming: big-screen 4K PC gamingPrices of current-gen enthusiast graphics cards are only going to rise as stock gets thin towards the launch of the Nvidia Ampere RTX 3000-series cards, and you're going to feel real foolish spending over the odds if the September 17 Ampere release date is confirmed next month.Though at the lower-end of the GPU spectrum things aren't so bad. The mainstream market isn't as badly affected by future releases given that we don't expect the more-affordable Ampere RTX 3000-series, or even mid-range AMD RDNA 2 cards, until next year.\u00a0Well, unless the MyDrivers reports of crypto mining demand increasing are to be believed, then your GTX 1660 Super and RTX 2060 are reportedly in trouble. And if mining's coming back that just again confirms we really are living in the darkest timeline.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDave JamesSocial Links NavigationEditor-in-Chief, HardwareDave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the Colecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!).

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12-pin PCIe Power Connector (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)A rumor has been spreading around the hardware circles that Nvidia's upcoming Ampere graphics cards might use a 12-pin PCIe power connector. Some news outlets are reporting the rumor as fact, while others are treating it as a sham. Our own insider source has confirmed that the connector is indeed real and has been submitted to the PCI-SIG standards body. However, it remains to be seen whether it will pass approval.The 12-pin PCIe power connector measures 19 x 14 x 8.35mm, give or take 0.30mm. If you want to get an idea of its size, the 12-pin connector should be roughly equivalent of putting two normal 6-pin PCIe power connectors side by side.\u00a0According to the submitted technical illustrations, the 12-pin PCIe power connector would come equipped with six 12V pins and six ground pins. Each 12V pin is rated for a maximum of 9A. Therefore, a single 12-pin PCIe power connector can theoretically provide a power input up to 648W, which blows every existing PCIe power connector out of the water.The 12-pin PCIe power connector is essentially a combination of two 6-pin PCIe power connectors albeit the different pin layout. As a result, power supply vendors can get away with just swapping the cable with its corresponding connector to the new 12-pin PCIe layout. This would allow them to save money since it wouldn't consist in touching the power supply's PCB.Image 1 of 212-pin PCIe Power Connector(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)12-pin PCIe Power Connector(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The wire gauge will play a significant role in power delivery. While the pins on the connector support 648W, you'll need 16AWG cables to get there. This shouldn't be a problem since we don't expect Ampere to draw that much power. The majority of modern power supplies employ 18AWG cables, which have a maximum ampacity of 7A. Even with 18AWG cables, the 12-pin PCI power connector can supply up to 504W of power and should be more than enough for any graphics card.Ampere graphics cards are rumored to pull up to 350W, which could explain Nvidia's insistence on a new PCIe power connector. Even with the current PCIe power connectors, it's possible to feed a graphics card more than 350W. The PCIe slot provides 75W and a single 8-pin PCIe power connector delivers up to 150W. So a combination of the PCIe slot with two 8-pin PCIe power connectors is good for 375W. If required, you could also add another 6-pin or 8-pin PCIe power connector to the mix. High-end graphics cards, such as the MSI GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Lightning Z or EVGA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti K|NGP|N depend on three 8-pin PCIe power connectors, so it's not uncommon to find graphics card with three power connectors.Perhaps it isn't a matter of whether current offerings can provide enough power for Ampere \u2013 it more likely comes down to marketing. Having multiple PCIe power connectors can give a bad first impression that the graphics card is a power-hungry one. To the untrained eye, a graphics card with a single PCIe power connector infuses an illusion of its power efficiency.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.At the moment, it's uncertain if the 12-pin PCIe power connector will be exclusive to Nvidia's Founders Edition models or the same for all aftermarket models. At any rate, we shouldn't be despair since the PCI-SIG group might not even approve the 12-pin PCIe power connector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nrtx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (11)\n\n\n\nZhiye LiuSocial Links NavigationNews Editor and Memory ReviewerZhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

(I suppose you could use the 3.3V for things like RGB...)\n\n*\n\nSecond: The PCIe power connectors have a level of redundancy built in, so you can't assume you can just add multiple ones together:\n\n6-pin has 2x +12V and 2x ground, but only needs one of each to supply the rated 75W. This means one wire/connector of each can be damaged and it will still meet any safety guidelines.\n\n8-pin has 3x +12V and 3x ground; one extra of each. The number of \"needed\" wires doubled from the 6-pin, so the power rating also doubles.\n\n*\n\nIf the 12-pin were to have the same 1 extra wire (for both +12V and ground), that leaves 10 pins. It's likely there will be a couple of sense pins, so you'd be left with 4 pairs for power delivery (5 pairs connected of which 1 for redundancy) and you'd have 4x the capacity of the 6-pin, or 300W.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDroidfreak\n\n\nAlright, so I can throw away my 250\u20ac ROG Thor PSU as soon as I buy an Ampere card?\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGillerer\n\n\nI'm sure there will be adapters for 2 x 8-pin --> 12-pin, or something.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njasonf2\n\n\nI have been watching this blow up with headlines like the \"ampere cards will require you to replace most of your computer\". What a joke. Even if you have to replace a psu to support the new header you are out somewhere between $250-$450 (ultra premium psu) for a video card upgrade that will more than likely run north of $1500 in the first place. While I am sure that there are some people out there that are moving from the 1080ti - 2080ti - 3080ti sequentially the cost of doing so in today's graphics card market is cost prohibitive for most. For me that means that my higher end graphics card purchase is typically on a new build and at that point I am buying a psu anyway. Other than cost replacing a psu takes like 10 minutes and a screwdriver and certainly isn't replacing most of my computer. The ideal that this will move people to AMD is just clickbait. People that are cycle upgrading like this are going after the performance crown. If AMD comes out with something that actually competes with the 3080(ti) they will sell cards to this group. If not they are going to be where they are today in the graphics card arena regardless of a power connector. Personally my bet is that these cards are going to ship with an adapter to hook into the header especially after all of this hype. While the spec itself may need the ability to feed 600 watts the cards won't need it and the adapter can be made to the card spec. I would bet on a splitter that will combine a number of existing psu cables. Going forward developing a standardized high wattage GPU power connector makes sense for the industry anyways. The new lightweight psu standard coming out (12 volt only) is going to make a mess for those trying to upgrade factory built pc's. Requiring a dedicated discrete gpu plug would at least cleanup the upgrade path going forward for those purposes and at those wattage requirements should suit the gpu purposes for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiceman_2037\n\n\nConsidering its ATX standards body that would yay or nay the introduction of a new socket and connector, this fake news is debunked.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDroidfreak\n\n\njasonf2 said:I have been watching this blow up with headlines like the \"ampere cards will require you to replace most of your computer\".

I actually did a new build in Q4 2019/Q1 2020 and spent almost 2K \u20ac without the GPU. ROG Strix Helios case, i9 9900KF, Maximis XI Hero Wifi, ROG Strix RGB 360 AIO, 1TB 970 Pro, 32 GB TridentZ Royal.. Now the fun fact: I'm still running a GTX 970, lol. And yes, I did buy a premium PSU (ROG Thor 850P). Cmon, my CPU draws up to 340 Watts (!) during a P95 stress run at 5.1 GHz, maybe ASUS et. al. need to introduce a new CPU PWR connector?\nSo if I was forced to replace the PSU for an Ampere card to work I would seriously consider AMD. Because guess what? It would still be waay faster than my GTX 970 \ud83d\ude01\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspongiemaster\n\n\nGillerer said:I'm sure there will be adapters for 2 x 8-pin --> 12-pin, or something.If this rumor is true, the adapter will come in the box of every video card that needs one. Nvidia is not going to be stupid enough to ship a card that either requires a new power supply that they make no money from the sales of or requires an adapter that may or may not be readily available from third party vendors on launch day.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 11 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070-series GPU supply to stabilize after April claims AIB partner Yeston\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew undersea cable tech listens for sabotage \u2014 can be retrofitted to existing fiber optic lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm debuts new Snapdragon G handheld gaming PC chips to compete with Intel and AMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina to spend $55 billion on R&D in 2025 \u2014 Semiconductor, AI and quantum computing fields to benefit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBambu Lab Announces New Printer: H2D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotherboard dies after marathon 100-hour BIOS update process, vigil attended by thousands online\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD boasts its Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is up to 12.2x faster than Lunar Lake in AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreeware image editor GIMP 3.0 arrives after seven years of incubation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle's Gemini 2.0 Flash is reportedly capable of removing watermarks \u2014 Also found to generate AI celebrity photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi and ChatGPT bring AI conversations to your retro rotary phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

This feature lets the GPU directly manage its video memory, enabling improved performance and lower latency in certain 3D and video applications.\n RTX-Accelerated Creative Apps\n The new Studio driver is validated against the latest GPU-accelerated creative app releases including Chaos V-Ray 5, Corel Painter 2021, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Substance Alchemist and Blender Cycles.\n Chaos V-Ray 5\n Chaos Group just released V-Ray 5 for Autodesk 3ds Max, with support for out-of-core geometry for rendering using NVIDIA CUDA to improve performance for artists and designers working with large scenes that aren\u2019t able to fit into the GPU\u2019s memory \u2014 and a host of new GPU-accelerated features for lighting, materials and colour management that include: \n\nLightMix - to freely experiment with lighting changes after you render, save out permutations, and push back improvements you\u2019d like to have in your scene.\nLight Path Expressions - to make customer render elements using the physical behavior of light.\nSun & Sky model - for adding the subtleties of twilight when the sun is near the horizon.\nLayer Compositing - to fine-tune and finish your images directly in the V-Ray frame buffer \u2014 without the need for a separate post-processing app.\nExpanded Materials - including Coat and Sheen layers in V-Ray Material, multiple texture randomising options, and new V-Ray Dirt weathering abilities.\nACEScg support - for the most demanding colour management needs. \n\nV-Ray GPU 5 adds a number of features that were previously only available on the CPU-only version, including 2D Displacement, OSL patterns, Phoenix Particle Shader, tyFlow support, improved shadow catching, and IBL ground projection.\n Corel Painter 2021\n The newly released Corel Painter 2021 brings a whole suite of updates to artists including double the number of GPU-accelerated brush engines than in Painter 2020. Corel Painter is now up to 15x faster on a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti than a desktop CPU, allowing you to paint with smooth stutter-free brushes.\n\n Adobe Premiere Pro\n With the new Adobe Premiere Pro 14.2 update, video creators gain massive time-savings with new GPU-accelerated encoding. Adobe and NVIDIA have optimised Premiere Pro for the built-in NVIDIA hardware encoder on NVIDIA Quadro and GeForce GPUs with staggering results. Editors can now export high-resolution videos up to 5x faster when using popular H.264 or H.265 / HEVC codecs. Less time exporting means more time for editing content and quicker turnarounds on projects.\n  \n Adobe Substance Alchemist\n Substance Alchemist, Adobe\u2019s newest material creation tool, received a recent AI upgrade. Their Image to Material feature allows artists to capture a photo of real-world surfaces and create textures for 3D that can be used in content creation. When run on NVIDIA RTX GPUs, the tool leverages an AI algorithm that recognises shapes and objects in a photograph. It automatically generates a higher quality, accurate texture map that includes base colour, height and normal, allowing artists to focus on creativity instead of time-consuming map refinement.\n  \n Blender Cycles\n Released earlier this month, Blender 2.83 gives artists the power of AI when denoising \u2014 a process that predicts final images from partially rendered results \u2014 while they\u2019re designing in the viewport. This allows users to explore new ideas and quickly iterate on design choices with full confidence in how it will turn out. It\u2019s one of many recent game-changing advancements in Blender that RTX acceleration brings to 3D artists and designers.\n  \n Even More Performance\n Tested across RTX GPUs running Windows 19H2, the latest driver provides up to 18% increase in creative performance. A few examples can be seen below.\n\n New RTX Studio Laptops Available Now\n Looking for a laptop that can handle the latest RTX-accelerated creative apps? There are some great new options available:\nDell XPS 17 was designed to handle intensive creative projects, gaming and VR with up to GeForce RTX 2060 graphics. Packing this much performance into an RTX Studio laptop of this size required engineering ingenuity to keep the system running smoothly. Under the hood is a brand new proprietary thermal design that provides more overall airflow and higher sustained performance to fuel the most demanding projects. It\u2019s also accelerated by NVIDIA Studio Drivers and features up to 19 hours of battery life.\nHP recently released the ENVY 15 RTX Studio laptop that can be configured with up to a GeForce RTX 2060 GPU for the ultimate in creator performance featuring an all-aluminum chassis with 82.8 percent screen-to-body ratio, up to a 4K OLED VESA DisplayHDR 400 True Black display with touch interface display, 10th gen Intel processors, and gaming-class thermals.\nCheck out the full catalog of RTX Studio laptops here.\n Stay Up-to-Date with NVIDIA Studio\n To get the latest performance optimisations and support for the new July creative app updates, download the new Studio Driver (release 451.48) today through GeForce Experience or from the driver download page. Studio Drivers are built specifically for creators and tested extensively against top creative apps and workflows.\nYou can also stay up to date on the latest apps through NVIDIA\u2019s new Studio YouTube channel, featuring tutorials, tips, and tricks by industry-leading artists.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Marco Chiappetta is a technologist who covers semiconductors and AI.Follow AuthorJul 31, 2020, 04:10pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.The Ampere-Based NVIDIA EGX A100.NVIDIA\nThe rumor mill has been steadily speculating on NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation consumer GPUs, based on the company\u2019s Ampere architecture, for quite a while now. In fact, I personally had multiple, off-the-record conversations regarding Ampere with a number of NVIDIA\u2019s board partners way back during CES in early January, and all of them had good things to say.\n\n\nAs we inch closer to the GeForce RTX 3000 series\u2019 eventual release (assuming that is what NVIDIA actually calls it), however, more and more leaks are hitting the web and virtually all of them suggest that the new cards are going to offer some killer performance.\n\nAll signs at this point suggest a September launch for NVIDIA\u2019s next-gen GeForces, which is two years exactly since the GeForce RTX 2000 series launched in September 2018. Considering the Turing-based GeForce RTX 2000 series was NVIDIA\u2019s first consumer GPU to feature Tensor and RTX cores (Volta was never a consumer GPU), NVIDIA has likely found a number of ways to optimize their performance and efficiency with consumer and gaming workloads. When talking about its data center / HPC focused Ampere A100 GPU, NVIDIA says, \u201cThe new third-generation Tensor Core architecture in A100 delivers double the raw dense Tensor throughput per SM compared to V100, accelerates more data types, and delivers tremendous additional 2x speedups for sparse matrix computations.\u201d In addition to enhancements made to the cores themselves, Ampere also features larger caches, more total cores, wider interfaces, support for new data compression types, and additional enhancements throughout the GPU. All of that should culminate in significantly increased performance all around.\n\nNVIDIA GA100 Full GPU with 128 SMs (A100 Tensor Core GPU has 108 SMs).NVIDIA\nIn some officially released ML Perf benchmarks that hit the web yesterday, NVIDIA announced record breaking AI performance on Ampere, that\u2019s up to 4X higher than Volta. And a number of recent leaks suggest that the flagship Ampere-based GeForce RTX 3000 series card \u2013 likely to be branded the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti \u2013 will be approximately 50% faster than the currently available GeForce RTX 2080 Ti with gaming and rendering workloads.\n\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nA couple of days ago, Jules Urbach, CEO and co-founder of OTOY Tweeted, \u201cThe NVIDIA A100 has now become the fastest GPU ever recorded on #OctaneBench: 446 OB4* #Ampere appears to be ~43 percent faster than #Turing in #OctaneRender - even w/ #RTX off!\u201d Now, that test was run on the A100 (not an upcoming consumer GPU), but it still points to massive performance improvements over existing cards, due to the architectural similarities that will exist between them.\n\nA supposed leak of a UL 3DMark TimeSpy benchmark that hit a couple of weeks back suggested a 30% advantage for the \u20183080 Ti\u2019 versus a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti FE card, with scores of 18,257 vs. 13,939, respectively. Another leak that hit today though, using the more taxing Time Spy Extreme benchmark, which places a heavier load on the GPU, suggests a 50% advantage for the alleged \u20183080 Ti\u2019. A tweet from a well-known leaker suggests a Time Spy Extreme score of nearly 10,000 for the \u20183080 Ti\u2019, whereas the average score for a single 2080 Ti in 3DMark\u2019s database for that test is \u201conly\u201d 6,471 \u2013 and that includes some heavily overclocked submissions.\n\n\nOf course, this is all speculation until cards actually arrive, but all signs point to big performance gains at this point. We should know for sure in just a few more weeks.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Making technology comprehensible and relevant.for\u00a0Tirias ResearchFollow AuthorJul 21, 2020, 02:30pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.Chris Malachowsky, Nvidia co-founderNvidia\nNvidia and The University of Florida (UF) are in engaging in a unique public-private partnership that could result in the development of the largest university AI supercomputer in the United States, and perhaps the world. The project is anchored by a $25 million gift from UF alumnus and Nvidia co-founder, Chris Malachowsky along with a matching $25 million grant from Nvidia in the form of hardware, software, training, and services, as well as an additional $20 million from UF for data center upgrades.\n\n\nThe project was inspired by Malachowsky who was looking for a way to help the university expand its reach and bring artificial intelligence (AI) to the forefront at UF. The initiative includes a commitment from UF to hire 100 additional faculty members focused on AI. They will join 500 new faculty recently added across disciplines \u2014 many of whom will weave AI into their teaching and research. The University expects to integrate the use of this AI supercomputer throughout various departments. In addition, the University is introducing a Bachelor of Science degree in Data Science this fall.\n\nMalachowsky hopes this unique project will become a template for other universities and companies to follow. He is quoted as saying: \u201cArtificial intelligence is the most disruptive technology of our era, with sweeping implications for how we live and work.\u201d In my conversation with Malachowsky he expressed great enthusiasm for bringing AI to a broad set of disciplines at the UF - from precision agriculture, to astrophysics, and to marine biology. The obvious applications are in engineering disciplines for applications such as autonomous driving research. In addition, Malachowsky also expects there will be courses in other areas such as the ethics of AI and journalism to understanding the impact of AI on society.\n\n\nMalachowsky believes that the Nvidia AI supercomputer will enhance research into all these areas with both number crunching and machine learning capability. In particular, he believes that solving some of the toughest problems we face today, such as alternative energy and climate change, requires an interdisciplinary approach that includes massive compute power and machine learning for simulation and modeling.\n\nOverall, there would be an general enhancement to STEM (short for Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) education throughout the University. The system that Nvidia will be delivering to UF later this year \u2013 which will be up and running just a few weeks later \u2014 is an Nvidia DGX SuperPOD. A similar, though larger, in-house system at Nvidia called Selene is in the No. 7 spot in the latest Top500 supercomputer list with an HPL mark of 27.58 petaflops. The DGX SuperPOD is powered by Nvida\u2019s new Ampere A100 GPUs and AMD\u2019s EPYC Rome CPUs and uses Mellanox HDR InfiniBand as the system network. Separately, it was announced earlier this year that UF was the first institution of higher learning in the U.S. to receive DGX A100 systems, which have already been deployed in an existing supercomputer.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\nNVIDIA SuperPOD Data CenterNvidia\n\nThis public-private initiative could be a model for other industry and academic collaborations. Alumni can work with their alma mater, industry, and local governments to make significant hardware and monetary contributions while the universities would provide the academic environment and the researchers to put that hardware to work. Malachowsky believes that this type of program can help to improve the United States\u2019 international competitiveness if it were to be replicated. UF is already moving ahead with improving access to its technology and will make the AI supercomputer available to other state and regional schools.\n\n\nMalachowsky believes this really is a \u201cmoonshot\u201d opportunity for the University and for all educators to leverage this unprecedented access to advanced compute capability and AI to advance the country.\nThe author and members of the Tirias Research staff do not hold equity positions in any of the companies mentioned.

The A100 chip is also available as a service on Google Cloud, targeted at companies that need the highest possible performance for data analytics, scientific computing, genomics, edge video analytics and 5G services workloads.\nNvidia said MLPerf\u2019s latest benchmarks show that its DGX A100 system delivers a four-times performance improvement over its original DGX system that was based on its older V100 GPUs. However, it said the tests show that the older system, known as DGX-1, is now twice as fast thanks to some new software optimizations.\n\nThe latest MLPerf benchmarks included two brand new tests as well as one \u201csubstantially revised\u201d test and Nvidia said its hardware \u201cexcelled\u201d in all of them. For example, the A100 chip and the DGX SuperPOD system achieved the best performance in the new recommendation systems test, which is an increasingly popular workload for AI systems.\nNvidia\u2019s hardware also achieved top scores in the Natural Language Processing category using the Bi-directional Encoder Representation from Transformers, or BERT, neural network model. It also set new records in the reinforcement learning test that uses Mini-go with a full-size 19\u00d719 Go board. According to Nvidia, this \u201cwas the most complex test in this round involving diverse operations from game play to training.\u201d\n\nNvidia said the DGX SuperPOD, which features more than 2,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs, swept every MLPerf benchmark category for at-scale performance among commercially available products.\nConstellation Research Inc. analyst Holger Mueller told SiliconANGLE that MLPerf\u2019s benchmarks are important as we\u2019re in the middle of the race to AI, and that enterprises realize more automation is better than less.\n\u201cCovid-19 only increases the urgency, so companies are looking to platform vendors to help them with their next generation application AI loads,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cToday it is Nvidia\u2019s turn, setting new records on a number of MLPerf standards. What is remarkable is that Nvidia has been able to improve its performance by four times over the last one and half years. That kind of performance increase is what is needed play in the medal ranks of AI benchmarks.\u201d\nNvidia wasn\u2019t alone in setting new records. Google also participated in the MLPerf benchmarks with some of its new hardware, and says they prove it has built the world\u2019s fastest machine learning training supercomputer after setting six performance records.\n\nGoogle\u2019s latest ML training supercomputer, based on its newest Tensor Processing Unit, is four times the size of the Cloud TPU V3 Pod that set three records in the previous benchmarks last year. Made up of 4,096 TPU V3 chips and hundreds of CPU hosted machines, the system delivers a peak performance of more than 430 petaflops, Google said.\nPhoto: Nvidia\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. \u00a0\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\n\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

The service started beta testing for Android last year and\u00a0opened up for everyone in February. NVIDIA had pledged to\u00a0announce new games for GeForce NOW every week, and over the past months, it has kept to that promise. This week, NVIDIA is giving GeForce NOW 11 new additions, including titles like Far Cry 3, Life is Strange - Before the Storm, Magic the Gathering: Arena, and some new releases. NVIDIA is also making it easier to sync your Steam library to the service. \nThese are the eleven titles that have made their way to NVIDIA GeForce NOW this week: \n\n                                        Steam:\n                                                \n\n                                        Blightbound\n                        \n\n                                        Hellpoint\n                        \n\n                                        Dead Age 2\n                        \n\n                                        Life is Strange - Before the Storm\n                        \n\n                                        Stationeers\n                        \n\n\n\n                                        Epic Games Store:\n                                                \n\n                                        Far Cry 3\n                        \n\n                                        For The King\n                        \n\n                                        Magic the Gathering: Arena\n                        \n\n                                        South Park: The Stick of Truth\n                        \n\n                                        This War of Mine\n                        \n\n\n\n                                        My.com:\n                                                \n\n                                        Warface\n                        \n\n\n\nAmongst these, Blightbound, Hellpoint, Dead Age 2 are new game launches, having launched on July 29, July 30, and July 16 respectively on their platforms. Their addition adds freshness to the game streaming platform, so users don\u2019t need to wait to play these games through the cloud. Along with the addition of new titles, NVIDIA has also added highlights support for Rainbow Six Seige, which will let users easily capture highlights from the game.\nFurther, NVIDIA is also adding in the ability to let users sync their Steam libraries to GeForce NOW by navigating to Settings > Game Sync. Once your Steam account is authorized, this feature will identify the games in the library that are supported by GeForce NOW and automatically add them to \"My Library\" within the app. You can also force a refresh any time you purchase a new Steam game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are all the previous title additions to NVIDIA GeForce NOW: \n\nMarch 26, 2020\n\n\nApril 24, 2020\n\n\nMay 1, 2020\n\n\nMay 7, 2020\n\n\nMay 14, 2020\n\n\nMay 21, 2020\n\n\nMay 28, 2020\n\n\nJune 11, 2020\n\n\nJune 18, 2020\n\n\nJune 25, 2020\n\n\nJuly 2, 2020\n\n\nJuly 9, 2020\n\n\nJuly 16, 2020\n\n\nJuly 23, 2020\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce NOW\nDeveloper: NVIDIA\n\nPrice: Free\n3.9\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nSteam\n\n\n\n\nGame Streaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support XDA.

Recently, we did a heat check on Nvidia and AMD, seeing whether our readers are planning to buy AMD\u2019s upcoming RDNA 2 GPUs or Nvidia\u2019s next generation of GeForce RTX graphics cards. Having had over 3,300 responses in just one day, we now have a good idea of which way KitGuru readers are leaning.\nWe ran this particular poll over on our Facebook page. Out of the 3,000 votes, two thirds of them went towards buying a next-gen Nvidia graphics card, with the remaining 1,000 votes going to AMD.\n\nSo, what do we know (or think we know) about these upcoming next-gen GPUs from Team Red and Team Green? We will break it all down below.\nAMD RDNA 2 and Radeon RX 6000\n\nWe have known about RDNA 2 since AMD unveiled its updated GPU roadmap last year. This architecture is already set to power the new Xbox Series X and PS5 consoles, but it will also be coming to PC graphics cards.\nAll we know officially is that RDNA 2 GPUs will support real-time raytracing, Mesh Shaders and Variable Rate Shading with enough horsepower to push into high-end 4K gaming. AMD has also confirmed that RDNA 2 is on track to be delivered on time later this year with a 50 percent boost to performance per watt compared to RDNA 1.\nThrough unofficial channels, such as data mining driver updates, we know that AMD has at least one high-end \u2018Big Navi\u2019 GPU that has yet to launch, in addition to something called Navi 2X. Right now, it is rumoured that Navi 2X and Big Navi are one and the same. One AMD employee has also previously confirmed through Reddit that next-gen graphics cards will not ship with blower-style reference coolers, indicating a more powerful chip in need of additional cooling out of the box.\nIf AMD delivers a 12 TFLOP RDNA 2 GPU like the one found in the Xbox Series X, then we may see PC graphics cards from Radeon that match the current Nvidia RTX 2080 Super. We should get an update on RDNA 2 graphics cards from AMD in the next few months.\nNvidia Ampere and GeForce RTX 3000\n\nOn the Nvidia front, there is much more unofficial information compared to official details. Nvidia did announce the Ampere architecture earlier this year, but the company has not confirmed that this will be the same architecture seen in the next GeForce series of GPUs. However, rumours are strongly pointing in that direction.\nAs we saw in a series of leaks in June 2020, there are a few variations of the GA102 GPU floating around with differing amounts of VRAM and CUDA cores, indicating specs for new RTX TITAN and RTX 3080. It is speculated that the next RTX TITAN will use a GA102-400-A1 GPU with 5376 CUDA cores and 24GB of GDDR6 VRAM. Meanwhile, the RTX 3080 is rumoured to be based on the GA102-200-A1 GPU with 4352 CUDA cores and 10GB of GDDR6 running at 19Gbps.\nMeanwhile, other leaks suggest that there will be an RTX 3070 and RTX 3070Ti, one equipped with a GA104-300 GPU and the other with a GA104-400. In this scenario, the RTX 3070 would feature 2944 CUDA cores and 8GB of GDDR6 memory, while the RTX 3070Ti would have 3072 CUDA cores and 8GB of faster memory.\nAs we dive deeper into rumour territory, there is also talk of a raytracing co-processor, which could drastically improve real-time raytracing performance across the board for a new series of RTX graphics cards. There is also talk that Nvidia may introduce a new 12-pin power connector for Ampere GPUs, ditching the old dual power connector design.\nFinally, we cannot forget about the leaked cooling shroud images from earlier this year, showing a complete overhaul compared to current \u2018Founders Edition\u2019 GPU coolers.\n\nThe cooling shroud shown above is reported to cost roughly $150 to produce, with an unusual PCB design that has an additional cut-out, putting it into a V-shape. A massive heatsink is then connected and extends to fill the cut-out on the PCB. Finally, a cooling fan sits on either side of the card, one on the front and one on the back. We are not sure what benefits this may bring yet, but it is an approach to cooling that we have never seen before on a reference GPU cooler.\nIf all these rumours prove to be accurate, we will be looking at up to a 30 percent boost in traditional rasterization performance compared to the Turing-based RTX 2000 series.\nConclusion\nTwo thirds of KitGuru readers are more interested in Nvidia\u2019s next-gen GPUs compared to AMD. As we look back at the landscape of news, one could speculate that a good chunk of that comes down to the fact that there are way more leaks and rumours on Nvidia\u2019s side driving momentum.\nWith AMD RDNA 2, a lot of the conversation has been focused on next-gen console hardware, with little shared about standalone PC graphics cards. While on the Nvidia side, we have lists of SKUs and specs to go with them, in addition to more wild rumours, like the raytracing co-processor, new 12-pin power connector and $150 cooler design.\nOne thing is for certain \u2013 Q3 is going to be huge for graphics card news. Currently, all signs point to announcements coming from both AMD and Nvidia within the next few months, giving us plenty to look forward to.\nDiscuss on our Facebook page, HERE.\nKitGuru Says: Are you excited to see new GPU launches this year?
