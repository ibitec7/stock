Our in-box is heavy with press releases from companies big and small, hoping to produce popular and newsworthy designs with which to tempt you. There are so many new designs it is hard to give proper coverage to them all but if you keep an eye on the HEXUS press releases section, they should eventually filter through. At release time we will be of course reviewing a choice selection of RTX 30 series GPUs too. In the meantime, I'm going to summarise my RTX 30 series highlights, as per the headline.\n\nGigabyte / Aorus\nGigabyte / Aorus have provided a first look video showcasing its initial salvo of GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards. I've embedded that directly above and it shows a cool looking OLED display on the GPU shroud. Like the Asus story from earlier today the video content focuses upon the coolers that have been designed to tame the RTX 30 GPUs.\nIf you head on over to the Gigabyte Nvidia graphics cards product pages and filter for the RTX 30 series you will be presented with a product portfolio of eight cards. These are all RTX 3090 and 3080 cards for now (four of each) and also split by four per each brand.\n\nChecking out the Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Master 10G, for example, I see that the specs page is very sparsely populated for now. All we see is the GPU inside and how many CUDA cores it has - the same as reference of course. This will be a familiar theme throughout this roundup - minimal specs revealed - so I won't mention it again.\nMSI\nMSI has provided a blog post and insider video about its new GeForce RTX 30 graphics cards. It has 14 new products based around the GeForce GTX 3090, 3080 and 3070 GPUs - six Gaming Trio and eight Ventus series cards. The Ventus range mixes up x3 and x2 coolers but the x2 coolers are exclusive to the RTX 3070 series which will be less power hungry.\n\nOn the topic of power hunger, the Gaming Trio RTX 3090 and 3080 cards have 3x 8-pin power connectors with the RTX 30 models requiring just two. All the Ventus series sport 2x 8-pin power connectors, even the RTX 3090 designs.\nEVGA\nEVGA has announced its GeForce RTX 30 series which will feature EVGA iCX3 cooling technology. Again this firm talks as if it decided on the cutouts in the PCB design, dubbed 'Air-Through PCB', (and backplate) but everyone will have inherited this from Nvidia. In other cooler specs we see the new EVGA designs will use; micro-thin heatpipes, a unified copper block for GPU and memory, through-hole heatsink fins, an HDB 2.0 0dB noise motor fan, an asymmetry fan arrangement and design, and aRGB LEDs.\n\nOn his Twitter feed Jacob Freeman, the Global Product Management Director at EVGA, shared some more tasty details of GeForce RTX 30 products to come. He published a photo of the FTW3 Hybrid card with 240mm radiator and RGB fans. Furthermore, Freeman stated that a KingPin version was on its way too.\n\nOther Nvidia partners\nInno 3D wrote to HEXUS about its upcoming GeForce RTX 30 series cards. It listed nine products based upon the RTX 3090, 3080 and 3070 GPUs in its email. These products use the iChill x4 and iChill x3 coolers at the higher end, with cards lower down in the pack sporting the Gaming x3 and Twin x2 coolers.\n\nLike other players, Inno 3D talks a lot about how it has improved its cooling shrouds. In particular it highlights its use of multiple copper heat pipes, and its Scythe blade fans with asymmetrical layout. Read more about the individual Inno 3D products on these official product pages.\nPalit has five new GeForce RTX 30 series products to show off at the time of writing. They all look remarkably similar, from RTX 3090, 3080 to 3070 with what appears to be the same triple fan cooler - but they are all dubbed 'GamingPro' models.\n\nInterestingly Palit shares the full specs of its cards with base and boost clocks, memory clocks, and so on available to peruse. I've screen grabbed a comparison table showing all that data and it is reproduced below. The RTX 3090 and 3080 OC models are just 30MHz faster\u2026\n\nclick to zoom table image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nHEXUS Week In Review: Radeon RX 6600 and RTX 3070 Noctua Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 25 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

Plenty of people saying availability is going to be truly horrendous and they have been pretty much on the money with the other stuff they have revealedShould be OK direct from Nvidia I'd have thought, and I'd take that one over an AIP for sure.We don't know what yields are like, true, but seems like the 3080 can be made from chips with a lot of defects given the specs compared to the 3090 which is the same die.\n            \n            \n            \n\n\n\n\n                    Posted by deleted - Wed 02 Sep 2020 15:33\n                \n\n\n\n\n            Aye I agree with both above. Saying it will be \u00a3649 and actually getting one ON LAUNCH DAY for \u00a3649 is different.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia debuts latest RTX 3000 series graphics cards, including high-powered RTX 3090      Daniel Howley   \u00b7 Technology Editor Updated September 2, 2020 3 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -3.40%       Nvidia (NVDA) debuted its newest high-powered consumer graphics cards on Tuesday, with performance that easily outpaces its last generation devices, the company said. The new cards, part of the firm's RTX line, include the RTX 3070, RTX 3080, and the outrageously powerful RTX 3090. Available in October, the cards will vary in price, with the RTX 3070 standing as the entry-level option at $499, the RTX 3080 sitting in the middle at $699, and the RTX 3090 ranking atop the rest at $1,499. The new graphics cards are powered by Nvidia's Ampere architecture, marking the first time that the platform has been used in consumer-level cards. The company promises that means big performance improvements over its prior generation options.   Nvidia's new RTX 3000 cards are the companies latest and greatest consumer graphics processors, promising dramatically improved speeds and performance. (Image: Nvidia)   Graphics cards are essential for PC gamers, providing the backbone for all of the photorealistic on-screen effects that make today's games look so impressive. With its first RTX line of cards, Nvidia began implementing true-to-life lighting effects via what's known as ray-tracing technology, and the RTX 3000 series builds on that. What\u2019s more, the company is bringing the tech to the incredibly popular game \u201cFortnite,\u201d giving gamers more of a reason to upgrade to the latest chips.   Epic's 'Fortnite' is getting the Nvidia RTX lighting treatment. (Image: Nvidia)   In terms of performance, Nvidia says the RTX 3070 is faster than its RTX 2080 Ti, despite the fact that the 2080 Ti costs well over $1,000, and is 60% faster than the RTX 2070. The RTX 3070 comes with 8GB of GDDR6 RAM, and can handle running games at resolutions as high as 4K. The RTX 3080, meanwhile, gets 10GB of GDDR6X RAM, which Nvidia says is the fastest discrete graphics memory in the world. The card, according to the company, is 2x as fast as the RTX 2080, and will let gamers play games at 4K resolutions and 60 frames per second. That's quite a feat, and something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.  Then there's the monster of the group: the RTX 3090. This is the card you get if you want to play games at the highest settings, handle heavy-duty content creation, or, alternatively, operate some kind of Bond villain-style weather-control device. That card, according to Nvidia, is 50% faster than the monstrous TITAN RTX card, and will let players run games at 8K resolutions and 60 frames per second. Nvidia's graphics chips have been the company's main source of revenue for years, but with the realization that graphics processors can be used to handle large workloads like those needed for artificial intelligence, such chips have made their way into high-end servers run by some of the biggest tech names in the world.   Story Continues That, in turn, has led to an increase in Nvidia's data center revenue, which, for the first time, surpassed gaming revenue in Q2 2020. In that quarter, the data center side brought in $1.75 billion in revenue, while the gaming business saw $1.65 billion in revenue. In the prior quarter, the company saw $1.14 billion in data center revenue and $1.34 in gaming revenue.We'll have to see if that remains a trend moving forward as Nvidia continues to see impressive growth.Got a tip?

You Asked, We Answered.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n                    \n                     By NVIDIA on September 21, 2020\n                \n\t\t\t\t | \n\t\t\t\t\t\nFeatured Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week's GeForce RTX 3080 launch was simultaneously the best GPU launch ever and the most frustrating.\nThe reception to our NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs has been off the charts and driven interest to heights we\u2019ve never previously experienced. A few examples compared to our previous launch -\u00a0 4 times the unique visitors to our website, 10 times the peak web requests per second, and more than 15 times the out clicks to partner pages.\nWe expected the best ever demand for the RTX 30-series, but the enthusiasm was overwhelming. We were not prepared for this level, nor were our partners. We apologize for this.\nOur community has asked questions in the past few days since the launch. Jensen\u2019s personal email has been flooded with requests to help. He wants everyone to know he is working with the team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? I was really excited for the GeForce RTX 3080, but the launch has made it near impossible to find one and this is really disappointing.\nThe demand for the GeForce RTX 3080 was truly unprecedented. We and our partners underestimated it. \nOver 50 major global retailers had inventory on the day of launch. Our retail partners reported record traffic to their sites, in many cases exceeding Black Friday. This caused crashes, delays and other issues for their customers. We knew the GeForce RTX 3080 would be popular, but none of us expected that much traffic on the first day. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the overall GeForce RTX 3080 stock situation?\nThe GeForce RTX 3080 is in full production. We began shipping GPUs to our partners in August, and have been increasing the supply weekly. Partners are also ramping up capacity to meet the unprecedented demand. We understand that many gamers are unable to buy a GeForce RTX 3080 right now and we are doing everything we can to catch up quickly. Keep checking in with your favorite retailer to be notified of availability. You may use the GeForce RTX 3080 product finder to find available cards at local retailers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does availability start with such low inventory? Why not wait until more cards are produced?\nWe have great supply - just not for this level of demand. It is typical for initial demand to exceed supply for our new GPUs. Our global network of partners are ramping as hard as they can to get the new GPUs to the more than 100 million GeForce gamers around the world. Our philosophy has always been to get the latest technology into the hands of gamers as fast as possible. As we race to build more GeForce RTX 3080s, we suggest not buying from opportunistic resellers who are attempting to take advantage of the current situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat changes are you making to the NVIDIA Store moving forward?\nAs with many other etailers, the NVIDIA Store was also overrun with malicious bots and resellers. To combat this challenge we have made the following changes: we moved our NVIDIA Store to a dedicated environment, with increased capacity and more bot protection. We updated the code to be more efficient on the server load. We integrated CAPTCHA to the checkout flow to help offset the use of bots. We implemented additional security protections to the store APIs. And more efforts are underway. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said the NVIDIA store would have GeForce RTX 3080s at 6 a.m. on September 17th, why did the store immediately go from \u201cnotify me\u201d to \u201cout of stock\u201d?\nAt 6 a.m. Pacific we attempted to push the NVIDIA store live.\u00a0 Instantly, the NVIDIA store was inundated with over 10 times the traffic of our previous generation launch, which took our internal systems to a crawl and encountered an error preventing sales from starting properly at 6:00am pacific. We were able to resolve the issues and process orders later than planned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI saw individuals who use bots/scripts celebrating the purchase of multiple GeForce RTX 3080 GPUs! Did bots get all of the available supply?\nNo. While individuals using bots may have shown images of email inboxes filled with confirmed orders, NVIDIA has cancelled hundreds of orders manually before they were able to ship. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did the NVIDIA Store not have any preventative measures in place to battle bots (i.e. CAPTCHA,etc)?\nThe NVIDIA Store had many behind-the-scenes security measures in place which proved sufficient for previous launches. This is the first time that we have seen bots at this scale and sophistication. Since launch, we have been quickly working on numerous security upgrades, including CAPTCHA. We will also continue to manually monitor purchases to help ensure cards get in the hands of legitimate consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did NVIDIA send \u201cNotify Me\u201d emails knowing that RTX 3080 FE was out of stock?\nWe intended for \u201cNotify Me\u201d emails to go out at 6:00 a.m. with the targeted start of availability. Due to the extreme demand and site traffic, we were unable to properly process orders on time. The emails were held back until the errors were resolved later that morning. Still, inventory sold out very quickly, so we were sold out by time most people opened their emails. In retrospect, we should not have sent the \u201cNotify Me\u201d emails.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThank you for listening, and thank you for your continued support as we navigate through this. We are excited that you are excited about the GeForce RTX 3080 and we are committed to do everything possible to catch up to the demand as quickly as we can.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Making the best use of a resource such as a GPU involves scalability when sharing GPU functionality. This is where the GPU profiles come into play. To achieve the best return on investment, density, or functionality, profiles are assigned to each VM. To get the best ArcGIS Pro user experience the minimum recommended frame buffer is 1024 MB (1 GB), which is shown as the 1Q profile. A 1Q or 1 GB frame buffer profile allows for the overall needed functionality. As workload demands on the GPU increase, as well as the additional needs from the operating system, additional frame buffer can be needed. Additional profiles offer more frame buffer from the GPU which can positively affect the user experience.\nGeoprocessing as well can make use of the GPU. New tools continue to be introduced that can be used for GPU compute. Tools such as Slope, Aspect, Viewshed2 and others take advantage of the GPU and offset the CPU usage. The GPU can also be used for inference when configured to use TensorFlow. ArcGIS Pro user types could be broken down in three categories:\n\nLight, Map creation and interactions. 2d, and light 3D Multipatch Rendering.\nMedium, Advanced data management and analysis, Deep Learning Inferencing.\nHeavy, High-end cartography and extensive analysis\n\nNVIDIA has produced many GPUs over the recent years. The first being the NVIDIA GRID Kepler architecture series, which was released in 2012. Since then, the Maxwell, Pascal, Volta, Turing, and the recently announced Ampere architecture. \u00a0Advancements in the Pascal architecture and later, allow for both visualization as well as high performance computing simultaneously. \u00a0This advancement allowed ArcGIS Pro to leverage the GPU for compute as well as Imagery.\u00a0 NVIDIA GPUs are classified by either performance, density, or blade optimized. V100, P40, and T4 are examples which are all classified as performance optimized graphics processors. \u00a0All these GPUs are meant for performance workloads such as heavy 3D visualization, machine or deep learning, or data science projects.\nThe NVIDIA Tesla T4 (with Quadro vDWS) is a GPU offering from NVIDIA on the Turing architecture that has offered the most diverse use cases for virtualizing ArcGIS Pro. The T4 is a low-profile, single PCIe slot form factor GPU with 16GB memory and 70w of power consumption. \u00a0With low power consumption and a good amount of memory, the T4 is an excellent choice for delivering various workload types within ArcGIS Pro.\u00a0 In addition, the size of the card offers a very large set of options that support scalability and density, as shown in other Esri/NVIDIA publications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArcGIS Pro continues to add new spatial analysis tools, as these new tools are developed or updated the focus of delivering faster compute times opens to using the GPU for compute in addition to using the CPU. One of the best examples of the impact of using a GPU for compute has been the use of the ViewShed2 analysis tool.\u00a0 ArcGIS Pro running this tool saw a dramatic improvement in processing time.\u00a0 In the example above the tool using the GPU for compute ran the analysis in less than 2 minutes versus 14 minutes.\u00a0 This is an example of the amount of time saved using the GPU to assist with compute processes. \u00a0Building on that and using CUDA when processing palm trees using the Detect objects using Deep Learning, and a trained network for inference.\u00a0 In other testing, detecting palm trees the compute time is dramatically faster.\u00a0 Instead of 30 minutes the process completes in 6 minutes.\u00a0 The advantage of the GPU here is clear, although delivering 3D is a key focus, the ability to save work hours on compute tasks is a welcome advancement.\nWe continue to see growth and adoption of ArcGIS Pro as utility companies, Higher Education, Gov\u2019t agencies and private companies utilize ArcGIS Pro in virtual environments.\u00a0 This continues to be enhanced to deliver 3D imagery and a fantastic user experience, enhanced with NVIDIA GPUs supporting the visual and compute analytical needs.\nFor additional information on the power of NVIDIA vGPU with ArcGIS Pro Check out the following blog:\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/09/25/esri-quadro-vdws/\nGet more insights about on how to remotely access ArcGIS Pro from virtual workstations from On-Prem data centers or cloud virtualization at the\u00a0GPU Technology Conference, taking place October 5-9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare this article\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nannouncements                    \n3d visualization & analytics                        \narcgis pro                        \nnvidia                        \nvirtualization                        \narcgis pro                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    Ryan Danzey                                \n\n\n                                Esri Performance Engineering.                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Article Discussion:\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n Subscribe\n\n\n\n\nLogin \n\n\n\n\nNotify of \n\n\nnew follow-up comments\nnew replies to my comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease login to comment\n\n\n\n\n1 Comment                    \n\n\n\nOldest\n\n\nNewest\n\n\n\n\n\n Inline Feedbacks                    \nView all comments\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    Load More Comments                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Related articles\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        March 12, 2020                                        | Ryan Danzey\n|\nBusiness\n\nAnnouncing the New ArcGIS Pro Virtualization White Paper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        October 16, 2019                                        |                                        Robert Brown\n                                        |\n3D Visualization & Analytics\n\nPrivate: Running Versatile GPU Workloads in ArcGIS Pro Virtualized Environments with NVIDIA Tesla T4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        March 16, 2020                                        |                                        Multiple Authors\n                                        |\nAnnouncements\n\nVirtualization of ArcGIS Pro from the Cloud and On-Premise platforms to support Higher Education\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsertYou are going to send email to SendMove CommentMove\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopens in new window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Upgrade Now          Nvidia taps Samsung, Micron for new gaming chips    FILE PHOTO: Nvidia at the E3 2017 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles \u00b7 Reuters     Stephen Nellis   September 2, 2020 2 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -3.36%     SSNLF   0.00%    MU   -1.28%      By Stephen Nellis (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp <NVDA.O> on Tuesday announced a series of powerful gaming chips it designed using new memory tech from Micron Technology Inc <MU.O> and that it is having manufactured by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS>. The Santa Clara, California-based company said its GeForce RTX 3090, 3080 and 3070 chips will improve video game graphics with twice the performance and nearly twice the power efficiency of previous versions.  Nvidia has long worked with a variety of chip manufacturers to fabricate its devices, and more recently has relied on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd <2330.TW> for its most advanced chips. Samsung will make the new GeForce chips with its 8-nanometer chipmaking process rather than its latest 5nm process. However, Nvidia officials said they worked with Samsung to customize the process so that Nvidia chips will be about 10% faster than other Samsung-made chips manufactured with the same 8nm process. \"Process technology is a lot more complex than a number. I think people have simplified it down to almost a ridiculous level,\" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told investors on a conference call last month, explaining why the company does not always use the newest chipmaking technology. Nvidia's chips use a number of technologies to boost graphics performance, such as using an artificial intelligence processor to make predictions about how light rays should move in a scene rather than manually calculating each ray. The newest chips also use memory technology that Micron has been developing since 2006 called GDDR6X to double the amount of data that can be shoveled into Nvidia's chip for processing. \"Unlike traditional memory, GDDR6X has unparalleled data rates that can keep pace with gaming innovation and data-hungry applications,\" said Tom Eby, senior vice president and general manager of the compute and networking business unit at Micron.

By combining the modularity and openness of the DRIVE Sim simulation software platform with highly accurate vehicle models like dSPACE\u2019s, every minor aspect of an AV can be thoroughly recreated, tested and validated.\nThe dSPACE ASM vehicle dynamics model makes it possible to simulate elements of the car \u2014 suspension, tires, brakes \u2014 all the way to the full vehicle powertrain and its interaction with the electronic control units that power actions such as steering, braking and acceleration.\nAs the world continues to work from home, simulation has become an even more crucial tool in autonomous vehicle development. However, to be effective, it must be able to translate to real-world driving.\ndSPACE\u2019s modeling capabilities are key to understanding vehicle behavior in diverse conditions, enabling the exhaustive and high-fidelity testing required for safe self-driving deployment.\nDetailed Validation\nHigh-fidelity simulation is more than just a realistic-looking car driving in a recreated traffic scenario. It means in any given situation, the simulated vehicle will behave just as a real vehicle driving in the real world would.\nIf an autonomous vehicle suddenly brakes on a wet road, there are a range of forces that affect how and where the vehicle stops. It could slide further than intended or fishtail, depending on the weather and road conditions. These possibilities require the ability to simulate dynamics such as friction and yaw, or the way the vehicle moves vertically.\nThe dSPACE ASM vehicle dynamics model includes these factors, which can then be compared with a real vehicle in the same scenario. It also tests how the same model acts in different simulation environments, ensuring consistency with both on-road driving and virtual fleet testing.\nA Comprehensive and Diverse Platform\nThe NVIDIA DRIVE Sim platform taps into the computing horsepower of NVIDIA RTX GPUs to deliver a revolutionary, scalable, cloud-based computing platform, capable of generating billions of qualified miles for autonomous vehicle testing.\nIt\u2019s open, meaning both users and partners can incorporate their own models in simulation for comprehensive and diverse driving scenarios.\ndSPACE chose to integrate its vehicle dynamics ASM with DRIVE Sim due to its ability to scale for a wide range of testing conditions. When running on the NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation platform, it can perform both software-in-the-loop and hardware-in-the-loop testing, which includes the in-vehicle AV computer controlling the vehicle in the simulation process. dSPACE\u2019s broad expertise and long track-record in hardware-in-the-loop simulation make for a seamless implementation of ASM on DRIVE Constellation.\nLearn more about the dSPACE ASM vehicle dynamics in the DRIVE Sim platform at the company\u2019s upcoming GTC session \u2014 register before Sept. 25 to receive Early Bird pricing.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | NVIDIA DRIVE Sim | Simulation and Design | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This 80% frame rate increase ensures smooth viewport movement while displaying photo-realistic visuals, helping architects experiment with designs in real-time, and making it easier to share their visions with clients.\nD5 Render also uses DLSS to speed up video scene exports, reducing export times by 50% on average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Courtesy of D5 Render\nSheenCity Mars is an architectural visualization application built for advanced designers with robust tool sets, supporting RTX real-time ray tracing and now, DLSS support for more responsive 3D designs.\nWith this update, users can enjoy higher frame rates with DLSS Quality mode doubling frame rates compared to native resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Courtesy of SheenCity and Chengdu Shangbai Architectural Design Consulting Co., Ltd.\nThe new NVIDIA Broadcast app upgrades any room into a home broadcast studio by transforming standard webcams and microphones into smart devices through the power of AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Broadcast is free and works with most popular live streaming, voice chat and video conferencing apps. It\u2019s supported on any NVIDIA GeForce RTX, TITAN RTX or Quadro RTX GPU, using their dedicated Tensor Core AI processors to help the app\u2019s AI networks run in real-time. NVIDIA Broadcast offers three powerful AI features:\n\nNoise Removal: remove background noise from your microphone feed \u2013 be it a dog barking or the doorbell ringing. The AI network can even be used on incoming audio feeds to mute that one keyboard-mashing friend or collaborator.\nVirtual Background: remove the background of your webcam feed and replace it with an alternative image, Windows app, a game, or even a subtle blur.\nAuto Frame: zooms in on you and uses AI to track your head movements, keeping you at the center of the action even as you shift from side to side. It\u2019s like having your own cameraperson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the new AI-Powered NVIDIA Broadcast app here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the Latest RTX 30 Series-powered App Updates\nNVIDIA is working with your favorite creative app developers to ensure maximum performance on new RTX 30 Series GPUs.

It\u2019s easy to capture with a variety of tools, and provides a good gauge of GPU throughput. However, it is not the only metric that matters when assessing GPU performance.\nPower and Latency are often overlooked because they are difficult to accurately measure and tend to be less relatable to viewers.\u00a0Enter the NVIDIA Reviewer Toolkit for Graphics Performance - an easy to use suite of hardware and software tools designed to help reviewers measure and report power and latency metrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis toolkit provides three tools to measure GPU performance:\n\nLatency and Display Analysis Tool (LDAT) - used to measure end to end system latency\nPower Capture Analysis Tool (PCAT) - used to measure total GPU board power in isolation\nFrameView 1.4 - Improved version of FrameView that ties everything together\n\nLDAT and PCAT are engineering tools that NVIDIA is sharing with reviewers to help them better evaluate hardware and games. We are covering them in this article so that gamers can understand how the tools work and why the data they provide matters to product reviews. They are similar in approach to FCAT - simple hardware tools with a lightweight software application user interface.\nLet\u2019s dive into each reviewer tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLDAT\nMeasuring end-to-end system latency traditionally requires recording the input and display using a high-speed camera and then counting the individual frames. This is both expensive and tedious.\nTo simplify the process of measuring system latency, NVIDIA has created an intuitive and powerful hardware latency measurement tool called LDAT (Latency Display Analysis Tool). LDAT is a discrete hardware analyser that uses a luminance sensor to quickly and accurately measure the motion-to-photon (click-to-muzzle flash) latency in a game or application. LDAT is cross platform and works with GPUs from all vendors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLDAT adds a totally new dimension to measuring and tuning gaming performance, and can answer questions like: \u201cHow does resolution or certain in-game settings and effects impact overall end-to-end latency?\u201d, or, \u201cHow can I tune settings to reduce latency and still maintain great image quality?\u201d, or, \u201cHow does latency compare among different games I play, and which ones need more latency tuning than others?\u201d. Capturing such data was complex and very time consuming in the past\u2014if possible at all. LDAT makes this data available easily and quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLDAT has been NVIDIA\u2019s goto internal tool for latency measurement. With the launch of our new low latency technology, NVIDIA Reflex, we wanted to share our internal testing tool with reviewers so they can effectively and easily measure this important performance metric. LDAT can help test latency on a variety of displays, save time compared to the old high speed camera method, and increase accuracy of measurements. For gamers, we have new NVIDIA G-SYNC 360Hz Esports displays coming to market this fall that effectively have LDAT built directly into the monitor -- we call it the NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyser, and it will put the power of system latency measurement directly into your hands for the first time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPCAT\nGPU power efficiency is critical for the success of a graphics architecture. With an efficient GPU, the graphics card outputs less heat and noise. Why is that important?\nOne way to increase performance is by reducing power consumption. That\u2019s because a GPU is limited by the amount of heat it can dissipate, so an efficient design directly translates to peak performance. Performance-per-watt efficiency results in designs with higher performance, lower noise, more overclocking headroom, and greater framerates.\nPCAT (Power Capture Analysis Tool) is a combination of hardware and software that provides accurate perf-per-watt and total graphics board power measurements. PCAT is designed to make the process of collecting and analysing power data very easy. This is accomplished with a PCI Express Riser that sits between the GPU and motherboard to gather data. That data is then sent to the PCAT Module, then finally to the software analyser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method of measuring power has many benefits:\n\nEasy to use PCIe graphics card power measurement\nWorks with any GPU vendor (does not rely on private API calls)\nDirect measurement of total board power (no more guessing and extrapolating)\nAccurate to within one-thousandth of a watt (assuming reasonable voltages)\nNo soldering required\n\nThis new, easy way to measure power enables reviewers to look at true GPU board power. Power APIs are not nearly as accurate and are typically not cross vendor and have different definitions of board power. For more details on power APIs, check our power primer. If you are looking to compare power efficiency between GPUs, PCAT is a great option for easily measuring total power power and efficiency insolation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrameView 1.4\nFor those who haven\u2019t used FrameView, FrameView is NVIDIA\u2019s software tool designed to capture and measure performance and power utilisation of PC-based graphics and CPU hardware. It\u2019s especially useful for measuring frame rates and GPU power usage when running stressful \u201creal world\u201d PC gaming scenarios. FrameView captures performance and power data with minimal overhead so as not to impact frame rates or gameplay, and includes an overlay that shows performance and power metrics as a game is being played. It also allows benchmarks runs to be captured and charted in detailed reports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this release, there a number of new features and key changes:\n\nLogs and Summary files have been completely restructured based on user feedback. Summary files now contain references to each log file in that directory - making it truly a summary of the benchmarking session\nA new FrameView Excel Analyser template that consumes log files and automatically creates charts that can be stylized to the reviewers needs\nVulkan Overlay support\nPCAT integration such that power metrics can be added to the logs directly from PCAT\nA new installer to make updating frameview easy\nNew metrics: CPU metrics, Render Present Latency, and system parameters\n\nTo download FrameView, or for more information including the user guide, please head here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrapping up\nThe NVIDIA Reviewer Toolkit for Graphics Performance offers reviewers an easy way to measure more than just FPS when assessing the performance of a GPU. Using new innovative tools like LDAT and PCAT, reviewers can increase the quality of their review by adding both power and latency to their host of tests. For gamers, that means reviewers and influencers can more effectively help you take these important factors into consideration when looking for your next upgrade.\nFrameView 1.4 is available for download today. LDAT and PCAT are being made available to select tech reviewers around the globe to incorporate into hardware and game reviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\n#SHOTWITHGEFORCE\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United Kingdom\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It\u2019s packed with 24GB of cutting-edge GDDR6X memory. It\u2019s the world\u2019s fastest graphics card \u2014 much faster than the previous generation TITAN RTX.\nSimilar to TITAN RTX, GeForce RTX 3090 will appeal to the most demanding users. It\u2019s great for creators making movies and rendering cinematics. It\u2019s sure to appeal to researchers building systems for data science and AI. And, of course, it\u2019s ideal for extreme gamers who want to experience the new world of 8K gaming.\nThe GeForce RTX 3090 enables creators who push their creations to the limits of graphics hardware with professional creation applications and with large models, detailed scenes, and high-resolution textures.\nRendering in these types of applications not only requires a more powerful GPU. It requires more GPU memory. Creators using the GeForce RTX 3090 will find that they can work with datasets that are more than twice as large as those that will fit into the memory of the GeForce RTX 3080.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor gamers pushing the limits, the GeForce RTX 3090 is also the first GPU that lets you connect, play, capture, and watch in 8K HDR. That\u2019s an insane 4x the pixels of 4K and 16x the pixels of 1080p.\nFor 4K gaming, the GeForce RTX 3090 is about 10-15% faster on average than the GeForce RTX 3080, and up to 50% faster than the TITAN RTX.\nSince we built GeForce RTX 3090 for a unique group of users, like the TITAN RTX before it, we want to apologize upfront that this will be in limited supply on launch day. We know this is frustrating, and we\u2019re working with our partners to increase the supply in the weeks to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But one software company was prepared from the beginning by using virtualization.\nFor California-based Esri, virtual machines have been essential to software developers. Since the teams are globally dispersed, they use a virtual environment where everyone can log in and create daily builds or run tests of Esri\u2019s ArcGIS software.\nWith NVIDIA Quadro Virtual Data Center Workstation (Quadro vDWS), Esri employees across the globe can easily log into VMs and run their complex tasks from any location. This helped Esri employees quickly shift to working remotely when the pandemic occurred.\nThe GPU-accelerated virtual workstations provide developers with the performance and flexibility needed to continue running computationally intensive workflows, even when working outside of the office.\nImage credit courtesy of Esri. Data from City of Montreal.\nQuadro vDWS Brings More Flexibility, Mobility and Power\nEsri develops ArcGIS, the world\u2019s most powerful mapping and spatial analytics software, which enables users to visualize and analyze data from 2D and 3D maps with its ArcGIS Pro desktop application.\nEsri learned years ago that its ArcGIS workflows required GPUs to provide a smoother user experience while panning and zooming 2D/3D data, as well as to accelerate performance for geospatial functionalities like deep learning.\nThe software development teams also run automatic and holistic tests on ArcGIS Pro nearly every day of the week, but when it comes to the larger tasks, their physical workstations don\u2019t always have enough power.\nWith Quadro vDWS, developers get GPU acceleration to create software daily builds, run tests during the development cycle and ultimately build released versions of ArcGIS. Employees from around the world can easily log into the virtual environment, while IT can provide VMs that vary in GPU capabilities and memory.\nThis flexibility allows Esri to categorize its software developers and create GPU-powered VMs based on their needs and workflows \u2014 whether they\u2019re testing pieces of functionality, building features related to deep learning or using certain scripts.\nImage credit courtesy of Esri. Data created with Bentley\u2019s ContextCapture product.\nAnd since Esri has been using VDI for many years, the company adjusted quickly when coronavirus cases started to spread, requiring everyone to work remotely. It\u2019s like the employees never left the office, as the Quadro Virtual Workstations performed just as well as physical ones.\n\u201cWhat was surprising was how smoothly the transition was, because we have a large virtualized environment where people can still get a lot of things done,\u201d said John Meza, performance engineering team lead at Esri. \u201cWe can continue to run processes and create large builds, just like we could when we were in the office. We did not miss a beat.\u201d\nIn addition to increased flexibility and mobility, Esri takes advantage of virtualization benefits like centralized maintenance and administration, including OS-level patching, virus scanning and driver updates.\nGet more insights about virtualization at the GPU Technology Conference, taking place October 5-9, when Esri representatives will share best practices on how to remotely access Esri ArcGIS Pro with Quadro-powered virtual workstations from the data center or cloud.\n\n\nCategories: Graphics Virtualization | Pro GraphicsTags: GTC 2020 | Quadro | Remote Work | Virtualization \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The GeForce RTX 3080 is supposed to deliver twice the performance of the RTX 2080 at the same price. It\u2019s even supposed to surpass the RTX 2080 Ti, providing solid 4K gaming performance for much less than Nvidia\u2019s last-generation cards cost. This is all while taking advantage of ray tracing and Nvidia\u2019s special AI-powered DLSS tech that boosts frame rates while maintaining image quality. Nvidia had similar promises before for 4K gaming with the RTX 2080. But with the RTX 3080, it\u2019s delivering on them.The RTX 3080 is part of Nvidia\u2019s 3000 series of graphics cards, all powered by the company\u2019s new Ampere architecture. There\u2019s the RTX 3070 (starting at $499), the RTX 3080 (starting at $699), and the RTX 3090 (starting at $1,499). You can\u2019t preorder any of these latest cards, and the RTX 3080 will arrive in stores on September 17th, with the RTX 3090 following on September 24th. While the RTX 3070 doesn\u2019t arrive until October 15th, it also promises performance that exceeds both the RTX 2080 and RTX 2080 Ti.I\u2019ve spent the past week putting the RTX 3080 through its paces at both 4K and 1440p, and I\u2019m impressed with what I\u2019ve seen. 4K gaming arrived with the RTX 2080 Ti, but $1,199 was far beyond most people\u2019s budgets. The RTX 3080 does the same and more at a much more affordable price point.8Verge ScoreNvidia RTX 3080$0The GoodVery quiet and coolGreat for 1440p or 4K gamingDLSS is transformativeThe Bad750W power supply requirement and extra power drawClunky 12-pin power adapter10GB of memoryHow we rate and review productsHardwareNvidia could have stuck with the big changes it made to the RTX 2080 cooling, but it\u2019s gone a step further with its hardware on the RTX 3080. The first noticeable change is that the dual-fan setup has shifted so there\u2019s one fan on either side of the card. Nvidia is using a push-pull system here, with the bottom fan pulling (hopefully cool) air into the card, then exhausting the warm air on the opposite side close to your CPU cooler and rear case fan. A traditional blower cooler also exhausts the hot air out of the PCIe slot and thus out of your case entirely.This creates a more optimal airflow, reducing GPU temperatures and delivering a quieter card. I didn\u2019t hear any noticeable differences against the RTX 2080 that I\u2019ve been comparing the RTX 3080 to this week, as both are quiet cards. There had been some concern that this cooling system could negatively affect CPU temperatures, but I didn\u2019t observe any issues during my tests. It\u2019s possible that, in some rigs, it could affect CPU temperatures, but I think for the vast majority of cases, it will be a non-issue.Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3080 design includes a new pennant-shaped board. Photo by Tom Warren / The VergePhoto by Tom Warren / The VergePhoto by Tom Warren / The VergeThe second major change to the RTX 3080 is the addition of a 12-pin single power connector, as opposed to the separate 6- and 8-pin or twin 8-pin connectors on prior cards. I like what Nvidia has done here, but the early implementation means you have to use an included adapter that\u2019s ugly and awkward. You connect two 8-pin PCIe power connectors to it, and the adapter then dangles out of the side of the card. Thankfully, power supply vendors like Corsair are planning single cables that will plug directly into Nvidia\u2019s new 12-pin connector. I\u2019d highly recommend ordering one of these if you (like me) care about cable management. Third-party cards are sticking with the regular dual 8-pin connectors, too.The third big change that might not be immediately noticeable is Nvidia\u2019s switch to a new pennant-shaped board for the RTX 3080. Combined with the new cooling shroud, this pennant shape makes for a really good-looking graphics card. There are no visible screws, and even the regular FCC and regulatory notices have been moved to the output end of the card to keep its appearance clean.Speaking of outputs, there\u2019s a single HDMI 2.1 port and three DisplayPort 1.4a ports. Nvidia has dropped the USB-C VirtualLink port found on the RTX 2080, which never saw any real adoption for VR. The RTX 3080 LED also lights up in pure white now, instead of the green found on the 2080. There\u2019s even a subtle white glow around part of the top fan. I\u2019m impressed with this new design, and it looks great sitting in a case if you have a side window.The only bad part of this new hardware is the power requirement. Nvidia is recommending at least a 750W power supply for the RTX 3080, as it can draw up to 320 watts by itself. That\u2019s a 42 percent jump from the 225-watt draw with the RTX 2080, which is understandable for the performance improvement but also disappointing for its impact on the environment and electricity bills.1440p testingI\u2019ve been testing the RTX 3080 on the same machine I used for the RTX 2080 review two years ago. While it doesn\u2019t have the latest and greatest CPU, I found Microsoft Flight Simulator, which is incredibly CPU-intensive, was the only game that was difficult to test on this rig.Test machine for 1440p and 4K:Processor: Intel Core i7-7700K 4.2GHz 4-CoreCPU Cooler: Corsair H100i v2Motherboard: Asus ROG STRIX Z270H GAMINGRAM: Corsair Vengeance 32GB (4 x 8GB) DDR4-3000Storage: Samsung 970 Evo 512GB M.2 SSDCase: Corsair Carbide 400QPSU: Corsair 850W RMx Series RM850xFor 1440p tests, I hooked up the RTX 3080 to a 27-inch Asus ROG Swift PG279Q monitor. This monitor supports refresh rates up to 165Hz plus G-Sync, so it\u2019s an ideal match for an RTX 3080 at 1440p resolution. I\u2019ve also been testing 4K performance, which you can find below.I\u2019ve been playing a variety of AAA titles all week to get a feel for what the 3080 is like. I\u2019ve also performed average frame rate testing and used built-in benchmarks across a variety of games, including Fortnite, Control, Death Stranding, Metro Exodus, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Microsoft Flight Simulator. All games were tested at max or ultra settings, and most regularly exceeded the 100fps average mark at 1440p.Fortnite hit an average of 161fps with maxed-out settings, and even Warzone hit 116fps on average. Both of these games are competitive shooters where you\u2019d typically lower settings to hit these types of averages on other cards, but the RTX 3080 was able to deliver a smooth high frame rate experience consistently.Even when playing more demanding titles like Control or Metro Exodus, the RTX 3080 improved performance at 1440p by nearly 60 percent or more from the previous RTX 2080 card. That put Metro Exodus to a far more playable average of 57fps with the RTX 3080, compared to the 36fps average on the RTX 2080 at extreme settings.RTX 3080 review (1440p)BenchmarkRTX 2080 Founders EditionRTX 3080 Founders Edition% changeMicrosoft Flight Simulator22fps29fpsup 32%Shadow of the Tomb Raider65fps96fpsup 48%Shadow of the Tomb Raider (DLSS)99fps117fpsup 18%CoD: Warzone96fps116fpsup 21%Gears 584fps95fpsup 13%Fortnite108fps161fpsup 49%CS:GO191fps263fpsup 38%Destiny 298fps109fpsup 11%Death Stranding113fps149fpsup 32%Death Stranding (DLSS quality)143fps159fpsup 11%Control79fps141fpsup 78%Control (DLSS quality + RT)77fps121fpsup 57%Control (RT)57fps91fpsup 60%Control (DLSS)118fps144fpsup 18%Metro Exodus36fps57fpsup 58%Metro Exodus (RT)23fps38fpsup 65%Metro Exodus (DLSS+RT)43fps66fpsup 53%Gaming on the RTX 3080 at 1440p meant I could easily take advantage of the higher refresh rates on the Asus ROG Swift PG279Q monitor; if I was willing to drop image quality just a little, I could get the full 165Hz. The RTX 3080 feels like a very comfortable option for 1440p, even for some of the most demanding AAA titles.If you\u2019re upgrading from a GTX 1080 or something older and thinking of moving from a 1080p monitor to 1440p, you won\u2019t be disappointed with the RTX 3080 at all. If you\u2019re aiming to be as competitive as possible and delving into the esports side of gaming, then a 1080p resolution monitor with the RTX 3080 would obviously provide even higher frame rates. For most people, though, the RTX 3080 provides solid headroom for a move to 1440p.Nvidia\u2019s 12-pin power connector on the RTX 3080. Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge4K testingThe RTX 2080 was supposed to deliver 4K gaming at a more affordable $699 price point, but it wasn\u2019t able to handle 60fps or more in demanding games with all of the settings maxed out. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve focused the majority of my RTX 3080 testing on 4K, pairing the card with Acer\u2019s 27-inch Nitro XV273K, a 4K monitor that offers up to 144Hz refresh rates, G-Sync, and even HDR support. In nearly every game I tested with the RTX 3080 at 4K, I was able to hit or exceed 60fps.I\u2019ve been truly amazed that I can run around in Call of Duty: Warzone with everything maxed out at 4K and still get 85fps on average. There were certainly times when action briefly dipped below 60fps, but this was rare and mostly when I was parachuting in rather than in combat situations.The performance increase at 4K from the RTX 2080 to RTX 3080 is significant. In most games, it was 60 percent or more, transforming Shadow of the Tomb Raider from just 32fps on average on the RTX 2080 to 57fps on the RTX 3080.RTX 3080 review (4K)BenchmarkRTX 2080 Founders EditionRTX 3080 Founders Edition% changeMicrosoft Flight Simulator17fps29fpsup 70%Shadow of the Tomb Raider32fps57fpsup 78%Shadow of the Tomb Raider (DLSS)65fps94fpsup 44%CoD: Warzone61fps85fpsup 39%CoD: Warzone (RT)57fps80fpsup 40%Gears 549fps80fpsup 63%Fortnite53fps98fpsup 85%CS:GO205fps261fpsup 27%Destiny 263fps80fpsup 27%Death Stranding66fps103fpsup 56%Death Stranding (DLSS quality)88fps135fpsup 53%Control40fps72fpsup 80%Control (DLSS quality + RT)50fps72fpsup 44%Control (RT)23fps45fpsup 95%Control (DLSS)67fps114fpsup 70%Metro Exodus15fps35fpsup 133%Metro Exodus (RT)10fps17fpsup 70%Metro Exodus (DLSS+RT)30fps49fpsup 63%Metro Exodus (DLSS)60fps61fpsup 1.6%Control was unplayable a lot of times with the RTX 2080 at max settings on 4K resolution, thanks to its physics-defying gameplay and the game\u2019s demanding specs. Control is very GPU-intensive and uses a variety of graphics techniques to produce some visually stunning gameplay. That\u2019s why gameplay regularly dipped below 30fps on the older RTX 2080, adding horrible input lag to the fast-paced shooting scenes. But on the RTX 3080, it averaged 72fps, with only occasional dips below 60fps. It\u2019s an 80 percent jump, which is staggeringly good.I also saw huge improvements in Fortnite, with average frame rates jumping 85 percent from the RTX 2080 to the RTX 3080. You can run Fortnite with maxed-out settings and still maintain 98fps on average. That\u2019s an impressive jump over the 53fps average on the RTX 2080.I wish I hadn\u2019t borrowed a 4K monitor for the RTX 3080 testing because now I want to spend money and upgrade from the 1440p display I own. The level of performance and detail has genuinely left me impressed, even as someone who typically prefers the higher frame rates available at 1440p or 1080p for competitive shooters.The only slight pause I have here is the 10GB of memory available on the RTX 3080. While Nvidia says the average game uses 4 to 6GB of memory at 4K at the moment, I do fear this will jump a lot closer to maxing out the RTX 3080 memory for future games if you want the very best settings. I might not normally have such a concern with a new card, but given the next-gen consoles are pushing 4K gaming, improved CPUs, and ray tracing, we\u2019re bound to see game developers push recommended specs even further in the years ahead. Max settings and performance are always a delicate balance, but I would have loved to have seen 12GB here.Nvidia says it\u2019s using 10GB, as most games don\u2019t need the additional memory right now, and the company had to get the right balance of extra memory and the pricing of the RTX 3080. It does leave the door very open for Nvidia to introduce an RTX 3080 Ti in the future with additional memory, particularly as the RTX 3090 will ship with 24GB of memory.The RTX 3080 also doesn\u2019t allow me to take full advantage of the 144Hz refresh rates on Acer\u2019s XV273K at 4K, once again leaving the door open for a card with a little more performance to take us firmly into 4K gaming at even more impressive frame rates.Still, 4K gaming is absolutely here at playable frame rates for a much more affordable price. That\u2019s a big jump, and it will hopefully influence the price of 4K monitors to improve the affordability aspect even further. You had to pay $1,199 for just a graphics card to even get close to this level of performance with the RTX 2080 Ti, and the RTX 3080 offers impressive 4K performance for its $699 price point.Screws aren\u2019t exposed on Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3080. Photo by Tom Warren / The VergePhoto by Tom Warren / The VergePhoto by Tom Warren / The VergeRay tracing and DLSSWhile the door is left open for something a little more powerful than the RTX 3080, Nvidia has some special tricks to improve performance and even image quality. When I originally reviewed the RTX 2080 two years ago, I wasn\u2019t able to test ray tracing or DLSS, Nvidia\u2019s AI super sampling technology. Back then, Nvidia was promising these tricks would eventually improve visual quality and frame rates, and add prettier cinematic effects in games. But there weren\u2019t any games at the RTX 2080 launch to back up Nvidia\u2019s claims, so they sounded like vague promises for the future.That future has now started to arrive, and more games are now supporting both ray tracing and DLSS. Nvidia\u2019s DLSS technology uses neural networks and AI supercomputers to analyze games and sharpen or clean up images at lower resolutions. In simple terms, DLSS allows a game to render at a lower resolution and use Nvidia\u2019s image reconstruction technique to upscale the image and make it look as good as native 4K or better.RTX 3080 (DLSS + raytracing at 4K)BenchmarkRTX 3080 Founders EditionShadow of the Tomb Raider57fpsShadow of the Tomb Raider (DLSS)94fpsCoD: Warzone85fpsCoD: Warzone (RT)80fpsFortnite98fpsFortnite (RT)20fpsFortnite (RT + DLSS quality)39fpsFortnite (RT+ DLSS perf)54fpsFortnite (DLSS quality)126fpsFortnite (DLSS perf)156fpsDeath Stranding103fpsDeath Stranding (DLSS quality)135fpsDeath Stranding (DLSS perf)147fpsControl72fpsControl (DLSS quality + RT)72fpsControl (RT)45fpsControl (DLSS quality)114fpsMetro Exodus35fpsMetro Exodus (Ultra RT)17fpsMetro Exodus (DLSS+ Ultra RT)49fpsMetro Exodus (DLSS)61fpsI\u2019m surprised at how good DLSS works and the performance benefits it provides. Every game implements it slightly differently, offering both performance modes and quality modes so you can opt for better frame rates over image quality. In Control, I was able to enable its ray-tracing mode to improve visuals while also enabling DLSS and maintaining the same frame rate I would with both options turned off. I found it incredibly difficult to notice any image quality reductions from DLSS in Control. You\u2019d have to compare them side by side to really dig into the differences, as DLSS is just that good.I enabled ray tracing in Call of Duty: Warzone and didn\u2019t notice a significant performance hit. But I have to be honest: it was hard to spot the difference. In Control with just ray tracing enabled, the performance hit was more significant at 4K, rendering at 45fps on average and lots of dips below 30fps. In Metro Exodus, it made the game unplayable unless I enabled DLSS, too.Nvidia\u2019s RTX off / on comparison in Control.I saw similar results in Fortnite, which has only just implemented ray tracing and DLSS. The ray tracing in Fortnite offers a lot more obvious improvements, including shadows and reflections around trees and lakes and just a general layer of polish on top of the game. Fortnite looks a lot more alive with ray tracing on.Unfortunately, the performance hit in Fortnite with ray tracing is significant if you max out all of the ray-traced effects. I went from 98fps on max settings all the way down to just 20fps with the maximum settings and maximum ray tracing. Even DLSS couldn\u2019t help bring things up much further, improving the average frame rate to 39fps with ray tracing turned on.DLSS without ray tracing offers a huge performance benefit in 4K for Fortnite, though. I tried the performance DLSS option, and I got around 135fps average frame rates, up from the already impressive 103fps average without DLSS.DLSS was also able to bump Metro Exodus up to much better frame rates. Performance went from 35fps to 61fps with DLSS enabled, making the game a lot smoother to play. In Control, DLSS also pushed frame rates beyond 100fps on average to 114fps. That\u2019s an impressive 58 percent jump.Ray tracing still feels like it\u2019s in its infancy, and I think game developers will really need to implement it across entire games instead of selectively to make a far bigger difference to the experience of a game. The performance hit is also often too big to enable ray tracing alone, but combined with DLSS, it makes it more of an option. DLSS is so good that it takes the huge performance hit from ray tracing and counteracts it to make games playable again.List of games with DLSS or ray tracing supportGamesRT / DLSS / Reflex SupportOut Now / Coming SoonAmid EvilRay Tracing & DLSSOut NowAnthemDLSSOut NowBattlefield VRay Tracing & DLSSOut NowCall of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)Ray TracingOut NowControlRay Tracing & DLSSOut NowDeliver Us The MoonRay Tracing & DLSSOut NowFortniteRay Tracing & DLSSOut NowMechwarrior V: MercenariesRay Tracing & DLSSOut NowMetro ExodusRay Tracing & DLSSOut NowMinecraft RTXRay Tracing & DLSSOut NowQuake II RTXRay TracingOut NowShadow of the Tomb RaiderRay Tracing & DLSSOut NowStay in the LightRay TracingOut NowWolfenstein: YoungbloodRay Tracing & DLSSOut NowF1 2020DLSSOut NowDeath StrandingDLSSOut NowAtomic HeartRay Tracing & DLSSComing SoonBright MemoryRay Tracing & DLSSComing SoonBoundaryRay Tracing & DLSSComing SoonCall Of Duty: Black Ops Cold WarRay Tracing & DLSSComing SoonCyberpunk 2077Ray Tracing & DLSSComing SoonDying Light 2Ray Tracing & DLSSComing SoonEnlistedRay Tracing & DLSSComing SoonJusticeRay Tracing & DLSSComing SoonSword & Fairy 7Ray TracingComing SoonSYNCED: Off PlanetRay TracingComing SoonVampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2Ray Tracing & DLSSComing SoonWatch Dogs: LegionRay Tracing & DLSSComing SoonWorld Of Warcraft: ShadowlandsRay TracingComing SoonI think DLSS is going to be the option most people will want to enable, though. We\u2019ve seen a variety of image reconstruction techniques over the years to improve image quality from lower-render resolutions. A variety of PS4 Pro and Xbox One X games use checkerboarding techniques to hit 4K resolutions at reasonable frame rates. DLSS is equally impressive on the PC side, delivering some notable results at the simple flick of a switch.Nvidia has also improved DLSS with a version 2.0, supported on its range of RTX cards, which makes it easier to train and should mean even more games support it in the future. Nvidia is promising improved visual quality and better performance gains for games that support DLSS 2.0, and the best thing is that games will be able to offer a variety of options for picking between performance and quality modes.Some of the biggest games launching later this year \u2014 including Cyberpunk 2077, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, and Watch Dogs: Legion \u2014 will also include both ray-traced effects and DLSS support.Nvidia\u2019s big promise of 4K gaming at 60fps for the RTX 2080 didn\u2019t hold up. The only viable option was the $1,199 RTX 2080 Ti, which was a serious investment for 4K gaming two years ago. The RTX 3080 will help transform the reality of 4K gaming on PC at a much more affordable $699 price point. Nvidia is also promising big jumps for performance with the RTX 3070 at just $499, so it certainly feels like 4K gaming on PC is about to be a lot more affordable even if the RTX 3070 means you need to lower some settings.The RTX 3080 ushers in the next generation of 4K gaming, thanks to some raw horsepower and a lot of the promises that Nvidia made with the RTX 2080 finally starting to materialize. DLSS and ray tracing were merely promises of where the future of PC games would move two years ago. But with games like Minecraft, Control, Fortnite, and Call of Duty supporting Nvidia\u2019s latest technology, it\u2019s a reality that\u2019s here with the RTX 3080. The next generation of consoles will also start to support ray tracing, meaning we\u2019re bound to see even more games throughout 2021 and beyond that can add ray tracing and soften its blow with DLSS.Nvidia tells me the RTX 3080 cards are in volume production with \u201cgreat\u201d yields, and that it\u2019s \u201cmaking them as fast as we can.\u201d I still can\u2019t help but feel there\u2019s going to be a lot of pent up demand here, so the biggest problem might be actually buying one of these cards in the coming weeks.The RTX 3080 will be will a staggering leap in performance if you\u2019re upgrading from something like a GTX 1080, especially at 1440p or if you\u2019re moving to 4K. That could tempt a whole host of people to upgrade, especially those who avoided the RTX 2000 series.If you\u2019re interested in making the jump to 1440p instead of 4K, then the RTX 3080 will give you so much headroom I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need to upgrade your PC for years. On the 4K side, you\u2019ll be upgrading to a card that provides solid frame rates with all of the settings maxed out without putting a hole in your wallet. 4K PC gaming is here, and it\u2019s finally a lot more affordable.Photography by Tom Warren / The VergeSee More: EntertainmentGamingGPU ReviewsNvidiaPC GamingReviewsTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019Lego announces Pok\u00e9mon sets are coming next yearInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

It  lets you play at 1440p and 4K resolution without compromises, even with ray tracing and DLSS enabled. It takes a lot of power, though. Nvidia\u2019s Founders Edition model looks sleek and has a radical cooler, but it offers limited repairability and puts its 12-pin power adapter in an ugly place.\n\n\t\t\tBest Prices Today: GeForce RTX 3080\t\t\n\n\n\n\nRetailer\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,494.68\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nView Deal \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card symbolizes why we tell people to wait for the second generation when bleeding-edge technology appears.\nThe radical new-look Turing GPUs inside Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 20-series packed all sorts of cutting-edge technologies designed to usher in real-time ray tracing, a long sought-after goal for the gaming industry. Not only did Turing introduce specialized RT cores devoted to processing ray tracing tasks, it also debuted tensor cores, dedicated hardware that uses machine learning to help denoise ray traced visuals and enable AI-enhanced tools like the fantastic Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology. Turing\u2019s improvements also extended to the traditional shader cores, introducing an overhauled processing pipeline better equipped to handle games built using the newer DirectX 12 and Vulkan graphics APIs. All of these were huge departures from the norm.\n\nBut new doesn\u2019t always mean great. While the RTX 20-series indeed birthed a new ray-traced era, games that supported ray tracing or DLSS were few and far between over its lifetime. Worse, the RTX 20-series cards offered essentially the same performance in traditional games as their older GTX 10-series predecessors at the same price point. The initial reception (and sales) weren\u2019t glowing.\nThe $699 GeForce RTX 3080 and Nvidia\u2019s new Ampere GPU architecture changes all that. This thing freakin\u2019 smokes. It\u2019s a massive upgrade over the older $699 GeForce RTX 2080, significantly faster than the former $1,200 RTX 2080 Ti flagship, and if you\u2019ve been holding onto your older GeForce GTX 1080? The GeForce RTX 3080 absolutely crushes it. This is an excellent graphics card for 4K and ultra-fast 1440p gaming\u2014if you can afford it when it launches on September 17.\n\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This comprehensive review of the GeForce RTX 3080 goes longer than most as it\u2019s our first evaluation of an Ampere-powered GeForce RTX 30-series graphics card.

Good. Now we\u2019re going to get geeky for a bit. Skip to the next section if you aren\u2019t interested in some deeper details on how the tech inside the GeForce RTX 3080 works.\n Nvidia\nThe beating heart inside the GeForce RTX 3080 is Nvidia\u2019s new GA102 \u201cAmpere\u201d GPU. Ampere is built using Samsung\u2019s 8nm processor node, moving up from the TSMC 14nm and slightly modified 12nm nodes used for the GTX 10- and RTX 20-series cards, so this is a generational leap for Nvidia. The last time Nvidia leaped a node, the GeForce GTX 10-series demolished their direct predecessors. It\u2019s no different this time around, as you\u2019ll soon see.\n Nvidia\n\nInside an RTX 30-series Ampere SM.\n\n\nWhile Turing shook up GPU design, Ampere builds on Turing\u2019s foundations. Turing\u2019s simultaneous multiprocessors (SMs)\u2014the building blocks of the GPU\u2014received a significant overhaul, adding a new integer pipeline (INT32) alongside the floating point pipeline (FP32) traditionally used to process shading. The new pipeline let Nvidia\u2019s GPU handle integer instructions at the same time as traditional FP instructions, giving Turing-based graphics cards a big speed boost in games that leaned heavily on those tasks\u2014namely, well-optimized Vulkan and DirectX 12 games. Performance in traditional games stayed largely stagnant in the RTX 20-series graphics cards, however, partially because FP32 is generally more important for gaming workloads.\n\nAmpere both builds on Turing and scales back that design by doubling the number of CUDA cores in each SM. The new architecture keeps a data path devoted exclusively to those crucial FP32 tasks, while the second path can process either INT or FP tasks, rather than dedicated them to INT alone. That makes Ampere much faster at traditional game rendering.\nNote that overall game performance doesn\u2019t scale up perfectly with CUDA core counts, especially because INT instructions can now potentially eat into the total FP throughput on that second path. All in all, it\u2019s a good, reasonable tweak. To feed the beasts, Nvidia doubled the bandwidth and partition size of the L1 cache in each SM, along with adding 33 percent more L1 capacity.\n[ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ]\nThose specialized RT and tensor cores also received upgrades\u2014the RT cores to a second-generation version, and the tensor cores to the third generation. There are more RT cores crammed into the RTX 3080, and fewer tensor cores. But these third-gen tensor cores are much more capable than their predecessors, enabling higher performance despite the reduced count.\nThe RT cores also gained the ability to interpolate triangle position. This particularly helps in scenes with motion blur, potentially speeding up ray traversal by 8X. Overall, Nvidia says its new RT cores are 1.7X faster than before, while the tensor cores are 2.7X more efficient\u2014though again, that doesn\u2019t scale perfectly to actual gaming performance.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n Nvidia\nThose gains are boosted even further by Ampere\u2019s newfound ability to run tasks on the tensor and RT cores simultaneously. In Turing, ray-traced tasks ran alongside shader functions, but the GPU needed to finish that ray-traced task and hand it to the tensor cores for denoising and DLSS before spitting out the final image. In Ampere, tensor cores can run DLSS to upscale one frame while the shader and RT cores work on the next one, all three process tasks running simultaneously. Paired with the improved shader capabilities, a frame that took up to 13 milliseconds to run on Turing with ray tracing and DLSS enabled can now be spit out in 6.7ms with Ampere. Hot damn.\nBottom line? Improvements in the Ampere GPU architecture give a big boost to performance in both traditional games as well as games that leverage Nvidia\u2019s RTX capabilities.\nBut the GeForce RTX 3080\u2019s gains don\u2019t come solely from the new Ampere architecture. Like the GTX 1080 and RTX 2080 before it, Nvidia\u2019s latest flagship introduces cutting-edge memory, too. This time around, the GeForce RTX 3080 (and forthcoming RTX 3090) tap Micron\u2019s blazing-fast GDDR6X memory modules. Micron\u2019s memory rolls out \u201cPAM4\u201d signaling technology, which lets them send four possible values per cycle, up from the traditional two. That lets GDDR6X move data twice as fast as previous incarnations. The 10GB of GDDR6X memory in the RTX 3080 sends that data over a 320-bit bus, for a total memory bandwidth of 760GBps. By comparison, the GeForce RTX 2080 Super\u2019s 8GB of non-X GDDR6 used a 256-bit bus for 496GBps of overall bandwidth.\n Nvidia\n\nTraditional GDDR6 vs. the RTX 3080\u2019s GDDR6x memory.\n\n\nNvidia also tweaked how the memory works to improve its efficiency\u2014a good thing, as the 320W GeForce RTX 3080 draws noticeably more power than even the previous-gen RTX 2080 Ti flagship. The company added 250mV voltage steps and new \u201cmax transition avoidance coding\u201d to take advantage of the four-signal PAM4 memory without having the chips swing wildly from the lowest to highest values, which could cause energy arcs. Nvidia also gave the graphics core and memory system their own dedicated power rails, letting the GPU fine-tune the power levels of each separately for greater efficiency. Previous chip designs used a shared power rail for the two.\n\nNow that we\u2019re talking power, it\u2019s a great time to shift gears to the design of the GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition.\nGeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition design\nThe GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition differs wildly from Nvidia\u2019s past in-house graphics cards. A lot of the change likely stems from the increased power demands of Ampere.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nTuring\u2019s flagship, the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, topped out at 260 watts. The GeForce RTX 3080 is rated for 320W, and the step-up RTX 3090 hits 350W. Moving up a process node, like Ampere does, can offer the same performance at much greater efficiency, offer more performance at the same power, or fall somewhere between those two extremes. Ampere is more efficient than Turing\u2014Nvidia claims the 220W GeForce RTX 3070 offers the same performance as the 260W RTX 2080 Ti\u2014but it\u2019s clear that Nvidia put the pedal to the metal a bit heavily here.\nPay close attention to the power supply requirements, which now hit 750W for both the 3080 and 3090 Founders Edition cards. When introducing its ROG Strix variants of the RTX 30-series GPUs, Asus even warned that \u201cas a\u00a0result of increased power demands, users may need to re-evaluate the power rating of their PSUs.\u201d A power supply that\u2019s toiled hard for years might not have the voltage regulation required to deal with fast load changes. Monster GPUs need to be well-fed.\n\nSuch a powerful GPU paired with such powerful memory requires powerful cooling, too. Everything from the PCB design to the power connector design to the radical cooler itself is different in the GeForce RTX 3080.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nIt all revolves around the new-look cooler. Prior to the GeForce RTX 20-series, all Nvidia Founders Edition and reference cards used a blower-style cooler that shoots hot air out the back of your system. With the RTX 20-series, Nvidia moved to a dual-axial fan design traditionally found in custom boards. The GeForce RTX 3080 splits the difference.\n Nvidia\nNvidia\u2019s new Founders Edition design deploys a unique push-pull \u201cflow-through\u201d design. The fan at the rear of the system stays in its normal place, embedded in the shroud at the bottom of the card. The front fan moves to the top of the graphics card, where you\u2019d normally see a backplate or bare PCB.\nThe rear fan functions like a traditional blower-style cooler, pushing hot air out of the card\u2019s I/O bracket. The top-mounted front fan, however, pulls in air at the bottom of the GPU and through the fan atop the card, exhausting it into the top of your system. The fans at the top or rear of your case then draw the air out. Nvidia says this method also keeps the intake-to-exhaust airflow in your system more consistent, rather than disrupting everything with a big honking dual-axial card between your case fans.\n\nIn effect, the GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition puts part of the cooling burden on the rest of your system. We\u2019ll need to conduct more testing to see whether this scheme affects your CPU and memory performance. Be sure your case is equipped with a rear outtake fan, as not all cases include one.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nThose metal heatsink fins are SOLID.\n\n\nThe rest of the GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition bristles with large, chunky, black heatsink fins, and a wraparound metal shroud that looks surprisingly slick in an industrial way. The card also feels significantly heavier in your hand than the RTX 20-series Founders Edition models. It\u2019s dense. But the new design works very well, keeping the beastly Ampere GPU decently cool while also creating far less noise than the last-gen dual-axial design. It may not work well in small form factor PCs, however.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe pewter-hued metal exterior of that shroud gets very hot to the touch after you load up the card for a few hours, though. Like the last-gen Founders Edition designs, the RTX 3080 FE\u2019s heavily integrated design looks like a nightmare to disassemble, too.\nIn its reviewer\u2019s notes, Nvidia PR pointed out that the card is \u201cunique in both its design and assembly,\u201d and warned that \u201cdisassembly without damaging the card requires some extra care\u201d while posting \u201cspecial \u2018engineering-approved\u2019 instructions.\u201d Don\u2019t expect to take this gorgeous graphics card apart very easily. Update: Gamers Nexus has posted a GeForce RTX 3080 tear-down video you\u2019ll want to watch before prying yours open.\n\n Nvidia\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3080 FE uses an exotic custom PCB to fit in its radical cooler.\n\n\nOf course, you can\u2019t push hot air through a PCB. In another departure for Nvidia, the GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition uses a custom PCB rather than a reference board, and it\u2019s really custom. As you can see from the image above, this card uses a teeny-tiny PCB with a long, angular notch taken off the far end, giving it a look somewhat reminiscent of Pac-Man with monstrous teeth. That cut-out leaves room for the funky new fan to suck air up and through the heatsink, though water block support will probably be slim pickings for DIY liquid enthusiasts.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\n12 pins of power\n\n\nShrinking the PCB\u2019s size required tight engineering\u2014and compromises. Rather than using traditional 6- or 8-pin power connectors, the GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition uses an Nvidia-created 12-pin power connector that\u2019s not much larger than a single 8-pin, then turns it vertically to save a ton of footprint space on the PCB.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nNvidia\u2019s 2\u00d78-pin to 12-pin power adapter\n\n\nThe company includes a 2x 8-pin to 12-pin adapter in the box so you can use the new card with traditional power supply hookups. It\u2019s a nifty bit of mechanical engineering. Nvidia says it submitted the design for standardization, so we may see it pop up on rival cards in the future.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nThe 12-pin power connector is embedded in the metal fins on the edge of the GeForce RTX 3080 FE because of its short PCB.\n\n\nThe nifty 12-pin idea turned out to be less than ideal in actual product terms, at least if you care about cable management. The included adapter isn\u2019t very long, and the shortened PCB means the 12-pin connector itself is positioned close to the center of the GPU\u2019s long edge. In practice, you\u2019ll have the ugly 8-pin connections looking cluttered front-and-center through your case\u2019s side window. The odd three-quarter angle of the 12-pin connection also makes it very hard to keep the adapter\u2019s dual prongs from covering some of the illuminated \u201cGeForce RTX 3080\u201d logo on the side.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nThe 12-pin power adapter doesn\u2019t look good in your case.\n\n\nI don\u2019t like it. On the plus side, some power supply manufacturers are offering specialized standalone cables that plug into the 12-pin on one end and dual 8-pin connections at your power supply, removing the need for an adapter at some extra cost (if one rolls out for your particular PSU, that is). Virtually every custom GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card by third-party vendors like EVGA, MSI, and Asus stick to a traditional reference board with normal 8-pin connectors, so you can look that way as well if the adapter bothers you.\nThe GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition comes equipped with a single HDMI connection, and in a first for graphics cards, it supports HDMI 2.1, which lets you connect an 8K display with a single cable. Previously, you needed four HDMI cables or a DisplayPort-to-HDMI 2.1 adapter to achieve the same thing. The card also packs three DisplayPort 1.4 connections. On the video technologies front, the RTX 30-series GPUs are the first to support AV1 decode (a boon for streaming 8K content) and the ability to record 8K HDR video natively at 30 fps, without the need to invest in a discrete video capture card.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nPort report\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 30-series also upgrades to PCIe 4.0, which is currently supported only on AMD Ryzen 3000 systems with an AM4 X570 or B550 motherboard. Intel does not support the blazing-fast interface. While that sounds like a conundrum, Nvidia representatives counseled that PCIe 4.0 moves performance only by a \u201cfew percent\u201d in best-case scenarios, and CPU selection matters much more. The company measured its own performance benchmarks in an Intel Core i9 system. Fear not: Your 9900K rig isn\u2019t dead yet.\nWhat\u2019s not included on the 3080 FE is also noteworthy, though irrelevant to most gamers. The RTX 20-series Founders Edition graphics cards included a VirtualLink connection to supply audio, visual, and data to VR headsets over a single USB-C port. While VirtualLink was backed by some of the biggest names in the business, it never appeared on any of the major VR headsets, and the initiative\u2019s website is now dead. You\u2019ll no longer find the port on the RTX 3080 FE.\n\nAlso missing: SLI connectors. Nvidia is limiting NVLink support to the GeForce RTX 3090 alone for this generation, slamming the final nail in multi-GPU\u2019s coffin. It\u2019s effectively been dead for years, though. Games just don\u2019t support it anymore, and it\u2019s usually janky in the games that do. Modern GPUs are also incredibly powerful compared to earlier ones that required SLI to hit their best frame rates.\nAll in all, however, Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition is a gorgeous, cleverly engineered graphics card that looks great while staying cool and quiet. Too bad about that adapter, though.\nOdds and ends\nNvidia\u2019s also supporting the GeForce RTX 30-series launch with a few things outside the scope of this review.\n Nvidia\nNvidia Reflex combines GPU and game engine optimizations to greatly improve your latency in games that support Nvidia\u2019s API. Activating it zeroes out the usual GPU render queue, so the GPU renders frames fed to it by the CPU as quickly as possible, reducing latency-inducing \u201cbackpressure\u201d on your system processor. As Nvidia\u2019s chart above shows, simply flipping it on in a supported game instantly lowers latency, while upgrading to more powerful graphics cards and faster monitors drop it even further.\n\nNvidia Reflex is an ingenious way to sell the insane speeds provided by this new generation of graphics cards. This isn\u2019t just for RTX 30-series cards, either; Nvidia says Reflex will work with most cards from the GeForce 900-series on up. I\u2019m looking forward to testing it more extensively in the future.\nCall of Duty Warzone, Valorant, Fortnite, and\u00a0Destiny 2\u00a0will be among the first games to support Nvidia Reflex when it launches this month. It\u2019ll also be coming to\u00a0Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, and\u00a0Apex: Legends.\n\n\n \n\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to spend up for the best esports experience, Nvidia\u2019s monitor partners are also rolling 360Hz G-Sync displays with hardware built-in to measure your overall system latency. Several low-latency Reflex-supporting mice will hit the streets soon, too, though the system will also work with standard peripherals.\n Nvidia\nJust as exciting is RTX IO, an innovative new technology that taps into Microsoft\u2019s DirectStorage API to let your NVMe SSD funnel data directly to your GPU, removing the potential bottlenecks of a pokey CPU and system memory. It sounds like the drool-worthy storage tech inside the next-gen Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 consoles. Read our article on how Microsoft and Nvidia plan to kill game-loading times on PCs if you want to know more. (We also expect AMD\u2019s \u201cBig Navi\u201d Radeon RTX 6000-series graphics cards to support Microsoft DirectStorage in some way when they\u2019re revealed on October 28.)\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFinally, DLSS and ray tracing denoising isn\u2019t all that tensor cores can do. The new Nvidia Broadcast app leverages that AI hardware to provide streamers with all sorts of nifty on-the-fly effects, ranging from the magical RTX Video noise-cancellation feature to video effects that include adjustable background blur, greenscreen-style background replacement, and automatic head-tracking effects. They looked pretty darn impressive in the demo, but we haven\u2019t had time to test the suite ourselves yet.\nPhew! That was a lot of info. Let\u2019s get into how this hot rod rides. Spoiler: It\u2019s fast.\nOur test system\nOur dedicated graphics card test system is a couple of years old, but it\u2019s packed with some of the fastest complementary components available to put any potential performance bottlenecks squarely on the GPU. Most of the hardware was provided by the manufacturers, but we purchased the cooler and storage ourselves.\n\nIntel Core i7-8700K processor ($300 on\u00a0Amazon) overclocked to 5GHz all cores\nEVGA CLC 240 closed-loop liquid cooler ($105 on\u00a0Amazon)\nAsus Maximus X Hero motherboard\n64GB HyperX Predator RGB DDR4/2933 ($355 on Amazon)\nEVGA 1200W SuperNova P2 power supply ($352 on\u00a0Amazon)\nCorsair Crystal 570X RGB case, with front and top panels removed and an extra rear fan installed for improved airflow\n2x 500GB Samsung 860 EVO SSDs ($70 each on\u00a0Amazon)\n\nWe were faced with a dilemma ahead of this review. As we mentioned in the previous section, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 30-series upgrades to the cutting-edge PCIe 4.0 interface, which could potentially improve performance in limited, ultra-demanding scenarios. But only AMD Ryzen 3000 systems with an AM4 X570 or B550 motherboard support PCIe 4.0. Intel does not support the blazing-fast interface yet, but it holds the single-thread performance crown so crucial to most games. What to do, other than moan about Intel\u2019s failure to support it?\n\nNvidia representatives say PCIe 4.0 adds only a \u201cfew percent\u201d more performance in the limited scenarios where it would make any difference. They claim that CPU choice matters more for overall performance. Nvidia\u2019s own benchmarks were conducted on an Intel Core i9 system with PCIe 3.0.\nWith that info in hand, we decided to stick with our established test bench for now. Our overclocked 5GHz Core i7-8700K goes toe-to-toe with even the Core i9-10900K in gaming performance, as TechSpot\u2019s testing proved last month, so it shouldn\u2019t be a bottleneck here. While AMD Ryzen has greatly closed the gap with Intel on single-thread performance, it\u2019s still a bit behind the Core chips. We feel we\u2019d be more likely to see performance impacts from slower single-threaded performance than from lacking PCIe 4.0 support. If the new \u201cZen 3\u201d Ryzen processors debuting in October equal or top Intel\u2019s single-threaded performance, we\u2019ll likely switch to that platform for future tests to get the best of both worlds. But it remains to be seen what AMD\u2019s next-gen chips will offer.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nWe\u2019re comparing the $700 GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition against a bunch of other FE cards: Nvidia\u2019s $800 GeForce RTX 2080, $1,200 RTX 2080 Ti, and the older $700 GTX 1080. (MSRP prices for the 1080 and 2080 started at $100 less, but Nvidia charged a premium for the FE models.)\nBecause so many owners of the $700 GTX 1080 Ti decided to skip over the lackluster performance increase in the similarly priced RTX 2080, we\u2019re also including the EVGA GTX 1080 Ti SC2 in our roundup. Our GTX 1080 Ti Founders Edition died years ago, the only Nvidia GPU ever to expire in our hands.\n\nWhy no Radeon comparisons? Simple: Nvidia is in a class of its own with high-end GPUs. Only the barely-available Radeon VII ever managed to come close to matching the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti\u2019s performance, and the 1080 Ti is now 3.5 years old. The Radeon RX 5700 XT isn\u2019t in the same ballpark either. Big Navi might change that, but Nvidia has defined enthusiast-class GPUs for years now. The time investment to benchmark AMD GPUs ahead of this launch, only for them to appear way at the bottom of the charts, wasn\u2019t worthwhile.\nWe test a variety of games spanning various engines, genres, and graphics APIs (DirectX 11, DX12, and Vulkan). Each game is tested using its in-game benchmark at the highest possible graphics presets unless otherwise noted. We disable VSync, frame rate caps, real-time ray tracing or DLSS effects, and FreeSync/G-Sync, along with any other vendor-specific technologies like FidelityFX. We\u2019ve also enabled temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) to push these cards to their limits.\u00a0We run each benchmark at least three times and list the average result for each test. We tested the older cards using Nvidia\u2019s publicly available 452.06 Game Ready driver, and the RTX 3080 FE using a 452.16 driver provided early to reviewers.\nLet\u2019s go.\nGeForce RTX 3080 gaming benchmarks\nHorizon Zero Dawn\nYep, Sony exclusives are hitting the PC now. Horizon Zero Dawn hit Steam with some performance issues, but the most egregious ones have been mostly cleared up thanks to hard work from the developers, and the game topped the sales charts for weeks after its release. It also seems to respond somewhat to PCIe 4.0 scaling, which will make this an interesting inclusion when we shift to a PCIe 4.0-based system in the future.\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn runs on Guerrilla Games\u2019 Decima engine, the same engine that powers Death Stranding. Ambient Occlusion can still offer iffy results if set to Ultra, so we test with that setting at Medium. Every other visual option is maxed out.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nJust look at that. The GeForce RTX 3080 flies. At 4K it\u2019s a ludicrous 81 percent faster than the RTX 2080, its direct predecessor. It\u2019s also 34 percent faster than the former RTX 2080 Ti flagship, and a monstrous 151 percent faster than the GTX 1080. If you\u2019ve been sitting tight since spending $700 on the GTX 10-series, it\u2019s definitely safe to upgrade, as these benchmarks will continue to show.\nThe GeForce RTX 3080 dominates even at lower resolutions. The lead narrows as you move down to 1080p or 1440p, settings that put more of the burden on the CPU rather than the GPU, like 4K does. That\u2019ll be a trend in most, but not all games as we continue through these.\nGears Tactics\nGears Tactics puts it own brutal, fast-paced spin on the XCOM-like genre. This Unreal Engine 4-powered game was built from the ground up for DirectX 12. We love being able to work a tactics-style game into our benchmarking suite. Better yet, the game comes with a plethora of graphics options for PC snobs. More games should devote such loving care to explaining what flipping all these visual knobs mean.\n\nYou can\u2019t use the presets to benchmark Gears Tactics, as it intelligently scales to work best on your installed hardware. That means \u201cUltra\u201d on one graphics card can load different settings than \u201cUltra\u201d on a weaker card. We manually set all options to their highest possible settings, and disable the minimum/maximum frame rate options.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nFun fact: The GeForce RTX 3080 FE is the only graphics card that doesn\u2019t generate a \u201cYour GPU can\u2019t handle this\u201d warning when enabling Glossy Reflections. Only the 3080 and the RTX 2080 Ti lack that warning for Planar Reflections. Told you these cards are monsters.\u00a0\nThose especially strenuous options hammer these GPUs, causing the RTX 3080 to achieve a narrower but still substantial 55 percent margin of victory over its predecessor at 4K. The RTX 3080\u2019s extra oomph\u00a0carries over to 1440p as well, where it\u2019s 50 percent faster than the RTX 2080, 30 percent faster than the 2080 Ti, and 89 percent faster than the GTX 1080.\nMore interesting is the gap between the GTX 1080 Ti and RTX 2080. The two cards offer virtually identical performance in many games, but with Gears Tactics being designed around DX12, the integer pipelines introduced in the RTX 20-series get to flex their muscles. Then all those shader improvements in Ampere come to bear with the RTX 3080.\n\nAgain, CPU comes into play more at 1080p.\nMetro Exodus\nOne of the best games of 2019, Metro Exodus is one of the best-looking games around, too. The latest version of the 4A Engine provides incredibly luscious, ultra-detailed visuals, with one of the most stunning real-time ray tracing implementations released yet. We test in DirectX 12 mode with ray tracing, Hairworks, and DLSS disabled for our basic benchmarks.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nAnother whupping at 4K. The GeForce RTX 3080 FE is 63 percent faster than the RTX 2080, 23 percent faster than the RTX 2080 Ti, and 136 percent faster than the GTX 1080.\nThe gap narrows a bit at 1440p, but Nvidia\u2019s new card remains over 50 percent faster than the RTX 2080 and almost 20 percent faster than the 2080 Ti.\n\nBorderlands 3\nBorderlands is back! Gearbox\u2019s game defaults to DX12, so we do as well. It gives us a glimpse at the ultra-popular Unreal Engine 4\u2019s performance in a traditional shooter.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThis is yet another game where the RTX 3080 flies beyond its predecessor by a ridonkulous 80 percent at 4K. It\u2019s also 37 percent faster than the 2080 Ti, and 154 percent faster than the GTX 1080. The performance lead shrinks at 1440p, but not by much. And even at 1080p, the RTX 3080 is 58 percent speedier than the 2080. \u00a0\nTo frame it another way: The 3080 is faster at 4K than the 2080 is at 1440p!\nStrange Brigade\nStrange Brigade\u00a0is a cooperative third-person shooter where a team of adventurers blasts through hordes of mythological enemies. It\u2019s a technological showcase, built around the next-gen Vulkan and DirectX 12 technologies and infused with features like HDR support and the ability to toggle asynchronous compute on and off. It uses Rebellion\u2019s custom Azure engine. We test using the Vulkan renderer, which is faster than DX12.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nHere, the RTX 3080 remains roughly 80 percent faster than the RTX 2080, and over 100 percent faster than EVGA\u2019s overclocked GTX 1080 Ti SC2. Like in Borderlands, the domination continues even as you move down in resolution. While the RTX 2080 barely tops 200 frames per second at 1080p, the RTX 3080 hits a stratospheric 330 fps.\nTotal War: Troy\nThe latest game in the popular Total War saga, Troy was given away free for its first 24 hours on the Epic Games Store, moving over 7.5 million copies before it went on proper sale. Total War: Troy is built using a modified version of the Total War: Warhammer 2 engine, and this DX11 title looks stunning for a turn-based strategy game.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nLike Metro Exodus (which supports DX12, but was built for DX11) the RTX 3080 is 63 percent faster than the RTX 2080 at 4K here, and 25 percent faster than the RTX 2080 Ti. The biggest leads for Nvidia\u2019s Ampere GPU look like they come in games running more modern graphics APIs. It\u2019s over twice as fast as the GTX 1080 non-Ti at 4K, and nearly 50 percent faster than the GeForce RTX 2080 at 1440p.\nF1 2020\nThe latest in a long line of successful racing games,\u00a0F1 2020 is a gem to test, supplying a wide array of both graphical and benchmarking options, making it a much more reliable (and fun) option than the\u00a0Forza\u00a0series. It\u2019s built on the latest version of Codemasters\u2019 buttery-smooth Ego game engine, complete with support for DX12 and Nvidia\u2019s DLSS technology. We test two laps on the Australia course, with clear skies on and DLSS off.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nYou know how this goes by now. At 4K, the new card is a nice 69 percent faster than the RTX 2080, 27 percent faster than the 2080 Ti, and a whopping 135 percent faster than the GTX 1080. The beat-down continues at lower resolutions, where the RTX 3080 clocks in at 57 percent faster than its predecessor, 25 percent faster than the RTX 2080 Ti, and over twice as fast as the GTX 1080.\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0concludes the reboot trilogy, and it\u2019s utterly\u00a0gorgeous. Square Enix optimized this game for DX12, and recommends DX11 only if you\u2019re using older hardware or Windows 7. We test with DX12.\u00a0Shadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0uses an enhanced version of the Foundation engine that also powered\u00a0Rise of the Tomb Raider and includes optional real-time ray tracing and DLSS features.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe GeForce RTX 3080 is so fast, this game struggles to keep up at 1440p, where SOTR was CPU-bound almost half the time\u2014hence the bunched-up results among the top-end cards at 1440p and 1080p. Nvidia\u2019s new GPU shines at 4K however, where it\u2019s 70 percent faster than the RTX 2080, 30 percent faster than the 2080 Ti, and 159 percent faster than the GTX 1080.\nGTA V\nThis DX11 game isn\u2019t a visual barn-burner like the (somewhat wonky) Red Dead Redemption 2, but it still tops the Steam charts day in and day out, so we deem it more worthy of testing. RDR2 will melt your graphics card, sure, but GTA V remains so popular years after launch that upgraded versions of it will be available on the next-generation consoles. That\u2019s staying power.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nWe test\u00a0Grand Theft Auto V\u00a0with all options turned to Very High, all Advanced Graphics options except extended shadows enabled, and FXAA.\u00a0GTA V\u00a0runs on the RAGE engine and has received substantial updates since its initial launch.\nHere, the game is entirely CPU-bound with all the graphics cards (except the GTX 1080) at both 1080p and 1440p. Moving to 4K reveals differences, though Nvidia\u2019s latest monster is straining the game engine\u2019s capabilities even at this pixel-packed resolution. The GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition is 47 percent faster than the RTX 2080 (and nearing the upper limits of this game\u2019s frame rate), 18 percent faster than the RTX 2080 Ti, and 83 percent faster than the GTX 1080.\nRainbow Six Siege\nLike GTA V, Ubisoft\u2019s Rainbow Six Siege still dominates the Steam charts years after its launch, and it\u2019ll be getting a visual upgrade for the next-gen consoles. The developers have poured a ton of work into the game\u2019s AnvilNext engine over the years, eventually rolling out a Vulkan version of the game that we use to test. By default, the game lowers the render scaling to increase frame rates, but we set it to 100 percent to benchmark native rendering performance on graphics cards. Even still, frame rates soar.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThere are no surprises in our final game. The RTX 3080 Founders Edition is 70 percent faster than the RTX 2080, 30 percent faster than the RTX 2080 Ti, and a flat-out stupid 165 percent faster than the GTX 1080 at 4K. The 3080\u2019s lead over its predecessor drops to a \u201cmere\u201d 60 percent at 1440p.\n\nGeForce RTX 3080 ray tracing and DLSS benchmarks\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nTraditional gaming performance is only part of Nvidia\u2019s value proposition with the GeForce RTX 3080. The company also packed this GPU with vastly improved RT and tensor core hardware to accelerate ray tracing and DLSS, respectively, now that those technologies are starting to gain more traction. Big-name games like Cyberpunk 2077, Watch Dogs Legion, and Vampire: The Masquerade\u2014Bloodlines 2 will support ray tracing and DLSS as they roll out over the next few months.\u00a0Fortnite is rolling out ray tracing, DLSS, and Nvidia Reflex on Thursday to roll out the red carpet for the RTX 3080\u2019s launch.\n[ Further reading: Nvidia RTX retrospective: What two years of ray tracing and DLSS got us ]\nAhead of the blitz, we benchmarked this card using compatible games in our suite to see if Nvidia\u2019s lofty promises for the RTX 30-series proved true. We didn\u2019t include the GTX 1080 and 1080 Ti in this section because, well, they don\u2019t include dedicated ray tracing hardware. We hope to add more titles to this section in the future, so stay tuned.\nFirst up: Shadow of the Tomb Raider. This was one of the first games to include ray tracing and the first incarnation of DLSS. The game\u2019s ray traced shadows aren\u2019t as breathtaking as Control\u2019s multiple effects, but they could definitely impact performance on the original RTX 20-series GPUs, especially at the Ultra setting we test at. The first-gen DLSS implementation doesn\u2019t support 1080p resolution, it\u2019s worth noting\u2014it bottoms out at 1920\u00d71200. DLSS 2.0 is much more flexible.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nAt 4K, the performance impact of activating ray tracing and DLSS is a scant 14 percent on the new GeForce RTX 3080 FE. The card manages to stay well above 60 fps even with all those bells and whistles active. The RTX 2080, by comparison, can\u2019t hit a consistent 40 fps with ray tracing and DLSS enabled, due to its hefty 26-percent performance penalty. Activating RTX impacts the 2080 Ti just 10 percent, meanwhile, which makes us wonder if memory capacity makes a difference with these features active. The RTX 2080 Ti has 1GB more capacity than the RTX 3080, albeit of the slower GDDR6 variety.\nMetro Exodus was the second game ever to support ray tracing, but it remains one of the most impressive. Its ray-traced Global Illumination completely changes the vibe of the game, making it feel much more foreboding, ominous, and post-apocalyptic. It also uses the first incarnation of DLSS, which looks a lot better now than it did when the game first launched.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nActivating ray tracing and DLSS makes the RTX 3080 FE run about 10 percent slower at 4K. That\u2019s not bad at all to enable this sort of eye candy, and the average frame rate stays above the hallowed 60-fps mark.\nOnce again, its RTX 2080 predecessor fails to crack a 40-fps average, but its frame rate only suffers by about 13 percent with RTX on. It\u2019s just that much slower in general performance.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 2080 Ti splits the difference with an 11-percent performance impact, but it can\u2019t crack 60 fps even with ray tracing off at 4K. The frame rate impacts become much more pronounced at lower resolutions, where Nvidia says the CPU starts becoming a bigger factor in ray tracing performance. Still, Metro manages to hit a very nice 88-fps average at 1440p.\nSo much for not being able to play ray traced games at higher resolutions.\nFinally, while the original version of DLSS could sometimes make games look a bit blurrier than native resolution, the fantastic DLSS 2.0 fixed that issue. It\u2019s so good that some games are starting to include it even without ray tracing, including Death Stranding and the game we\u2019re about to test, F1 2020. That\u2019s because DLSS 2.0 can provide a boost in frame rates with little to no visual changes, depending on whether you use Quality or Performance mode. DLSS 2.0 is much easier to implement than the first version, and it\u2019s such a game-changer that we hope to see more titles support it soon. Anywho, onto the benchmarks:\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nActivating DLSS 2.0 in F1 2020 gives the RTX 3080 an 18-percent frame rate boost at 4K, pushing its average close to 150 fps, while the RTX 2080 rides a 22-percent boost to almost 100 fps. The GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, meanwhile, sees a speedy 25-percent increase with DLSS active. The RTX 3080 sees much smaller boosts at lower resolutions, but that\u2019s clearly because it\u2019s nearing the frame rate limit of either the game engine or the CPU.\n\nNvidia touted vastly improved RT and tensor cores in the RTX 30-series. But as you can see, the older RTX 20-series cards manage to float in the same range of performance impact, aside from the RTX 2080\u2019s major blow in Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Nvidia representatives told us that the amped-up RT and tensor cores can stretch their legs more in games with more strenuous ray tracing effects.\nThe best results should be seen in fully path-traced games like\u00a0Minecraft RTX and\u00a0Quake II RTX, Nvidia said. As triple-A games start integrating multiple ray tracing effects, the performance should grow compared to these early RTX titles with support for singular effects. Nvidia cited\u00a0Control as a test-worthy example, but we weren\u2019t able to benchmark that game in time for this review.\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077 and Fortnite\u2019s RTX update will also be absolutely loaded with various ray tracing technologies. We hope to benchmark RTX performance more soon.\nRegardless, when it\u2019s bolstered by DLSS, the GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition proves powerful enough to play with superb frame rates even with the penalty impact of ray tracing. That\u2019s a major change from the RTX 20-series, where even the then-monstrous RTX 2080 Ti often needed to drop to 1440p or even 1080p to maintain 60 fps in ray traced games. If you upgrade to the RTX 3080, you needn\u2019t be scared to turn on ray tracing anymore.\nPower draw, thermals, and noise\nWe test power draw by looping the\u00a0F1 2020\u00a0benchmark at 4K for about 20 minutes after we\u2019ve benchmarked everything else. We note the highest reading on our Watts Up Pro meter, which measures the power consumption of our entire test system. The initial part of the race, where all competing cars are onscreen simultaneously, tends to be the most demanding portion.\u00a0\n\nThis isn\u2019t a worst-case test. We removed the Core i7-8700K\u2019s overclock and specifically chose a GPU-bound game running at a GPU-bound resolution to gauge performance when the graphics card is sweating hard. If you\u2019re playing a game that also hammers the CPU, you could see higher overall system power draws. Consider yourself warned.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nYep, feeding the Ampere beast takes quite a bit of power. Remember when we said Nvidia put the pedal to the metal with these GPUs? It shows here, where the RTX 3080 draws 50W more than the former 2080 Ti flagship, and over 100W more than its direct 2080 predecessor, and an eye-opening 200W more than the GTX 1080. Spending uncomfortable levels of power to achieve uncomfortable levels of (gaming) power is well worth it by our estimation, but if you\u2019re upgrading from a prior GeForce card, you may need to invest in a new power supply\u2014especially if you\u2019re jumping up from the GTX 10-series.\nWe test thermals by leaving GPU-Z open during the\u00a0F1 2020\u00a0power draw test, noting the highest maximum temperature at the end. We observed the RTX 3080\u2019s temperatures in EVGA\u2019s Precision X1 tool instead, however.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNvidia\u2019s radical new \u201cflow-through\u201d cooler for the GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition works just fine, and it\u2019s significantly quieter than the dual-axial fans on the RTX 20-series Founders Edition cards\u2014especially the RTX 2080 Ti. In practice, it\u2019s a lot better than any reference or Founders Edition cooler we\u2019ve seen before. Keeping the GPU at 79 degrees Celsius isn\u2019t noticeably better or worse than previous FE models in raw thermal performance, and this actually runs slightly hotter than the RTX 2080 FE. The outer metal shroud also gets screaming hot to the touch.\n\nBut the GeForce RTX 3080 is a lot more power-hungry and higher-performance than previous-gen GPUs, and I\u2019m not surprised it took an exotic cooling design to keep the RTX 3080 Founders Edition tame while churning out frame rates like these. Nvidia couldn\u2019t just slap a bunch of heavy metal and endless axial fans on these without severely stepping on the toes of partners like EVGA and Asus, after all.\nI mention all this because Nvidia made lofty claims about the flow-through cooler\u2019s efficiency. The company\u2019s GeForce RTX 30-series announcement post said it offers \u201cnearly 2x the cooling performance of previous generation solutions,\u201d while CEO Jensen Huang claimed that this \u201ckeeps the GPU 20 degrees cooler than the Turing design\u201d during the card\u2019s livestream reveal. As you can see below, those lofty numbers aren\u2019t represented in the final product, the RTX 3080 Founders Edition that you can actually buy.\n Nvidia\n\nHow Nvidia achieved its lofty cooling comparisons for the RTX 30-series new design.\n\n\nThe details, as always, are more nuanced. In a presentation to reporters, GeForce product manager Justin Walker shared the above slide, which revealed that the claims were made by comparing the RTX 3090 versus the monster Titan RTX at a fixed 350W. This really is a much more efficient cooler than previous-generation solutions, and it was essential for bringing Ampere to heel. But this serves as a reminder that you shouldn\u2019t take marketing numbers at face value.\nI have no complaints about Nvidia\u2019s flow-through design, though I haven\u2019t tested whether the hot air pulled into the top of your system can affect CPU or memory performance. I also love how quiet it is compared to previous models. I\u2019m very curious to see what custom board makers can do with their more traditional cooling designs.\n\nShould you buy the GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition?\nIf you\u2019re interested in spending big to get exceptional 4K or ultra-fast 1440p performance on a 144Hz+ monitor, then yes, you should buy the RTX 3080 Founder Edition. Full stop.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that Ampere is GeForce\u2019s greatest generational leap ever, and he wasn\u2019t kidding. Remember being blown away when the GTX 1080 was 60 to 70 percent faster than the GTX 980, even with its slightly higher price? The GeForce RTX 3080 spits out frames up to 80 percent faster in several games, and 60 percent higher in the others. It\u2019s roughly 30 percent faster than the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, the $1,200 previous-gen flagship, and a ridonkulous 100 to 160 percent faster than the older GeForce GTX 1080. All at the exact same $700 price tag as the RTX 2080.\nThe promises were true. This thing is an absolute monster. Sometimes it\u2019s faster at\u00a04K than the RTX 2080 is at\u00a01440p. Ludicrous.\u00a0\nThere are no games where the GeForce RTX 3080 fails to clear a 60-frames-per-second average at 4K resolution with all possible visuals effects turned on. The exception is the ridiculously strenuous Total War: Troy, which averages 56 fps (and feels just fine at even lower speeds as a strategy game). Most games go significantly faster than that. Other than Troy, again, no games fall below 100 fps at 1440p resolution with everything maxed out. Again, Total War again falls just shy, at 98 fps, and again, most games go significantly faster than that. If you\u2019re fine bumping graphics down to high, games fly along even faster\u00a0in our off-the-cuff tests. No graphics card has come close to this level of performance before.\n\nThe \u201cworst\u201d (but still massive) results come in CPU-bound or older DX11 titles. The Ampere architecture screams when unleashed on properly optimized games that were built for DirectX 12 or Vulkan. More and more of those are being published these days, and all ray-traced games require DX12. The impact of ray tracing and DLSS doesn\u2019t appear to be lessened despite the next-gen RT and tensor cores, but the RTX 3080 is so fast, it doesn\u2019t matter. You can play ray traced games at 1440p, and even 4K now.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nJust make sure you can put all this power to good use. If you don\u2019t have a 4K monitor or a 144Hz 1440p monitor, you\u2019re probably wasting your money here. Nvidia says the $500 GeForce RTX 3070 will be just as fast as the last-gen 2080 Ti for less than half the price when it launches in October. That should be a fine ultra-fast 1440p and 4K option too, though you\u2019ll likely need to dial down some graphics settings in strenuous games. You don\u2019t with the RTX 3080.\nNote, too, that most games hit a CPU bottleneck playing at 1080p with this card. Unless you\u2019re an esports pro who plans on turning down graphics settings (or playing around with Nvidia Reflex) to hit the highest possible frame rates on a 360Hz monitor, your money is better spent elsewhere if you have a 1080p screen and don\u2019t plan on upgrading it soon.\nThe design, while gorgeous, is a mixed bag when you dive into the details. The radical new cooler isn\u2019t drastically better than what came before, temperature-wise, but it works well and is significantly quieter than before. The unique flow-through cooling may not work well in small form factor PCs, though. The new 12-pin power connector is fine, but its too-short adapter for 2x 8-pin connectors looks ugly and blocks the card\u2019s illuminated white logo, though power supply makers will sell bespoke cables to fix the issue. It\u2019s also somewhat tricky (but not impossible) to pry apart for repair or water cooling, as you can see in this Gamers Nexus RTX 3080 tear-down video.\n\nVirtually every gripe I can raise is nitpicking. The monstrous performance increase wouldn\u2019t be quite as impressive if the ho-hum RTX 20-series hadn\u2019t been so disappointing. You may need to upgrade your power supply to feed this beast, but it\u2019s worthwhile.\nI also wonder whether the 10GB of onboard VRAM will be enough capacity for 4K gaming in a few years. The cutting-edge GDDR6X chips inside the RTX 3080 moves data twice as fast as standard GDDR6, however, and showed no sign of slowing down in our tests.\nNone of these are major issues for most people.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nYou could hold off on a day-one purchase to see what custom versions of the GeForce RTX 3080 offer, But you also should feel free to spam F5 on your keyboard at Amazon or Newegg when the RTX 3080 hits online shelves September 17, especially considering rumors that stock of these cards could be in short supply during this crazy year.\n\nMaybe you also want to see what AMD has up its sleeves with the \u201cBig Navi\u201d Radeon RX 6000 reveal on October 28. Sure, AMD\u2019s RDNA 2 architecture looks promising. But don\u2019t forget that Radeon has yet to topple the GTX 1080 Ti nearly 3.5 long years later. I hope Big Navi sparks competition in the enthusiast end of the market yet again, but it looks like a tall order for AMD.\nNvidia brought it this generation. Ampere is indeed Nvidia\u2019s greatest generational leap in recent memory. The GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition isn\u2019t just the fastest graphics card ever released (until next week, when the even more monstrous $1,500 RTX 3090 lands), it also makes its predecessor feel instantly obsolete\u2014and instantly makes ray tracing feel so much more viable.\nLike we said at the start: Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card symbolizes why we tell people to wait for the second generation when bleeding-edge technology appears.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBest Prices Today: GeForce RTX 3080\t\t\n\n\n\n\nRetailer\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,494.68\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nView Deal \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Ray tracing. Deep-learning super sampling. Crazy-fast memory bandwidth. In some cases, Nvidia's new $699 GPU is at its best when software leverages its very specific perks and features.\nBut as we all know, 2018's line of RTX 2000 GPUs left fans with high-priced options that didn't offer enough universally drool-worthy boosts. At the time, I called those cards \"a ticket to the RTX lottery,\" and for nearly two years, the payoff was scant.\nIt's getting better\u2014especially as DirectX 12 Ultimate and a pair of next-gen consoles finally lean into most of 2018's RTX-specific perks. AMD will soon cash in on this stuff with its own powerful RDNA 2 line of GPUs. Once Nvidia's RTX features feel less \"proprietary,\" we should see them in more games\u2014but that also leaves Nvidia to answer a question. Well, what else ya got?\nThis brings me to the way I prefer to summarize the RTX 3080 difference, as prompted by my Ars colleague Lee Hutchinson. I could practically hear the eager gasps through his keystrokes in an Ars chat session about my GPU tests when he typed four words: \"Elite Dangerous in VR?\"\nZero-G, 120fps\n\n\n    Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080\n      \n\n\n        $699 at Nvidia\n      \n\n\nAs of press time, this space-exploration game's PC version is not optimized for DirectX 12 Ultimate or RTX-specific features. It's just a damned hungry game set in an infinite universe\u2014one where you can float through barren space one moment, then abruptly warp into an epic, spinning-all-around dogfight next to a geometrically dense formation.\nIt's awesome stuff. It's even better in VR. And that mode is\u00a0even better when you can flip the 120Hz switch on a high-end headset like the Valve Index, put both hands on your favorite HOTAS rig, and lay zero-G, 360-degree hellfire upon anyone who might dare interrupt your cargo-shuffling mission... all without dropping frames. (Thanks to the game's emphasis on high-speed rotation, the normal 90Hz VR standard isn't enough for standard-issue stomachs. More frames in that game mean more comfort.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo someone like Mr. Hutchinson, who has a high price ceiling for his gaming rig but not an infinite one, I can say this: with the RTX 3080, you can run Elite Dangerous at its \"high\" preset in VR, flip to 120Hz mode in Valve Index, and expect a nearly locked framerate. The same goes for Fallout 4 VR, a brutally unoptimized VR conversion of Bethesda's RPG, which I can\u00a0finally\u00a0run at a locked 90fps (or hover in variable\u00a0100-110fps territory on Valve Index). Three years after that VR port's launch, I actually want to play it that way.\nTrickling down from the crazies\n\n\n\n\nRTX\u00a03080 FE\nRTX\u00a02080\u00a0Ti FE\nRTX\u00a02080 Super\nRTX 2080 FE\nRTX 2070 Super\n\n\n\nGTX\u00a01080 Ti\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n8.704\n4,352\n3,072\n2,944\n2,560\n\n\n\n3,584\n\n\nTexture\n Units\n272\n272\n192\n184\n184\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROPs\n96\n88\n64\n64\n64\n\n\n\n88\n\n\nTensor cores\n272 (\"3rd-gen\")\n544\n384\n368\n320\n\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nRT cores\n68 (\"2nd-gen\")\n68\n48\n46\n40\n\n\n\nn/a\n\n\nCore Clock\n1,440MHz\n1,350MHz\n1,650MHz\n1,515MHz\n1,605MHz\n\n\n\n1,480MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1,710MHz\n1,635MHz\n1,815MHz\n1,800MHz\n1,770MHz\n\n\n\n1,582MHz\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n320-bit\n352-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n\n\n\n352-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed\n19GHz\n14GHz\n15.5GHz\n14GHz\n14GHz\n\n\n\n11GHz\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n760GB/s\n616GB/s\n496GB/s\n448GB/s\n448GB/s\n\n\n\n484GB/s\n\n\nMemory Size\n10GB GDDR6X\n11GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n\n\n\n11GB GDDR5X\n\n\nTDP\n320W\n260W\n250W\n250W\n215W\n\n\n\n250W\n\n\nMSRP at launch\n$699\n$1,199\n$699\n$799\n$499\n\n\n\n$699\n\n\n\nI can say similar things for so much demanding PC software as handled by this card in ways that I couldn't with 2018's eye-watering $1,199 RTX 2080 Ti. In an alternate universe\u2014the one where Nvidia ran unopposed in the GPU race, beating the pants off AMD for years\u2014Nvidia could have continued charging something like $800 or $900 for that 2018 card, whose price tag was much more about dedicated effects-processing cores than about sheer, across-the-board power.\nWith AMD finally nipping on its heels this year, Nvidia has arrived with a $699 beast of an RTX 3080 whose \"Founders Edition,\" without any overclocks added, consistently beats an overclocked 2080 Ti Founders Edition in modern 3D games and software (and flexes stronger muscles on RTX-specific features). In performance tests, the margin of gained performance always clears the 13-percent threshold, sometimes much more. (In the case of Elite Dangerous VR's \"high\" preset, which is much tougher to benchmark, it makes a roughly 20 percent difference in frame times across the board.)\nThis isn't just good news for the crazy Lee Hutchinsons of the world. This card's impact on the market will hopefully\u00a0push the average GPU value proposition into reasonable territory. A $699 GPU may not be your cup of tea, but if prices for everything beneath the RTX 3080 (and its sibling, the RTX 3070, slated to launch in October at $499) adjust according to the below benchmarks, that means a rock-solid 1080p or 1440p GPU may finally land within your budgetary reach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's go to the numbers\nUsually with reviews like this, we go into a testing environment looking for edge cases and performance issues, and our resulting coverage is full of nitpicks and caveats for the careful PC parts picker. After all, we're tech enthusiasts, not necessarily Nvidia ones.\nThe only \"nitpick\" I can offer at this point is that some of the $699 RTX 3080's leads are \"mild\" compared to the RTX 2080 Ti, which launched at $1,199 almost two years ago to the day. But all the way across the board, from general raw performance to RTX-specific benchmarks, the RTX 3080 wins over its overpriced siblings. It's loud and it's power-hungry, but neither of those categories is egregious for the gains this update offers.\nSince we're talking about a $699 GPU, I opted to test higher-end GPUs currently on the market, along with 2017's $700 champ, the GTX 1080 Ti. (Should we get our mitts on the $499 RTX 3070, slated to launch in October, we'll adjust the GPU testing selection accordingly.) All GPU testing in this review was conducted on a solid-but-not-epic testing rig, sporting the following specs:\n\nCPU: i7-8700K, overclocked to 4.7GHz\nRAM: 32GB DDR4-3000\nHD: Sabrent 1TB Rocket NVMe PCIe M.2 2280\nMobo:\u00a0Asus ROG Strix Z370-I\nPSU: EVGA 850G3 (850W)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      This custom benchmark measures performance with pre-determined weather, wind, and cloud effects while glancing inside and outside a cockpit's view for 45 seconds. All other benchmarks in this gallery are pre-built by game developers.\n          \n\n\n\n\nThis custom benchmark measures performance with pre-determined weather, wind, and cloud effects while glancing inside and outside a cockpit's view for 45 seconds.

Most are around 150MHz to base clocks, 500MHz to memory clocks. The RTX 2080 Super has a much milder bump of 50MHz and 150MHz, respectively.\u00a0I opted not to overclock the RTX 3080 for my default tests.\nLet's start with performance gains in games without any proprietary Nvidia hooks. As usual for a high-end GPU review, I leaned toward 4K resolutions and near-max feature sets, because we're trying to pound the GPU instead of running up to CPU-bound limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe performance differential between a standard 3080 and a mildly overclocked 2080 Ti is pretty stunning, coming in at a floor of about 13 percent by default, and up to 17.4 percent in the incredibly demanding Red Dead Redemption 2 benchmark. What's more, in pretty much every scenario listed, you can see an interesting trend for the RTX 3080: it's a \"4K at near-max\" beast.\nMaking last year's card downright laughable\nWatching benchmark after benchmark, I continued to see RTX 3080 performance not only clear the \"60fps average\" bar but also match it with stability. I could go either into a game's settings or the Nvidia control panel, force 60Hz vsync, and see performance in these scenarios stick pretty well to a 60fps promise. I only needed to tweak a few things in the listed games to ensure such a performance threshold: AA reduction in Assassin's Creed Odyssey and GTA V, or resolution scaling down to 80 percent (or 3072\u00d71728) in the incredibly demanding Microsoft Flight Simulator. (To be clear: MSFS is a CPU-hungry beast, but at least the 3080 will get strong CPUs up to higher resolutions en route to 60fps.)\nBelow the 2080 Ti, you can see the 2080 Super and 1080 Ti (long sold out) duke it out for the next-in-line throne\u2014an issue I already explored in my 2080 Super hands-on from last year. In light of the 3080's test results, the 2080 Super is downright laughable as a \"comparable\" $699 option. We're mostly in the 30-percent-and-up territory between the two cards, with Shadow of the Tomb Raider exposing a whopping 40-percent gain by the RTX 3080. Yowza.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Since Control doesn't include a benchmark utility, I picked one of the game's early levels, full of reflections and wide-open geometry, then ran in a straight line to equalize the stress test across multiple cards.\n          \n\n\n\n\nSince Control doesn't include a benchmark utility, I picked one of the game's early levels, full of reflections and wide-open geometry, then ran in a straight line to equalize the stress test across multiple cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      We've previously covered the Minecraft RTX Beta, which has since been updated with performance boosts across the board.

Our benchmarks show an even larger gain with ray tracing effects enabled for the 3080 over an overclocked 2080 Ti, to the tune of a roughly 20-percent minimum gain. The Minecraft RTX Beta in particular stunned with a whopping 32-percent jump in one testing scenario with DLSS upscaling disabled. (The performance gap between all cards slightly narrowed with DLSS enabled, which makes sense. As native rendering resolution shrinks, so does the benefit of sheer GPU horsepower.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same story goes for 3DMark's suite of tests, and this time around, we focused primarily on the testing suite's high-end selection. This includes mostly non-RTX stress tests, along with a butt-kicker of a ray tracing test that the non-RTX card in my testing suite, the 1080 Ti, could actually run... at roughly 9fps. All in all, the 3080's gains are similar: roughly 18 to 20 percent over the 2080 Ti, whether in DX11 or DX12. It's worth noting, though, that 3DMark's ray tracing test doesn't show proportionately higher gains the way gaming software does.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                We've left older, less intensive tests behind for the RTX 3000 generation. New this time is \"Port Royal,\" a ray tracing stress test that the GTX 1080 Ti somehow is able to run, albeit barely.\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      We've left older, less intensive tests behind for the RTX 3000 generation. New this time is \"Port Royal,\" a ray tracing stress test that the GTX 1080 Ti somehow is able to run, albeit barely.\n\n          \n\n\n\nMath data paths, replumbed pipelines\nSince I don't have a non-\"Super\" RTX 2080 on hand, I cannot directly address Nvidia's claim that the RTX 3080 can \"double\" performance compared to that card. In some scenarios, I certainly believe that an RTX 2080 at stock clocks could be doubled by a stock 3080, since the original 2080 was a bummer (especially at its $799 launch price). The truth is a little less jaw-dropping, but the jump is still as severe as any we can remember between GPU generations.\nNvidia hosted press-only panels with its team of engineers about exactly how they got their Ampere generation of GPUs up to such performance levels. Being that this was Nvidia speaking on its own behalf, we're hesitant to publish their every declaration as ironclad, much less declare them as the only engineers coming up with these tweaks, but the panels were interesting all the same.\nAmong the disclosures:\n\nThe jump from the Pascal process to Turing saw Nvidia add a \"second math data path\" per clock. But in real-world Turing use cases, Nvidia noticed this integer-only path was under-utilized, due to rendering engines leaning heavily on floating-point workloads. Thus, this time around, Ampere's second math data path on each of its streaming multiprocessors (SM) can alternate between FP32 and integer workloads as needed. This is arguably the simplest path to \"doubled performance\" claims for Ampere.\nThe above shader core boost was met by Nvidia's decision to \"replumb the [Ampere] L1 pipeline\" with double the bandwidth of Turing, along with a boost to cache capacity. Jonah Alben, Nvidia senior VP of Engineering, pointed to a doubling of the \"cache partition [that is] dynamically looking at what shaders are accessing and trying to hold that for future use.\"\nAlben points to two updates to Ampere's ray tracing (RT) core dedicated to that workflow's mathematical challenge of motion blur\u2014which applies to a more cinematic rendering of light bounces on TVs and monitors, as opposed to an \"infinitely fast shutter-speed photograph.\" The RT core now has \"doubled\" triangle intersection processing, and it has an entirely new ability to interpolate these light sources' triangle trajectories in motion whether in a straight line or in rotation (like in propeller blades or wheels).\nData sent through the GPU's GDDR6X memory has been \"doubled per cycle\" due to a voltage system that has four levels (as opposed to simply 1s and 0s). Nvidia's team insists that its \"max transition avoidance coding\" scheme ensures that voltage readings won't slow down when the voltage needs to jump from the lowest level to the highest. It will be interesting to see how RTX 3070 performance compares, since its 8GB of GDDR6 memory is designed differently.\n\"Our hardware can continuously train and adapt to find the best level\" in time or voltage, Alben says, insisting that Ampere cards are built with algorithms that self-regulate based on variances like temperature or an individual card's working transistors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPromising battlefields\nThe \"second generation\" of Nvidia's RT cores are the most curious there, since they outright suggest that certain gains in those cores' performance are inherent to new mathematical calculations. I asked Nvidia's reps whether these require a separate developmental fork for game makers, and they confirmed that motion blur pipelines will specifically require reauthoring, while most other RT-specific workloads will not. Nvidia pointed to its own OptiX API already including these motion blur-related updates should developers currently lean on it. \"[RTX motion blur] is supported in Blender Cycles, Redshift, Chaos V-Ray, and Autodesk Arnold so far,\" the Nvidia reps added.\nI asked this because Nvidia also set me up with access to a beta branch of 2019's Wolfenstein Youngblood \"designed to take advantage of some of the functionality of the NVIDIA Ampere Architecture SM and second-gen RT core.\" On the RTX 3080, benchmarks on this beta branch showed a mild-but-noticeable gain: anywhere from 7 to 13.8 percent above the score that RTX 3080 already achieves without additional Ampere-related optimizations.\nHopefully more existing software with DirectX Ray Tracing (DXR) pipelines will get Ampere-minded patches by year's end. Yet right now, even with software released with only Turing in mind, the RTX 3080 proof is in the ray-traced pudding.\nOn my testing rig, my Battlefield V \"ultra\" benchmark\u2014a straight-line march through the opening beat of the Tirailleur campaign level, full of explosions and ray-traced water reflections\u2014currently hits a 60.4fps average, which means it noticeably dips beneath the 60fps threshold often enough. In great news, that benchmark sequence can get up to an 80.0fps average, almost entirely above the 60fps line, with all settings identical... except for a drop in the ray tracing setting from \"ultra\" to \"medium.\" (This primarily drops the working resolution of bounced rays, which is arguably an easy detail to overlook in the middle of a frantic Battlefield firefight.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, the RTX 3080 can convincingly pound through Battlefield V at\u00a0raw 4K resolution, with medium-resolution ray tracing effects and everything else jacked to \"ultra,\" and stay above the 60fps line. With DLSS enabled, you can choose \"ultra\"-resolution ray tracing effects for a full \"ultra\" preset and convincingly clear the 60fps bar. This test case got the benchmark up to a\u00a076.1fps average. It's about as convincing a test of the RTX 3080 as I've seen.\nOverclocking, throttling, airflow\nUnfortunately, I don't have great news to report on the overclocking front, at least for the 3080 Founders Edition. All of this high-level performance I've described thus far revolves around the card's default profile, as opposed to leaving much room for us to go any further\u2014at least in terms of basic default tweaks combined with stock cooling.\nMy first overclocking test, at the meager levels of 50MHz to core clocks and 150MHz to memory clocks, resulted in an immediate drop-off in average frame rates after only one minute of stress-testing via 3DMark's \"Time Strike Ultra\" sequence\u2014a 4K graphic benchmarking demo that defaults to revving the RTX 3080 at 98- to 99-percent workload while leaving all of my i7-8700K's cores around the 30-percent mark. The drop was roughly 3.5 percent, enough to immediately void the test in 3DMark's eyes.\nComparatively, running an even longer version of that same 3DMark stress test on the RTX 3080, set at stock clocks, saw a mild drop-off after 50 minutes of sustained load, right around the three-percent level. That's not a voided test result, but it's close, and it hints to mild thermal throttling issues that power users may need to contend with\u2014or, at least, more work on Nvidia's front with those self-regulating algorithms they have mentioned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmittedly, Nvidia went back to the drawing board for across-the-GPU cooling requirements for the Ampere design, hence resulting in a dual-blower design that dispels heat in two directions: out the back of your PC's case, and upward to the\u00a0top of your case's internals. If you're testing an RTX 3080 on a standard-issue ATX motherboard, that means one of its exhaust paths will likely blow right over your motherboard's memory. Not ideal.\nCoincidentally, while I've been wanting to upgrade my testing mobo, I'm still using a high-performing Mini-ITX that I'd fished out of another case. As a result, I don't have some features I'd love, particularly a second PCI-E slot for something like a capture card. But in the case of Nvidia's new card, I do benefit from the RTX 3080's internal blower shooting directly past precious system elements. Thankfully, I am\u00a0not running this system in a Mini-ITX case; I have two massive vents at the top of my Raidmax case to expel heat. Throughout my testing, I have not noticed overheating for my CPU, memory, or NVMe drive.\nPower, pins, adapters\nNvidia has been proud to tout the power efficiency for the RTX 3080, showing a jump in performance at the 2080 Super's rated peak of 240W. Nvidia's estimate in that case, of roughly 30fps (or 50-percent performance) gained in the game Control, is mostly in line with my own testing. But that's a convenient choice for Nvidia, because as the charts above show, Control on the 2080 Super with DLSS disabled and RTX effects enabled\u00a0stinks performance-wise.\nFor the rest of the RTX 3080 experience to really shine, especially without a ray-tracing pipeline figuring into the performance difference, you'll want to jump to its 320W rating, at which point the GPU is right there decibel-wise with its RTX 2000-series peers. I won't blow smoke: The RTX 3080 is loud, and it's neck and neck with the loud RTX 2080 Ti. To their credit, Nvidia's engineers did well to execute a bi-directional airflow design without doubling the previous generation's noise ceiling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      New adapter for existing 8-pin adapters.\n          \n\n\n\n\nNew adapter for existing 8-pin adapters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      As packed into the box.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nAs packed into the box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      12-pin connector, up close.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n12-pin connector, up close.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs packed into the box.\n\n\n\n\n\n12-pin connector, up close.\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of power, Nvidia suggests powering your PC with a 750W PSU as a bare minimum for running the RTX 3080. My testing suite includes an 850W PSU, which, at this rate, is enough headroom for another one to two years of erring on the brighter side of 4K performance. Increased GPU performance at the 650W maximum, a count I've seen as a \"gamer\" system baseline for a few years, could become a loud battle between Nvidia's RTX 3070 and whatever similarly powered GPU we see from AMD's RDNA 2 lineup next month.\nAs seen above, the RTX 3080 sees Nvidia push forward with its very small 12-pin power adapter, designed by Nvidia to push higher wattage from smaller parts. \"We distribute [the 12-pin cable] as a standard and don't restrict who can use it,\" Nvidia reps said in a press briefing, but the company didn't elaborate on whether that standard will be opened for the sake of PSU and parts manufacturers adopting it far and wide. In the meantime, all RTX 3000-series Founders Edition cards will ship with a 12-pin adapter, which breaks out to two 8-pin slots. \"Some\" partner cards in the series will adopt this standard, as well, while others will continue to ship with two 8-pin slots built in.\nThis extra proprietary plug, and its bulky adapter, isn't a dealbreaker for a spacious case. Though if you're meticulous about cord management in your gaming PC's case, prepare to slice and reset your existing zip-ties accordingly.\nBottom line: Hail to 2019's GPU king, baby\nNvidia was eager to recommend that we test the RTX 3080 with productivity software, particularly in the video editing realm, but I'm pausing on those tests for the moment. Primarily, that's because the $1,499 RTX 3090, and its whopping 24GB of GDDR6X VRAM, is on the horizon. Video editing is a completely different use case in terms of PC budgets, the kind where a $1,499 GPU won't even break a sweat. I have a feeling that will be the more popular question about the RTX 3090, as opposed to its increased memory profile's emphasis on 8K gaming, and I look forward to addressing it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, I'm confident in saying that the $699 RTX 3080 has handily dethroned the GTX 1080 Ti as the market's best expensive-but-attainable GPU. Its specific performance profile, achieved with serious hunger (320W) and a large-but-not-epic pool of RAM (10GB, albeit in the efficient GDDR6X profile), will let you rip and tear in 4K resolutions and in high-performing VR scenarios without requiring buy-in from game developers to toggle Nvidia's proprietary systems.\nSimultaneously, this card's advances on the ray-tracing front make that realm's \"medium\" settings a no-brainer in applicable software, even without having to toggle Nvidia's DLSS upscaling system. So far, we haven't seen any software take advantage of Nvidia's newly advertised \"RTX I/O\" system, which is meant to more efficiently funnel 3D assets through the GPU without wasting CPU cycles. It's a proprietary Nvidia tech, limited only to its newest GPUs, so I'm not holding my breath expecting RTX I/O to make industry-wide waves in the immediate future.\nBut much of that proprietary \"RTX\" stuff from Turing, particularly ray tracing,\u00a0will soon become an industry-wide standard, thanks to factors like the upcoming Windows 10 standard of DirectX 12 Ultimate and AMD's own aggressive entry into ray tracing (fueled in part by both major next-gen consoles this holiday season). What I once called the \"RTX lottery ticket\" is now a given, and the RTX 3080 is proof that you can have your 60fps-at-4K cake\u00a0and eat your ray traced frosting, too.\nVerdict: If you're itching to build a desktop PC in the $1,500-and-up range, you can finally expect proper bang for your $699 GPU buck.

Which makes sense since he\u2019s the VP of business development at NVIDIA and head of NVIDIA Inception, a virtual accelerator that currently has over 6,000 members in a wide range of industries.\nAhead of the GPU Technology Conference, taking place Oct. 5-9, Herbst joined AI Podcast host Noah Kravitz to talk about what opportunities are available to startups at the conference, and how NVIDIA Inception is accelerating startups in every industry.\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 Exploring the AI Startup Ecosystem with NVIDIA Inception\u2019s Jeff Herbst \u2013 Ep. 128\nHerbst, who now has almost two decades at NVIDIA under his belt, studied computer graphics at Brown University and later became a partner at a Silicon Valley premier technology law firm. He\u2019s served as a board member and observer for dozens of startups over his career.\nOn the podcast, he provides his perspective on the future of the NVIDIA Inception program. As AI continues to expand into every industry, Herbst predicts that more and more startups will incorporate GPU computing.\nThose interested can learn more through NVIDIA Inception programming at GTC, which will bring together the world\u2019s leading AI startups and venture capitalists. They\u2019ll participate in activities such as the NVIDIA Inception Premier Showcase, where some of the most innovative AI startups in North America will present, and a fireside chat with Herbst, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang, and several CEOs of AI startups.\nYou can learn more about Inception at www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/startups/\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\nHerbst\u2019s interest in supporting an AI startup ecosystem began in 2008 at the NVISION Conference \u2014 the precursor to GTC. The conference held an Emerging Company Summit, which brought together startups, reporters and VCs, and made Herbst realize that there were many young companies using GPU computing that could benefit from NVIDIA\u2019s support.\nHerbst provides listeners with an insider\u2019s perspective on how NVIDIA expanded from computer graphics to the cutting edge of AI and accelerated computing, describing how it was clear from his first days at the company that NVIDIA envisioned a future where GPUs were essential to all industries.\n\nTweetables:\n\u201cWe love startups.

He left his lab coat behind to lead a group of data scientists at Scotiabank, based in Toronto, exploring how machine learning can improve predictions of credit risk.\nThe team believes machine learning can both make the bank more profitable and help more people who deserve loans get them. They aim to share later this year some of their techniques in hopes of nudging the broader industry forward.\nScorecards Evolve from Pencils to AI\nThe new tools are being applied to scorecards that date back to the 1950s when calculations were made with paper and pencil. Loan officers would rank applicants\u2019 answers to standard questions, and if the result crossed a set threshold on the scorecard, the bank could grant the loan.\nWith the rise of computers, banks replaced physical scorecards with digital ones. Decades ago, they settled on a form of statistical modeling called a \u201cweight of evidence logistic regression\u201d that\u2019s widely used today.\nOne of the great benefits of scorecards is they\u2019re clear. Banks can easily explain their lending criteria to customers and regulators. That\u2019s why in the field of credit risk, the scorecard is the gold standard for explainable models.\n\u201cWe could make machine-learning models that are bigger, more complex and more accurate than a scorecard, but somewhere they would cross a line and be too big for me to explain to my boss or a regulator,\u201d said Edwards.\nMachine Learning Models Save Millions\nSo, the team looked for fresh ways to build scorecards with machine learning and found a technique called boosting.\nThey started with a single question on a tiny scorecard, then added one question at a time. They stopped when adding another question would make the scorecard too complex to explain or wouldn\u2019t improve its performance.\nThe results were no harder to explain than traditional weight-of-evidence models, but often were more accurate.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve used boosting to build a couple decision models and found a few percent improvement over weight of evidence. A few percent at the scale of all the bank\u2019s applicants means millions of dollars,\u201d he said.\nXGBoost Upgraded to Accelerate Scorecards\nEdwards\u2019 team understood the potential to accelerate boosting models because they had been using a popular library called XGBoost on an NVIDIA DGX system. The GPU-accelerated code was very fast, but lacked a feature required to generate scorecards, a key tool they needed to keep their models simple.\nGriffin Lacey, a senior data scientist at NVIDIA, worked with his colleagues to identify and add the feature. It\u2019s now part of XGBoost in\u00a0RAPIDS, a suite of open-source software libraries for running data science on GPUs.\nAs a result, the bank can now generate scorecards 6x faster using a single GPU compared to what used to require 24 CPUs, setting a new benchmark for the bank. \u201cIt ended up being a fairly easy fix, but we could have never done it ourselves,\u201d said Edwards.\nGPUs speed up calculating digital scorecards and help the bank lift their accuracy while maintaining the models\u2019 explainability. \u201cWhen our models are more accurate people who are deserving of credit get the credit they need,\u201d said Edwards.\nRiding RAPIDS to the AI Age\nLooking ahead, Edwards wants to leverage advances from the last few decades of machine learning to refresh the world of scorecards. For example, his team is working with NVIDIA to build a suite of Python tools for scorecards with features that will be familiar to today\u2019s data scientists.\n\u201cThe NVIDIA team is helping us pull RAPIDS tools into our workflow for developing scorecards, adding modern amenities like Python support, hyperparameter tuning and GPU acceleration,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cWe think in six months we could have example code and recipes to share,\u201d he added.\nWith such tools, banks could modernize and accelerate the workflow for building scorecards, eliminating the current practice of manually tweaking and testing their parameters. For example, with GPU-accelerated hyperparameter tuning, a developer can let a computer test 100,000 model parameters while she is having her lunch.\nWith a much bigger pool to choose from, banks could select scorecards for their accuracy, simplicity, stability or a balance of all these factors. This helps banks ensure their lending decisions are clear and reliable and that good customers get the loans they need.\nDigging into Deep Learning\nData scientists at Scotiabank use their DGX system to handle multiple experiments simultaneously. They tune scorecards, run XGBoost and refine deep-learning models. \u201cThat\u2019s really improved our workflow,\u201d said Edwards.\n\u201cIn a way, the best thing we got from buying that system was all the support we got afterwards,\u201d he added, noting new and upcoming RAPIDS features.\nLonger term, the team is exploring use of deep learning to more quickly identify customer needs. An experimental model for calculating credit risk already showed a 20 percent performance improvement over the best scorecard, thanks to deep learning.\nIn addition, an emerging class of generative models can create synthetic datasets that mimic real bank data but contain no information specific to customers. That may open a door to collaborations that speed the pace of innovation.\nThe work of Edwards\u2019 team reflects the growing interest and adoption of AI in banking.\n\u201cLast year, an annual survey of credit risk departments showed every participating bank was at least exploring machine learning and many were using it day-to-day,\u201d Edwards said.\n\n\nCategories: Accelerated Analytics | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Data Science | Financial Services | Machine Learning | NVIDIA DGX | RAPIDS \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The most watched esport, League of Legends, drew over 100M viewers for its 2019 championship -- more than last year\u2019s NFL Superbowl. With esports rivaling traditional sports in both viewership as well as playtime, it\u2019s more important than ever for gamers to have their PC and graphics hardware tuned to allow them to play their best. This is why several years ago NVIDIA invested in an esports laboratory staffed by NVIDIA Research scientists, dedicated to understanding both player and hardware performance in esports. Today, we are excited to share with you the first major fruits of this research.\nAlongside our new GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs, we\u2019re unveiling NVIDIA Reflex, a revolutionary suite of GPU, G-SYNC display, and software technologies that measure and reduce system latency in competitive games (a.k.a. click-to-display latency). Reducing system latency is critical for competitive gamers, because it allows the PC and display to respond faster to a user\u2019s mouse and keyboard inputs, enabling players to acquire enemies faster and take shots with greater precision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex features two major new technologies:\nNVIDIA Reflex SDK: A new set of APIs for game developers to reduce and measure rendering latency. By integrating directly with the game, Reflex Low Latency Mode aligns game engine work to complete just-in-time for rendering, eliminating the GPU render queue and reducing CPU back pressure in GPU intensive scenes. This delivers latency reductions above and beyond existing driver-only techniques, such as NVIDIA Ultra Low Latency Mode.\n\u201cNVIDIA Reflex technology arms developers with new features to minimize latency in their games. We\u2019re seeing excellent responsiveness and player control with Fortnite running on the GeForce RTX 30 Series.\u201d - Nick Penwarden, VP of Engineering, Epic Games.\n\u201cValorant was designed from the beginning to be a precise, competitive FPS, and that means doing everything we can to ensure crisp, responsive gameplay. With GeForce RTX 30 Series and NVIDIA Reflex technology, we're able to serve players around the world with the lowest render latency possible.\u201d - Dave Heironymus, Director of Technology - Valorant / Riot Games\nNVIDIA Reflex will deliver latency improvements in GPU-intensive gaming scenarios on GeForce GTX 900 and higher NVIDIA graphics cards in top competitive games, including\u00a0Fortnite,\u00a0Valorant,\u00a0Apex Legends,\u00a0Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War,\u00a0Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,\u00a0Call of Duty: Warzone, and\u00a0Destiny 2.\nWith popular mid-range cards, like the GeForce GTX 1660 Super, gamers can expect up to a 33% improvement in PC responsiveness with Reflex. Add in a\u00a0GeForce RTX 3080\u00a0and a\u00a0360Hz G-SYNC esports display, and gamers can play like the pros with the very lowest latency possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer: A revolutionary system latency measurement tool integrated into new 360Hz G-SYNC Esports displays from ACER, Alienware, ASUS, and MSI, and supported by top esports peripherals from ASUS, Logitech, Razer, and SteelSeries.\nReflex Latency Analyzer detects clicks coming from your mouse and then measures the time it takes for the resulting pixels (i.e. a gun muzzle flash) to change on screen. This type of measurement has been virtually impossible for gamers to do before now, requiring over $7000 in specialized high-speed cameras and equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhereas in the past gamers had to guess at their system\u2019s responsiveness based on throughput metrics such as Frames Per Second (FPS), Reflex Latency Analyzer provides a much more complete and accurate understanding of mouse, PC, and display performance. Now with Reflex Latency Analyzer, competitive gamers can start a match with confidence, knowing their system is operating exactly as it should be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this article, we are going to provide a deep dive into system latency and NVIDIA Reflex technology -- so buckle up!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo What Is Latency Anyway?\nEnd to End System Latency\nWhat\u2019s The Difference Between FPS and System Latency?\nWhy Does System Latency Matter?\nReducing System Latency with NVIDIA Reflex\n\nNVIDIA Reflex SDK\nEnhanced Control Panel Options for Latency\n\nUltra Low Latency Mode\nPrefer Maximum Performance\n \n \nAutomatic Tuning in GeForce Experience\nMeasuring System Latency with NVIDIA Reflex\n\nNVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer\nNVIDIA Reflex Software Metrics\n \nTraining Your Aim with Lower Latency\n\nNext Level: System Latency - Advanced Section\n\nBreaking Down How Your Actions Get To The Display\nGPU-Bound Latency Pipeline\nNVIDIA Reflex SDK Latency Pipeline\nCPU-Bound Latency Pipeline\nDiving Into PC Latency and Overlap\n \n \nWrapping Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo What Is Latency Anyway?\nLatency is a measure of time describing the delay between a desired action and the expected result. When we use a credit card to pay for something online or at the grocery store, the delay it takes for our purchase to be confirmed is latency.\nGamers primarily experience two kinds of latency: system latency and network latency.\nNetwork latency is the round trip delay between the game client and the multiplayer server - more commonly known as \u201cping\u201d. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis delay can affect our gameplay in a few different ways depending on how the game\u2019s networking code handles network latency. Below are a few examples:\n\nDelayed hit confirmations, like when your shot hits, but you don\u2019t get the kill confirmation until much later. This can result in wasted ammo or delayed aiming transfers to your next target.\nDelayed interactions with world objects, like opening doors or loot chests.\nDelayed positions of opponents, which results in what is known as \u201cpeeker\u2019s advantage\u201d (more about this later)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that network latency is not the same as network instability issues, such as packet loss and out of order packets. Network instability can cause problems like rubberbanding and desync. Rubberbanding is when you move around in the game, only to be reset back to your location from a few seconds ago. Like a rubber band, you elastically snap back to your position as seen by the server. Desync is when you have packet loss, resulting in network stutter. This will look like enemies pausing for a second then teleporting forward into their correct position. Both of these common problems are not network latency issues, but typically happen when the packet has further to travel and thus are correlated with higher latency.\nSystem latency is the delay between your mouse or keyboard actions and the resulting pixel changes on the display, say from a gun muzzle flash or character movement. This is also referred to as click-to-display or end-to-end system latency. This latency doesn\u2019t involve the game server - just your peripherals, PC, and display. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis delay impacts gameplay in a number of different ways. Here are a few examples:\n\nDelayed responsiveness, like when you move the mouse but your aim on screen lags behind.\nDelayed shots, like when you shoot, but the bullet hole decals, bullet tracers, and weapon recoil lag behind the actual mouse click.\nDelayed positions of opponents, known as \u201cpeeker\u2019s advantage\u201d. (yes, \u201cpeeker\u2019s advantage\u201d is also impacted by your system latency!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a high level, there are three main stages in system latency - the peripheral (such as a mouse), the PC, and the display. Unfortunately, this latency has been difficult to describe due to the use of the term \u201cinput latency\u201d or \u201cinput lag\u201d to describe different pieces of the system latency.\u00a0\nFor example, you can find \u201cInput Latency\u201d on the box of a mouse when talking about how long the mouse takes to process your click. You can also find it on the box of a monitor talking about how long the display takes to process the frame. And you can find it mentioned in games and software tools when they are really talking about how long the game takes to process your inputs. If all are named \u201cinput latency\u201d, which is it then?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd to End System Latency\nLet\u2019s take a moment to dive one level deeper and define some terms that are more accurate than \u201cInput lag\u201d: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeripheral Latency: The time it takes your input device to process your mechanical input and send those input events to the PC\nGame Latency: The time it takes for the CPU to process input or changes to the world and submit a new frame to the GPU to be rendered\nRender Latency: The time from when the frame gets in line to be rendered to when the GPU completely renders the frame\nPC Latency: The time it takes a frame to travel through the PC. This includes both Game and Render Latency\nDisplay Latency: The time it takes for the display to present a new image after the GPU has finished rendering the frame\nSystem Latency:The time encompassing the whole end-to-end measurement - from the start of peripheral latency to the end of display latency\n\nThese are high level definitions that gloss over some of the details, though they do give us a great foundation to communicate about latency effectively. We will also go into more detail about each of the stages later in the article, so if you want to get more technical, skip ahead to the advanced section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s The Difference Between FPS and System Latency?\nIn general, higher FPS correlates with lower system latency - however this relationship is far from 1-to-1. To better understand, let\u2019s step back and think about how we can measure our interactions with our PC. First, there is the number of pictures our display can present to us per second. That number is a throughput rate called FPS (Frames Per Second). The second way is the time it takes for our actions to be reflected in one of those pictures -- a duration called System Latency.\nIf we have a PC that can render 1000 FPS, but it takes one second for our inputs to reach the display, that would be a poor experience. Conversely, if our actions are instantaneous but our framerate is 5 FPS, that won't be a great experience either.\nSo which one matters more? More than a year ago, we set out to answer this question and the findings are quite interesting. We published our full research at SIGGRAPH Asia, but in short, we found that system latency impacted subjects' ability to complete aiming tasks in an aim trainer much more than the rate of frames displayed on their monitor. But why is that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Does System Latency Matter?\nLet\u2019s start to answer this question by looking at examples in real games:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let\u2019s take a look at hit registration. Hit registration is a term gamers use when talking about how well the game registers their shots onto another player. We often blame hit registry when we KNOW we hit that shot. We have all been there. But is it really hit registration?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this shot above, the mouse button was pressed when the crosshair was over the target, but we still missed. Due to system latency and the movement of the opponent, the game engine read that the position of your crosshair was actually behind the target. In fact, what you see on your display is behind the current state of the game engine. This is simply because it takes a while for the PC to process the information, render the frame, and present it to the display. In games where milliseconds matter, 30-40 extra ms of delay can mean missing that game winning frag.\nSecond, let\u2019s cover \u201cpeeker's advantage\u201d. At high levels of competitive play, you typically hold an angle when you have an extreme angle advantage (when you are further away from the corner than your opponent) to offset a characteristic of online games called \u201cpeeker\u2019s advantage\u201d. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeeker\u2019s advantage is the split second advantage the attacker gets when peeking around a corner at a player holding an angle. Because it takes time for the attacking player\u2019s positional information to reach the defender over the network, the attacking player has an inherent advantage. To offset this, players will \u2018jiggle peek\u2019 the corner; quickly peeking and ducking back into cover, as it will allow them to see an enemy before they are seen, providing a split second advantage. This phenomena is often seen as a characteristic of the game networking code or network latency. However, system latency can play a large role in peeker\u2019s advantage. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in the shot above, both players were equally distanced from the angle, and their pings were the same. The only difference was their system latencies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the hit registration explanation, at higher system latency your view of the world is delayed - allowing for the target to see you before you see the target. If your system latency is much lower than your opponent, you can potentially mitigate peeker\u2019s advantage completely. There are still the effects of the game networking at play here, but in general, lower system latency helps to both mitigate peeker\u2019s advantage on defense and take advantage on attack.\nFinally, let\u2019s discuss aiming accuracy. In particular, flick shots. Drilling flicks is probably the most important training you can do for competitive games like CS:GO or Valorant. In a split second you must acquire your target, flick to it, and click with incredible precision that requires millisecond accuracy. But do you ever feel like no matter what you do, your flicks aren\u2019t consistent? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAiming involves a series of sub-movements - subconscious corrections based on the current position of the crosshair relative to the target\u2019s location. At higher latencies, this feedback loop time is increased resulting in less precision. Additionally, at higher average latencies, the latency varies more, meaning that it\u2019s harder for your body to predict and adapt to. The end result is pretty clear - high latency means less precision.\nAnd that brings us to the results of our study we mentioned earlier. In the chart below, you can see how lower latency had a large impact when measuring flick shot accuracy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn competitive games, higher FPS and refresh rates (Hz) reduce your latency, delivering more opportunities for your inputs to end up on screen. Even small reductions in latency have an impact on flicking performance. In our latest Esports Research blog, the NVIDIA Research team explored the ways in which different levels of system latency affect player performance.\nNVIDIA Research has found that even minor differences in system latency -- 12ms vs. 20ms, can have a significant difference in aiming performance. In fact, the average difference in aiming task completion (the time it takes to acquire and shoot a target) between a 12ms and 20ms PCs was measured to be 182ms - that is about 22 times the system latency difference. To put that into perspective, given the same target difficulty, in a 128 tick Valorant or CS:GO server, your shots will land on target an average of 23 ticks earlier on the 12ms PC setup. Yet most gamers play on systems with 50-100ms of system latency!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo does this translate into actually being more successful in games? Being good at competitive shooters involves much more than just mechanical skill. A keen game sense and battle-hardened strategy can go a long way towards getting a chicken dinner or clutching the round. However, looking at our PUBG and Fortnite data, we see a similar correlation between higher FPS (lower latency) and K/D (kill to death) ratios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy no means does correlation mean causation. But applying the above science to this correlation, we see a lot of evidence to support the claim that higher FPS and lower system latency lead to landing shots more frequently - boosting K/D ratios. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReducing System Latency with NVIDIA Reflex\nWith the launch of NVIDIA Reflex, we set out to optimise every aspect of the rendering pipeline for latency using a combination of SDKs and driver optimizations. Some of these techniques can result in large latency savings, while others will have more modest benefits, depending on the situation. Regardless, NVIDIA Reflex is our commitment to delivering gamers and developers tools to\u00a0optimise for system latency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex SDK\nThe Reflex SDK allows game developers to implement a low latency mode that aligns game engine work to complete just-in-time for rendering, eliminating the GPU render queue and reducing CPU back pressure in GPU-bound scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above image, we can see that the queue is filled with frames. The CPU is processing frames faster than the GPU can render them causing this backup, resulting in an increase of render latency. The Reflex SDK shares some similarities with the Ultra Low Latency Mode in the driver; however, by integrating directly into the game, we are able to control the amount of back-pressure the CPU receives from the render queue and other later stages of the pipeline. While the Ultra Low Latency mode can often reduce the render queue, it can not remove the increased back-pressure on the game and CPU side. Thus, the latency benefits from the Reflex SDK are generally much better than the Ultra Low Latency mode in the driver.\nWhen developers integrate the Reflex SDK, they are able to effectively delay the sampling of input and game simulation by dynamically adjusting the submission timing of rendering work to the GPU so that they are processed just-in-time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the SDK also offers a feature called Low Latency Boost. This feature overrides the power saving features in the GPU to allow the GPU clocks to stay high when heavily CPU-bound. Even when the game is CPU-bound, longer rendering times add latency. Keeping the clocks higher can consume significantly more power, but can reduce latency slightly when the GPU is significantly underutilised and the CPU submits the final rendering work in a large batch. Note that if you do not want the power tradeoff, you can use Reflex Low Latency mode without the Boost enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompetitive gamers generally avoid higher resolutions when playing first person shooters due to the increased rendering load and latency.\u00a0 However, with NVIDIA Reflex, you can get lower latency at higher resolutions - enabling competitive play for gamers who enjoy great image quality and a responsive experience.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompetitive shooters are dynamic - changing back and forth between GPU and CPU boundedness. If there is an explosion with lots of particles and the game becomes GPU-bound, the Reflex SDK will keep the latency low by not letting the work for the GPU queue up. If the rendering is simple and the game is CPU bound, the Reflex SDK will keep latency low by maintaining high GPU clock frequencies. Regardless of the state of the rendering pipeline, the Reflex SDK intelligently reduces render latency for the given configuration. With the Reflex SDK, gamers can stay in the rendering latency sweet spot without having to turn all their settings to low.\nAt the time of the Reflex SDK announcement, the following games plan to support NVIDIA Reflex with our next Game Ready Driver on September 17th, 2020:\u00a0Fortnite, and Valorant. Additionally, the following games have announced support for NVIDIA Reflex coming soon:\u00a0Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War,\u00a0Call of Duty: Warzone,\u00a0Cuisine Royale,\u00a0Destiny 2, Enlisted, Kovaak 2.0,\u00a0and\u00a0Mordhau.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NVIDIA Reflex SDK supports GPUs all the way back to 2014\u2019s GeForce GTX 900 Series products. The Low Latency Boost mode is supported on all GPUs, however, GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs will maintain a slightly higher clock rate to further reduce latency.\nFor those of you who really want to dig into how the SDK works, we will cover the rendering pipeline, CPU/GPU-boundedness, and how latency is reduced in more detail in the advanced section.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhanced Control Panel Options for Latency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltra Low Latency Mode\nIf a game doesn't support the Reflex SDK, you can still get partial latency improvements by enabling NVIDIA Ultra Low Latency mode from the NVIDIA Control Panel. Simply open the control panel and navigate to Manage 3D Settings, then Low Latency Mode, and select the Ultra option. As mentioned earlier in the article, this will help reduce the rendering latency, but without full control of the pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a game supports the NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency mode, we recommend using that mode over the Ultra Low Latency mode in the driver. However, if you leave both on, the Reflex Low Latency mode will take higher priority automatically for you. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrefer Maximum Performance\nThe NVIDIA graphics driver has long shipped with an option called \u201cPower Management Mode\u201d. This option allows gamers to choose how the GPU operates in CPU-bound scenarios. When the GPU is saturated with work, it will always run at maximum performance. However, when the GPU is not saturated with work there is an opportunity to save power by reducing GPU clocks while maintaining FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the Low Latency Boost feature in the Reflex SDK, the Prefer Maximum Performance mode overrides the power savings features in the GPU and allows the GPU to always run at higher clocks. These higher clocks can reduce latency in CPU-bound instances at a tradeoff of higher power consumption. This mode is designed for gamers who want to squeeze every last microsecond of latency out of the pipeline regardless of power.\nWith GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs, we are able to set this clock value higher than before, allowing the GPU to target the absolute lowest render latency possible when CPU-bound. Users with older GPUs can still turn on Prefer Maximum Performance and hold clocks to base frequencies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic Tuning in GeForce Experience\nWith the release of a new GeForce Experience update coming in September, there\u2019ll be a new beta feature in the In-game overlay performance panel that allows gamers to tune their GPU for lower render latency with a single click.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis advanced automatic tuner scans your GPU for the maximum frequency bump at each voltage point on the curve. Once it has found and applied the perfect settings for your GPU, it also retests and maintains your tuning over time - keeping your tune stable.\nStay tuned to GeForce.com for further details and a how-to for this exciting new feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring System Latency with NVIDIA Reflex\nOne of the main reasons why system latency hasn\u2019t been widely talked about until now is that it\u2019s been incredibly difficult to accurately measure. In order to measure latency, your measurement device has to be able to accurately know the start and end times of the measurement.\nTraditionally, measuring system latency has only been accomplished with expensive and cumbersome high speed cameras, engineering equipment, and a modified mouse and LED to track when the mouse button has been pressed. With a 1000 FPS high speed camera, you can measure a minimum of 1ms of latency. However, a setup like this starts at about $7,000 USD for the bare minimum equipment. Even then, once you have the setup, it takes roughly 3 minutes for each measurement\u2026pretty much a non-starter for 99.9% of gamers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer\nCompatible 360Hz G-SYNC displays launching this Fall come enabled with a new feature - NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer. This revolutionary addition enables gamers to measure their system responsiveness, allowing them to fully understand and tweak their PC\u2019s performance before starting a match.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo access this capability, simply plug your mouse into the designated Reflex Latency Analyzer USB port on a 360Hz G-SYNC display. The display's Reflex USB port is a simple passthrough to the PC that watches for mouse clicks without adding any latency.\nReflex Latency Analyzer works by detecting the clicks coming from your mouse and measuring the time it takes for a resulting display pixel change (i.e. gun fire) to happen on the screen, providing you with a full System Latency measurement.\nGeForce Experience\u2019s new Performance Overlay reports the latency metrics in real-time. To view the latency metrics, navigate to the \u201cPerformance Overlay\u201d options, and enable the \u201cLatency Metrics\u201d setting, when released in September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer breaks the system latency measurement up into Mouse Latency, PC + Display Latency, and System Latency.\nYou can use any mouse with Reflex Latency Analyzer to get PC + Display Latency (with the exception of Bluetooth mice). However, with a compatible mouse, you will also be able to measure peripheral latency and get full end-to-end system latency.\nAdditionally, we will also be releasing an open database of average mouse latencies that can be referenced if GeForce Experience recognises your mouse. In the future, the community will be able to add mice to the database. More on this in the future.\nAt the time of writing, there are four mouse partners that have announced support for NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer: ASUS, Logitech, Razer, and SteelSeries. Keep an eye on their websites and social media pages for announcements about NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer compatibility. Also, starting this Fall, look out for\u00a0360Hz G-SYNC esports displays\u00a0from ACER, Alienware, ASUS and MSI with built-in NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex Software Metrics\nIf you are eager to start measuring latency, you can do so before you get your hands on a new 360Hz display. Any game that integrates the NVIDIA Reflex SDK also has the ability to add both Game Latency and Render Latency metrics to their in game stats. This measurement is not the full latency you feel, but can get you started on your path to latency optimisation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, GeForce Experience now features a performance overlay that lets you track render present latency in any game. Render present latency tracks the present call through the render queue and GPU rendering. Since it\u2019s the final call of a frame, the magnitude of render present latency will be slightly smaller than render latency measured with the NVIDIA Reflex SDK, but should still give you a good idea of what your rendering latency is. We will be adding render latency to GeForce Experience in a future update.\nAll you need to do is update to the latest versions of the GeForce Game Ready Driver and GeForce Experience later this month when the feature is released, select the \u201cPerformance\u201d menu, choose the \u201cLatency Metrics\u201d set, and enable the \u201cPerformance overlay\u201d. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining Your Aim with Lower Latency\nIn addition to latency measurement tools, we\u2019ve partnered with The Meta, the developers of KovaaK 2.0, to introduce a new NVIDIA Experiments mode in a future client update, which will help gamers improve their performance and hone their skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can enter into the NVIDIA Experiments mode from either the sandbox or the trainer. Once you are in the NVIDIA Experiments mode, choose an experiment that interests you. Additionally, we have integrated the NVIDIA Reflex SDK into KovaaK 2.0, in addition to a few other technologies that can help gamers feel the difference between high and low system latency.\nTaking part in experiments not only helps improve your aim, but also contributes to important esports research. Our partnership with The Meta on KovaaK 2.0 allows us to test and bust myths in the competitive gaming space. For example, one of our first experiments looks to add some science behind the preference in target colour choice based on debates competitive gamers have around target outline colours in Valorant.\nOther experiments will test things like different ranges of latency while giving you challenging tasks to complete. Check out The Meta\u2019s KovaaK 2.0 on Steam today, and stay tuned for the release of the NVIDIA Experiments mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Level: System Latency - Expert Mode\nAlright, let\u2019s pop the hood and take a look at how this all works at the next level of detail. This section will cover how your mouse clicks actually get to the pixels on your screen, the concept of the game and rendering pipeline, the impact CPU and GPU-boundness has on latency, overlap within the rendering pipeline, and finally some tools to help visualise what is happening on your system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreaking down how your actions get to the display\nSo how do your clicks really get to the display? The chart below breaks down the stages of the pipeline. Note that while there is overlap between these stages, they do need to start and finish in left-to-right order. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, let\u2019s break down each box on the second row in the above diagram. Note that the sizes of the boxes are not to scale. Additionally, we are going to focus on the mouse for simplicity, but everything below applies to any USB peripheral connected to the PC.\n\nMouse HW - This is defined as the first electrical contact when the mouse is ready to send the event down the wire. In the mouse, there are a few routines (such as debounce) that add latency to your mouse button press. Note that debounce routines are important and prevent the mouse from clicking when you don\u2019t want it to. These extra clicks are often referred to as double clicks - when two clicks are sent instead of one because the debounce routine was too aggressive. So latency isn\u2019t the only critical attribute of your mouse\u2019s performance.\nMouse USB HW - Once debounce is finished, the mouse has to wait on the next poll to send the packets down the wire. This time is reflected in USB HW.\nMouse USB SW - Mouse USB SW is the time the OS and mouse driver take to handle the USB packet.\nSampling - Clicks come into the OS based on the mouse\u2019s polling rate, at which point they may have to wait for the next opportunity to be sampled by the game. That waiting time is called sampling latency. This latency can grow or shrink based on your CPU framerate.\nSimulation - Games constantly have to update the state of the world. This update is often called Simulation. Simulation includes things like updating animations, the game state, and changes due to player input. Simulation is where your mouse inputs are applied to the game state.\nRender Submission - As the simulation figures out where to place things in the next frame, it will start to send rendering work to the graphics API runtime. The runtime in-turn hands off rendering commands to the graphics driver.\nGraphics Driver - The graphics driver is responsible for communicating with the GPU and sending it groupings of commands. Depending on the graphics API, the driver may do this grouping for the developer, or the developer may be responsible for grouping rendering work.\nRender Queue - Once the driver submits the work for the GPU to perform, it enters the render queue. The render queue is designed to keep the GPU constantly fed by always having work buffered for the GPU to do. This helps to maximise\u00a0 FPS (throughput), but can introduce latency.\nRender - The time it takes for the GPU to render all the work associated with a single frame.\nComposition - Depending on your display mode (Fullscreen, Borderless, Windowed), the Desktop Windows Manager (DWM) in the OS has to submit some additional rendering work to composite the rest of the desktop for a particular frame. This can add latency. It\u2019s recommended to always be in exclusive fullscreen mode to minimise compositing latency!\nScanout - Once composition completes, the final frame buffer is ready to be displayed. The GPU then signals that the frame buffer is ready for the display and changes which frame buffer is being read from for scanout. If VSYNC is on, this \u201cflip\u201d in framebuffers can stall due to having to wait for the VSYNC of the display. Once ready, the GPU feeds the next frame to the display, line by line, based on the refresh rate (Hz) of the display. Given the fact that scanout is a function of the refresh rate, we include it in \u201cDisplay Latency\u201d.\nDisplay Processing - Display processing is the time the display takes to process the incoming frame (scanlines) and initiate the pixel response.\nPixel Response - This is the time it takes a pixel to change from one color to the next. Since pixels are actual liquid crystals, it takes time for them to change. Pixel response times can vary based on the intensity of the required change, and will also depend on the panel technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU-Bound Latency Pipeline\nNow that we know how a click gets to the screen, let\u2019s dig into performance. When profiling games, we often attempt to characterise performance as GPU or CPU-bound. This is extremely helpful for understanding system performance, but in the real world, games often switch back and forth.\nLet\u2019s start with the GPU-bound case when VSYNC is off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, we are simplifying the pipeline down to 5 major stages: Peripheral, CPU, Render Queue, GPU, and Display.\nLet\u2019s inspect Frame 4 and look into what is going on at each stage:\n\nPeripheral - Mouse input or keyboard input can start whenever; it\u2019s up to the user. In this example, the mouse was clicked before the CPU was ready to accept the input, so the input event just waits. It\u2019s like arriving at the train station and waiting for the next train.\nCPU - The start of the CPU (Simulation) typically begins after what is called a Present block finishes. In the GPU-bound case, the CPU executes its work faster, meaning that it can run ahead of the GPU. However, in most graphics APIs (DX11, DX12, Vulkan, etc) the number of frames that the CPU render submission thread can run ahead is limited. In the case above, the CPU is allowed to run two frames ahead. The CPU section finishes when the driver is done submitting work to the GPU. In reality, there is overlap with the render queue, but we will get into that later.\nRender Queue - Think of this like any other line or queue. The first one to get in the line is the first one out. If the GPU is working on the previous frame when it comes time for the CPU to submit more work, the CPU places that rendering work into the render queue. This queue can be helpful for making sure the GPU is constantly fed and can help smooth out frametimes, however it can add a significant amount of latency.\nGPU - This is the actual GPU rendering of the frame. In the GPU-bound case, work is back to back as the GPU is the component that is the bottleneck. \nDisplay - This is the case where VSYNC is off. When the GPU finishes rendering, it immediately scans out the new buffer regardless of where the display is in it\u2019s scan process. This creates tearing, but is often preferred by gamers because it provides the lowest latency. Stay tuned for an article on VSYNC and G-SYNC in the future.\n\nAlright, now that we understand what\u2019s going on here, we can see that we are GPU bottlenecked, causing the render queue to pile up and the CPU to run ahead. In the image above, we can see our frametime is how we measure FPS. A faster GPU would produce a higher framerate in this case.\nAdditionally, we can see the system latency, starting from when the mouse was first clicked to when the display finished. Latency is typically higher in GPU-bound cases because of the render queue and the game running ahead of the Present block and generating new frames which it will be delayed in submitting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex SDK Latency Pipeline\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at what the NVIDIA Reflex SDK does to the GPU-bound pipeline:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the render queue has pretty much disappeared. The Reflex SDK doesn\u2019t disable it though, it just empties it. But how does this work?\nEssentially, the game is able to better pace the CPU such that it can\u2019t run ahead. In addition, it\u2019s allowed to submit work to the GPU just in time for the GPU to start working without any idle gaps in the GPU work pipeline. Also, by starting the CPU work later, it provides opportunities for inputs to be sampled at the last possible millisecond, further reducing latency.\nAdditionally, when the render queue is reduced with the method used by the SDK, game latency also starts to shrink. This savings is due to the reduction in back pressure that is caused by the render queue in GPU-bound scenarios.\nFor those of you who have optimised for latency before, this is like using a good in-game framerate limiter to reduce latency. Good in-game frame rate limiters will stall the game in the right spots, allowing for lower latency and reduction of backpressure on the CPU.\nHowever, with NVIDIA Reflex, instead of being locked to a particular framerate, your framerate can run faster than your limit, further reducing your latency. You can think of it as a \u201cdynamic\u201d framerate limiter that keeps you in the latency sweet spot at all times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPU-Bound Latency Pipeline\nWhen using Reflex Low Latency mode in a GPU-bound case, the pipeline behaves as though it\u2019s CPU-bound even while the GPU remains fully saturated and utilised. Let\u2019s take a look at what an actual CPU bound pipeline looks like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in this chart, the framerate is limited by the CPU. Since the CPU can\u2019t run ahead of the GPU, there is no render queue in this case either. In general, being CPU bound is a lower latency state than being GPU bound.\nIn this case, a faster GPU won\u2019t yield any additional FPS, but it will reduce your latency. When VSYNC is off or when G-SYNC is enabled, a faster GPU means that the rendered image can be sent to the display faster.\nIf you have ever wondered why lowering your settings makes the game feel more responsive, this is why. Reducing settings can often create a CPU-bound scenario (eliminating the queue) and simultaneously reduces the GPU render time, further reducing latency.\nWith the Reflex Low Latency mode, gamers don\u2019t have to default to turning their settings all the way down. Since we can effectively reduce the render queue, extra rendering work only adds to the GPU render time.\nAdditionally, even if you are CPU-bound, the Reflex Low Latency mode also has a Boost setting that disables power saving features in favour of slightly reducing latency. In the CPU-bound cases where GPU utilization is low, GPU clocks are kept high to speed up processing such that a frame can be delivered to the display as soon as possible. Generally, this Boost setting will provide a very modest benefit, but can help squeeze every last millisecond of latency out of the pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiving Into PC Latency and Overlap\nReady to go one level deeper? Let\u2019s take a look at a single frame, but this time looking at the pipeline with full overlap. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the majority of the overlap happens in the core of PC Latency between simulation and the GPU render being complete. But why does this exist?\nFrames are rendered in small pieces of work called drawcalls. These calls are eventually grouped together into packets of work. Those packets of work are then sent by the graphics driver to the GPU to be rendered. This allows each of the stages to start working before the prior stage has finished - splitting up the frame into bite-sized pieces.\nAs work makes it way through the pipeline, it eventually gets written to the frame buffer. This continues until the frame is fully rendered. Once it\u2019s done rendering, the back buffer is swapped with another available buffer in the swap chain and sent to scan out.\nThis is important to understand when looking at rendering latency and game latency. Often game latency and render latency overlap, which means simply adding them together won\u2019t produce a correct latency sum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrapping Up\nSystem Latency is both the quantitative measurement of how your game feels and the key factor impacting players\u2019 aiming precision in first person shooters. NVIDIA Reflex enables developers and players to optimise for system latency and provides the ability to easily measure system latency for the first time.\nTo summarise, NVIDIA Reflex offers a full suite of latency technology:\n\nLow Latency Tech:\n\nNVIDIA Reflex SDK - Developer SDK used to enable NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency for lower latency in GPU-intensive scenarios\nLatency Optimised Driver Control Panel Settings - Enhanced \u201cPrefer maximum performance\u201d mode and \u201cUltra Low Latency\u201d mode\nGeForce Experience Performance Tuning - Automatic tuner for 1-click GPU overclocking\n \nLatency Measurement Tools:\n\nNVIDIA Reflex SDK metrics - Game and render latency markers enable developers to show latency metrics in game\nNVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer - New feature of 360Hz G-SYNC displays that enables full end-to-end System Latency measurement for the first time\nGeForce Experience Performance Monitoring - Side bar and in-game overlay that displays real-time performance metrics, including latency\n \n\nWe are excited to bring you NVIDIA Reflex, and to help you obtain a more responsive gaming experience. At NVIDIA, we are laser-focused on reducing latency and will continue to refine NVIDIA Reflex and expand our partner ecosystem.\nWe would love to hear your feedback!

And when playing online, low system latency can make you more competitive.\nTo reduce system latency for millions of GeForce gamers, we\u2019ve created NVIDIA Reflex, which is now available in Call of Duty\u24c7: Modern Warfare and Call of Duty: Warzone\u24c7 with the Season 6 update. And will be coming to Call of Duty\u24c7: Black Ops Cold War when it\u2019s released.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a simple flick of a switch in Options --> Graphics --> NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency, you can reduce system latency in Modern Warfare and Warzone by to 17%, improving PC responsiveness:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex works on all GeForce GPUs dating back to the GeForce GTX 900 Series. To experience NVIDIA Reflex in Call of Duty: Warzone or Modern Warfare, download and install the latest Game Ready Driver, version 456.55, from GeForce Experience, update Call of Duty from Battle.net, and you can then enable this game-changing tech in the options menu.\nAdditionally, there is an \u201cEnabled + Boost\u201d option that maintains higher GPU clocks while running a game in heavily CPU bound scenarios, resulting in a slight latency reduction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about NVIDIA Reflex and system latency as a topic, check out our NVIDIA Reflex deep dive.\nFor the latest news on Reflex, and to learn when other games add NVIDIA Reflex, stay tuned to GeForce.com.\n\u00a9 2020 Activision Publishing, Inc.

Its 4K gaming performance is significantly faster than its immediate and identically priced predecessor, the RTX 2080, and it even beats Nvidia's previous flagship, the RTX 2080 Ti, offering 4K 60fps speeds on max settings in almost all of today's top games for almost half the money. Indeed, the RTX 3080's official starting price of \u00a3649 / $699 also makes it a tempting proposition for current GTX 1080 owners. It not only doubles your PC's 4K gaming chops, but it also brings a substantial speed boost to playing games at 2560x1440, with my benchmark figures showing improvements of at least 70-80% across a spread of today's big blockbusters. Add in all its ray tracing and DLSS gubbins and PCIe 4.0 support, and it appears to be a very solid foundation on which to build your \"next-gen\" gaming PC.\n\nAsus TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3080 OC review specs:\n\nCUDA Cores: 8704\nBase / Boost Clock Speed: 1400MHz / 1785MHz (1815MHz OC)\nVRAM: 10GB GDDR6X\nMemory Speed: 19 Gbps\nPower: 320W\nRecommended System Power: 750W\nSlot size: 2.7\nDimensions: 300x127x51.7mm\nPrice: \u00a3680 / $730\n\n\n\"Appears\" is very much the operative word here, though, as until we know what's going on with AMD's rival Big Navi GPUs (which are due to be unveiled on October 28th), it's impossible to say whether the RTX 3080 is the 4K graphics card you should actually consider buying right now. Admittedly, the current stock shortages have largely put paid to that dilemma. The RTX 3080 is rarer than hen's teeth at time of writing, and most retailers aren't forecasting a proper re-stock until well after AMD's big launch, at which point we'll have a much better idea of exactly how the RTX 3080 stacks up in the next-gen 4K gaming area.\nStill, as a taste of what's to come for 4K gaming, the RTX 3080 paints a very rosy picture, and to see what Nvidia's new flagship Ampere GPU is capable of, I've been testing Asus' TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3080 OC edition. \n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 review in a nutshell\nNvidia's new flagship graphics card is a great 4K graphics card, but until AMD reveal their rival Big Navi GPUs you should hold off trying to buy one right now.\n\nThe good...\n\n4K 60fps performance on max settings in almost every game going\nSignificantly improved ray tracing and DLSS performance\nSets the benchmark for \"next-gen\" 4K graphics cards\n\n\n\nThe bad...\n\nNeeds a beefy power supply (at least 750W)\nNeeds a powerful CPU to get the most out of it\nIt's very expensive right now due to limited stock available\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the Nvidia Founders Edition of the card, Asus' TUF card uses a traditional 2x 8-pin power connector rather than Nvidia's special 12-pin connector, and its trio of fans are all located on the same side of its aluminium shroud. There's a very small vent at the end of the card to allow some of the hot air to escape upwards toward your PC's rear exhaust fan, mimicking the dual-axial fans of Nvidia's reference card design, but it's not quite as fancy or sophisticated as having proper double-sided fans like the FE version of the RTX 3080.\nAsus say their rear vent allows hot air from the front of the card to escape toward your case's rear exhaust fans, much like the dual axial fan design of Nvidia's Founders Edition card.\nIt still expels a heck of a lot of hot air out the back of the case, though, and my office at home became noticeably hotter after a day of benchmarking. The TUF's 2.7 slot design is a real whopper inside my case, too, and its 300x127x51.7mm dimensions only just about fit in front of the remaining HDD bays I've got. As a result, I'd highly recommend checking your case has enough clearance to accommodate your RTX 3080 of choice before you buy. It's not just its size that's potentially prohibitive, either. Nvidia have increased the recommended PSU requirements to 750W for the RTX 3080, so you may also need to buy a new power supply in order to accommodate it. \nHappily, despite its beefy size and power requirements, Asus' cooling mechanisms are clearly working hard on the TUF OC, as noise levels were kept to a relative minimum. At no point did I feel the need to flip the little BIOS switch on the side of the card from its default 'Performance' mode to 'Quiet', for example, and overall it was perfectly manageable. Maybe not quite as whisper quiet as Nvidia's previous RTX reference cards, all told, but certainly less noisy than a lot of third party AMD cards I've tested in the past. \nI tested the Asus TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3080 using its default Performance mode, but you can easily switch it to 'Quiet' mode if you prefer.\nRTX 3080 4K benchmarks\nThe RPS Test PC:\nCPU: Intel Core i5-8600K\nRAM: 16GB Corsair Vengeance LED 2133MHz\nMotherboard: Asus Prime Z370-P\nPSU: OCZ ZX850W\nThe RTX 3080 is quite the brute when it comes to raw gaming performance, making it the 4K graphics card to beat going forward. As I alluded to earlier, this graphics card is capable of hitting a smooth 60fps on max settings at 4K in nearly all of today's toughest games, a feat that was previously only achievable on the significantly more expensive RTX 2080 Ti. In fact, the RTX 3080 goes even further than the RTX 2080 Ti in a lot of cases, offering an average boost of around 15-20fps on those very top quality settings. \nThis means that tough games such as Metro Exodus finally lurch over the 60fps mark in its dedicated benchmarking tool on Ultra settings, averaging 68fps versus the 2080 Ti's 49fps. The RTX 3080 is also able to make a much better fist of the game's ray tracing support, too. You'll still need to enable DLSS to hit that 60fps sweet spot with ray tracing set to Ultra (and High, for that matter), but that's still better than trundling along in the low 50s on the 2080 Ti. \nFinal Fantasy XV was also a lot more pleasant to play on the RTX 3080 on its Highest graphics settings at 4K, with my jaunts up and down the hills of Duscae averaging 72fps with all of the extra Nvidia effects switched off, and 59fps with HairWorks and TurfEffects switched on. Interestingly, it still only managed an identical 42fps average to the RTX 2080 Ti when I added in ShadowLibs and its tough VXAO setting, but the RTX 3080's improved Tensor Cores and DLSS capabilities quickly put it back out in front again. Whereas the RTX 2080 Ti was only ever able to manage an average of 51fps with DLSS when all the Nvidia effects were in play, the RTX 3080 boosted that all the way up to an average of 63fps - which is also a very pleasant improvement on the 42fps average managed by the RTX 2080 Super, too. \nThe Asus TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3080 OC is a 2.7 slot card, so it may obscure some of the PCIe slots on your motherboard.\nAs for Monster Hunter: World, previous RTX cards definitely needed its DLSS support to hit 60fps on its top Highest setting at 4K, but not so with the RTX 3080. Here, it averaged 59fps in my sprint across its Ancient Forest environment, up from the 45fps average I recorded for the RTX 2080 Ti without DLSS and 35fps on the RTX 2080 Super. Switch on DLSS with the RTX 3080 and you're absolutely laughing, as it averaged an impressive 83fps overall.\nIt was a similar picture over in Shadow Of The Tomb Raider as well. Here, the RTX 3080 managed an impressive 57fps average on Highest at 4K with its demanding SMAA x4 anti-aliasing setting in effect, which is quite the improvement on the RTX 2080 Ti's 42fps average. Admittedly, you will need to enable DLSS in order to maintain that frame rate with its Ultra-fied ray tracing setting switched on, but I think you'll agree that an average of 70fps is still quite the improvement over the RTX 2080 Ti's 54fps average and the RTX 2080 Super's 43fps average. \nOf course, the number of games that actually support ray tracing and DLSS is still reasonably small at the moment, but the RTX 3080 still sets a high standard when it comes to general raw performance, too. In Assassin's Creed Odyssey, for example, it was still able to average 60fps on its top Ultra High setting at 4K, and an even smoother 67fps on Very High. Admittedly, that's not a huge amount extra on top of the RTX 2080 Ti's 54fps average on Ultra High, but if I was an RTX 2080 Super owner at the moment, I'd be looking at my average of 43fps and wishing I'd held out for the RTX 3080. \nUnlike Nvidia's Founders Edition of the RTX 3080, the Asus TUF Gaming OC model doesn't have any rear-facing fans.\nIn fact, the only game where I really felt the RTX 3080 had met its match at 4K was Total War: Three Kingdoms. Here, I only managed an average of 47fps in its Battle benchmark, which is still perfectly playable, but not really much of an improvement on the RTX 2080 Ti's 45fps average, or indeed that materially different to the RTX 2080 Super's average of 35fps. Still, whereas the RTX 2080 Super has the settle for Medium to get a smooth 60fps, the RTX 3080 only requires a drop down to High before you're averaging a very pleasant 68fps again. \nIts extra horsepower also bodes well for older games that are in line for future ray tracing upgrades, too, such as The Witcher III. Both the RTX 2080 Super and RTX 2080 Ti are more than capable of hitting at least 60fps in The Witcher III on Ultra settings at 4K at the moment, but even now they only average 65fps and 70fps respectively. The RTX 3080, on the other hand, managed an average of 87fps during my horseback ride around the forests of White Orchard, making it much more likely to stay above the 60fps line when its ray tracing update arrives with the launch of the game's upcoming Complete Edition.\nRTX 3080 1440p and 1080p benchmarks\nUnsurprisingly, the RTX 3080 makes short work of max settings at a 1440p resolution, too, often achieving average frame rates of 90fps+ (if not into the 100s in some cases) in practically all of the games mentioned above. Only Assassin's Creed Odyssey proved to be a bit of a sticking point here, averaging 64fps. However, I suspect this was more a limitation of my Core i5-8600K CPU than anything else, as when I tested it again with Intel's new Core i5-10600K processor, its benchmark score shot up to a much more respectable 80fps. \nThe Asus TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3080 comes with three DisplayPort 1.4a outputs, and two HDMI 2.1 outputs.\nSpeaking of new CPUs, it probably goes without saying that you will need a more powerful processor than a Core i5-8600K to get the most out of the RTX 3080 at 1920x1080, too - especially if you want those 100fps+ frame rates on max settings. Indeed, my 8600K fell into exactly the same pitfalls I had with the original RTX 2080 at this resolution, producing nigh-on identical results to my 1440p benchmarks instead of being significantly higher. \nThat doesn't necessarily mean you need to have a Core i7 / Ryzen 7 CPU, though (although it certainly will help). When I put the RTX 3080 in my Core i5-10600K build, for example, its 1080p performance often increased by another 20fps or so, boosting Tomb Raider and Total War up to just over 120fps from their 8600K-bound scores of 102-4fps, to give just two examples. The difference was a lot less pronounced when I re-tested at 1440p, though, and made naff all difference at 4K. As a result, it's really only 1080p where you have to worry about bottlenecks, as you're still going to be GPU-bound when you push into higher resolutions. \n\nRTX 3080 conclusion\nIf you're the kind of person who wants to be able to play all of today's toughest games on max settings at 4K, the RTX 3080 is potentially a very worthy upgrade. Its second generation RT Cores and third generation Tensor Cores for its DLSS put it in a much better position than than its RTX 20-series predecessors ever were for tackling the onward march toward all things ray tracing, and it's also more than capable of filling out those high refresh rates on 1440p gaming monitors, too. \nHowever, as I mentioned right at the start of this review, opting for an RTX 3080 now without waiting to see what AMD have up their sleeve would be short sighted. Heck, even if new AMD GPUs weren't on the cards, Nvidia's own RTX 3070 has plenty of potential to undermine the RTX 3080, too, especially if what you're after is a catch-all 1440p monster with still very good 4K performance. Indeed, I suspect this will be the card that's arguably the better upgrade for a lot of people, especially if Nvidia's faster-than-RTX-2080-Ti power claims end up proving true. \nSo, yes, the RTX 3080 is indeed a very powerful graphics card, and Asus TUF Gaming OC Edition is a very good version of it. But until we know the full picture of what tomorrow's 4K graphics cards are going to look like, I wouldn't advise anyone to go and open up their wallets and pay one of today's extortionate mark-ups for it. It sets a very high standard for what's to come, though, and I'll be very interested to see if AMD manage to beat it come the end of October.

The award \u2014 a Nobel Prize, of sorts, in computer science \u2014\u00a0 was for their work in 3D computer graphics and computer-generated imagery.\nHe spoke Thursday at NTECH, NVIDIA\u2019s annual internal engineering conference. The digital event was followed by a virtual chat between NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and Hanrahan, who taught a computer graphics course at NVIDIA\u2019s Silicon Valley campus during its early days.\nWhile the theme of his address was \u201cYou Can Be an Innovator,\u201d the main takeaway is that a \u201ccuriosity about how things work\u201d is a prerequisite.\nHanrahan said his own curiosity for art and studying how Rembrandt painted flesh tones led to a discovery. Artists of that Baroque period, he said, applied a technique in oil painting with layers, called impasto, for depth of skin tone. This led to his own deeper study of light\u2019s interaction with translucent surfaces.\n\u201cArtists, they sort of instinctively figured it out,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know about the physics of light transport. Inspired by this whole idea of Rembrandt\u2019s, I came up with a mathematical model.\u201d\nHanrahan said innovative people need to be instinctively curious. He tested that out himself when interviewing job candidates in the early days of Pixar. \u201cI asked everybody that I wanted to hire into the engineering team, \u2018How does a toilet work?\u2019 To be honest, most people did not know how their toilet worked,\u201d he said, \u201cand these were engineers.\u201d\nAt the age of seven 7, he\u2019d already lifted the back cover of the toilet to find out what made it work.\nHanrahan worked with Steve Jobs at Pixar. Jobs\u2019s curiosity and excitement about touch-capacitive sensors \u2014 technology that dated back to the 1970s \u2014 would eventually lead to the touch interface of the iPhone, he said.\nAfter the talk, Huang joined the video feed from his increasingly familiar kitchen at home and interviewed Hanrahan. The wide-ranging conversation was like a time machine, with questions and reminisces looking back 20 years and discussions peering forward to the next 20.\n\n\nCategories: CorporateTags: Events | GPU | Visual Computing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This has since been corroborated by Videocardz, which claims its own sources have confirmed the same delays.\n\n\n \nYou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

The budget GTX 1630 is reportedly already with board partners and has final designs for packaging, but an embargo on the announcement was suddenly changed by Nvidia at the last minute. The reason, according to Videocardz, is due to a shortage of components, although not specifically for the GPUs themselves.These rumors suggest that Nvidia will launch its next-generation GPUs right before AMD plans to release its own new slate of hardware, with Radeon RX 7000 series GPUs reportedly scheduled for launch in Q4 of this year. AMD is introducing its new RDNA 3 architecture with these cards, which should hopefully help performance in ray-tracing workloads while also providing better efficiency than RDNA 2 GPUs (the same architecture in both the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5).Intel is also planning to launch its first discrete GPUs for consumers later this summer. The Arc 5 and Arc 7 GPUs were recently delayed, although Intel still expects to start shipping them between July and August this year.The Best PC Games To Play In 2025See More \n\n\n \n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

See frame rates, clock speeds, GPU temperatures, and more in one overlay. And when new NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer G-SYNC displays arrive this fall, you can monitor system latency, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use this new feature, first ensure \u201cIn-Game Overlay\u201d is enabled in Settings > General.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, press Alt+Z to load the Share overlay on your desktop or in-game, and click the new \u201cPerformance\u201d button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new sidebar will appear on the left of your screen. In the topmost portion, click the cog highlighted in our image below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this new screen, you can select where on your display monitored metrics appear:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting Advanced will display the full suite of tracked stats; Basic will show the key stats most gamers are interested in:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, Alt+R will toggle the display of stats at any time.

While AI began in the data center, it is moving quickly to the edge \u2014 to stores, warehouses, hospitals, streets, and airports, where smart sensors connected to AI computers can speed checkouts, direct forklifts, orchestrate traffic, and save power. In time, there will be trillions of these small autonomous computers powered by AI, connected by massively powerful cloud data centers in every corner of the world. \nBut in many ways, the field is just getting started. That\u2019s why we are excited to be creating a world-class AI laboratory in Cambridge, at the Arm headquarters:\u00a0a\u00a0Hadron collider or Hubble telescope, if you like, for artificial intelligence.\u00a0\u00a0\nNVIDIA, together with Arm, is uniquely positioned to launch this effort. NVIDIA is the leader in\u00a0AI computing, while Arm is present across a vast ecosystem of edge devices, with more than 180 billion units shipped. With this newly announced combination, we are creating the leading computing company for the age of AI.\u00a0\nArm is an incredible\u00a0company and it employs some of the greatest engineering minds in the world. But we believe we can make Arm even more incredible and take it to even higher levels. We want to propel it \u2014 and the U.K. \u2014 to global AI leadership.\nWe will create an open center of excellence in the area once home to giants like Isaac Newton and Alan Turing, for whom key NVIDIA technologies are named. Here, leading scientists, engineers and researchers from the U.K. and around the world will come develop their ideas, collaborate and conduct their ground-breaking work in areas like healthcare,\u00a0life sciences,\u00a0self-driving cars and other fields. We want the U.K. to attract\u00a0the best minds and talent from around the world.\u00a0\nThe center in Cambridge will include:\u00a0\n\nAn Arm / NVIDIA-based\u00a0supercomputer. Expected to be one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in the world, this system will combine state-of-the art Arm CPUs, NVIDIA\u2019s most advanced GPU technology, and NVIDIA Mellanox DPUs, along with high-performance computing and AI software from NVIDIA and our many partners. For reference, the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer,\u00a0Fugaku\u00a0in Japan, is Arm-based, and NVIDIA\u2019s own supercomputer\u00a0Selene\u00a0is the seventh most powerful system in the world.\u00a0\u00a0\nResearch Fellowships and Partnerships. In this center, NVIDIA will expand research partnerships within the U.K., with academia and industry to conduct research covering leading-edge work in healthcare, autonomous vehicles, robotics, data science and more. NVIDIA already has successful research partnerships with King\u2019s College and Oxford.\u00a0\nAI Training.\u00a0NVIDIA\u2019s education wing, the Deep Learning Institute, has trained more than 250,000 students on both fundamental and applied AI. NVIDIA will create an institute in Cambridge, and make our curriculum available throughout the U.K. This will provide both young people and mid-career workers with new AI skills, creating job opportunities and preparing the next generation of U.K. developers for AI leadership.\u00a0\nStartup Accelerator. Much of the leading-edge work in AI is done by startups. NVIDIA Inception, a startup\u00a0accelerator program, has more than 6,000 members \u2014 with more than 400 based in the U.K. NVIDIA will further its investment in this area by providing U.K. startups with access to the Arm supercomputer, connections to researchers from NVIDIA and partners, technical training and marketing promotion to help them grow.\u00a0\nIndustry Collaboration. The NVIDIA AI research facility will be an open hub for industry collaboration, providing a uniquely powerful center of excellence in Britain. NVIDIA\u2019s industry partnerships include GSK, Oxford Nanopore and other leaders in their fields. From helping to fight COVID-19 to finding new energy sources, NVIDIA is already working with industry across the U.K. today \u2014 but we can and will do more.\u00a0\n\nWe are ambitious. We can\u2019t wait to build on the foundations created by the talented minds of NVIDIA and Arm to make Cambridge the next great AI center for the world.\nImage credit: Richard Croft, licensed for\u00a0reuse\u00a0under this\u00a0Creative Commons Licence.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Deep Learning | Research | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Modern game engines have exceeded the capability of traditional storage APIs; a new generation of I/O architecture is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing NVIDIA RTX IO\nLeveraging the advanced architecture of our new GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards, we\u2019ve created NVIDIA RTX IO, a suite of technologies that enable rapid GPU-based loading and game asset decompression, accelerating I/O performance by up to 100x compared to hard drives and traditional storage APIs. When used with Microsoft\u2019s new DirectStorage for Windows API, RTX IO offloads dozens of CPU cores\u2019 worth of work to your GeForce RTX GPU, improving frame rates, enabling near-instantaneous game loading, and opening the door to a new era of large, incredibly detailed open world games.\nObject pop-in and stutter can be reduced, and high-quality textures can be streamed at incredible rates, so even if you\u2019re speeding through a world, everything runs and looks great. In addition, with lossless compression, game download and install sizes can be reduced, allowing gamers to store more games on their SSD while also improving their performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cMicrosoft is delighted to partner with NVIDIA to bring the benefits of next generation I/O to Windows gamers. DirectStorage for Windows will let games leverage NVIDIA\u2019s cutting-edge RTX IO and provide game developers with a highly efficient and standard way to get the best possible performance from the GPU and I/O system. With DirectStorage, game sizes are minimized, load times reduced, and virtual worlds are free to become more expansive and detailed, with smooth & seamless streaming.\u201d - Bryan Langley - Group Program Manager for Windows Graphics and Gaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow NVIDIA RTX IO Works\nNVIDIA RTX IO plugs into Microsoft\u2019s upcoming DirectStorage API, which is a next-generation storage architecture designed specifically for gaming PCs equipped with state-of-the-art NVMe SSDs, and the complex workloads that modern games require. Together, the streamlined and parallelized APIs, specifically tailored for games, allow dramatically reduced IO overhead and maximize performance/bandwidth from NVMe SSD to your RTX IO-enabled GPU.\nSpecifically, NVIDIA RTX IO brings GPU-based lossless decompression, allowing reads through DirectStorage to remain compressed while being delivered to the GPU for decompression. This removes the load from the CPU, moving the data from storage to the GPU in its more efficient, compressed form, and improving I/O performance by a factor of 2.\nGeForce RTX GPUs are capable of decompression performance beyond the limits of even Gen4 SSDs, offloading dozens of CPU cores\u2019 worth of work to deliver maximum overall system performance for next generation games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX IO: GPU Accelerated Storage Technology For The Next Generation of Games\nMicrosoft is targeting a developer preview of DirectStorage for Windows for game developers next year, and NVIDIA RTX gamers will be able to take advantage of RTX IO-enhanced games as soon as they become available.

The ripples expanded quickly.\nToday, AI translates web pages and automatically routes customer service calls. It\u2019s helping hospitals read X-rays, banks calculate credit risks and retailers stock shelves to optimize sales.\nIn short, machine learning, one part of the broad field of AI, is set to become as mainstream as software applications. That\u2019s why the process of running ML needs to be as buttoned down as the job of running IT systems.\nMachine Learning Layered on DevOps\nMLOps is modeled on the existing discipline of DevOps, the modern practice of efficiently writing, deploying and running enterprise applications. DevOps got its start a decade ago as a way warring tribes of software developers (the Devs) and IT operations teams (the Ops) could collaborate.\nMLOps adds to the team the data scientists, who curate datasets and build AI models that analyze them. It also includes ML engineers, who run those datasets through the models in disciplined, automated ways.\nMLOps combine machine learning, applications development and IT operations. Source: Neal Analytics\nIt\u2019s a big challenge in raw performance as well as management rigor. Datasets are massive and growing, and can change in real time. AI models require careful tracking through cycles of experiments, tuning and retraining.\nSo, MLOps needs a powerful AI infrastructure that can scale as companies grow. For this foundation, many companies use the NVIDIA DGX platform and NVIDIA AI Enterprise, which includes AI tools and frameworks like TAO Toolkit, Triton Inference Server, RAPIDS and more.\nLifecycle Tracking for Data Scientists\nWith an AI infrastructure in place, an enterprise data center can layer on the following elements of an MLOps software stack:\n\nData sources and the datasets created from them\nA repository of AI models tagged with their histories and attributes\nAn automated ML pipeline that manages datasets, models and experiments through their lifecycles\nSoftware containers, typically based on Kubernetes, to simplify running these jobs\n\nIt\u2019s a heady set of related jobs to weave into one process.\nData scientists need the freedom to cut and paste datasets together from external sources and internal data lakes. Yet their work and those datasets need to be carefully labeled and tracked.\nLikewise, they need to experiment and iterate to craft great models well torqued to the task at hand. So they need flexible sandboxes and rock-solid repositories.\nAnd they need ways to work with the ML engineers who run the datasets and models through prototypes, testing and production. It\u2019s a process that requires automation and attention to detail so models can be easily interpreted and reproduced.\nToday, these capabilities are becoming available as part of cloud-computing services. Companies that see machine learning as strategic are creating their own AI centers of excellence using MLOps services or tools from a growing set of vendors.\nGartner\u2019s view of the machine-learning pipeline\nData Science in Production at Scale\nIn the early days, companies such as Airbnb, Facebook, Google, NVIDIA and Uber had to build these capabilities themselves.\n\u201cWe tried to use open source code as much as possible, but in many cases there was no solution for what we wanted to do at scale,\u201d said Nicolas Koumchatzky, a director of AI infrastructure at NVIDIA.\n\u201cWhen I first heard the term MLOps, I realized that\u2019s what we\u2019re building now and what I was building before at Twitter,\u201d he added.\nKoumchatzky\u2019s team at NVIDIA developed MagLev, the MLOps software that hosts NVIDIA DRIVE, our platform for creating and testing autonomous vehicles. As part of its foundation for MLOps, it uses the NVIDIA Container Runtime and Apollo, a set of components developed at NVIDIA to manage and monitor Kubernetes containers running across huge clusters.\nLaying the Foundation for MLOps at NVIDIA\nKoumchatzky\u2019s team runs its jobs on NVIDIA\u2019s internal AI infrastructure based on GPU clusters called DGX PODs.\u00a0 Before the jobs start, the infrastructure crew checks whether they are using best practices.\nFirst, \u201ceverything must run in a container \u2014 that spares an unbelievable amount of pain later looking for the libraries and runtimes an AI application needs,\u201d said Michael Houston, whose team builds NVIDIA\u2019s AI systems including Selene, a DGX SuperPOD ranked the most powerful industrial computer in the U.S.\nAmong the team\u2019s other checkpoints, jobs must:\n\nLaunch containers with an approved mechanism\nProve the job can run across multiple GPU nodes\nShow performance data to identify potential bottlenecks\nShow profiling data to ensure the software has been debugged\n\nThe maturity of MLOps practices used in business today varies widely, according to Edwin Webster, a data scientist who started the MLOps consulting practice for Neal Analytics and wrote an article defining MLOps. At some companies, data scientists still squirrel away models on their personal laptops, others turn to big cloud-service providers for a soup-to-nuts service, he said.\n\nTwo MLOps Success Stories\nWebster shared success stories from two of his clients.\nOne involves a large retailer that used MLOps capabilities in a public cloud service to create an AI service that reduced waste 8-9 percent with daily forecasts of when to restock shelves with perishable goods. A budding team of data scientists at the retailer created datasets and built models; the cloud service packed key elements into containers, then ran and managed the AI jobs.\nAnother involves a PC maker that developed software using AI to predict when its laptops would need maintenance so it could automatically install software updates. Using established MLOps practices and internal specialists, the OEM wrote and tested its AI models on a fleet of 3,000 notebooks. The PC maker now provides the software to its largest customers.\nMany, but not all, Fortune 100 companies are embracing MLOps, said Shubhangi Vashisth, a senior principal analyst following the area at Gartner. \u201cIt\u2019s gaining steam, but it\u2019s not mainstream,\u201d she said.\nVashisth co-authored a white paper that lays out three steps for getting started in MLOps: Align stakeholders on the goals, create an organizational structure that defines who owns what, then define responsibilities and roles \u2014 Gartner lists a dozen of them.\nGartner refers to the overall MLOps process as the machine learning development lifecycle (MLDLC).\nA technical blog from NVIDIA provides more details about the job functions and workflows for enterprise MLOps. And a separate blog outlines MLOps best practices.\nFor more details, watch two sessions at GTC (free with registration). One lays out the fundamentals in an Enterprise MLOps 101. A separate session with experts from Arize AI, AWS, ClearML, Iguazio and NVIDIA walks through how to develop and scale MLOps workflows.\nBeware Buzzwords: AIOps, DLOps, DataOps, and More\nDon\u2019t get lost in a forest of buzzwords that have grown up along this avenue. The industry has clearly coalesced its energy around MLOps.\nBy contrast, AIOps is a narrower practice of using machine learning to automate IT functions. One part of AIOps is IT operations analytics, or ITOA. Its job is to examine the data AIOps generate to figure out how to improve IT practices.\nSimilarly, some have coined the terms DataOps and ModelOps to refer to the people and processes for creating and managing datasets and AI models, respectively. Those are two important pieces of the overall MLOps puzzle.\nInterestingly, every month thousands of people search for the meaning of DLOps. They may imagine DLOps are IT operations for deep learning. But the industry uses the term MLOps, not DLOps, because deep learning is a part of the broader field of machine learning.\nDespite the many queries, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find anything online about DLOps. By contrast, household names like Google and Microsoft as well as up-and-coming companies like Iguazio and Paperspace have posted detailed white papers on MLOps.\nMLOps: An Expanding Software and Services Smorgasbord\nThose who prefer to let someone else handle their MLOps have plenty of options.\nMore than 100 MLOps software and service providers are working with NVIDIA. The software providers include:\n\nCanonical: Charmed Kubeflow creates an application layer where models can be moved to production, using software certified to run on both single-node and multi-node deployments of DGX systems.\nClearML: Trusted by enterprises worldwide, ClearML delivers a unified, open-source platform for continuous machine learning and is certified to run NVIDIA AI Enterprise.\nDataiku: Dataiku enables data and domain experts to work together to build AI into their daily operations and is certified as part of the NVIDIA DGX-Ready Software program.\nDomino Data Lab: Domino Cloud, a fully-managed MLOps platform as-a-service, is available for fast and easy data science at scale, certified to run on NVIDIA AI Enterprise.\nRun:ai: Atlas, Run:ai\u2019s computing platform, functions as a foundational layer, bringing automated resource management capabilities to users\u2019 MLOps and AI infrastructure and is certified on NVIDIA AI Enterprise.\nWeights & Biases: W&B\u2019s tools help many ML users build better models faster, debugging and reproducing their models with just a few lines of code, and it is certified with NVIDIA AI Enterprise and integrates with NVIDIA Base Command Platform.\n\nCloud service providers have integrated MLOps into NVIDIA-accelerated platforms, including:\n\nAmazon Web Services: Amazon SageMaker for MLOps helps developers automate and standardize processes throughout the machine learning lifecycle, using NVIDIA-accelerated computing.\nGoogle Cloud: Vertex AI\u2019s end-to-end MLOps capabilities make it easier to train, orchestrate, deploy and manage ML at scale, using NVIDIA GPUs optimized for a wide variety of AI workloads.\nAzure: The Azure Machine Learning cloud platform, accelerated by NVIDIA, unifies ML model development and operations, providing quality assurance through built-in responsible AI tools to help ML professionals develop fair, explainable and responsible models.\nOracle Cloud: Oracle Cloud Infrastructure AI Services makes it possible for developers to easily add NVIDIA-accelerated machine learning to apps without slowing down application development.\nAlibaba Cloud: Accelerated by NVIDIA, the Alibaba Cloud Machine Learning Platform for AI lets enterprises quickly create and deploy machine learning experiments to achieve business objectives.\n\nKoumchatzky, of NVIDIA, puts tools for curating and managing datasets at the top of his wish list for the community.\n\u201cIt can be hard to label, merge or slice datasets or view parts of them, but there is a growing MLOps ecosystem to address this. NVIDIA has developed these internally, but I think it is still undervalued in the industry.\u201d he said.\nLong term, MLOps needs the equivalent of IDEs, the integrated software development environments like Microsoft Visual Studio that apps developers depend on. Meanwhile Koumchatzky and his team craft their own tools to visualize and debug AI models.\nThe good news is there are plenty of products for getting started in MLOps.\nA number of industry and open-source groups are forming in an effort to help guide MLOps standards and best practices. NVIDIA joined the most prominent of these, the AI Infrastructure Alliance (AIIA).\nFounded in late 2020, it includes more than 60 companies, working with a global community of about 30,000 data scientists, engineers and managers. We will take a seat on the AIIA\u2019s board and provide members access to our technologies through NVIDIA LaunchPad.\nAn AIIA working group created this example of an MLOps workflow.\nNVIDIA Base Command provides software for managing the end-to-end lifecycle of AI development on the DGX platform. NVIDIA also provides a reference architecture for creating GPU clusters called DGX BasePODs.\nIn the end, each team needs to find the mix of MLOps products and practices that best fits its use cases. They all share a goal of creating an automated way to run AI smoothly as a daily part of a company\u2019s digital life.\nFinally, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang shared his views on MLOps and more in the podcast below.\n\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Data Science | Machine Learning | NGC | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA DRIVE | Trustworthy AI \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

A share today is worth over 40 times its value seven years ago. So, how much would you have today if you purchased stock instead of an Apple product? See for yourself in the table below.\n\nConroy kept the post up-to-date until April 1, 2012; at that point, my first Apple computer, a 2003 12\u2033 iBook, which cost $1,099 on October 22, 2003, would have been worth $57,900. Today it would be worth $311,973.\nI thought of this meme, which pops up every time Apple\u2019s stock hits a new all-time high, while considering the price Apple paid for P.A. Semi back in 2008; for a mere $278 million the company acquired the talent and IP foundation that would undergird its A-series of chips, which have powered every iPad and every iPhone since 2010, and, before the end of the year, at least one Mac (the rest of the line will follow within two years).\nSo I was curious: what would $278 million in 2008 Apple stock look like today? The answer is $5.5 billion, which, honestly, is still an absolute bargain, and a reminder that the size of an acquisition is not necessarily correlated with its impact.\nNvidia Acquires ARM\nOver the weekend Nvidia consummated the biggest chip deal in history when it acquired Arm1 from Softbank for around $40 billion in stock and cash. Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang wrote in a letter to Nvidia employees:\n\n  We are joining arms with Arm to create the leading computing company for the age of AI. AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. Learning from data, AI supercomputers can write software no human can. Amazingly, AI software can perceive its environment, infer the best plan, and act intelligently. This new form of software will expand computing to every corner of the globe. Someday, trillions of computers running AI will create a new internet \u2014 the internet-of-things \u2014 thousands of times bigger than today\u2019s internet-of-people. Uniting NVIDIA\u2019s AI computing with the vast reach of Arm\u2019s CPU, we will engage the giant AI opportunity ahead and advance computing from the cloud, smartphones, PCs, self-driving cars, robotics, 5G, and IoT.\n\nThese are big ambitions for a big purchase, and Wall Street apparently agrees; yesterday Nvidia\u2019s market cap increased by $17.5 billion, nearly covering the $21.5 billion in shares Nvidia will give Softbank in the deal. Indeed, it is Nvidia\u2019s stock that is probably the single most important factor in this deal. Back in 2016, when Softbank acquired Arm, Nvidia was worth about $34 billion; after yesterday\u2019s run-up, the company\u2019s marketcap was $318 billion.\nThe first takeaway is that selling Arm for $32 billion means that the company was yet another terrible investment by Softbank; simply buying Nvidia shares \u2014 or, for that matter, an S&P 500 index fund, which is up 55% since then \u2014 would have provided a much better return than the ~5% Softbank earned from Arm.\nThe second takeaway is the inverse: Nvidia is acquiring a company that was its marketcap peer four years ago for a relative pittance. Granted, Nvidia\u2019s stock may not stay at its current lofty height \u2014 the company has a price-to-earnings ratio of over 67, well above the industry average of 27 \u2014 but that is precisely why a majority-stock acquisition makes sense; Nvidia\u2019s stock may retreat, but Arm will still be theirs.\nNvidia\u2019s Integration\nBeginning my analysis with stock prices is not normally what I do; I\u2019m generally more concerned with the strategies and business models of which stock price is a result, not a driver. The truth, though, is that once you start digging into the details of Nvidia and ARM, it is rather difficult to see what strategy might be driving this acquisition.\nStart with Nvidia: the company is perhaps the shining example of the industry transformation wrought by TSMC; freed of the need to manufacture its own chips, Nvidia was focused from the beginning on graphics. Its TNT cards, released in the late 1990s, provided 3D graphics for games while also powering Windows (previously hardware 3D graphics were only available via add-on cards); its GeForce line, released in 1999, put Nvidia firmly at the forefront of the industry, a position it retains today.\nIt was in 2001 that Nvidia released the GeForce 3, which had the first pixel shader; instead of a hard-coded GPU that could only execute a pre-defined list of commands, a shader was software, which meant it could be programmed on the fly. This increased level of abstraction meant the underlying graphics processing unit could be much simpler, which meant that a graphics chip could have many more of them. The most advanced versions of Nvidia\u2019s just-announced GeForce RTX 30 Series, for example, has an incredible 10,496 cores.\nThis level of scalability makes sense for video cards because graphics processing is embarrassingly parallel: a screen can be divided up into an arbitrary number of sections, and each section computed individually, all at the same time. This means that performance scales horizontally, which is to say that every additional core increases performance.\nIt turns out, though, that graphics are not the only embarrassingly parallel problem in computing. Another obvious example is encryption: brute forcing a key entails running the exact same calculation over-and-over again; the chips doing the calculation don\u2019t need to be complex, they simply need as many cores as possible (this is why graphics cards are very popular for blockchain applications; miners are basically endlessly brute-forcing encryption keys).\nWhat is most enticing for Nvidia, though, is machine learning. Training on large datasets is an embarrassingly parallel problem, which means it is well-suited for graphics cards. The trick, though, is in decomposing a machine learning algorithm into pieces that can be run in parallel; graphics cards were designed for, well, graphics, which meant that programmers had to work in graphics programming languages like OpenGL.\nThis is why Nvidia transformed itself from a modular component maker to an integrated maker of hardware and software; the former were its video cards, and the latter was a platform called CUDA. The CUDA platform allows programmers to access the parallel processing power of Nvidia\u2019s video cards via a wide number of languages, without needing to understand how to program graphics.\nHere the kicker: CUDA is free, but that is because the integration is so tight. CUDA only works with Nvidia video cards, in large part because many of the routines are hand-tuned and optimized. It is a tremendous investment that has paid off in a major way: CUDA is dominant in machine learning, and Nvidia graphics cards cost hundreds of dollars ($1500 in the case of the aforementioned RTX 3090). Apple isn\u2019t the only company that understands the power of differentiating premium hardware with software.\nArm\u2019s Neutrality\nArm\u2019s business model could not be more different. The company, founded in 1990 as a joint venture between Acorn Computers, Apple, and VLSI Technology, doesn\u2019t sell any chips of its own; rather, it licenses chip designs to companies which actually manufacture ARM chips. Except even that isn\u2019t quite right: most ARM licensees actually contract with manufacturers like TSMC to make physical chips, which are then sold to OEMs. The entire ecosystem is extremely modular; consider an Oppo smartphone, with a MediaTek chip:\n\nArm chips appear in many more devices than smartphones \u2014 most micro-controllers in embedded systems are Arm designs \u2014 and Arm designs more than CPUs; the company\u2019s catalog includes everything from GPUs to AI accelerator chips. It also licenses less than full designs: Apple, for example, designs its own chips, but uses the ARM Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) to communicate with them. The ARM ISA is the platform that ties this entire ecosystem together; programs written for one ARM chip will run on all ARM chips, and each of those chips results in a licensing fee for Arm.\nWhat makes Arm\u2019s privileged position viable is the same one that undergirds TSMC\u2019s: neutrality. I wrote about the latter in Intel and the Danger of Integration:\n\n  In 1987, Morris Chang founded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) promising \u201cIntegrity, commitment, innovation, and customer trust\u201d. Integrity and customer trust referred to Chang\u2019s commitment that TSMC would never compete with its customers with its own designs: the company would focus on nothing but manufacturing.\n  This was a completely novel idea: at that time all chip manufacturing was integrated a la Intel; the few firms that were only focused on chip design had to scrap for excess capacity at Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs) who were liable to steal designs and cut off production in favor of their own chips if demand rose. Now TSMC offered a much more attractive alternative, even if their manufacturing capabilities were behind.\n  In time, though, TSMC got better, in large part because it had no choice: soon its manufacturing capabilities were only one step behind industry standards, and within a decade had caught-up (although Intel remained ahead of everyone). Meanwhile, the fact that TSMC existed created the conditions for an explosion in \u201cfabless\u201d chip companies that focused on nothing but design.\n \n  For example, in the late 1990s there was an explosion in companies focused on dedicated graphics chips: nearly all of them were manufactured by TSMC. And, all along, the increased business let TSMC invest even more in its manufacturing capabilities.\n\nThat article was about TSMC overtaking Intel in fabrication, but a similar story can be told about Arm overtaking Intel in mobile. Intel was relentlessly focused on performance, but smartphones needed to balance performance with battery concerns. Arm, which had been spending years designing highly efficient processors for embedded applications, had both the experience and the business model flexibility to make mobile a priority.\nThe end result made everyone a winner (except Intel): nearly every smartphone in the world runs on an ARM-derived chip (either directly or, in the case of companies like Apple, the ARM ISA), which is to say that Arm makes money when everyone else in the mobile ecosystem makes money.\nThe Nvidia-ARM Mismatch\nNotice that an ARM license, unlike the CUDA platform, is not free. That makes sense, though: CUDA is a complement to Nvidia\u2019s proprietary graphics cards, which command huge margins. ARM license fees, on the other hand, can and are paid by everyone in the ecosystem, and in return everyone in the ecosystem gets equal access to Arm\u2019s designs and ISA. It\u2019s not free, but it is neutral.\nThat neutrality is gone under Nvidia ownership, at least in theory: now Nvidia has early access to ARM designs, and the ability to push changes in the ARM ISA; to put it another way, Nvidia is now a supplier for many of the companies it competes with, which is a particular problem given Nvidia\u2019s reputation for both pushing up prices and being difficult to partner with. Here again Apple works as an analogy: the iPhone maker is notorious for holding the line on margins, prioritizing its own interests, and being litigious about intellectual property; Nvidia has the same sort of reputation. So does Intel, for that matter; the common characteristic is being vertically integrated.\nOf course Nvidia is insistent that ARM licensees have nothing to worry about. Huang noted in that letter to Nvidia employees:\n\n  Arm\u2019s business model is brilliant. We will maintain its open-licensing model and customer neutrality, serving customers in any industry, across the world, and further expand Arm\u2019s IP licensing portfolio with NVIDIA\u2019s world-leading GPU and AI technology.\n\nNotice that last bit: Huang is not only arguing that Nvidia will serve Arm customers neutrally, but that Nvidia itself will adopt Arm\u2019s business model, licensing its IP to competitive chip-makers. It\u2019s as if this is an acquisition in reverse: the $318 billion acquirer is fitting itself into a world defined by its $40 billion acquisition.\nColor me skeptical; not only is Nvidia\u2019s entire business predicated on selling high margin chips differentiated by highly integrated software, but Nvidia\u2019s entire approach to the market is about doing what is best for Nvidia, without much concern for partners or, frankly customers. It is a luxury afforded those that are clearly best in class, which by extension means that sharing is anathema; why trade high margins at the top of the market for low margins and the headache of serving everyone?\nIn short, this deal feels like the inverse of the P.A. Semi deal not simply in terms of the price tag, but in its overall impact on the acquirer. I have a hard time believing that Nvidia is going to change its approach.\nOr maybe that\u2019s the entire point.\nHuang\u2019s Dream\nBy far the best articulation of the upside of this deal came, unsurprisingly, from Huang. What was notable about said articulation, though, was that it came 46 minutes into the investor call about the acquisition, and only then in response to a fairly obvious question: why does Nvidia need to own ARM, instead of simply license it (like Apple, which has a perpetual license to the ARM ISA, and is not affected by this acquisition)?\nWhat was so striking about Huang\u2019s answer was not simply its expansiveness \u2014\u00a0I\u2019ve transcribed the entire answer below \u2014 but also the way in which he delivered it; unlike the rest of the call, Huang\u2019s voice was halting and uncertain, as if he were scared of his own ambition. I know this excerpt is long, but it\u2019s essential:\n\n\n  We were delightful licensees of ARM. As you know we used ARM in one of our most important new initiatives, the Bluefield GPU. We used it for the Nintendo Switch\u00a0\u2014 it\u2019s going to be the most popular and success game console in the history of game consoles. So we are enthusiastic ARM licensees.\n  There are three reasons why we should buy this company, and we should buy it as soon as we can.\n  Number one is this: as you know, we would love to take Nvidia\u2019s IP through ARM\u2019s network. Unless we were one company, I think the ability for us to do that and to do that with all of our might, is very challenging. I don\u2019t take other people\u2019s products through my channel! I don\u2019t expose my ecosystem to to other company\u2019s products. The ecosystem is hard-earned \u2014 it took 30 years for Arm to get here \u2014 and so we have an opportunity to offer that whole network, that vast ecosystem of partners and customers Nvidia\u2019s IP. You can do some simple math and the economics there should be very exciting.\n  Number two, we would like to lean in very hard into the ARM CPU datacenter platform. There\u2019s a fundamental difference between a datacenter CPU core and a datacenter CPU chip and a datacenter CPU platform. We last year decided we would adopt and support the ARM architecture for the full Nvidia stack, and that was a giant commitment. The day we decided to do that we realized this was for as long as we shall live. The reason for that is that once you start supporting the ecosystem you can\u2019t back out. For all the same reasons, when you\u2019re a computing platform company, people depend on you, you have to support them for as long as you shall live, and we do, and we take that promise very seriously.\n  And so we are about to put the entire might of our company behind this architecture, from the CPU core, to the CPU chips from all of these different customers, all of these different partners, from Ampere or Marvell or Amazon or Fujitsu, the number of companies out there that are considering building ARM CPUs out of their ARM CPU cores is really exciting. The investments that Simon and the team have made in the last four years, while they were out of the public market, has proven to be incredibly valuable, and now we want to lean hard into that, and make ARM a first-class data center platform, from the chips to the GPUs to the DPUs to the software stack, system stack, to all the application stack on top, we want to make it a full out first-class data center platform.\n  Well, before we do that, it would be great to own it. We\u2019re going to accrue so much value to this architecture in the world of data centers, before we make that gigantic investment and gigantic focus, why don\u2019t we own it. That\u2019s the second reason.\n  Third reason, we want to go invent the future of cloud to edge. The future of computing where all of these autonomous systems are powered by AI and powered by accelerated computing, all of the things we have been talking about, that future is being invented as we speak, and there are so many great opportunities there. Edge data centers \u2014 5G edge data centers \u2014 autonomous machines of all sizes and shapes, autonomous factories, Nvidia has built a lot of software as you guys have seen \u2014 Metropolis, Clara, Isaac, Drive, Jarvis, Aerial \u2014 all of these platforms are built on top of ARM, and before we go and see the inflection point, wouldn\u2019t it be great if we were one company.\n  And so the timing is really quite important. We\u2019ve invested so much across all of these different areas, that we felt that we really had to take the opportunity to own the company and collaborate deeply as we invent the future. That\u2019s the answer.\n\nIt turns out this is very much an Nvidia vision after all. Nvidia is not setting out to be a partner, someone that gets along with everyone in exchange for a couple of pennies in licensing fees. Quite the opposite: Huang wants to own it all.\nIn this vision Nvidia\u2019s IP is the CUDA to its graphics chips \u2014 the complement to its grander ambitions. Huang has his sights set firmly on Intel, but while Intel has leveraged its integration of design and manufacturing, Nvidia is going to leverage its integration of chip design and software. Huang\u2019s argument is that it is the lack of software \u2014 a platform, as opposed to simply a chip or a core \u2014 that is limiting ARM in the data center, and that Nvidia intends to build that software.\nOn one hand, this is exciting for ARM licensees, particularly companies like Amazon that have invested in ARM chips for the data center; note, though, that Nvidia isn\u2019t doing this out of charity. Huang twice mentioned the importance of capturing the upside he believes Nvidia will generate, which ultimately means increased license fees. Sure, Nvidia will be able to make more changes to ARM to suit the data center than they could have as licensor, but the real goal is to tie ARM into an Nvidia software platform until licensees have no choice but to pay what will undoubtedly be ever-increasing licensing fees (which, it should be noted, will still result in chips that less expensive than Intel\u2019s).\nI don\u2019t know if it will work; data centers are about the density of processing power, which is related to but still different than performance-per-watt, ARM\u2019s traditional advantage relative to Intel, and there are a huge amount of 3rd-parties involved in such a transition. There is a lot about this vision that is out of Nvidia\u2019s control \u2014 it\u2019s more of a dream. What is comforting in a way, though, is just how true this dream is to what makes Nvidia unique: this isn\u2019t about adopting ARM\u2019s approach, it\u2019s about co-opting it for a vision of integration that makes Nvidia an object of inevitability, not affection.\nAnd, to return to the beginning, it is a bet that is a relatively free one. If Nvidia\u2019s stock is over-priced, then it is buying Arm for an even bigger discount than it seems; the vision Huang laid out, though, is a reason to believe Nvidia\u2019s stock price is actually correct. Might as well roll the dice on a P.A. Semi-type outcome.\n\nThree additional notes about this transaction:\n\nAs I noted above, Apple has a perpetual license to ARM. The specific details of this license are unknown \u2014 we now know that Apple can extend the ISA for its own uses \u2014 but my understanding is that the terms are locked in. That is why Apple didn\u2019t feel any motivation to acquire ARM itself, even if Nvidia, a company that Apple does not get along with, was the alternative suitor.\nThis vision of Arm\u2019s future is in many ways incompatible with ARM\u2019s neutral past, but the truth is Arm is already facing disruption of its own. RISC-V is an open-source ISA that is increasingly popular for embedded controllers in particular, in large part because it not only gets rid of Arm control, but also Arm license fees. I would expect investment in RISC-V to accelerate on this news, but it\u2019s worth noting that it is just that \u2014 an acceleration of what was inevitable in the long run.\nOne of the biggest regulatory questions around this acquisition is China. On one hand, China has reason to fear an American company \u2014 which is subject to U.S. export controls \u2014 acquiring more processor technology. On the other hand, Arm China is actually a joint venture, the CEO of which has gone rogue; it\u2019s not clear if Arm is actually in control. It\u2019s possible that this acquisition happens without China\u2019s approval and without ARM China, which is 20% of Arm\u2019s sales. Huang\u2019s dream, though, is perhaps enough to justify this nightmare.\n\nThroughout this article I will write \u201cArm\u201d when I am referring to the company, and \u201cARM\u201d when I am referring to said company\u2019s IP\u00a0\u21a9ShareFacebookTwitterLinkedInEmail\n\n\n\nGet notified about new Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease verify your email address to proceed.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelatedBestDateTuesday, December 2, 2014Apple Should Buy NetflixDateMonday, October 31, 2016Apple and the Oak TreeDateWednesday, August 2, 2017\n\u2190An Interview with Paul Mozur on Technology in China\n2020 Bundles\u2192\n\n\nSearch\n\nStratechery Plus\nUpdates\n\n\nIntel\u2019s New CEO, Reevaluating Gelsinger, Lip-Bu Tan and Cadence\nTuesday, March 18, 2025\n\nMetallica on Vision Pro, Non-Immersive Immersive Video, Ping and AI\nMonday, March 17, 2025\n\nAn Interview with Tailscale Co-Founder and CEO Avery Pennarun\nThursday, March 13, 2025\n\n\nView All\n\n\n\nStratechery Plus\nPodcasts\n\nA 2021 Redraft: Cade\u2019s Revival, Mobley\u2019s Ascent, Redrafting Multiple Jalens, Sengun Four Years Later, and MoreGreatest Of All Talk | Mar 18A 2021 Redraft: Cade\u2019s Revival, Mobley\u2019s Ascent, Redrafting Multiple Jalens, Sengun Four Years Later, and MoreApple's PreciousnessDithering | Mar 18Apple's Preciousness(Preview) Should Apple Buy Perplexity?, What Apple Could Learn from IBM, Vision Pro and Its VaporwareSharp Tech | Mar 17(Preview) Should Apple Buy Perplexity?, What Apple Could Learn from IBM, Vision Pro and Its Vaporware\n\n\nStratechery Plus\nInterviews\n\n\nAn Interview with Tailscale Co-Founder and CEO Avery Pennarun\nThursday, March 13, 2025\n\nAn Interview with Michael Nathanson About the Streaming Endgame\nThursday, March 6, 2025\n\nAn Interview with Benedict Evans About AI Unknowns\nThursday, February 27, 2025\n\n\nView All\n\n\nMore by Ben Thompson\nYear in Review\nThe most popular and most important posts on Stratechery by year.\n\nView All\n\nAll Articles\nExplore all free articles on Stratechery.\n\nView All\n\nAll Content\nExplore all posts on Stratechery.\n\nView All\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStratechery Plus\nUpdateS\n\n\nIntel\u2019s New CEO, Reevaluating Gelsinger, Lip-Bu Tan and Cadence\nTuesday, March 18, 2025\n\nMetallica on Vision Pro, Non-Immersive Immersive Video, Ping and AI\nMonday, March 17, 2025\n\nAn Interview with Tailscale Co-Founder and CEO Avery Pennarun\nThursday, March 13, 2025\n\n\nView All\n\n\n\n\nStratechery Plus\nPodcasts\n\nA 2021 Redraft: Cade\u2019s Revival, Mobley\u2019s Ascent, Redrafting Multiple Jalens, Sengun Four Years Later, and MoreGreatest Of All Talk | Mar 18A 2021 Redraft: Cade\u2019s Revival, Mobley\u2019s Ascent, Redrafting Multiple Jalens, Sengun Four Years Later, and MoreApple's PreciousnessDithering | Mar 18Apple's Preciousness(Preview) Should Apple Buy Perplexity?, What Apple Could Learn from IBM, Vision Pro and Its VaporwareSharptech | Mar 17(Preview) Should Apple Buy Perplexity?, What Apple Could Learn from IBM, Vision Pro and Its Vaporware\n\n\nStratechery Plus\nInterviews\n\n\nAn Interview with Tailscale Co-Founder and CEO Avery Pennarun\nThursday, March 13, 2025\n\nAn Interview with Michael Nathanson About the Streaming Endgame\nThursday, March 6, 2025\n\nAn Interview with Benedict Evans About AI Unknowns\nThursday, February 27, 2025\n\n\nView All\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stratechery LLC 2025 | Terms of Service | Privacy Policy\nProudly powered by WordPress.

With open networking from end to end and at all layers of software and infrastructure, NVIDIA and Lenovo can help customers of any size unlock value.\nSpectrum Ethernet Switches\u00a0\nNVIDIA allows access to the switch ASIC from all tiers of the stack. This includes Spectrum\u2019s programmable ASIC and open ASIC drivers allowing Cumulus Linux full access to Spectrum features.\nSpectrum switches also offer open software development kit APIs to maximize application flexibility \u2014 NVIDIA doesn\u2019t restrict usage or programming of the ASIC. This lets customers quickly address their business requirements by programming Spectrum-based switches, either directly or through an open network operating system like Cumulus, which enables advanced automation, customization and scalability.\nNVIDIA Cumulus Linux integrates tightly with Spectrum switches to enable programmable data center automation and network DevOps.\nSpectrum Ethernet switches are the most advanced available and optimized for high-performance enterprise-class systems, storage, AI and the cloud. They offer a fully shared buffer to support fair bandwidth allocation and predictably low latency, as well as traffic-flow prioritization and optimization technology.\nAlso included in the switches is What just Happened switch telemetry technology. WJH provides real-time visibility and actionable details on abnormal network behavior for the fastest and easiest network monitoring, troubleshooting and problem resolution.\nIntelligent What Just Happened telemetry from Spectrum switches is aggregated, analyzed and displayed by Cumulus NetQ.\nLenovo now offers the following Spectrum Ethernet switches with the Cumulus Linux network operating system:\nAS4610-54T \u2013 A Gigabit Ethernet Layer 3 switch series with a total of 54 ports; 48 10/100/1000Base-T RJ-45 ports, four 10G SFP+ uplink ports, and two 20G QSFP+ stacking ports. The AS4610-54T is ideal as a data center top-of-rack switch or can be used as an intelligent platform management interface to provide management and monitoring capabilities.\u00a0\nSN2010 \u2013 The ideal half-width, top-of-rack switch for hyperconverged and storage deployments. Packed with 18 ports of 10/25GbE and four breakout ports of 40/100GbE, the SN2010 can deliver up to 1.7Tb/s aggregate throughput with the perfect number of ports to deliver high availability for storage and HCI clusters.\nSN2410-B \u2013 The ideal top-of-rack switch, allowing maximum flexibility, with speeds spanning from 10Gb/s to 100Gb/s per port. Its optimized port configuration enables high-speed rack connectivity to 48 devices at 10GbE speeds. The eight 100GbE uplink ports, which can be split into 16 ports running 50GbE, allow a variety of blocking ratios that suit any application requirement.\nSN2410-C \u2013 Provides 25GbE through 100GbE interconnectivity within the data center and is aimed for 25GbE server deployments.

All of the RTX 3000 cards are more powerful than the company's current flagship GPU, the RTX 2080 Ti, making this year's line of cards particularly enticing.If your setup is able to capitalize on it, the RTX 3080 in particular is a fantastic graphics card. In our RTX 3080 review, editor Michael Higham writes that \"if you don't care about 4K or aren't trying your hardest to get the most out of a high refresh rate 1440p monitor, I'd consider the RTX 3080 overkill, for now,\" but that \"if you're still on the GTX 10 series, this might be a good generation to hop with great features like DLSS for simultaneous image quality and performance improvements, and ray tracing which is increasingly relevant in games.\"\n\n\n \nYou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

And with reports that Nvidia is set to acquire UK-based chip designer ARM from Softbank for $40B, that gap might grow even bigger.\nNvidia built its advantage by riding the right trends\nFounded in 1993, the Santa Clara-based firm has seen its value increase ~22x in the past 5 years. This is largely thanks to several major \u00a0developments:\n\nDemand for gaming and AI\nNvidia began as a producer of graphics processing units (GPUs), which are now heavily used in the gaming industry, and for AI computing.\nThe transition to \u201cfabless\u201d chip making\nUnlike Intel, Nvidia doesn\u2019t own any chip fabrication plants. Instead, the firm designs its chips and outsources production to specialized foundries, like the $385B Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TMSC).\n\nAlong with Microsoft, Intel was synonymous with the PC\u00a0\nFounded in 1968, Intel came to dominate the PC market in the 1990s and early 2000s.\nHowever, the success of Intel\u2019s PC business hamstrung efforts to effectively compete in the lower margin (but much faster growing) smartphone chip market. With PCs on the decline, Intel\u2019s growth has become reliant on high-end data centers (which Nvidia is increasingly encroaching on).\nTwo further blows hit in 2020:\n\nIntel\u2019s next gen of chips has encountered major delays\nApple replaced Intel chips with ARM for its new Macbook lines\n\nWhy Nvidia\u2019s ARM deal could be huge \u00a0\nARM\u2019s energy-efficient designs have been used to create 160B chips \u2014 and buying the firm would boost Nvidia\u2019s position in smartphones, tablets and internet-of-things (IOT) hardware.\nHowever, the Wall Street Journal notes some potential deal roadblocks:\n\nBritish politicians didn\u2019t love Softbank\u2019s $32B acquisition of ARM in 2016 and may not love it this time, either\nThere are concerns the deal may negatively impact the escalating US-China chip wars\n\nWe have a more pressing question. If the deal happens, which portmanteau is better: NvARM or Armidia?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics:\nBig Tech\n\n\n\nFollow us on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprevious\n\n\n\n\n\nnext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Can VR make you care about nature?\n                  \n\n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Mar 11, 2025\n  \n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Alphabet\u2019s innovation lab will solve humanity\u2019s biggest problems, if others help foot the bill\n                  \n\n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Jan 25, 2024\n  \n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Big Tech power rankings: Where the 5 giants stand to start 2024\n                  \n\n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Jan 04, 2024\n  \n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    The government can read your push notifications\n                  \n\n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Dec 08, 2023\n  \n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Enshittification just keeps happening\n                  \n\n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Jul 13, 2023\n  \n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    After years of building pricey playgrounds, Big Tech recalibrates\n                  \n\n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Jun 24, 2023\n  \n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    TikTok\u2019s new plan to avoid getting banned in the US\n                  \n\n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Apr 11, 2023\n  \n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Why are there so many tech layoffs?\n                  \n\n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Apr 11, 2023\n  \n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Is eBay\u2019s brief renaissance over?\n                  \n\n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Apr 11, 2023\n  \n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Can Netflix be a lifestyle brand?\n                  \n\n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Feb 07, 2023\n  \n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Smarter on Business and Tech\nThanks for subscribing! \n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the 5-minute newsletter keeping 2M+ innovators in the loop.\n\n\n\n\nWant even more business resources?

Engineers designed Arm CPUs into everything from smartphones and PCs to cloud data centers and supercomputers. An astounding 180 billion computers have been built with Arm \u2014 22 billion last year alone. Arm has become the most popular CPU in the world.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSimon Segars, its CEO, and the people of Arm have built a great company that has shaped the computer industry and nearly every technology market in the world.\u00a0\nWe are joining arms with Arm to create the leading computing company for the age of AI. AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. Learning from data, AI supercomputers can write software no human can. Amazingly, AI software can perceive its environment, infer the best plan, and act intelligently. This new form of software will expand computing to every corner of the globe. Someday, trillions of computers running AI will create a new internet \u2014 the internet-of-things \u2014 thousands of times bigger than today\u2019s internet-of-people.\u00a0 \u00a0\nUniting NVIDIA\u2019s AI computing with the vast reach of Arm\u2019s CPU, we will engage the giant AI opportunity ahead and advance computing from the cloud, smartphones, PCs, self-driving cars, robotics, 5G, and IoT.\u00a0\nNVIDIA will bring our world-leading AI technology to Arm\u2019s ecosystem while expanding NVIDIA\u2019s developer reach from 2 million to more than 15 million software programmers.\u00a0\nOur R&D scale will turbocharge Arm\u2019s roadmap pace and accelerates data center, edge AI, and IoT opportunities.\u00a0\nArm\u2019s business model is brilliant. We will maintain its open-licensing model and customer neutrality, serving customers in any industry, across the world, and further expand Arm\u2019s IP licensing portfolio with NVIDIA\u2019s world-leading GPU and AI technology.\u00a0\nArm\u2019s headquarter will remain in Cambridge and continue to be a cornerstone of the U.K. technology ecosystem.\u00a0NVIDIA will retain the name and strong brand identity of Arm.\u00a0Simon\u00a0and his management team are excited to be joining NVIDIA.\u00a0\u00a0\nArm gives us the critical mass to invest in the U.K. We will build a world-class AI research center in Cambridge \u2014 the university town of Isaac Newton and Alan Turing, for whom NVIDIA\u2019s Turing GPUs and Isaac robotics platform were named. This NVIDIA research center will be the home of a state-of-the-art AI supercomputer powered by Arm CPUs. The computing infrastructure will be a major attraction for scientists from around the world doing groundbreaking research in healthcare, life sciences, robotics, self-driving cars, and other fields. This center will serve as our European hub to collaborate with universities, industrial partners, and startups. It will also be the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute for Europe, where we teach the methods of applying this marvelous AI technology. \u00a0\nThe foundation built by Arm and NVIDIA employees has provided this fantastic opportunity to create the leading computing company for the age of AI. The possibilities of our combined companies are beyond exciting.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nI can\u2019t wait.\u00a0\nJensen\n\n\nCategories: CorporateTags: Artificial Intelligence \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

You can even game at 8K\u2014not 4K, 8K\u2014with some titles on this so-called \u201cBFGPU.\u201d\nYou probably shouldn\u2019t buy it if all you do is game, though. Unless you\u2019re a deep-pocketed enthusiast who doesn\u2019t mind spending lavishly for the absolute best performance possible, the staggeringly powerful $700 GeForce RTX 3080\u00a0offers much better bang-for-buck for pure gamers. Nvidia actually calls the RTX 3080 its flagship gaming GPU, even though the RTX 3090 offers more raw horsepower.\n\nBut if you\u2019re a professional who could save real money by creating videos or churning through GPU-intensive tasks at a massively faster clip, the GeForce RTX 3090 truly shines\u2014especially if you can take advantage of its massive 24GB memory capacity. Nvidia also says this card delivers \u201cTitan-class performance,\u201d and that\u2019s no exaggeration. The GeForce RTX 3090 will absolutely melt your face (and your render times) in many content creation tasks, toppling both the last-gen RTX Titan as well as AMD\u2019s creator-beloved Radeon VII. Oh, and at $1,500, the GeForce RTX 3090 costs a full $1,000 less than the RTX Titan it replaces in all but name.\nIf you need the ultimate graphics card for both work and play, Nvidia\u2019s BFGPU tramples the competition. Let\u2019s dig into Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition.\n\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This comprehensive review of the GeForce RTX 3090 goes longer than most as it\u2019s good for much more than just 4K gaming\u2014we dive into 8K benchmarks and prosumer tasks, too.

Check out our RTX 3080 review for a deeper look at Ampere\u2019s most significant architectural changes, as we won\u2019t be rehashing those GPU-level technical details here. You can also find more info about how the new RTX 30-series GPUs stacks up against the previous generation in our\u00a0GeForce RTX 30-series vs. RTX 20-series spec comparison.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s a high-level look at the GeForce RTX 3090\u2019s insides:\n\nCUDA cores: 10,496\nBoost clock: 1.7GHz\nMemory: 24GB GDDR6X\nMemory bus: 384-bit\nMemory bandwidth: 936 GBps\nRT cores: 82 (2nd-gen)\nTensor cores: 328 (3rd-gen)\nNVLink SLI: Yes\nPCIe: Gen 4\nHDMI: 2.1\nHDCP: 2.3\nDisplay connectors: 1x HDMI 2.1, 3x DisplayPort 1.4\nLength: 12.3 inches\nWidth: 5.4 inches\nHeight: 3-slot\nMaximum GPU temp: 93\nGraphics card power: 350W\nRecommended power supply: 750W\nPower connectors: 2x 8-pin (with supplied 12-pin adapter)\n\nBy comparison, the RTX 3080 packs 68 SMs and 8,704 CUDA cores. That gives the GeForce RTX 3090 a 20-percent advantage in raw specs, though it\u2019s worth noting that it is not 20 percent faster in every workload. The GeForce RTX 3080 offers roughly 85 to 90 percent of the RTX 3090\u2019s 4K gaming performance at under half the cost, as you\u2019ll see in our benchmarks later.\nThe upgraded RT and tensor cores in Ampere GPUs help with playing ray traced games at 1440p and 4K resolution, alleviating a concern with the RTX 20-series. But Nvidia\u2019s new-look cores can make an even more tangible difference for creators. Several creative applications now support Nvidia\u2019s OptiX technology, which lets them tap into the specialized capabilities of RT and tensor cores to speed up tasks. In addition to the raw denoising and ray tracing speed boosts in rendering tasks, the 2nd-gen RT cores inside the RTX 3090 now support hardware acceleration for ray-traced motion blur, and applications can now support Nvidia\u2019s DLSS technology to speed up their real-time visualizations. The D5 Render tool for architects already supports DLSS.\u00a0\n\nTwo specs in particular should make professionals drool, though: The SLI connector, and the 24GB of GDDR6X memory.\n Nvidia\n\nTaking on Titans.\n\n\nNvidia teamed up with Micron to create GDDR6X, the ultra-fast new memory in the RTX 3080 and 3090. It uses advanced \u201cPAM4\u201d signaling technology that can send up to four possible values per cycle, rather than the usual two. That lets GDDR6X move data twice as fast as previous incarnations. Again, read our RTX 3080 review for deeper Ampere details.\nThe RTX 3090\u2019s mammoth 24GB capacity is the real draw for professionals. Creators need more capacity than standard gaming-class graphics cards provide when they\u2019re editing 8K videos or processing other tasks. More VRAM helps AI and analytics pros handle larger data sets.\nThe 16GB of HBM2 inside AMD\u2019s Radeon VII helped it win over creators more than gamers during its brief lifespan. The GeForce RTX 3090 offers 8GB more capacity. While HBM2 helped the Radeon VII hit a massive 1TB/s memory bandwidth, GDDR6X\u2019s advances help the RTX 3090 hit a blistering 936GB/s. By contrast, the RTX 3080 packs in only 10GB of GDDR6X.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nPrying off a cover reveals the RTX 3090\u2019s NVLink connector.\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3090 is also the only RTX 30-series graphics card equipped with an NVLink connector, which helps move data between a pair of RTX 3090 cards in a multi-GPU configuration to the tune of 112.5GB/s. SLI is dead for gamers\u2014Nvidia won\u2019t even offer SLI profiles in its drivers beyond 2020\u2014but this is a critical inclusion for creators and software developers who can utilize multiple linked GPUs for enhanced application performance.\nThe days of rigs stuffed with four high-end graphics cards may be numbered though, especially if you use a standard PC case. Nvidia\u2019s BFGPU needs a big-ass cooler to tame it.\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition design\nThe GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition is like the 3080 FE\u2019s design on steroids.\nIt\u2019s the same cooler, just massively bigger. While the RTX 3080 FE managed to squeeze into a 2-slot design, Nvidia expanded the 3090 Founders Edition to a full three slots.\n\nIt\u2019s longer, too. The RTX 3080 FE measures 11.2 inches long, while the 3090 FE is 12.3 inches. This beast takes a lot of space in your case.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nRTX 3090 FE next to RTX 3080 FE\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a gamer, that doesn\u2019t matter. And if you\u2019re a prosumer who only needs one or two monstrous graphics card for your projects, the RTX 3090 Founders Edition\u2019s size shouldn\u2019t matter either. But if your workload can scale up if you put more graphics cards in your system, drastically reducing completion time and potentially putting real money in your pocket, the size is something you want to take into consideration.\nI have a second 3090 here\u2014MSI\u2019s custom Gaming X Trio, which is also a beefy 3-slot design. I\u2019d hoped to slap both in my system to test Davinci Resolve performance. They both fit in my ATX motherboard, but the fans on the bottom-most card couldn\u2019t avoid the case wiring for my Corsair Crystal 570X RGB case. You could fit two triple-slot 3090s easily into a full-tower case, but not this relatively spacious mid-tower.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nTwo triple-slot RTX 3090s is a tight squeeze in a standard PC case.\n\n\nThe actual cooler design could be an issue if you plan on slapping several into a system too, as both the Founders Edition and the MSI card (review tomorrow!) exhaust hot air back into your case, rather than venting it all out with a blower-style design. If you have a big case and want to cram four or more RTX 3090s inside of it after reading this review, we\u2019ve spotted a Gigabyte RTX 3090 with a standard 2-slot, blower-style design, but it\u2019s unknown at this point whether adopting a less-potent cooler will affect real-world performance. Of course, you could also turn to custom water cooling.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubting the Founders Edition\u2019s effectiveness, though. Its two-slot configuration held up very well on RTX 3080, but opting for the smaller design helped custom models with bigger coolers run even cooler and quieter. Well, not here. It\u2019s clear Nvidia engineered its radical cooler with the GeForce RTX 3090 in mind, and the Founders Edition cooler blows us away in its beefed-up 3-slot version. Even with the card running at full tilt, pushing our total system power draw over 500 watts, the Founders Edition couldn\u2019t be heard whatsoever. It maxed out at a chilly 68 degrees Celsius under load\u2014far cooler than most custom designs on less potent GPUs, and a full 11 degrees cooler than the RTX 3080 FE.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nHeavy metal. The entire body of the RTX 3090 Founders Edition acts like a heatsink, bristling with thick, black fins.\n\n\nAll those bristling metal fins and Nvidia\u2019s unique \u201cFlow-through\u201d push-pull hybrid design really paid off. Custom cards will find it difficult to match the Founders Edition\u2019s excellent cooling. For deeper details into the custom cooler, check out the Founders Edition design section of our RTX 3080 review.\nLike that card, the 3090 Founders Edition also uses a proprietary 12-pin connector to power the card, but Nvidia includes a bundled adapter in the box. It\u2019s short and ugly, though some power supply makers like EVGA offer full-length 2x 8-pin to 12-pin cables if the aesthetics bother you.\nNvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 30-series also upgrades to PCIe 4.0, which is currently supported only on AMD Ryzen 3000 systems with an AM4 X570 or B550 motherboard. Intel does not support the blazing-fast interface. PCIe 4.0 makes little difference if you\u2019re gaming\u2014the raw speed of your CPU matters more, which is why we tested this card on an overclocked 5GHz Core i7-8700K instead of upgrading to a Ryzen 3000 system. But it\u2019s possible that some professional applications can better tap into the lightning-fast interface.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nPeer closely and you can see the proprietary 12-pin power connector nestled among the black metal fins in the center of the RTX 3090.\n\n\nNvidia is pitching the GeForce RTX 3090 as an 8K gaming GPU. As you\u2019ll see in our testing later, it can definitely hit 60 frames per second at 8K in many games, though it\u2019s far from universal. In any case, Nvidia equipped the GeForce RTX 3090 with an HDMI 2.1 connector capable of handling 8K/60 over a single cable\u2014something that couldn\u2019t happen with previous HDMI or DisplayPort connectors.\u00a0 The card also packs three DisplayPort 1.4 connections.\nThat setup works well enough for the RTX 3080. Considering the 8K video and enthusiast-level aims of this much pricier RTX 3090, however, I would\u2019ve preferred to see an extra HDMI 2.1 connection, even if it meant dropping a DisplayPort. That HDMI 2.1 connection is required for 8K video, and if you\u2019ve invested in a VR headset as well\u2014easy to imagine if you\u2019re this class of gamer\u2014then you\u2019ll need to swap the cords out when switching between the two. The RTX 3090 lacks the VR-focused VirtualLink connector found on prior-gen GeForce FE cards (after no headsets embraced it). Nvidia says it decided customers are more likely to need extra DisplayPorts than two HDMI 2.1 connections, but pointed out that the custom $1,600 Asus TUF RTX 3090 includes dual HDMI ports if you need them.\n Nvidia\n\nNvidia-supplied numbers for AV1 vs. H.264 decode performance\n\n\nOn the video technologies front, the RTX 30-series GPUs are the first to support AV1 decode (a boon for streaming 8K content) and the ability to record 8K HDR video natively at 30 fps using GeForce Experience\u2019s Shadowplay feature. These new features potentially negate the need to invest in a discrete video capture card to share your 8K experiences with the world.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about the streaming software side of the RTX 30-series, I highly recommend watching EposVox\u2019s excellent GeForce RTX 3080 review embedded below. He specializes in streaming and video creation tools, and delves deeply into the performance of AV1, NVENC encoding performance, and actual streaming results around the 22:08 mark. It\u2019s a review of a less powerful card, but it should still prove insightful. If you want a deeper look at AV1 specifically, he goes into detail at the 56:52 mark of this other video. Good stuff.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur tests using Microsoft\u2019s AV1 video extension and this 8K/60 video on a 4K monitor upscaled to\u00a08132\u00d74320 using Nvidia\u2019s Dynamic Super Resolution technology lived up to the claims. Without the GeForce RTX 3090 installed, watching that video maxed out our processor, which in turn led to massive amounts of dropped frames. But the RTX 3090\u2019s AV1 decode support took over with it installed, easing the processor\u2019s screams and utterly eradicating all dropped frames. Again: Good stuff.\nSpeaking of tests, let\u2019s get to that. Evaluating the BFGPU will take a little more work than our typical reviews.\nOur test system\nOur dedicated graphics card test system is a couple of years old, but it\u2019s packed with some of the fastest complementary components available to put any potential performance bottlenecks squarely on the GPU. Most of the hardware was provided by the manufacturers, but we purchased the cooler and storage ourselves.\n\nIntel Core i7-8700K processor ($300 on\u00a0Amazon) overclocked to 5GHz all cores\nEVGA CLC 240 closed-loop liquid cooler ($105 on\u00a0Amazon)\nAsus Maximus X Hero motherboard\n64GB HyperX Predator RGB DDR4/2933 ($355 on Amazon)\nEVGA 1200W SuperNova P2 power supply ($352 on\u00a0Amazon)\nCorsair Crystal 570X RGB case, with front and top panels removed and an extra rear fan installed for improved airflow\n2x 500GB Samsung 860 EVO SSDs ($70 each on\u00a0Amazon)\n\nGeForce RTX 3090 content creation benchmarks\nOur graphics card test system was designed for maximizing pure gaming performance, but because so much of the GeForce RTX 3090\u2019s value proposition lies in its prosumer chops, we also wanted to test its content creation capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$1,494.68 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t have any Titans on hand, so we\u2019re comparing Nvidia\u2019s $1,499 RTX 3090 Founders Edition against other gaming flagships. We\u2019ve included the step-down $699 GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition with 10GB of GDDR6X in the charts below, along with the $1,200 GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Founders Edition. The former flagship packs 11GB of GDDR6. The 3-year-old $700 GeForce GTX 1080 Ti includes 11GB of GDDR5X. Finally, AMD\u2019s bizarre and short-lived $800 Radeon VII was beloved by content creators thanks to its 16GB of HBM2 memory, so we tested that as well. (It\u2019s screaming loud compared to Nvidia\u2019s cards.) We ran three runs of each benchmark and averaged the results.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that while Nvidia offers creator-focused Studio drivers now, tied to updates to creative applications, some of these tools realize their greatest potential on Nvidia Quadro graphics cards, which get enhanced support for specialized professional applications. They cost a whole lot more, though. Your system configuration also matters for many of these tests, so your exact mileage may vary.\nLet\u2019s start with Geekbench 5. This quick cross-platform benchmark measures GPU compute performance \u201cusing workloads that include image processing, computational photography, computer vision, and machine learning.\u201d Higher results are better, and we\u2019ve included both OpenCL and CUDA results. Any GPU can run OpenCL, but CUDA requires specialized hardware and software from Nvidia\u2014hence the \u201czero\u201d score for the Radeon VII on that metric.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nIt\u2019s a massive win for the GeForce RTX 3090 here, especially once you flip on CUDA.\n\nMoving on, Luxmark 3.1 is a pure OpenCL benchmark based on the LuxRender v1.5 engine. It offers three different scenes to test. The \u201csimple\u201d Luxball HDR renders 217K triangles; the \u201cmedium\u201d Neumann TLM-102 Special Edition renders 1,769K triangles; and the \u201ccomplex\u201d Hotel Lobby renders 4,973K triangles. Higher scores are better.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nAMD\u2019s Radeon VII holds its own against the GTX 1080 Ti and even the RTX 2080 Ti, but these new RTX 30-series GPUs wipe the floor with it.\nNvidia\u2019s software stack is a key ace in the hole. Many developers swear by CUDA software optimizations. Now that RTX is here, Nvidia\u2019s been rolling out \u201cOptiX\u201d technology that leverages all those RT and tensor cores for creative purposes.\nBlender is a very popular free and open-source 3D graphics program used to create visual effects and even full-blown movies. In 2019, Blender integrated Nvidia OptiX into Cycles, its physically based path tracer for production rendering, to tap into GeForce\u2019s RT cores for hardware-accelerated ray tracing.\n\nWe tested Blender using the Blender Open Toolkit. We tested two scenes: Classroom and Victor, with the latter being the most strenuous scene the benchmark offers. AMD\u2019s Radeon VII consistently crashed when trying to run Victor, but worked fine with Classroom. We tested each graphics card with the best-performing GPU acceleration possible for that card. That\u2019s OpenCL for the Radeon VII, CUDA for the GTX 1080 Ti, and OptiX for the trio of GeForce RTX cards. The results show total rendering time, so lower is better.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe Ampere GPU architecture inside the GeForce RTX 3080 and 3090 smash all prior options, especially in the more difficult Victor scene. Even the RTX 3080 explodes far ahead of the former RTX 2080 Ti flagship, though the 3090 starts to flex its muscles as complexity ramps up.\nLet\u2019s continue our look at the benefits Nvidia-specific software can provide with a pair of tools that require GeForce graphics cards. The Radeon VII, obviously, isn\u2019t included in the next couple of tests.\nMaxon\u2019s Redshift is a GPU-accelerated biased renderer that requires CUDA-capable graphics. It\u2019s been used in the real world by major companies like Jim Henson\u2019s Creator Shop and Blizzard Entertainment. We tested our cards using the hard-to-find Redshift \u201cAge of Vultures\u201d benchmark in the demo version. Redshift has also implemented OptiX and supports additional acceleration with RTX graphics cards. We enabled that for all applicable GPUs, while the GTX 1080 Ti stuck to bare CUDA. The results listed are seconds to render, so again, lower is better.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nYep, it\u2019s a whupping. The GeForce RTX 3090 is over 65 percent faster than the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, which offered most of the performance of the $2,500 RTX Titan, albeit with lower memory capacity. As you can see, though, if your specific workloads don\u2019t tap into the 3090\u2019s massive 24GB memory buffer, it\u2019s only slightly faster than the much cheaper RTX 3080.\nNext up: OctaneBench 2020 v1.5. This is a canned test offered by OTOY to benchmark your system\u2019s performance with the company\u2019s OctaneRender, an unbiased, spectrally correct GPU engine. OctaneBench (and OctaneRender) also integrate Nvidia\u2019s OptiX API for accelerated ray tracing performance on GPUs that support it. The RTX cards do; the GTX 1080 Ti again sticks to CUDA. The benchmark spits out a final score after rendering several scenes, and the higher it is, the better your GPU performs.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe GeForce RTX 3090 scores a massive 86 percent higher than the RTX 2080 Ti, and 19 percent higher than the RTX 3080.\nOkay, let\u2019s get back to non-CUDA-specific tests. When you\u2019re talking about professional tools, viewport performance matters. Unlike with gaming, faster GPUs aren\u2019t always better through brute strength in ProViz. SPECviewperf 13 measures GPU viewport performance using traces in 3ds Max, Maya, Siemens NX, Creo, CATIA, and SolidWorks, as well as energy and medical tests that draw on datasets typical of those industries. Both AMD and Nvidia contribute to the project as part of SPECgpc.\u00a0\n\nHigher scores are better. Also note that this particular set of specialized benchmarks are likely to score higher with Nvidia Quadro or Radeon Pro cards thanks to their optimized professional drivers, but we don\u2019t have any on hand to test.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe GeForce RTX 3090 generally offers better viewport performance than other options, though it doesn\u2019t smash quite as hard as it does in other tests. These are very application-dependent results. Still, if you use these tools, these benchmarks indicate you\u2019ll notice faster viewport responsiveness with Nvidia\u2019s new GPU.\nOur final set of benchmarks examines rendering performance in DaVinci Resolve Studio 16, a production tool that \u201ccombines professional 8K editing, color correction, visual effects and audio post production.\u201d (Nvidia provided an activation code for our testing.) It\u2019s very popular among creative professionals, especially for 8K media editing.\nWe tested these GPUs using Puget System\u2019s DaVinci Resolve Studio Benchmark. Puget Systems specializes in creating high-end, custom professional workstations, and the company crafted a serious of benchmarks for various applications to quantify performance.\n\nPuget offers several different benchmarks for DaVinci Resolve. We used the 4K benchmark, which requires 16GB of system RAM and at least 8GB of GPU VRAM. It tests a variety of media codecs, and each of the codecs gets put through the following gauntlet, per Puget:\n\u201cFor the 4K and 8K render tests, we benchmark 5 different levels of grade:\n\n\u201dOptimized Media\u201d \u2013 No effects applied in order to simulate the performance when generating optimized media\n\u201dBasic Grade\u201d \u2013 Simple color wheel and similar adjustments with a base grade plus 4 power windows.\n\u201dOpenFX \u2013 Lens Flare + Tilt Shift Blur + Sharpen\u201d \u2013 Basic Grade plus four OpenFX\n\u201dTemporal Noise \u2013 Better 2 Frames\u201d \u2013 Basic Grade plus a single TNR node\n\u201d3x Temporal Noise \u2013 Better 2 Frames\u201d \u2013 Basic Grade plus three TNR nodes using splitter/combiner nodes\n\nThe \u201cOptimized Media\u201d timeline is rendered out to MXF OP1A DNxHR LB at 1920\u00d71080, while the others are all rendered out to Quicktime DNxHR HQ at the native resolution of the timeline (UHD or 8K).\u201d\nPuget\u2019s tool measures how many frames per second it takes to complete each benchmark on each codec, then spits out an average score for each type of test, along with an overall score. Those scores are based on performance relative to their reference workstation with a Core i9-9900K and a 24GB RTX Titan; the higher the score, the better. Nvidia GPUs use CUDA in DaVinci Resolve, while the Radeon VII leans on OpenCL.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nAs the Overall Score and Basic Grade results show, you\u2019ll notice a decent performance bump with the GeForce RTX 3090. But once you start going heavy with the GPU effects, the GeForce RTX 3090 starts to roar, as evidenced in the Open FX and Temporal Noise results.\nPuget\u2019s benchmarking tool also proved the worth of one of the GeForce RTX 3090\u2019s most key features: its massive 24GB of GDDR6X VRAM. We hoped to run Puget\u2019s 8K benchmark suite as well, but every Nvidia card except the 3090 ran out of memory and crashed during the attempt. If you\u2019re editing 8K video, you need a graphics card with 24GB of VRAM, and the GeForce RTX 3090 offers it for $1,000 less than the RTX Titan did.\n Nvidia\n\nNvidia-supplied results in a memory-heavy OctaneRender test. The 3090\u2019s 24GB of VRAM makes a massive difference to overall performance.\n\n\nExceeding your GPU VRAM makes some applications (like Blender and DaVinci Resolve) fail their tasks. Other tools may allow you to use general system memory if the scene you\u2019re working on exceeds the capacity of your VRAM, but doing so delivers a huge performance impact on rendering time.\nNvidia\u2019s reviewer\u2019s guide walked through just such a scenario with OctaneRender. The results above show how significantly performance improves if you can keep the entire workload directly on your graphics card\u2019s VRAM rather than going \u201cout-of-core\u201d to system memory.\n\nGeForce RTX 3090 4K and 1440p gaming benchmarks\nPhew! That was a lot of work. Let\u2019s see how the GeForce RTX 3090 plays. Mullet time.\nWe\u2019re comparing the $1,500 GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition against Nvidia\u2019s $700 GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition, of course. We\u2019ve also included results for a bunch of prior-gen Founders Edition cards: Nvidia\u2019s $800 GeForce RTX 2080, $1,200 RTX 2080 Ti, and the older $700 GTX 1080 FE. (MSRP prices for the 1080 and 2080 started at $100 less, but Nvidia charged a premium for the FE models.) We\u2019re also including the EVGA GTX 1080 Ti SC2 in our roundup, as our GTX 1080 Ti FE gave up the ghost years ago. AMD Radeon graphics cards can\u2019t compete with Nvidia\u2019s enthusiast-class GPUs in gaming performance, so they\u2019re not included here.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3090 FE in our test system, with EVGA\u2019s optional full-length 12-pin cable installed because the bundled adapter is fugly.\n\n\nWe test a variety of games spanning various engines, genres, and graphics APIs (DirectX 11, DX12, and Vulkan). Each game is tested using its in-game benchmark at the highest possible graphics presets unless otherwise noted, with VSync, frame rate caps, real-time ray tracing or DLSS effects, and FreeSync/G-Sync disabled, along with any other vendor-specific technologies like FidelityFX. We\u2019ve also enabled temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) to push these cards to their limits.\u00a0We run each benchmark at least three times and list the average result for each test. We tested the older cards using Nvidia\u2019s publicly available 452.06 Game Ready driver, the RTX 3080 Founders Edition model using a 452.16 driver provided early to reviewers, and the RTX 3090 FE using the publicly available 456.38 driver.\nOverall, the GeForce RTX 3090 offers about 10 to 15 percent more performance than the RTX 3080 at 4K resolution, and less of an improvement at 1440p. We\u2019ll present these 4K and 1440p gaming benchmarks but withhold additional commentary for our final analysis. Our RTX 3080 review already proved this even more potent card isn\u2019t a good 1080p option, as cheaper cards are just as fast at that resolution.\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn\nYep, Sony exclusives are hitting the PC now. Horizon Zero Dawn hit Steam with some performance issues, but the most egregious ones have mostly been cleared up, thanks to hard work from the developers. The game topped the sales charts for weeks after its release. It also seems to respond somewhat to PCIe 4.0 scaling, which will make this an interesting inclusion when we shift to a PCIe 4.0-based system in the future.\nHorizon Zero Dawn runs on Guerrilla Games\u2019 Decima engine, the same engine that powers Death Stranding. Ambient Occlusion can still offer iffy results if set to Ultra, so we test with that setting at Medium. Every other visual option is maxed out.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nGears Tactics\nGears Tactics puts it own brutal, fast-paced spin on the XCOM-like genre. This Unreal Engine 4-powered game was built from the ground up for DirectX 12. We love being able to work a tactics-style game into our benchmarking suite.\nBetter yet, the game comes with a plethora of graphics options for PC snobs. More games should devote such loving care to explaining what flipping all these visual knobs mean. You can\u2019t use the presets to benchmark Gears Tactics, as it intelligently scales to work best on your installed hardware, meaning that \u201cUltra\u201d on one graphics card can load different settings than \u201cUltra\u201d on a weaker card. We manually set all options to their highest possible settings.\n\nFun fact: The GeForce RTX 3080 FE is the only graphics card that doesn\u2019t generate a \u201cYour GPU can\u2019t handle this\u201d warning when enabling Glossy Reflections, and only the 3080 and the RTX 2080 Ti lack that warning for Planar Reflections. Told you these cards are monsters.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nMetro Exodus\nOne of the best games of 2019, Metro Exodus is one of the best-looking games around, too. The latest version of the 4A Engine provides incredibly luscious, ultra-detailed visuals, with one of the most stunning real-time ray tracing implementations released yet. We test in DirectX 12 mode with ray tracing, Hairworks, and DLSS disabled for our basic benchmarks.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nBorderlands 3\nBorderlands is back! Gearbox\u2019s game defaults to DX12, so we do as well, and it gives us a glimpse at the ultra-popular Unreal Engine 4\u2019s performance in a traditional shooter.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nStrange Brigade\nStrange Brigade\u00a0is a cooperative third-person shooter where a team of adventurers blasts through hordes of mythological enemies. It\u2019s a technological showcase, built around the next-gen Vulkan and DirectX 12 technologies and infused with features like HDR support and the ability to toggle asynchronous compute on and off. It uses Rebellion\u2019s custom Azure engine. We test using the Vulkan renderer, which is faster than DX12.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nTotal War: Troy\nThe latest game in the popular Total War saga, Troy was given away free for its first 24 hours on the Epic Games Store, moving over 7.5 million copies before it went on proper sale. Total War: Troy is built using a modified version of the Total War: Warhammer 2 engine. This DX11 title looks stunning for a turn-based strategy game. We use the more intense battle benchmark scene.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nF1 2020\nThe latest in a long line of successful racing games,\u00a0F1 2020 is a gem to test, supplying a wide array of both graphical and benchmarking options, making it a much more reliable (and fun) option that the\u00a0Forza\u00a0series. It\u2019s built on the latest version of Codemasters\u2019 buttery-smooth Ego game engine, complete with support for DX12 and Nvidia\u2019s DLSS technology. We test two laps on the Australia course, with clear skies on and DLSS off.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0concludes the reboot trilogy, and it\u2019s utterly\u00a0gorgeous. Square Enix optimized this game for DX12, and recommends DX11 only if you\u2019re using older hardware or Windows 7, so we test with DX12.\u00a0Shadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0uses an enhanced version of the Foundation engine that also powered\u00a0Rise of the Tomb Raider and includes optional real-time ray tracing and DLSS features.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nGTA V\nThis DX11 game isn\u2019t really a visual barn-burner like the (somewhat wonky) Red Dead Redemption 2, but it still tops the Steam charts day in and day out, so we deem it more worthy of testing. RDR2 will melt your graphics card, sure, but GTA V remains so popular years after launch that upgraded versions of it will be available on the next-generation consoles. That\u2019s staying power.\n\nWe test\u00a0Grand Theft Auto V\u00a0with all options turned to Very High, all Advanced Graphics options except extended shadows enabled, and FXAA.\u00a0GTA V\u00a0runs on the RAGE engine and has received substantial updates since its initial launch.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nRainbow Six Siege\nLike GTA V, Ubisoft\u2019s Rainbow Six Siege still dominates the Steam charts years after its launch, and it\u2019ll be getting a visual upgrade for the next-gen consoles. The developers have poured a ton of work into the game\u2019s AnvilNext engine over the years, eventually rolling out a Vulkan version of the game that we use to test. By default, the game lowers the render scaling to increase frame rates, but we set it to 100 percent to benchmark native rendering performance on graphics cards. Even still, frame rates soar.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nGeForce RTX 3090 8K gaming benchmarks\nNow let\u2019s get a little weird.\n Nvidia\nAs our 4K gaming benchmarks show, the GeForce RTX 3090 is insanely powerful. It\u2019s so powerful, in fact, that Nvidia pitched this \u201cBFGPU\u201d as the world\u2019s first 8K graphics card as part of its marketing, then bolstered that claim with AV1 encoding, HDMI 2.1 for 8K/60 over a single cable, and native 8K/30 video capture with GeForce Experience\u2019s Shadowplay feature.\n\nThe company even upgraded its fantastic Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) 2.0 technology to 2.1 to support 8K gaming. Whereas DLSS 2.0 previously topped out at 4x upscaling\u2014rendering games at 1080p, then using smart AI-based upscaling to render at 4K resolution with little to no visual degradation\u2014DLSS 2.1 deploys \u201c9x AI Super Resolution,\u201d using your GPU to render visuals at 2560\u00d71440 resolution then upscaling the image to 8K. Nvidia calls the new 8K support \u201cUltra performance mode.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a smart use of DLSS 2.0, a technology I wish more games embraced. Nvidia sent over access to beta versions of Death Stranding and Control\u00a0that support 8K Ultra Performance Mode. I was, indeed, able to play those games just fine at 8K with DLSS on at High presets. Well, kinda 8K. I don\u2019t have a pricey 8K monitor or TV, so I used Nvidia\u2019s 4x Dynamic Super Resolution feature to unlock 8132\u00d74320 resolution on my 4K monitor. That\u2019s a smidge above the official 7680 x 4320 \u201c8K\u201d resolution. F1 2020\u2019s DLSS 2.0 (not 2.1) also helped that game crack the hallowed 60fps barrier at the high preset.\n Nvidia\n\nNvidia-supplied benchmarks of various games at 8K using High visual presets.\n\n\nLook at the rest of the games in Nvidia\u2019s 8K benchmarks above, though. They\u2019re mostly lighter, less-intense games, with several esports titles and the fantastically optimized Forza Horizon 4 in the mix. Screwing around in Destiny 2 and Rainbow Six Siege at High settings indeed proved playable at my pseudo-8K resolution, though RB6\u00a0had a nasty habit of trying to render at a lower 6K-ish resolution.\u00a0\nBut is the RTX 3090 really an 8K graphics card? I decided to run several games in our benchmark suite at the strenuous resolution, both at our original Ultra settings, then again at High settings. (Borderlands 3 couldn\u2019t see the higher Nvidia DSR resolutions, for some reason.) Here are the results, but keep in mind that because my DSR resolution is slightly higher than actual 4K, performance should be 3 to 5 percent higher on a native 8K display:\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nAs you can see, it\u2019s a mixed bag. Grand Theft Auto V, Strange Brigade, and F1 2020 indeed hover around 60 fps on average at 8K with High settings. Despite the 35-fps average, Gears Tactics also felt okay\u2014not great, but okay\u2014in real life, because it\u2019s a slower turn-based game. Metro Exodus, Total War: Troy, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider didn\u2019t perform well at 8K. In fact, even the menus felt sluggish in Shadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0because they\u2019re full of animated characters and scenes.\u00a0\nSeveral games (HZD and Gears Tactics among them) offer dynamic resolution scaling features that can offer higher performance when enabled, but they work by scaling down the actual render resolution and then fitting it to your screen. The dynamic resolution scaling you find in most games doesn\u2019t use any of the AI smarts that DLSS 2.0 does, and can sometimes get real ugly, real quick depending on their implementation. Play around with the feature if you think it can help you play on a 4K monitor, but keep an eye out for blurriness.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe also ran into some funkiness with games. Shadow of the Tomb Raider uses first-gen DLSS technology that tops out at 4K resolution, so we couldn\u2019t activate it at 8K. Total War: Troy\u2019s user interface scaled horribly at 8K, rendering incredibly small, which is a bummer in a menu-heavy game.\nBottom line? The GeForce RTX 3090 can indeed game at 8K\u2014sometimes. The sky-high resolution still manages to bring even this beast to its knees in many triple-A games. Consider 8K gaming more of a bonus than the RTX 3090\u2019s gold standard, unless you mostly play esports games. Here\u2019s hoping that more developers embrace the awesome potential of DLSS 2.0 in the future, as it looks like that makes all the difference in the world, both in 8K and at lower resolutions.\n\nPower draw, thermals, and noise\nWe test power draw by looping the\u00a0F1 2020\u00a0benchmark at 4K for about 20 minutes after we\u2019ve benchmarked everything else and noting the highest reading on our Watts Up Pro meter, which measures the power consumption of our entire test system. The initial part of the race, where all competing cars are onscreen simultaneously, tends to be the most demanding portion.\u00a0\nThis isn\u2019t a worst-case test; we removed the Core i7 8700K\u2019s overclock and specifically chose a GPU-bound game running at a GPU-bound resolution to gauge performance when the graphics card is sweating hard. If you\u2019re playing a game that also hammers the CPU, you could see higher overall system power draws. We saw Borderlands 3 hit 590W on our system. Consider yourself warned.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition is the first graphics card to top 500W of total system power draw in this test. Considering the RTX 3080 FE drew 482 watts, this isn\u2019t so bad given the RTX 3090\u2019s higher performance. Still, you might want to replace your power supply for RTX 30-series GPUs if your current one is on the modest side. They draw significantly more juice than previous GeForce generations.\nWe test thermals by leaving GPU-Z open during the\u00a0F1 2020\u00a0power draw test, noting the highest maximum temperature at the end.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nAt this level of performance, raw power draw probably isn\u2019t a major consideration. Thermals and acoustics very much matter for enthusiasts, though, and Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition excel in those departments.\nWhile the 2-slot 3080 FE proved cooler enough and quiet enough, it was bested by beefier 3-slot custom designs like the MSI Gaming X Trio. It\u2019s clear that the 3090 was Nvidia\u2019s true focus though. The massive 3-slot design of the 3090 Founders Edition runs ice cold at a full 11 degrees cooler than its 3080 sibling. Nvidia\u2019s radical cooler goes toe-to-toe with the best custom coolers we\u2019ve ever tested, aside from over-the-top liquid-cooled models. Better yet, it\u2019s utterly silent. You won\u2019t hear it whatsoever even running the most strenuous 4K games or GPU-heavy DaVinci Resolve workloads.\nBravo. Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3090 Founders Edition cooler is an engineering marvel, albeit a gigantic one. Custom-cooled third-party versions of the RTX 3090 will be hard-pressed to beat Nvidia\u2019s thermals and acoustics.\nShould you buy a GeForce RTX 3090?\nIt depends on what you\u2019re doing.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the $1,500 GeForce RTX 3090 is indeed a \u201cbig ferocious GPU,\u201d and the most powerful consumer graphics card ever created. The Nvidia Founders Edition delivers unprecedented performance for 4K gaming, frequently maxes out games at 1440p, and can even play at ludicrous 8K resolution in some games. It\u2019s a beast for 3440\u00d71440 ultrawide gaming too, as our separate ultrawide benchmarks piece shows. Support for HDMI 2.1 and AV1 decoding are delicious cherries on top.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA great custom RTX 3080\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080 Gaming X Trio 10G\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$750 at  Newegg \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a pure gamer, though, you shouldn\u2019t buy it, unless you\u2019ve got deep pockets and want the best possible gaming performance, value be damned. The $700 GeForce RTX 3080 offers between 85 and 90 percent of the RTX 3090\u2019s 4K gaming performance (depending on the game) for well under half the cost. It\u2019s even closer at 1440p.\nIf you\u2019re only worried about raw gaming frame rates, the GeForce RTX 3080 is by far the better buy, because it also kicks all kinds of ass at 4K and high refresh rate 1440p and even offers the same HDMI 2.1 and AV1 decode support as its bigger brother. Nvidia likes to boast that the RTX 3090 is the first 8K gaming card, and while that\u2019s true in some games, it falls far short of the 60 frames per second mark in many triple-A titles. Consider 8K gaming a nice occasional bonus more than a core feature.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nNVLink is a major deal for some professional workloads, and only the GeForce RTX 3090 offers it.\n\n\nIf you mix work and play, though, the GeForce RTX 3090 is a stunning value\u2014especially if your workloads tap into CUDA. It\u2019s significantly faster than the previous-gen RTX 2080 Ti, which fell within spitting distance of the RTX Titan, and offers the same 24GB VRAM capacity of that Titan. But it does so for $1,000 less than the RTX Titan\u2019s cost.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3090 stomps all over most of our content creation benchmarks. Performance there is highly workload-dependent, of course, but we saw speed increases of anywhere from 30 to over 100 percent over the RTX 2080 Ti in several tasks, with many falling in the 50 to 80 percent range. That\u2019s an uplift that will make your projects render tangibly faster\u2014putting more money in your pocket. The lofty 24GB of GDDR6X memory makes the RTX 3090 a must-have in some scenarios where the 10GB to 12GB found in standard gaming cards flat-out can\u2019t cut it, such as 8K media editing or AI training with large data sets. That alone will make it worth buying for some people, along with the NVLink connector that no other RTX 30-series GPU includes. If you don\u2019t need those, the RTX 3080 comes close to the RTX 3090 in raw GPU power in many tests.\nListen: You know if you need a card this powerful for professional tasks. You know if you need a 24GB memory buffer or NVLink. If you do, this is the card to get, full stop. The GeForce RTX 3090 indeed offers Titan-class performance, but without the Titan-brand price tag, and it\u2019s the best gaming GPU in the world on top of that.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNvidia\u2019s highly customed GeForce RTX 30-series Founders Edition design worked very well with the 3080, but the expanded 3-slot version used with the GeForce RTX 3090 excels. It looks gorgeous, maxes out at a frigid 68 degrees Celsius under full load, and stays utterly silent the entire time. This unique \u201cflow-through\u201d cooler is exceptional here.\nEnthusiast-priced hardware needs to meet enthusiast-class demands, though, and I have a couple of minor quibbles with the otherwise exceptional FE. The card\u2019s bulk means you can only fit a couple in a standard PC case, and while the rear fan blows most of the hot air out of your case, the front fan exhausts some heat back into your case. Those could both be an issue if you plan on packing a system full of these for professional tasks, though workarounds definitely exist for each. (Gigabyte plans to offer a 2-slot RTX 3090 with a standard blower design that fully exhausts hot air.) Since this card also targets price-is-no-object gamers, I wish Nvidia equipped the Founders Edition with two HDMI 2.1 ports for enthusiasts who want to use both an 8K display and a VR headset. (The Asus TUF 3090 does exactly that.) I still don\u2019t like the look of the short, ugly 12-pin power adapter either.\n\nThose gripes may be big issues for some people, but they\u2019re nitpicks in general.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPure gamers should get an RTX 3080 instead\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$1,494.68 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia calls the RTX 3090 a \u201cBFGPU,\u201d and it\u2019s just as potent as the BFG it takes its name from. If you need the ultimate graphics card for work and play, the GeForce RTX 3090 earns our hearty recommendation, along with our Editors\u2019 Choice award.

The pinnacle of the 10 Series introduced in 2016, the 1080 Ti was such a gaming powerhouse that, for many, the Turing-based GeForce RTX launch in October 2018 was underwhelming.\nIndeed, Pascal has had such an impact that, three and a half years down the road, the GeForce 10 Series was still considerably more popular among gamers than the RTX 20 Series. It\u2019s pretty safe to say that real-time ray tracing has been adopted more slowly than NVIDIA would have liked, and Turing just wasn\u2019t as compelling as it could have been. And that\u2019s putting it as diplomatically as possible.\nSuffice it to say, excitement about the 20 Series family among enthusiasts has been rather tepid for nearly two years now, but that all changed just a couple of weeks ago when NVIDIA revealed the high-level specs and pricing of the new Ampere-based GeForce RTX lineup.\n \n \n \n\n\nSpecifications\nHere\u2019s a look at the specs your $699 could buy from NVIDIA at launch over the past three and a half years (plus the $999+ 2080 Ti for reference):\n \n\n\n\n\nRTX 3080\nRTX 2080 Ti\nRTX 2080 SUPER\nRTX 2080\nGTX 1080 Ti\n\n\nGPU\nGA102\nTU102\nTU104\nTU104\nGP102\n\n\nArchitecture\nAmpere\nTuring\nTuring\nTuring\nPascal\n\n\nSMs\n68\n68\n48\n46\n28\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n8704\n4352\n3072\n2944\n3584\n\n\nTensor Cores\n272 (2nd Gen)\n544 (1st Gen)\n384 (1st Gen)\n368 (1st Gen)\n\u2013\n\n\nRT Cores\n68 (2nd Gen)\n68 (1st Gen)\n48 (1st Gen)\n46 (1st Gen)\n\u2013\n\n\nBase Clock\n1440 MHz\n1350 MHz\n1650 MHz\n1515 MHz\n1480 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1710 MHz\n1545 MHz\n1815 MHz\n1710 MHz\n1582 MHz\n\n\nTexture Units\n272\n272\n192\n184\n224\n\n\nROPs\n96\n88\n64\n64\n88\n\n\nMemory\n10GB GDDR6X\n11GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n11GB GDDR5X\n\n\nMemory Data Rate\n19 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n15.5 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n11 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Interface\n320-bit\n352-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n352-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n760 GB/s\n616 GB/s\n496.1 GB/s\n448 GB/s\n484.4 GB/s\n\n\nTransistor Count\n28.0B\n18.6B\n13.6B\n13.6B\n11.8B\n\n\nDie Size\n628 mm2\n754 mm2\n545 mm2\n545 mm2\n471 mm2\n\n\nProcess Tech\n8nm Samsung\n12nm TSMC\n12nm TSMC\n12nm TSMC\n16nm TSMC\n\n\nTGP\n320W\n250W\n250W\n215W\n250W\n\n\nLaunch Price\n$699\n$999/$1199\n$699\n$699\n$699\n\n\n\n \nA comprehensive breakdown of all specs is available (as always) at TechPowerUp\u2019s GPU Database, and for further reading about the Ampere architecture you can visit NVIDIA\u2019s page which contains a link to the existing technology whitepaper.\nThis review will focus on performance with the new card, and will not attempt to break down the new Ampere architecture.\n \n \n \n\n\nThe RTX 3080 Founders Edition\nTastes vary, but I have to say, the new industrial design from NVIDIA for the RTX 3080 Founders Edition is as good as any consumer computer product I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s a solid, futuristic design that weighs in at a solid 3.0 lbs. You may not agree, but I think an in-person demo might convince you.\n \n\n\nLonger than the previous Founders Edition design, this dual-slot width card measures 11.2\u2033 (285 mm) long, and 4.4\u2033 (112 mm) tall. The card\u2019s design is virtually all heatsink from the front side, with a pass-through fan the only opening on the rear side.\n \n\n\nThe rear IO bracket offers very large vents, with display connections along the edge consisting of three DisplayPort 1.4a and a single HDMI 2.1. Up to 4 monitors are supported, with a maximum resolution of 7680\u00d74320 (\u201c8K\u201d), and HDCP 2.3 is supported.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPCPer-NVIDIA-RTX-3080-FE-Review-0326\n\n\n\n\n\nPCPer-NVIDIA-RTX-3080-FE-Review-0329\n\n\n\n\n\nPCPer-NVIDIA-RTX-3080-FE-Review-0332\n\n\n\n\n\nPCPer-NVIDIA-RTX-3080-FE-Review-0330\nSome have looked at both the design and thermal modeling shown by NVIDIA in their design video (YouTube link), and assumed that this unusual dual fan design \u2013 in which there are fans on opposite sides of the card \u2013 could be problematic to case airflow. That can be measured easily enough, of course.\nOf course no overview of the Founders Edition design would be complete without mention of the new compact 12-pin connector, which takes the place of two 8-pin PCIe connectors.\n \n\n\nPower supplies featuring dedicated cables with this new 12-pin connector are coming, and optional 12-pin modular cables already on offer from major PSU makers. The $0 solution is simply to make use of the dual 8-pin PCIe to 12-pin Y-adapter included with the Founders Edition (and presumably any other card making use of this new connector).\n \n \n \n\n\nGaming Performance\nBefore expounding on results we first embark on a journey of component exploration, with the test methodology of some interest here as the hardware is completely new for us, in this context. After talking it over with the staff it seemed to make sense to use an AMD platform for this launch.\nWhy? Because that\u2019s where the enthusiast DIY market is, of course! Clearly I don\u2019t need to tell our readers that AMD has a killer product lineup with Ryzen, and if that wasn\u2019t enough to get us off of our Intel test platform there\u2019s this little matter of PCI Express 4.0 to consider.\nYes, NVIDIA\u2019s latest GPUs all take advantage of PCIe Gen4, meaning that results with an Intel platform will necessarily reduce throughput to Gen3 levels. Does this matter at all? We will cover the implications with some Gen vs. Gen testing later on, but for now enjoy some all-new benchmarks using a shiny new AMD system based on the Ryzen 9 3900X.\nI hope this choice doesn\u2019t end up costing us a week\u2019s worth of benchmarking, but hey. It\u2019s all temporary.\n \n\n\n\nPC Perspective GPU Test Platform\n\n\nProcessor\nAMD Ryzen 9 3900X\n\n\nMotherboard\nASUS ROG Crosshair VIII HERO WIFI\n\n\nMemory\nHyperX Predator DDR4-3600 CL16 32GB (16GBx2)\n\n\nStorage\nSamsung 850 EVO 1TB SSD\n\n\nPower Supply\nCORSAIR RM1000x 1000W\n\n\nOperating System\nWindows 10 64-bit (1909)\n\n\nDrivers\nGeForce Game Ready Driver 452.06 WHQLRadeon Software Adrenalin 2020 Edition 20.8.3GeForce Game Ready Driver 456.16 (Press Driver, RTX 3080)\n\n\n\n \n3DMark Time Spy\n3DMark doesn\u2019t always reflect real-world results, but it\u2019s still a handy method of estimating relative performance between graphics cards. First we see results from Time Spy, a moderately challenging 2560\u00d71440 resolution test.\n \n\n\n\n\nWith an average graphics score of 17875 over our three test runs, the RTX 3080 FE provided a 66.3% increase over the RTX 2080 FE, and a 21.6% increase over the tested ASUS RTX 2080 Ti Strix OC.\n \n3DMark Time Spy Extreme\nLet\u2019s raise the stakes, moving up to the more challenging 3840\u00d72160 Time Spy Extreme benchmark.\n \n\n\n\n\nLooking at the overall graphics score, the RTX 3080 FE shows a massive 77.7% increase over RTX 2080 FE, with the increase over the 2080 Ti Strix OC growing to 29.3%.\n \nMetro Exodus\nA very tough benchmark even at its \u201chigh\u201d preset setting (with both ultra and extreme above that), we ran Metro Exodus using DirectX 12 at both 2560\u00d71440 and 3840\u00d72160.\nResults at 1440p are first:\n \n\n\nHitting an average of 115.5 FPS across our three benchmark runs, the RTX 3080 FE shows a 47.3% increase over the RTX 2080 at these settings, with a more modest 15.49% increase over the RTX 2080 Ti Strix OC here.\nNext we look at 3840\u00d72160 (\u201c4K\u201d) results:\n \n\n\nAt 4K the RTX 3080 FE offers a 63.7% increase over the RTX 2080 FE, and a 26.2% increase over the RTX 2080 Ti Strix OC.\n \nThe Division 2\nWe ran Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division 2 at its \u201chigh\u201d preset setting using the DirectX 12 API option, at both 2560\u00d71440 and 3840\u00d72160.\nWe begin with results at 1440p:\n \n\n\nAt 2560\u00d71440 frame rates with these cards can get quite high as you can see, but I wanted at least one example of something for the 144 Hz monitor users out there. The RTX 3080 FE averages nearly 175 FPS, which is an increase of 62.1% over the RTX 2080 FE, and 27.7% over the RTX 2080 Ti Strix OC.\nNow a look at 3840\u00d72160:\n \n\n\nAt 4K the RTX 3080 FE averages just over 100 FPS, which is an increase of 66.8% over the RTX 2080 FE, and 27.1% over the RTX 2080 Ti Strix OC.\n \nFar Cry 5\nFar Cry 5 is where I may have to rethink this Ryzen 3900X testbench \u2013 unless there\u2019s some hidden 120 FPS frame limit I missed. Erroneous 1440/Ultra results aside (not published here), the game posed no issue at the GPU-bound 3840\u00d72160 resolution.\n \n\n\nAt 4K the RTX 3080 FE averages just over under 95 FPS, which is an increase of 57.3% over the RTX 2080 FE, and 20.2% over the RTX 2080 Ti Strix OC.\n \nBenchmarking Footnote\nBefore moving on to RTX results, I wanted to add that the above selection of games leaves quite a bit to be desired. While we do get a picture of how the RTX 3080 FE stacks up against a handful of recent GPUs, the original list (including Shadow of the Tomb Raider and F1 2019) had to be pared down due to issues with some titles. These were either related to the new platform, or pre-release drivers.\nFor example, when I couldn\u2019t get F1 2019 to load with the RX 5700 XT (using the latest Radeon driver) I knew something was wrong, but re-testing multiple games on different driver versions is quite laborious and these will have to be re-visited later on. The entire game benchmark suite is in need of an overhaul.\n \nPerformance Part 2: RTX On\nThe RTX series brought with it dedicated hardware for real-time ray tracing for the first time in any graphics card. And it has been quite popular to disparage Turing\u2019s ray tracing support as being unnecessary, or even some sort of \u201cscam\u201d (preposterous but a great clickbait title \u2013 subsequently changed, of course).\nIt takes an objective look at the technology to appreciate what NVIDIA has been trying to do here, and while I doubt very many readers would agree that RTX made sense in 2018, the performance with the new RTX 3080 is so much more impressive that I think it\u2019s time to take another look here in 2020.\n \nMetro Exodus RTX\nWe\u2019ll begin our look at RTX performance with a game from the previous benchmarks, Metro Exodus. This offers both NVIDIA RTX and DLSS support, though issues getting DLSS going on the 3080 with the benchmark tool prevented DLSS results today.\n \n\n\nWhile the RTX 2080 Ti was able to average over 60 FPS in this game at 1440/RTX settings previously, the RTX 3080\u2019s nearly 80 FPS was a notably smoother experience, with a 95th percentile average still up in the mid-50s.\nComparing the RTX 3080 to the RTX 2080 here, there was a 67.2% increase in performance with the new GPU at these settings, and a 25.3% improvement over the 2080 Ti Strix OC.\n \nBright Memory Infinite RTX Benchmark\nBright Memory Infinite is an in-development followup to Bright Memory that currently exists as an RTX-infused benchmark \u2013 and it\u2019s stunning. It\u2019s also the most challenging 2560\u00d71440 test I\u2019ve found to date at its highest preset, though a very impressive implementation of DLSS offers a significant boost when toggled.\u00a0\nSome extra attention has clearly been paid to make this demo look as good as possible, and I found DLSS to offer no noticeable quality loss \u2013 using the \u201cquality\u201d setting, appropriately enough. The charts display both non-DLSS and DLSS Quality results, each run at the highest \u201cvery high\u201d RTX setting at 2560\u00d71440.\n \n\n\nAll you have to do is look at the average FPS numbers to see just how punishing a fully ray-traced demo like this can be at its highest settings even at 2560\u00d71440, though DLSS provides a significant improvement.\nThe gains from the 20 Series are massive here, with the RTX 3080 showing a 60.3% increase over the RTX 2080 Ti Strix OC card here, and a 108.9% increase over the RTX 2080. It appears that, depending on the scenario, you can indeed enjoy a 2x advantage over the RTX 2080 with this new GPU.\n \n\n\nHere the RTX 3080 FE is a full 30 FPS faster with DLSS \u2013 again, at the \u201cquality\u201d level (with \u201cbalanced\u201d and \u201cperformance\u201d offering even faster results, of course). The RTX 2080 and 2080 Ti also show large gains using DLSS, but the 3080 is the only one to reach the 60 FPS mark.\n \nBoundary Raytracing Benchmark\nAnother standalone benchmark from a game still in development, the Boundary: Raytracing Benchmark (YouTube link) is nonetheless a good test of DLSS-enabled RTX eye candy.\n \n\n\nAs you can see from the above chart, this benchmark poses less of a strain on the system compared to the previous test (Bright Memory Infinite).\n \nWolfenstein: Youngblood Optimizations\nFor our final look at RTX On performance with the new RTX 3080, we\u2019re testing the card with a new beta build of Wolfenstein: Youngblood that takes advantage of the improved asynchronous compute capabilities of Ampere, and also makes use of the RTX 3080\u2019s 2nd Gen RT cores (and the latest version of DLSS). Ray traced effects are limited to reflections in this title, but it\u2019s still worth looking at as an example of how RTX performance can be improved with optimization.\nHere are the results of this (Vulkan API) game running at 4K with the highest detail preset and RTX On, first without DLSS:\n \n\n\nOnce again we have a 2x performance jump over the RTX 2080 FE (well, an increase of 96.9% anyhow). The 45.7% increase over the RTX 2080 Ti is also quite impressive here.\nAnd now with DLSS enabled:\n \n\n\nPretty consistent results here at the DLSS Quality setting as the RTX 3080 FE puts up another 96% increase over the 2080 FE. The 48.5% increase over the 2080 Ti is also very close to the non-DLSS result. The only real difference is the much higher FPS average, which is kind of the whole point of DLSS when you think about it.\nI have to say, using only the \u201cquality\u201d preset \u2013 which uses the least aggressive render scaling \u2013 I wasn\u2019t seeing any noticeable difference in quality in any of the benchmarks I ran here. I\u2019m sure I could point things out using screenshots, but \u2013 subjectively, of course \u2013 in real time it looks no different.\n \nPCI Express 4.0 Testing\nThe short version? The Gen3 vs. Gen4 question becomes much ado about nothing once the benchmarks are run. I didn\u2019t see any difference outside of a normal run-to-run variance in my testing, and yes, I verified that the card was running in Gen3 mode after manually adjusting the settings in the motherboard setup.\n \n\n\nGPUZ Screenshots Indicating PCIe Gen4 (left) and Gen3 (right) Interface\nOf course there can be a measurable difference (I did see about 2 FPS higher using Gen4 with Metro Exodus at 1440/Ultra), but it\u2019s very small. Until you break out the PCI Express Feature Test in 3DMark, that is!\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 3080 FE PCIe Gen4 result on the left, Gen3 result on the right\nResults of the PCI Express Feature Test were 26.24 GB/s bandwidth using PCI Express 4.0, dropping to just 13.05 GB/s using PCI Express 3.0. I\u2019m sure there will be applications that can leverage more bandwidth than the games and synthetics benchmarks I ran, but for gamers on current Gen3 Intel platforms there shouldn\u2019t be a noticeable impact.\n \n \n \n\n\nPower Consumption and Thermals\nLeading up to today\u2019s reviews much has been made about power consumption with the RTX 30 Series, and there\u2019s no doubt that NVIDIA chose to pursue higher performance rather than reduced power consumption on this custom Samsung 8nm process.\nBut one thing is certain after spending the last week benchmarking the RTX 3080 Founders Edition: it\u2019s not a particularly hot or loud card. In fact, it\u2019s pretty cool and quiet. Granted, this was on an open test platform, and enclosure-based testing is planned.\nAs an example of both power draw and thermals, here are the results from a test involving 10 successive runs of the Metro Exodus benchmark at 4K/High settings using DX12:\n \n\n\n\n\nTotal GPU board power (as reported by GPUZ) topped out at 331.3W, with max temps of 77 C in a 22 C room. That board power measurement can\u2019t be immediately validated via hardware (as I wait for GPU testing equipment), so I will add some trusty wall power measurements to compliment the software reporting here:\n \n\n\nTwo things stand out here. First, the RTX 3080 Founders Edition is using quite a bit more power than even a factory overclocked RTX 2080 Ti. Second, total system draw at the wall under a full 4K gaming load is still just 462 watts here, and considering the graphics horsepower you\u2019re getting I don\u2019t personally consider this a problem.\nAMD fans will be quick to judge NVIDIA on power consumption with the RTX 30 Series, and I daresay the RTX 3080 will not end up being a darling of the small form-factor community. Still, I was expecting more power draw than 462W, which is largely a testament to AMD\u2019s efficient Ryzen 3000 series CPUs. Still, the 750W PSU recommendation seems very safe, even if you have a CPU that consumes 200W on its own.\n \n \n \n\n\nPricing\nOk, here we go. This is the topic that seemed to get more attention with the 20 Series than all of the performance metrics combined. It makes sense. The simple fact is that the cost of NVIDIA graphics cards rose sharply from Pascal (the GTX 10 series) to Turing (RTX 20 series).\nRemember, the high-end GTX 1080 Ti launched at $699, which at that time was just $50 more than the outgoing GTX 980 Ti. In late 2018 the RTX 2080 Ti Founders Edition arrived at $1199, a $200 premium over the official (theoretical) $999 launch price. And partner models often commanded significantly more.\nThe jump from $699 to $1199 for the high-end consumer option was, to put it mildly, not particularly well received on the DIY side of the PC enthusiast community. And now a significant performance improvement over this $1200 card is launching for $699, which is the same launch price as the RTX 2080 and the GTX 1080 Ti.\nNeedless to say, I think pricing with the RTX 3080 is fantastic. Grumblings about the days of high-end sub-$500 graphics cards aside, I think the 3080 is a bargain at $699, and the upcoming RTX 3070 might just be the sweet spot at $499.\n \nFinal Thoughts\nNVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition is the fastest graphics card I\u2019ve ever tested, and it\u2019s an amazing product for the money. Now, actually buying one for $699 might require divine intervention, but we don\u2019t really know until they go on sale.\nWe know demand will be there because performance is just so damn impressive with this card. No, the leap in performance isn\u2019t 2x over the RTX 2080 outside of certain testing scenarios, but it\u2019s always significant \u2013 often 60% or greater. The RTX 2080 was soundly beaten in these benchmarks by an average of 72% (!) between raster and raytraced tests (and the number moves to 76% if you count the beta Wolfenstein: Youngblood results).\nI\u2019ll be honest here. The RTX 2080 was a letdown. The Turing launch left a lot of gamers frustrated, and Pascal continued to be the architecture of choice for most GeForce gamers. RTX made for an awesome demo, but outside of a few titles that was about it. DLSS took time to improve, and without it full native rendering with real-time ray tracing was too expensive from a performance standpoint.\nI feel like the ray tracing story has changed, if the RTX 3080 is any indication. Suddenly I\u2019m really interested in games that use more RTX features, and excited about the prospect of the RTX 3090\u2019s performance in this department. Frame rates \u2013 even without DLSS \u2013 are suddenly playable even at very high settings, and the visuals in some of the games and demos are stunning.\n \n\n\nWith the RTX 3080 we finally have a graphics card that redefines the $699 performance level in a way that eclipses even the GTX 1080 Ti. It\u2019s an exciting time to be an enthusiast, and I can\u2019t wait to get my hands on the RTX 3070 \u2013 and (fingers crossed) the RTX 3090 as well.\nOn the team red side of things AMD does not have anything that comes close to competing with the RTX 3080 \u2013 or at least not yet. We know that AMD is announcing new GPUs next month, and we\u2019ve seen some of the leaks. It could be turn into a very interesting autumn, but NVIDIA has set the bar very, very high.\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nReview Disclosures\n\n\n\n\nThis disclosure statement covers the way the product being reviewed was obtained and the relationship between the product's manufacturer and PC Perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Product Was Obtained\nThe GPU is on loan from NVIDIA for the purpose of this review.\n\n\nWhat Happens To Product After Review\nThe GPU remains the property of NVIDIA but will be on extended loan to PC Perspective for the purpose of future testing and product comparisons.\n\n\nCompany Involvement\nNVIDIA provided the product sample and technical brief to PC Perspective but had no control over the content of the review and was not consulted prior to publication.\n\n\nPC Perspective Compensation\nNeither PC Perspective nor any of its staff were paid or compensated in any way by NVIDIA for this review.\n\n\nAdvertising Disclosure\nNVIDIA has not purchased advertising at PC Perspective during the past twelve months.\n\n\nAffiliate Links\nThis article contains affiliate links to online retailers.

When enough int operations get put into the mix, it takes away from total fp32 perf and I am very certain this is a big reason why perf is not scaling out as what many hoped for.\ncombine that with Samsun 8nm node being not-so-great for perf/watt, then we get cards that not only don\u2019t perf as well as many hoped for, but also use more power than what many anticipated.\nNvidia really should have gone with TSMC 7nm.   I suspect the full fat chips will be on TSMC, the ones that are either going to be used in HPC or maybe even workstation cards.   Desktop gaming always gets the bottom of the barrel chips.\nReply  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\nDr. Vibrato \n\t\t\t\t\ton September 17, 2020 at 2:48 pm\t\t\t\t\n \n\n\nThere is the old wisdom about the performance difference between a GPU connected via 16 PCIe 3.0 lanes vs. only 8 lanes is negligible. And i expect going from PCI 3.0 x16 to PCI 4.0 x16 will result in negligible performance differences as well.\nBut, DirectStorage might show a meaningful benefit of PCI 4.0 over PCI 3.0. Looking forward to reviews/tests that pit PCI 3.0-based DirectStorage against PCI 4.0-based DirectStorage. But i guess we have to be patient until software/games with DirectStorage support is being released. \ud83d\ude41\nReply  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\nBigTed \n\t\t\t\t\ton September 17, 2020 at 8:30 pm\t\t\t\t\n \n\n\nMicrosoft are \u201ctargeting getting a development preview of DirectStorage into the hands of game developers next year\u201d\n so I reckon it will be quite some time before we see anything using the API to its full potential on PC.

It\u2019s easier to quantify with CPUs, but there are so many variables in the cards even from game to game it\u2019s impossible. \nThat 500$ card will be better than the 300$ card, but will it be $200 better? How much are you paying for the base operation and how much is performance?  Is the 400$ one better value than the 700$ or the other way around? How much more does it cost to develop for 5 more fps? Is a used card 100$ worse or just 100$ cheaper? Does that 20$ premium add 20$ worth of graphics to the CPU or is it a 20$ savings without it?

Jim Cramer, the founder of TheStreet, in an interview with CNBC, said that this deal will be a catalyst for the growth of the company's stock price.\n    \n\n\n\n\u201cIf Nvidia can close on Arm Holdings, the stock\u2019s gonna be unstoppable even after its magnificent multiyear run, I think [CEO] Jensen Huang can eventually make it happen, but what if I\u2019m wrong? Look, the stock was at $486 before the Arm news, and it\u2019s only at $494 now. I like that risk-reward.\u201d  Jim Cramer to CNBC  \n\n\n\n\n        In addition, the purchase of Arm will make Nvidia a leader in the semiconductor industry.\n    \n\n\n\n\u201cPut them both together, and you\u2019ve got the undisputed king of the semiconductor industry\u201d  Jim Cramer to CNBC  \n\n\n\n\n        This is due to the fact that technologies developed by Arm are used by almost all companies in the industry, including Apple, using them in the creation of iPhones.\n    \n\n\n\n        However, precisely because of such a monopoly position in the market, the deal could be at risk, as the regulatory authorities will not allow absolute control over a company as strategically important for the entire technology industry as Arm.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n#Nvidia\n#Stocks\n#Analysis\n#NVDA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Usman Salis\n            \nE-mail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoticias de Criptomonedas (ES)\n17 Mar 2025, 21:03 PM\n\nPancakeSwap (CAKE) sube un 45% mientras la red BNB recibe un gran impulso\nPancakeSwap (CAKE) sube un 45% impulsado por el crecimiento de la red BNB y un aumento en la actividad comercial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoticias del Oro XAU/USD (ES)\n17 Mar 2025, 21:03 PM\n\nEl oro devora las acciones y eclipsa a las criptomonedas con un 40% de ganancias. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9?\nEl oro brilla con un 40% de ganancias, superando a las acciones y criptomonedas.

Mentioned: Coles Group Ltd (COL), Greencape Broadcap (14654), Bennelong Australian Equities (16998), Hyperion Australian Growth Companies (3344), First Sentier Australian Share (3404), Ausbil Australian Active Equity (6117), Computershare Ltd (CPU), EML Payments Ltd (EML), IRESS Ltd (IRE), NVIDIA Corp (NVDA), Nextdc Ltd (NXT), PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL), Qantas Airways Ltd (QAN), QBE Insurance Group Ltd (QBE), Seek Ltd (SEK), Zip Co Ltd (ZIP)A Morningstar Gold-rated fund manager says Afterpay is too hot to hold because it lacks earnings sustainability and the barriers to entry in the sector are increasingly brittle.Greencape Capital's David Pace used last week's Fidante Partners Investment Forum to pan Afterpay (ASX: APT), saying that as competition heats up in the buy-now pay-later sector, he struggles to \"find value\" in the popular stock.Instead, Pace believes his decision not to invest in the company will deliver for investors if ETF providers are forced to pick up the stock.\"The inclusion or exclusion of any name into or out of an index has little bearing on what our portfolio looks like,\" he said, referring to APT's brief entry into the ASX largest 20 companies last month after it rallied over 850 per cent off March lows.\"That's what the passive money reacts to. We think fundamentally, and we think bottom-up. We can't find value in APT, and now that it holds a larger index position, we see that as an opportunity to earn alpha by not owning the stock over the medium to long term.\"Afterpay's surge to $95 last month brought its market capitalisation to $25 billion, making it more valuable than larger, more established players like Coles (ASX: COL), QBE Insurance (ASX: QBE) and Qantas (ASX: QAN). At the depths of the virus, the stock was trading below $9.Other asset managers share Pace\u2019s concerns. Eiger Capital's Stephen Wood, for instance, argues covid has accelerated BNPL the business plans forward to unsustainable levels.\"This sector relies heavily on retail to drive its business case forward,\" says Eiger, the senior portfolio manager of the Australian Small Companies fund.\"Retail has had a phenomenal stimulus hit from government plans and Australians\u2019 super draw down. It seems unlikely to us that some of the key retailers that BNPL helps are going to be able to cycle these numbers next year.\"Morningstar's Australian growth managers are almost equally divided about whether Afterpay should feature in their portfolios. Hyperion and Bennelong (which are Silver-rated) and CFS and Ausbil (which are Bronze-rated) all count Afterpay as a major holding in their portfolio declarations to Morningstar. In contrast, Greencape, Platypus and Yarra avoid the name.Morningstar medallist large-cap Australian equity growth funds with Afterpay in their top-10 published holdingsSource: Morningstar Direct, Stock IntersectionPace\u2019s concerns about Afterpay do not extend to other tech stocks, however. His colleague, Nikki Thomas of Alphinity Investment Management, also on the panel, was particularly bullish about the outlook for global technology stocks, saying firms were benefiting from an acceleration of trends as consumers turned to technology to get them through lockdowns. Historically low rates also play into the picture, she says.\"Low interest rates are here to stay for considerable time, and of course that means if you can find growing businesses that are delivering strong cash flows, you're relative attractiveness of those businesses is much higher than the world we were in just a couple of years ago,\" she says.\"Looking for those sorts of businesses\u2014they're often in that technology space because they have low reinvestment requirements, and they have fantastic growth opportunities because of secular tail winds.\"Within his own portfolio, Pace has exposure to several Australian tech names including digital gift card company EML Payments (ASX: EML), adviser software provider IRESS Ltd (ASX: IRE) and stock transfer company Computershare (ASX: CPU). The gold-rated Australian equities fund can also hold 10 per cent in offshore equities, allowing Pace to invest in US-based chipmaker NVIDIA (NAS: NVDA) and data centre operator\u00a0Nextdc Ltd (ASX: NXT). However, he says the numbers just don't stack up for Afterpay.BNPL services like Afterpay and Zip Pay have attracted more than 5 million customers between them.Pace argues that Afterpay is a bit too frothy, contrasting it with job classifieds website Seek (ASX: SEK).\"When we have an APT discussion, we're always comparing names,\" he says.\"A name like SEEK has an exceptional core business that throws off a lot of cash, has stable of what they refer to as early stage ventures. None of them are currently making money, but they're all very good businesses growing at a rate of knots.\"If I put those businesses on the same revenue multiples as APT is on, I could find you $6 or $7 value.\"It's always about benchmarking but from a bottom up perspective, we don't think the barriers are high enough for APT, and we don't think the earnings are sustainable enough.\"Competition heats upThere are already signs that BNPL's moment in the sun could be fading. The sector suffered major blows earlier this month, ushering in an abrupt end to its record stock-price run.First, US-payments giant PayPal (NAS: PYPL) announced its entrance into the BNPL market with its \u201cPay in 4\u201d interest-free product in time for Christmas. Then, two of Australia's big four banks\u2014NAB and CBA\u2014launched interest-free credit cards within days on each other in a brazen attempt win customers back from the thriving BNPL industry.The news of increased competition, compounded by Wall Street's volatile technology sell-off, saw prices tumble across the BNPL sector. Afterpay is down 14 per cent to $72.58 this month, Zip Co (ASX: Z1P) shares crashed 27 per cent to $5.84, and US-based Sezzle (ASX: SZL) came out worst, down 33 per cent to $5.83.Investment growth | ASX BNPL stocks, year to dateTime period: 01/01/2020 - 14/09/2020Source: Morningstar Direct\u201cThese new cards signal it\u2019s game on between the big banks and buy now, pay later,\" RateCity.com.au research director Sally Tindall says, noting that BNPL services like Afterpay and Zip Pay (ASX: Z1P) have attracted more than 5 million customers between them.\u201cHopefully this competition will bring more low-cost, consumer-focused credit options to the table.\"First-mover advantageAfterpay continues to garner backing from several growth managers, including Hyperion portfolio manager's Mark Arnold and Jason Orthman who sung the stock's praises ahead of reporting season. Hyperion added APT to the fund for the first time in June 2020, describing it has a \"innovative business serving the next generation\".\"For us it really comes back to that 10-year valuation. What's interesting for us is not what sales or earnings are going to be in August or 12 months' time,\"\u00a0Orthman told Morningstar in late July.Asked if he was worried about the low barriers to entry for BNPL firms, Orthman says he believes in Afterpay's long-term market-leadership. \"You need to be the number one or number two player, and that's absolutely what Afterpay is\".Pace's attention has turned to managing risk on the current environment.\"We're not in the business of flipping coins\u2014for us there are too many binomial events on the table today where we have very little clarity,\" he says.\"What does Australia look like post JobKeeper? How many businesses will go to the wall? Which way goes the US election go? All the trade tensions we're seeing with China.\"We're unashamedly not out on the curve right now.\u201dHow do the new cards compare to BNPL?Source: RateCityAFTERPAYAPTASXBNPLBUY NOW PAY LATERCREDITRALLYTECH STOCKSTECHNOLOGYTRENDSZIP PAYAUTHOREmma Rapaportwas formerly the editorial manager for Morningstar Australia.SHARE THIS ARTICLE Article Page URL has been copied to clipboard for sharing.

After months of Nvidia leaks, teasing, and anticipation, people have been patiently waiting to be able to make reasoned buying decisions with regard to this class-leading $699 GPU that we found capable of 4K60 gaming with RT/DLSS turned on. Unfortunately, Nvidia has let itself and consumers down by underestimating GeForce RTX 3080 demand, it admits in a recently published GeForce RTX 3080 Launch Q&A.\n\nNvidia isn't alone in the underestimation of demand for the RTX 3080. It says that its partners weren't ready either - so perhaps it wasn't pushed to supply more components than it offered AIBs. However, on launch day, Nvidia reports that its website received 4x the unique visitors compared to the previous gen launch, as well as \"10 times the peak web requests per second, and more than 15 times the out clicks to partner pages\". With this said, Nvidia doesn't shrink from directly apologising for not being prepared for consumer demand.\nNvidia partners and retailers experienced a similar swell of web traffic in the wake of the RTX 3080 launch. Many experienced \"record traffic to their sites, in many cases exceeding Black Friday,\" says Nvidia.\nProduction capacity and swatting bots\nTrying to reassure those unfulfilled consumers somewhat, Nvidia asserts that \"the GeForce RTX 3080 is in full production.\" It has been increasing GPU supply to partner's week on week, and partners are thus able to ramp up their production. As well as working on the supply side, Nvidia says both its own retail department and partners are looking at better bot/scalper protection when stock becomes available. Apparently, Nvidia has already \"cancelled hundreds of orders manually,\" after checking whether they were ordered by bots/scripts, making sure more products get directly into the hands of genuine customers.\n\nA section of eBay auctions for GeForce RTX 3080 cards\nI've noticed a similar story coming from EVGA in recent hours. On Twitter the firm said \"We are hand reviewing all EVGA GeForce RTX 3080 orders, any orders that are taken from 'bots' will be rejected.\" Jacob Freeman, Global Product Management Director at EVGA, added an apology of sorts, stating that \"Obviously the site did not run as smooth as we would like. There are some server updates and upgrades we will be making to further improve it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\nPayPal enables cryptocurrency trading for UK account holders\n\n                    Firm's first expansion of its 'Buy, Hold and Sell Crypto' facilities outside the US. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n17\nNvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti returning to plug GPU market gap\n\n                    Australian TechTuber says the initiative has been confirmed with multiple retailers. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n8\nAmazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos to step down in Q3\n\n                    Andy Jassy, AWS boss and employee of 23 years, will become CEO.

The growingly popular tech YouTuber introduced the new segment by saying he has tested numerous GeForce RTX 3080 and 3090 graphics cards already and never had any instability issues with out of the box clocks. However he noted that due to the nature of overclocking you will always hit a mark somewhere when an individual GPU will become unstable.\n\nIn his lab tests der8auer has found that that instability with these RTX 3000 GPUs has crept in between 1,960 and 2,080MHz - and the mix of 'MLCC vs POSCAP' isn't a definitive indicator of how high these cards can overclock. In previous years as an OC professional der8auer has often worked on capacitor mods, among other techniques, to push GPUs well beyond the clocks possible to the average enthusiast - swapping, or adding further banks of capacitors to keep GPUs stable under extreme stress.\n\nAbove you can see der8auer switch two of the Gigabyte card's stock 470u POSCAP capacitors with twenty 47u MLCC capacitors (unwavering soldering skills on display) before re-testing the GPU. The result of the modification is that he could manage to squeeze an extra 30MHz from the GPU before stability issues were evidenced...\nIn summary, der8auer reckons that the capacitor choice of certain AIBs isn't solely 'to blame' but it is a contributor to reported instability, hand-in-hand with the vBIOS enabled boost clocks. The whole drama could have been avoided if partners had had more time to test their wares and adjust vBIOS settings ahead of making them available to the public. Instead, nowadays \"every single vendor is testing on the consumer,\" asserts the OC expert, with early adopters feeling the sharp end of this issue.\nGigabyte and MSI statements\nGigabyte's statement asserts that the 'MLCC vs POSCAP' debate is of little value. It says that both types of capacitors have their characteristics and uses, as noted in our last article on this issue. Furthermore, Gigabyte says that it hasn't selected capacitor configurations based upon \"using cheap materials,\" but rather it selected them as the best choices for the application.\nGigabyte goes on to highlight its RTX 3080 Gaming OC & Eagle OC capacitor specs vs Nvidia reference, and mentions the latest Nvidia driver (version 456.55) delivering stability to the RTX 3000 series.\nMSI is equally bullish in backing its existing product designs. It used a \"mixed capacitor grouping in its designs to benefit from the strengths of both SP-Caps and MLCCs\". MSI says that all cards shipped have this mixed config and it stands behind this design. I think some early box art might have shown different capacitors beneath the GPU, which has caused some confusion. Again, MSI recommends the latest Nvidia GeForce driver version 456.55.\n\nNote that both Gigabyte and MSI refer to 'POSCAPs' as 'SP-CAPs' in their statements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nHEXUS Week In Review: Radeon RX 6600 and RTX 3070 Noctua Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 13 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

This week there are a couple of notable additions; firstly GeForce Now users will be able to dabble in the art of in-game photography using Nvidia Ansel, secondly Chromebook users are now able to sync their PC Steam library on their portables. Additionally, as usual, Nvidia has announced 10 new games that will become available for GeForce Now streaming gamers now or in the near future.\n\nIn case you don't know, Ansel is Nvidia's gaming screenshot composition software. The Alt-Z hotkey tool allows users to carefully compose screenshots, preview post-process filters, capture HDR imagery in high-fidelity formats, and share them in 360 degrees using your mobile phone, PC, or VR headset.\n\nMany but not all games support Ansel and it is supported by popular games engines such as Unreal Engine 4 and Unity 5. Moreover, some games/engines offer greater support for Ansel features than others, especially in the ability to position the camera in the scene and 360/VR screenshot support. Ansel was originally launched in May 2016 and was updated to be RTX On friendly (again depends on the game/engine) in August 2018.\nLast month Nvidia added Chromebooks to the GeForce Now ecosystem, brightening up these dull browser-based machines with a link to AAA gaming fun. All Chromebook users needed to do was head on over to play.geforcenow.com and log in with their GeForce Now account to get started.\nNvidia recently added Steam Sync support to GeForce Now\u2019s PC and macOS apps and it is said to have been a popular change. Today the same level of integration has arrived on Chromebooks. On Google's mobile computing platform all that needs to be done is for users to to Settings > Game Sync in GeForce Now, and the feature will identify games in their Steam library that are supported by GeForce Now and automatically add them to 'My Library' within the app. This is a one-time process as any games subsequently added to your Steam library will be detected and updated on the Chromebook side.\nIn the intro I mentioned 10 games additions.

The robot named Servi will act as a sort of waiter, using its layers of trays to carry food and drinks and its 3D cameras and Lidar sensors to navigate between kitchen and tables.  Servi will be launched in Japan in January and will cost 99,800 yen ($950) per month excluding tax on a three-year plan, SoftBank Group Corp said. The start up first showed a prototype to Softbank chief executive Masayoshi Son last year and SoftBank led a $32 million round of investment in the startup in January. The launch leverages SoftBank's long experience in bringing overseas technology to Japan but reflects the shift away from Son's earlier focus on humanoid robots. Servi has been tested by Japanese restaurant operators, including Seven & i Holdings at its Denny's chain, as the sector grapples with an aging workforce and deepening labour shortages. The launch comes as companies are scrambling to employ technology to offer contactless service and ensure social distancing. SoftBank's humanoid Pepper robot became the face of the company following its 2014 unveiling but failed to find a global customer base. The firm in 2018 announced cleaning robot Whiz, which employs technology from group portfolio company Brain Corp and has sold more than 10,000 units worldwide. SoftBank is touting the use of Whiz as a coronavirus countermeasure, and said on Monday that Pepper can be used in conjunction with thermal sensors to monitor customers. Son has shifted from operating businesses to making investments in recent years. This month, SoftBank announced the sale of cellphone distributor Brightstar as it cuts links to the telecoms industry. The group also owns Boston Dynamics, which developed the four-legged robot Spot. SoftBank has a history of troubled investments in the robotics sector.

Nvidia signed on the dotted line agreeing to pay US$40 billion in cash and shares to take Arm off SoftBank's hands. Coinciding with the news of the industry-quaking agreement, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, shared a visionary statement about how Nvidia will unite with Arm to \"advance computing from the cloud, smartphones, PCs, self-driving cars and robotics, to edge IoT, and expand AI computing to every corner of the globe\". However, some people weren't very happy about the deal.\n\nThere are a number of worries from various parties about the Nvidia takeover. Firstly we have the industry partners and rivals who are anxious about Arm licensing being in Nvidia's control. That is yet to be addressed, though Nvidia has made statements about continuing the \"global customer neutrality,\" policy at the centre of Arm's business model.\nProbably the greater worry here in the UK would be that, while Nvidia made pledges to expand Arm's R&D presence in Cambridge, UK, and build \"a new global centre of excellence in AI research at Arm's Cambridge campus,\" it could be just saying that to get the deal over the line without the UK government / regulators causing speed bumps. In other words people are worried that Nvidia would 'do a Kraft' (see: Kraft takeover of Cadbury).\nWhen SoftBank bought Arm in 2016 it gave legally binding assurances that the company HQ would stay in Cambridge and it would double the UK workforce over five years. This legal pledge expires in Sept 2021.\nJust ahead of the weekend the FT interviewed the Nvidia CEO and obviously had some questions about the SoftBank/Arm deal. Jensen Huang sought to alleviate the fears of those who don't want to see an Arm brain drain. \"We will of course enter legally binding documents with everybody,\" Huang told the FT. However, he didn't provide any details about the form or scope of such commitments.\n\nReading further, it is expected that the government will look to impose legally binding commitments to wave the deal on. It could enforce political-style commitments as it did with the Cobham-Advent deal from earlier this year, ring-fencing company location and R&D spending levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nTSMC announces N4P process as value N3 alternative for 2023\n\n                    Fifth process to be developed from original N5 promises 6 per cent perf uplift over N4. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n5\nAMD sales up 54 per cent, beats analyst expectations\n\n                    Server and semi-custom chips are selling particularly well.

Expected to retail from \u00a3469, the GeForce RTX 3070 might be the third most powerful of the Ampere-powered bunch so far, but it's still been claimed that it will be faster than the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti while still retaining half of its price tag.\u00a0It offers 8GB of GDDR6 (notably, no GDDR6X like its bigger siblings) with 5,888 CUDA cores, boost clock of 1.73GHz, and 256-bit memory bus width. Expect 20.4 shader teraflops, 40 ray tracing TFLOPS, and 163 tensor TFLOPS.\u00a0It might not compare to the RTX 3090 but at this price point, that shouldn't really matter. Nvidia has previously referred to it as the \"sweet spot\" when it comes to performance and value.\u00a0It's unknown just yet if superior performance to the RTX 2080 Ti relates to faster ray-tracing, DLSS-enhanced gaming or something else but the key thing we do know is that it's going to be a considerable upgrade for many, while remaining much cheaper than the RTX 2080 Ti. As always, Nvidia has a handy graph demonstrating the performance boosts although it's worth noting that it doesn't include the RTX 2080 Ti here.The GeForce RTX 3070 might be lacking the extra fast GDDR6X memory that we've seen on the RTX 3080 and 3090 but it should be more than plenty enough for those looking for a more modest upgrade than spending thousands on the RTX 3090.\u00a0There have already been rumours of stock shortages for the RTX 3080 so the RTX 3070 may be a good option for those with deeper pockets than us to tide them over. It'll be interesting to see if stock shortages also extend to the RTX 3070, especially as the price/performance ratio is sounding pretty good right now.Keep an eye out for its release this time next month. Oh, and expect a free copy of Watch Dogs: Legion and a GeForce Now membership thrown into the deal.\n\n\n\nWant to comment?

All we had was a generic photo of the EVGA Kingpin AiO shroud from EVGA's Jacob Freeman.\n\nYesterday afternoon, Vince 'Kingpin' Lucido shared an image of what looks like the consumer-ready EVGA GeForce RTX 3090 Kingpin hybrid graphics card, a post which was subsequently echoed by Jacob Freeman. Both social media sources confirmed two things; that the EVGA GeForce RTX 3090 Kingpin Hybrid design would feature a triple fan radiator, and that it features a flip up monitor screen.\nThe previous generation Kingpin Hybrid card had an attached 240mm radiator as part of the AiO offering. In some later replies to his photo Tweet, Freeman confirmed that there would be a \"Standard Hybrid\" cooled EVGA GeForce RTX 3090 which features a 240mm radiator.\nThe Kingpin GPU monitor screen looks quite small and it isn't described by either source, so at the time of writing we don't know how much data will fit on it, or what particular data will be able to be monitored via this screen (voltages, temps etc).\n\nAs well as the robust cooler, other features we expect to see on this or any future Kingpin graphics card include; superior power phase design, more durable components - to achieve higher clock speeds than other cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 10 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI), the manufacturer of extended-range hybrid vehicles, has jumped into the autonomous driving arena with a bang following a three-way partnership agreement with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Huizhou Desay SV Automotive \u2013 NVIDIA\u2019s Chinese partner.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Li Auto will become the first OEM to equip its upcoming smart SUV, expected to launch in 2022, with NVIDIA\u2019s Orin SoC chipset. Explaining the rationale behind this move, Li Auto\u2019s press release notes:\nRelated Story NIO, XPeng, and Li Auto Stand to Benefit as China Warns of a Harsh Crackdown Against Price Gouging of Automobile Chips\u201cOrin uses a 7-nanometer production process to achieve a computing power of 200 TOPS, 7 times that of the previous generation, the Xavier SoC. Even with the significant improvement in computing performance, Orin's baseline power consumption is just 45 watts, relatively equivalent to the low power consumption of the previous generation SoC. In addition, Li Auto will provide end-users with upgradeable solutions, ranging from L2+ autonomous driving with a single Orin chip and 200 TOPS in computing power, to L4 with dual Orin chips and 400 TOPS in computing power. In the future, the use of discrete GPU can further increase the computing power up to 2000 TOPS theoretically, which provides sufficient hardware capabilities for L5 autonomous driving.\u201d\nFor its part, Huizhou Desay SV Automotive will furnish Li Auto with an autonomous driving domain controller built on the Orin chipset. By combining these essential components from its partners, \u201cLi Auto will develop [an] all autonomous driving program design and algorithms, aiming to become the first new energy vehicle company to independently develop L4 autonomous driving systems in China\u201d.\nAs a refresher, Li Auto manufactures Extended-Range Electric Vehicles (EREVs). These are essentially hybrid vehicles that utilize gasoline to extend the range of the car, thereby, proving to be an effective solution for China\u2019s growing, yet still relatively limited, EV charging infrastructure.\nLi Auto is quickly growing its footprint across China. As an illustration, the company reported on the 2nd of September that it delivered 2,711 Li ONE units in the month of August. Year to date, the company has delivered 14,656 Li ONE units to its customers in China. As far as Li Auto\u2019s geographical coverage is concerned, the company maintains 31 retails stores spanning across 26 Chinese cities.\nHighlighting the importance of EREVs in the current paradigm and, by extension, the smart strategy of Li Auto, UBS had stated in its recent investment note:\n\"We view EREV as a pragmatic solution to address customers\u2019 need for a suitable driving range and charging alternatives. We expect it to co-exist with battery electric vehicles and internal combustion engine cars, and think it is particularly well-suited for large vehicles due to the savings in the large battery compared with BEV.\"\n\nSource\nLi Auto shares are currently up around 3 percent in the pre-market trading session. However, since its debut on the NASDAQ index back in July, the stock is up a modest 2.67 percent, based on the current pre-market price level.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ: LI) Shares Rocket Higher on Strong Li ONE August Delivery Numbers\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ: LI) \u2013 the Latest Chinese EV Maker to List in the U.S. \u2013 Is up Over 46 Percent in Its Maiden Week\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Reportedly Compared to Elden Ring for Its Player Freedom\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCS: Legacy, a Fan-Made Standalone Remake of Counter-Strike, Is in the Works\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n142\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n102\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n39\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n37\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1480\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1157\nComments\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n1035\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The culmination of the #UltimateCountdown is going to be an Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 unveiling event hosted by Jensen Huang, and at last we will find out lots of official juicy details about consumer Ampere GPUs and some/all of the following; specs, the range being made available, performance, availability, and pricing.\nAhead of any such event there are inevitable leaks and this time around is no exception. Last week we saw pictures of a purported triple slot 310mm long reference RTX 3090 design, which will probably be dubbed a 'Founders Edition' as has recently been Nvidia's practice. Later in the week Nvidia did a bit of teasing of its own with a video about its GPU cooler designs over recent years. In that video was an official glimpse of the new 12-pin power connector that will be rolled out, and a view of the pennant shaped PCB.\n\nOver the long weekend there have been at least three major leaks involving Nvidia partner graphics card makers and their wares. New Inno3D, Gainward and Zotac GeForce graphics cards have been spilled on the web to varying degrees but probably the most massive slippage was by Gainward which published product pages for its RTX 3090 and RTX 3080 models. Gainward took down the offending pages an hour or two after they were spotted but not before the likes of VideoCardz captured them for posterity.\n\nclick to zoom\nIn all Gainward exposed four of its upcoming Ampere graphics cards; the GeForce RTX 3090 and 3080 Phoenix, and the other two were 'Golden Sample' versions of these cards with hand-picked GPUs. I've reproduced the screengrabs of a couple of the pages above. But from the various leaks it has been possible to put together a quick reference table to make spec perusal and comparison nice and easy. The data below was compiled by VideoCardz this weekend.\n\nThe Gainward leak doesn't contain any RTX 3070 cards but they seem to form part of the initial launch lineup from Zotac, which has at least three RTX 3090 cards, three RTX 3080 cards and two RTX 3070 cards waiting for the starting pistol. VideoCardz has some exclusive images of upcoming Inno3D cards based upon the RTX 3090 and RTX 3080 designs. These come with iChill x4 and x3 coolers or the cheaper Gaming x3 and Twin x2 OC shroud options.\n\nRounding off this bucket full of leaks, technically minded folk might appreciate the bare PCB photos of the RTX 3090, as shared by a ChipHell forum user. On the PCB you can see traces for a 20-phase VRM section, twelve memory pads for the 384-bit memory attached GDDR6X, four display output pads, and more.\n\nclick to zoom\nLastly, there are some purported Nvidia RTX 30 series performance slides circulating - but there is widespread doubt about their authenticity. It is worth ignoring those for now, especially as it is only a few hours until authentic slides will be shared by Nvidia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 22 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

The new system, scheduled to become operational in March, will be based around SX-Aurora TSUBASA vector processors from NEC and NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, all connected with NVIDIA Mellanox HDR 200Gb/s InfiniBand networking.\nThis will give it a maximum theoretical performance of 19.5 petaflops, putting it in the highest echelons of the TOP500 supercomputer ratings.\nThe new system will benefit from a multi-architecture design, making it suited to various research and development projects in the earth sciences field. In particular, it will act as an execution platform for efficient numerical analysis and information creation, coordinating data relating to the global environment.\nIts work will span marine resources, earthquakes and volcanic activity. Scientists will gain deeper insights into cause-and-effect relationships in areas such as crustal movement and earthquakes.\nThe Earth Simulator will be deployed to predict and mitigate natural disasters, potentially minimizing loss of life and damage in the event of another natural disaster like the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in 2011.\nEarth Simulator will achieve this by running large-scale simulations at high speed in ways previous generations of Earth Simulator couldn\u2019t. The intent is also to have the system play a role in helping governments develop a sustainable socio-economic system.\nThe new Earth Simulator promises to deliver a multitude of vital environmental information. It also represents a quantum leap in terms of its own environmental footprint.\nEarth Simulator 3, launched in 2015, offered a performance of 1.3 petaflops. It was a world beater at the time, outstripping Earth Simulators 1 and 2, launched in 2002 and 2009, respectively.\nThe fourth-generation model will deliver more than 15x the performance of its predecessor, while keeping the same level of power consumption and requiring around half the footprint. It\u2019s able to achieve these feats thanks to major research and development efforts from NVIDIA and NEC.\nThe latest processing developments are also integral to the Earth Simulator\u2019s ability to keep up with rising data levels.\nScientific applications used for earth and climate modelling are generating increasing amounts of data that require the most advanced computing and network acceleration to give researchers the power they need to simulate and predict our world.\nNVIDIA Mellanox HDR 200Gb/s InfiniBand networking with in-network compute acceleration engines combined with NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs and NEC SX-Aurora TSUBASA provides JAMSTEC a world-leading marine research platform critical for expanding earth and climate science and accelerating discoveries.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Networking | SupercomputingTags: High-Performance Computing | Science \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

As the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is going to be the first of the RTX 30 series to become available (Thurs, 17th Sept), it makes sense that benchmark scores are starting to leak for this upcoming flagship.\nTwitter PC hardware leakster RoGame has been particularly productive on the RTX 3080 benchmarks front. He has shared a number of benchmark results in recent days / hours with some useful comparisons against the likes of the RTX 2080 Ti, and the AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT.\nGeekbench 4 OpenCL\nMost recently, RoGame has shared Geekbench 4 OpenCL scores for the RTX 3080. He linked to three results that are viewable in the Geekbench browser, with OpenCL scores of between 464k and 470k. Giving some perspective to these scores, the Turing GPU based RTX 2080 Ti Geekbench OpenCL performance bracket is from 340k to 370k. At the other end of the comparisons, the RTX 2070 could only muster a range of 250k to 260k in this test.\n\nAshes of the Singularity\nSimilarly RoGame unearthed RTX 3080 AoTS scores in the game's online benchmark result database. AoTS is a DirectX 12 benchmark that has fallen out of favour with users and reviewers but RoGame has gathered some comparisons from colleagues.\nIn the 'Crazy' 4K quality preset the RTX 3080 managed 88.3fps in AoTS. This compares against an overclocked MSI Gaming X Trio RTX 2080 Ti at 80.29fps, an Asus Dual 2080 Ti with water cooler at 81.55fps, and a 'stock' RTX 2080 Ti which achieved 69.99fps. Meanwhile the Amd Radeon RX 5700 Xt scored 45.5fps in the same 'Crazy' 4K tests.\n\nTum Apisak also had some RTX 3080 AoTS scores to share, and I have embedded his comparison table above.\nRTX 30 family photo\nA photo showing the GeForce RTX 3080, 3080, and 3070 side by side has emerged on social media. We have seen these products separately but it is good to see them all together like this to get an impression of how sizable the RTX 3090 is, for example. VideoCardz put together a trio of simple size-based bullet points, as follows:\n\nRTX 3090: 13.8 cm (W) x 31.3 cm (L), 3-slot\nRTX 3080; 11.cm (W) x 28.5 cm (L), 2-slot\nRTX 3070: 11.2 cm (W) x 24.2 cm (L), 2-slot\n\n\nAll the Nvidia FE cards feature the new 12-pin connector. It will be interesting to see of the GeForce RTX 3060 can continue the downsizing trend - will there be compact single-fan models? I haven't seen any reliable looking leaks of RTX 3060 details as yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 14 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

New gaming cards and game consoles will launch this holiday powered by custom processors from rival Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0(AMD -0.65%).\u00a0Yet NVIDIA may have the answer in the new Ampere RTX 30 gaming cards announced on Sept. 1.\nWhat's under the hood of Ampere RTX\nNVIDIA says the RTX 30 series delivers up to two times the performance over the previous Turing generation when used for ray tracing.\u00a0NVIDIA originally introduced ray tracing with its Turing RTX cards in 2018, which rendered more accurate lighting and shadow effects in-game.\nOverall, the new Ampere gaming chips pack an impressive 28 billion transistors,\u00a0which is significantly higher than the 15.4 billion under the hood of Microsoft's (MSFT -1.49%) upcoming Xbox Series X.\n\nThe Ampere RTX 3080 GPU. Image source: NVIDIA.\n\nNVIDIA is delivering a much bigger leap in performance than it did with Turing over Pascal in 2018. In a press release, NVIDIA called these GPUs \"the greatest-ever generational leap in GeForce history.\"\u00a0The specs and prices of these new cards are clearly intended to put a competitive product out ahead of a busy holiday season when the new consoles launch.\nAt the top is the RTX 3090. It's powerful enough to run games at 60 frames per second at 8K resolution.\u00a0As CEO Jensen Huang said, \"This is insane.\" It's so fast that most gamers won't need that much graphics power, especially at the hefty price tag of $1,499.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the 3090 meeting the highest of performance needs, that leaves plenty of room for NVIDIA to offer superior gaming performance at prices that will compete with Sony's (SONY 0.31%) PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's\u00a0Xbox Series X this holiday.\nThe RTX 3080 comes at a price tag of $699 and is twice as fast as the RTX 2080.\u00a0It can run games at 60 frames per second at 4K resolution. While the PlayStation 5 will run on 16GB of GDDR6 memory with memory bandwidth of 448 GB per second,\u00a0the 3080 runs on 10GB of the faster GDDR6X kind of memory with a memory bandwidth up to 760 GB per second, based on the specs from the AORUS Xtreme model from Gigabyte.\u00a0\nThe best part is that the 3080 delivers more speed but at a cheaper price point than the RTX 2080 Super, which retails for $729.\u00a0\nHowever, NVIDIA may have hit the sweet spot with the RTX 3070. It is less than half the price of NVIDIA's most powerful RTX card -- the 2080 Ti\u00a0-- but NVIDIA says it is faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: NVIDIA.\n\nThe 3070 will retail at a competitive price of $499 -- the same price that was just revealed for the Xbox Series X.\nThe new Ampere RTX 30 GPUs offer a genuine performance upgrade over Turing RTX and are exactly what NVIDIA needed to offer to maintain its lead in the discrete GPU market.\u00a0\nIn the second quarter, NVIDIA expanded its lead over AMD in the add-in board market, reaching a market share of 78%, according to Jon Peddie Research. That is up from 69% in the first quarter and 68% in the year-ago quarter.\nNVIDIA goes beyond graphics to appeal to gamers\nNVIDIA not only packed a punch with the Ampere cards, it's going over the top to cater to those who like to play esports titles and stream their gameplay, with new software tools like NVIDIA Reflex and NVIDIA Broadcast.\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex will help esports enthusiasts be a little faster on the trigger in competitive shooters like Valorant.\u00a0Reflex helps reduce latency, or the speed it takes for a mouse click to register on the screen during gameplay. Most NVIDIA users play esports games, so this will be right up their alley.\u00a0\nNVIDIA Broadcast uses artificial intelligence to paint a virtual background behind the streamer without the use of a physical green screen.\u00a0Streaming continues to grow with millions trying it out every year,\u00a0and this new feature will make it even easier for new streamers to get started.\u00a0\nNVIDIA delivers a pre-emptive strike at AMD\nThrough the last quarter, less than a third of the total installed base of NVIDIA GeForce users had upgraded to an RTX GPU.\u00a0The new Ampere GPUs may accelerate the upgrade cycle over the next year, especially with more games starting to come out taking advantage of ray-tracing technology.\nAMD is expected to announce a new round of graphics processors for gaming later this year with the RDNA 2 GPUs. These cards will likely offer similar performance to what NVIDIA has with Ampere,\u00a0but NVIDIA did what it needed to do with this release, which was to give PC gamers a compelling alternative to stick with their PC, as opposed to dropping $500 on a new console.\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA is doing more here than just offer upgraded graphics performance. With the new creative tools like Reflex and Broadcast, NVIDIA is trying to corner the market on PC gaming by offering all the tools needed, across hardware and software tools, to handle anything a gamer throws at their machine.\nInvestors gave NVIDIA a big thumbs up immediately following the announcement by sending the share price up 7%.\n\n\n\nTeresa Kersten, an employee of LinkedIn, a Microsoft subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The models include cards from ASUS and EVGA and it looks like users looking for the best cards should also expect paying a massive premium for them as suggested by the leaked prices.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Custom Model Prices Leaked Out By US-Based Retailers, Up To $1799 US For Premium Models\nSpotted by Redditor MRizkBV (via Tomshardware), several custom models for the soon to launch GeForce RTX 3090 graphics card were listed by Newegg US. Standard and even Top variants such as the ASUS ROG STRIX and EVGA FTW3 were listed along with their prices. The prices are listed below:\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\n\nAsus ROG Strix OC Edition\nROG-STRIX-RTX3090-O24G-GAMING\n$1,799.99\nBestBuy\n\n\nEVGA FTW3 Ultra Gaming\n24G-P5-3987-KR\n$1,799.99\nNewegg\n\n\nEVGA FTW3 Gaming\n24G-P5-3985-KR\n$1,729.99\nNewegg\n\n\nEVGA XC3 Ultra Gaming\n24G-P5-3975-KR\n$1,619.99\nNewegg\n\n\nAsus TUF Gaming OC Edition\nTUF-RTX3090-O24G-GAMING\n$1,599.99\nNewegg /BestBuy\n\n\nGigabyte GAMING OC\nGV-N3090GAMING OC-24GD\n$1,579.99\nBestBuy\n\n\nMSI Ventus 3X OC\n\u2013\n$1,569.99\nBestBuy\n\n\nGigabyte EAGLE OC\nGV-N3090EAGLE OC-24GD\n$1,549.99\nBestBuy\n\n\nEVGA XC3 Gaming\n24G-P5-3973-KR\n$1,549.99\nNewegg\n\n\nEVGA XC3 Black Gaming\n24G-P5-3971-KR\n$1,529.99\nNewegg\n\n\nAsus TUF Gaming\nTUF-RTX3090-24G-GAMING\n$1,499.99\nNewegg\n\n\n\nAs per the leaked price lists, AIBs would be charging a hefty premium as much as $300 US for the fastest variants they have to offer. Starting with ASUS models, Best Buy has the models listed for $1799.99 US for the ROG STRIX OC variant while the EVGA FTW3 Ultra Gaming costs the same. For those who are looking for something closer to the MSRP of $1499 US, the ASUS TUF Gaming and EVGA XC3 series does exist but those may not offer the same cooling performance of factory OC which the top variants have to offer.\nASUS GeForce RTX 3090 ROG STRIX OC has been listed at Best Buy for $1799.99 US (Image Credits: Videocardz)\nThe TUF Gaming OC model has a price premium of $100 US over the non-OC model which is also quite significant. One can only imagine the prices for even higher-end variants such as the ASUS ROG Poseidon, MSI Lightning, EVGA Kingpin / Hydro & AORUS's Xtreme, just to name a few. Many AIBs have also yet to unveil the final clock speeds of their models.\nASUS just recently listed the final clocks for its ROG STRIX RTX 3080 OC graphics cards which would offer boost clocks of up to 1935 MHz, making it the fastest RTX 3080 but we don't know when the card hits the retail segment. The same can be said for the ROG STRIX RTX 3090 graphics card since we don't have confirmation if they will be available at launch or ship later.\n\nEVGA's FTW3 model features a boost clock of 1800 MHz which is a 6.2% boost over the Founders Edition clock speeds. You'll be paying a $300 US premium not only for the higher factory overclock but also for the custom and triple-fan cooling solution that is featured over the card.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Graphics Card Specifications\nThe RTX 3090 features some insane specifications such as 82 SM units which results in a total of 10496 CUDA cores. In addition to the CUDA cores, the card also comes packed with next-gen RT (Ray-Tracing) cores, Tensor cores, and brand new SM or streaming multi-processor units. The card has a base clock of 1400 MHz and a boost clock of 1700 MHz with a TDP of 350W.\n\nIn terms of memory, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 comes packed with 24 GB of memory and that too the next-generation GDDR6X design. With Micron's latest and greatest graphics memory dies, the RTX 3090 can deliver GDDR6X memory speeds of 19.5 Gbps. That along with a bus interface of 384-bit will deliver a cumulative bandwidth of 936 Gbps.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere' Graphics Card Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA106-300Ampere GA104-200Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie SizeTBC395.2mm2395.2mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBC17.4 Billion17.4 Billion28 Billion28 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores358448645888870410496\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs112 / 64152 / 80184 / 96272 / 96328 / 112\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores112 / 28152 / 38184 / 46272 / 68328 / 82\n\n\nBase Clock1320 MHz1410 MHz1500 MHz1440 MHz1400 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock1780 MHz1665 MHz1730 MHz1710 MHz1700 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute13 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs30 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPs25 TFLOPs32 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs58 TFLOPs69 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPs101 TOPs192 TOPs163 TOPs238 TOPs285 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity12 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR610 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus192-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed16 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth384 Gbps448 Gbps448 Gbps760 Gbps936 Gbps\n\n\nTGP170W175W220W320W350W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$329 US$399 US$499 US$699 US$1499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)25th February 20212nd December 202029th October 202017th September 202024th September 2020\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series Graphics Cards Price & Availability\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 will be launching to consumers on the 24th of September, 2020. The reference Founders Edition variant will cost $1499 US. The NVIDIA RTX 3090 will feature a price of $1499 (MSRP) however custom models will vary depending on their design and the extra horse-power that they have to offer.\n\nThere aren't any detailed performance numbers that NVIDIA is sharing right now but from what has been showcased, the RTX 3090 is about as much as 50% faster than the RTX 2080 Ti which is very impressive for the full lineup stack. The GeForce RTX 3090 being the flagship is up to 50% faster than the NVIDIA Titan RTX which is just insane amounts of performance for this flagship BFGPU & is made for up to 8K resolution gaming.\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA GeForce 'Ampere' GPU are you waiting for the most?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n186\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n67\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n51\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nResident Evil 9 Is Taking so Long to Release Because It Is a Reinvention of the Series \u2013 Rumor\n\n\n\n46\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1463\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Of course the size and mass of the cooling shrouds are for a very practical reason - with cards sucking over 300W and needing to keep cool under duress.\nA growingly popular alternative cooling method is to remove the bulky air cooler shroud and bolt on a water block, adding it to a PC liquid cooling loop. Such a change will slim down the physical presence of the GPU in your PC yet can deliver cooling and overclocking benefits. With this in mind Corsair and EKWB have both launched new water blocks for taming your new GeForce RTX 30 graphics card.\nCorsair\nCorsair has announced its new Hydro X Series XG7 RGB 30 Series GPU Water Blocks. The range will cover a wide variety of high-end RTX 30 products; the Founders Edition Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 and 3080, as well as reference designs from Asus Strix, MSI Ventus, and other select AIB partner cards.\n\nThe new XG7 RGB water block is made from precision milled nickel-plated copper and finished in stylish black aluminum. Corsair says the cooling block features more than 50 high-density micro-skived cooling fins atop the GPU core, fed by a high-flow coolant channel. The design covers the GPU, VRM, and memory chips and includes pre-applied thermal material and thermal pads for your convenience.\nFor lighting, Corsair has installed 16 individually addressable RGB LEDs into the XG7 RGB, customized via iCUE, as you would expect.\nWe don't have pricing and availability details from Corsair as yet. If you are very interested you can sign up to be notified of availability on the Corsair web store.\nEKWB\nEK has announced its new EK-Quantum Vector RTX 3080/3090 D-RGB. This water block supports reference PCB layout Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards. The firm lists currently available RTX 30 model compatibility in its news blog post, spanning multiple SKUs from the likes of Gainward, Galax, Palit and PNY.\nThe new EK-Quantum Vector is a second gen design featuring a thick 11.2mm copper base which directly cools the GPU, VRAM, and the VRM. EK asserts that as its block is in direct contact with MOSFETs and chokes it will also have the effect of minimizing the chances of coil whine.\n\nInside the water block EK has worked to optimize liquid flow, minimizing flow instabilities and vortexing. The fin array consists of 27 microfins with 0.5 mm wide microchannels that provide optimal cooling performance, according to the company. Meanwhile, atop of the block is your choice of glass-like cast Acrylic or durable black POM acetal.\nLighting is catered for by 12 individually addressable RGB LEDs, which are supported by popular RGB sync technologies from all major motherboard manufacturers (Asus, ASRock, Gigabyte and MSI).\nEKWB has its model choice and pricing details ready. It says that these water blocks will be ready to ship in early October.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorSep 16, 2020, 09:00am EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.Nvidia (NVDA) has finally allowed reviewers to lift the lid on the performance of the GeForce RTX 3080 and publish reviews and today I\u2019ll be revealing just how fast it is in games such as Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020), Borderlands 3 and Wolfenstain: Youngblood.\nNvidia's RTX 3080Antony Leather\n\nYou can see my Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 reveal for more information on the new Ampere architecture and cooler design, but in short, Nvidia is promising that the RTX 3080 is up to twice as fast as the RTX 2080, significantly quicker than the RTX 2080 Ti, especially where ray tracing is concerned plus cooler and quieter too. The latter are thanks to a unique cooler design with a flow-through design at one end that sees air pass right through the graphics card. This is possible due to a shortened V-shape PCB.\n\n\n\nForbesNvidia Confirms RTX 3090, RTX 3080 At $699, RTX 3070 At $499By Antony Leather\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nTest system\n\nMy test system includes an Intel Core i9-10900K overclocked to 5GHz, 16GB of 3466MHz Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro memory, an MSI MEG Z490 Ace motherboard, Corsair HydroX water-cooling components, a Barrow Rhopilema test bench, and Corsair RM850i power supply.\nNvidia RTX 3080 Test SystemAntony Leather\n\n\nI should add that this Intel hardware is limited to PCIe 3.0 and the RTX 3080 is capable of PCIe 4.0. I took the decision to test mainly with PCIe 3.0 as that is currently what the vast majority of PC enthusiasts use. Only AMD B550 and X570 chipset motherboards support PCIe 4.0 and users of those are in a minority. In addition, I found that I got higher performance in games with the Intel system anyway and as you can see in the additional PCIe 4.0 vs 3.0 testing below, there was actually very little difference.\nFor the PCIe testing I used the same memory, PSU and cooling hardware, but used an AMD Ryzen 9 3950X and MSI MEG X570 Unify motherboard, switching between PCIe 3.0 and 4.0 in the BIOS for the testing.\nI should also add that I did not use the riser cable shown in the test system above for testing. This was removed and the cards sat normally in the motherboard.\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator\nAfter an absence of more than a decade, Microsoft Flight Simulator returned to our screens recently and with some very positive reviews. The graphics are incredible, but the down side is that this is a hideously difficult game to run well. I set the detail to high, volumetric clouds to medium and disabled all live data feeds to get consistent results. I also ran the benchmarks at the same time and with the same weather settings.\nThe benchmark consisted of creating a flight plan taking off and landing at London Luton airport - a relatively dense area, and using Nvidia FrameView to record frame times during takeoff and a portion of a the flight. The results below are the recorded 99th percentile frame times converted to frames per second. As you might expect, the 95th percentile results were noticeably higher and this seemed to coincide with flying at higher altitudes, while takeoff was often choppy. We'll spend most of our time in the air of course, but the most dangerous parts of any flight are takeoff and landing so having choppy frame rates here isn't ideal.\nThe RTX 3080 was the only card to provide smooth frame rates throughout the benchmark, with the minimum 99th percentile being 26 and the 95th percentile pushing way over 30fps, with an average of 50fps. The RTX 2080 Ti was well below and quite choppy at takeoff, but once in the air the average frame rate of 40fps was adequate for smooth viewing, but less so on the RTX 2080 Super and 2080.\nSwitching to 4K and the game is an absolute monster. Takeoff was choppy with the RTX 3080, managing a 99th percentile of just 13fps, but once airborne the average frame rate hovered around 30fps. You'\u2019ll likely need to dial back the settings, or of course, wait for Nvidia's RTX 3090. Interestingly, the RTX 2080 Ti still performed similarly here, which goes to show that it remains a potent graphics card. In short, even the RTX 3080 is only just able to offer playable frame rates in this game and even then you'll need to dial back some settings if you're flying in detailed areas.\nFar Cry New Dawn\nNew Dawn is a much easier game to run and is also devoid of RTX-enabled features. However, the RTX 3080 was 30 percent faster on the average 99th percentile frame rate at 1440p than the RTX 2080 but didn't offer much more over the RTX 2080 Ti, but was still noticeably quicker. At 4K it was nearly 50 percent quicker than the RTX 2080 at 20 percent faster than the RTX 2080 Ti.\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\nAnother relatively easy game to run, Shadow of the Tomb Raider offers both DLSS and ray tracing support so I carried out tests with these enabled and disabled. at 1440p, the RTX 3080 was significantly quicker than the RTX 2080 Ti and a massive 58 percent faster than the RTX 2080. Switching to 4K saw its lead extended with a 37 percent advantage over the RTX 2080 Ti and a huge 79 percent boost over the RTX 2080's results. Enabling DLSS and ray tracing, the results were just as impressive with another 79 percent lead over the RTX 2080.\nMetro Exodus\nAnother game with both DLSS and ray tracing support, Metro Exodus is also quite tough to run fast. However, the RTX 3080 was 26 percent quicker than the RTX 2080 Ti and over 50 percent quicker than the RTX 2080 at 2560 x 1440. it was a similar result with DLSS and ray tracing enabled, where the RTX 2080 Super and RTX 2080 both took a hit in frame rates. At 4K the RTX 3080 was 29 percent faster than the RTX 2080 Ti and 65 percent faster than the RTX 2080, with similar results once ray tracing and DLSS were enabled.\n\nAnother relatively easy to run game, Borderlands 3 again showed that the RTX 3080 is much quicker than the RTX 2080 Ti even when RTX features are not enabled with a 27 percent lead at 1440p and at 4K it was 59 percent faster than the RTX 2080.\nWolfenstein: Youngblood\nAt 1440p, the game was a piece of cake for the RTX 3080, which offered a 24 percent boost over the RTX 2080 Ti and massive 72 percent advantage over the RTX 2080. Switching up to 4K saw that lead eroded a little but it was still 62 percent faster than the RTX 2080.\n\nPower consumption\nThe system as a whole drew 481W from the wall in Metro Exodus at 4K with ray tracing and DLSS enabled, which means that ideally you'll need at least a 750W PSU for gaming with the RTX 3080. Admittedly, this was with a Core i9-10900K, but even so, the RTX 3080 does draw noticeably more power than its predecessors. However, the extra performance is far in excess of this, with the card approaching twice the performance of the RTX 2080 in some games, while barely drawing more than 100W more.\n\nTemperatures\nThe RTX 3080's heatsink definitely got very warm in testing - a good sign it's working, and the flow-through fan also dished out a lot of heat. The RTX 3080 remained quiet throughout testing, though, reaching a peak core temperature of 76\u00b0C, while the RTX 2080 Ti sat at 79\u00b0C. I also carried out my own testing in a small mini-ITX case to see what impact that flow-through fan has on cooling in these small cases, and you can see the result below.\nUnfortunately, you do need to ensure you have adequate airflow and also that you're not hampering airflow coming out the top side of the card through that top fan. That's what happened in the NZXT H1 case I used here and the result was pretty shocking.Nvidia's RTX 3080Antony Leather\nPCIe 3.0 versus PCIe 4.0\nAs I mentioned above, I chose to use an Intel system to provide as small a CPU bottleneck across my benchmarks as possible. This did mean using a PCIe 3.0 rather than PCIe 4.0 interface, but Nvidia itself told me that it has found Intel CPUs to provide better performance overall despite the older interface. It will come into its own once RTX IO comes into mainstream support, but for now, I really wouldn't worry about getting a PCIe 4.0 motherboard.\nConclusions\nThe RTX series didn't have the best of launches with few RTX-enabled games and much higher prices for its GPUs than the previous generation. However, even the RTX 2080 Ti has proven to be a solid investment if you bought one back then, remaining the most powerful mainstream card available and still packing a punch more than two years later in the benchmarks here today.\nHowever, the RTX 3080 and Ampere architecture are a massive improvement across the board. Whether RTX features are enabled or not, it's consistently much faster than the more expensive RTX 2080 Ti and gets on for nearly twice as fast as the RTX 2080 in some games too. Considering it's slated to retail for $699, this means that this awesome performance is available for the same price as the GTX 1080 Ti back in 2017 and is a monstrous graphics card for ultrawide and 4K gaming. Ultimately, the RTX 2080, 2080 Super and 2080 Ti have been made quite redundant at their current prices.Nvidia's RTX 3080Emma Griffiths\nThat said, we do, of course, need to see the RTX 3080 actually retailing for $699 or thereabouts and it will be worth keeping an eye on partner cards too, which can be a little cheaper than the Founders Edition card I've reviewed here. Ultimately, though, Nvidia has laid down the gauntlet to AMD with its 'Big Navi' and we're still to see the RTX 3090. given Nvidia\u2019s claims about the RTX 3080 are mostly on par with actual performance, that looks set to be one heck of a graphic card. If you have around $700 to spend on a new graphics card, though, the RTX 3080 is absolutely brilliant.\nI'd like to thank Nvidia for providing me with a sample of the RTX 3080 for this review.\nI'll be back with more information and reviews of Nvidia's new RTX 3000 series as well as news and rumors surrounding next-gen CPUs and other graphics cards so follow me here on Forbes,\u00a0YouTube,\u00a0Twitter,\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0Instagram\u00a0\u00a0or\u00a0Reddit\u00a0for more PC hardware news and reviews.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

We're so used to that GeForce logo screaming green, but the new Nvidia Ampere reference design has gone for a far more neutral white look.I'm not allowed to talk about performance yet, so can't really say whether the new Ampere card's actual pixel-pushing prowess is also something that stands out from my time testing the RTX 3080. And I'm not allowed to show pictures of my card powered on, just in case that blows the whole case wide open.But those blazing white lights, shown in the RTX 30-series sizzle reel, are a major change from the traditional green GeForce beacon normally beaming out of the side of your chassis from an Nvidia card. And a welcome one too.Yes, I'm here talking aesthetics when all you really want to know is, do those RTX 2080 Ti pasting performance promises play out? But hear me out.\u00a0I've had to eat a fair bit of humble pie since getting my hands on the RTX 3080 Founders Edition; it's honestly quite a stunning bit of industrial engineering. And it's definitely grown on me.When I first saw the early leaked images of the shroud I was most definitely not onboard. It looked too chunky, almost too Fisher Price, Baby's First Graphics Card for my tastes. But now it's actually here in front of me. I think it's actually the most grown-up reference card design I've ever seen from any GPU maker.Certainly compared to some of the more 'extra' RTX 30-series designs we've seen from the board partners so far.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Image 1 of 7(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)The super-solid metal frame of the Founders card makes it a seriously weighty beast, but it also lends both straight edges and soft curves to the outline too. It's a unit (though not as much as the beastly RTX 3090 seems to be), but the tight, enclosed shroud stops it from looking vast. In fact it's only a shade longer than a Founders Edition RTX 20-series cooler design.On looks alone, I think Nvidia's latest reference card would be the one I'd want in my gaming rig. And thanks to that shining white light it's more likely to fit in with the overall look of our gaming PCs too.Image 1 of 6(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)I'm not the only one who colour coordinates their PC, right? At the moment the Nvidia green LEDs of the Titan X sat in my machine are very much at odds with the hot pink aesthetic of my rig. The lighting strips of the Lian Li DK-04 desk, the blazing UNI FAN SL120 fidget spinners, and the motherboard underlighting of the Asus Maximus XII Extreme are all fighting against that GeForce glow.The multiple white LEDs also brighten up what is otherwise a very dark card. The brushed aluminium frame is the only contrast for the jet-black cooling fins arrayed across the rest of the RTX 3080's cooler.That's all we can really talk about for now, but we'll have our full performance review for your delectation soon...\n\n\nDave JamesSocial Links NavigationEditor-in-Chief, HardwareDave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the Colecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!).

Since the video was taken down the last time they did this, WhyCry took the liberty of compiling all the juicy bits and it seems that according to their review the RTX 3090 is on average just 10% faster than the RTX 3080 (while being twice as expensive). While this is certainly due to some bottleneck, these are very interesting (and controversial) results.\nTecLab leaks NVIDIA RTX 3090 review: 10% faster than the RTX 3080\nTecLabs is quickly approaching cult status in the leak scene as the husky mask-donned vigilantes break the usual embargo to publish juicy videos with details earlier than anyone else. This time around, the subject of the video is the anxiously anticipated RTX 3090. Spoiler alert, however, as the RTX 3090 only seems to be capable of generating 10% more performance than the RTX 3080 on the current state of drivers and game code.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ3-KIZxipo&feature=youtu.be\nBefore we begin, the preliminaries are as follows: An Intel Core i9-10900 clocked at a solid 5 GHz was used with 32 GB of RAM at 4133 MHz. Needless to say, this is an absolutely solid compute configuration and more than exceeds the amount available in usual circumstances to gamers. A Galax HOF PRO M.2 1 TB SSD was used and a flurry of titles was tested. While the review doesn't explicitly mention the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090, they do say the 5000 YUAN flagship and the 10000 YUAN flagship so it is very clear what they are referring to.\n\nThe following data was compiled by Videocardz. As we can see below, the average performance increase across a panel of 16 synthetics and titles is roughly 10% (the exact number is actually 8.8% which is even less) delta over the RTX 3080. This is something that isn't in itself particularly surprising considering the RTX 3080 already doubles the CUDA core count of the RTX 2000 series and any software based bottlenecks would easily show up here as well as the RTX 3090.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs RTX 3080 (compilation by Videocardz)\n\n\n\n\nScore / 4K AVG FPSRTX 3090RTX 30803090/3080\n\n\n3DMark Time Spy Extreme99489000+10.5%\n\n\n3DMark Port Royal1282711981+7.1%\n\n\nMetro Exodus RTX/DLSS OFF54.448.8+10.2%\n\n\nMetro Exodus RTX/DLSS ON74.567.6+10.2%\n\n\nRainbow Six Siege275260+5.8%\n\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn8476+10.5%\n\n\nForza Horizon156149+4.7%\n\n\nFar Cry10799+8.1%\n\n\nAssassins Creed Oddysey7165+9.2%\n\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider RTX/DLSS Off9183+9.6%\n\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider RTX/DLSS On111102+8.8%\n\n\nBorderlands 367.661.3+10.3%\n\n\nDeath Stranding DLSS/RTX ON175164+6.7%\n\n\nDeath Stranding DLSS/RTX OFF116104+11.5%\n\n\nControl DLSS/RTX ON7165+9.2%\n\n\nControl DLSS/RTX OFF6257+8.8%\n\n\n\nWe have also attached some screenshots of the benchmarks below but the question then becomes: is the RTX 3090 just 9% faster than the RTX 3080? and if so why? The first answer that comes to my mind is that the amount of core increase that we saw in the 3000 series is just too big for software stacks to handle. While the drivers would (probably) have been updated to handle the massive throughput, game code and engines have to scale up to take advantage of the available processing power as well. This is sort of like games being optimized primarily to take advantage of just 1 core and not scaling perfectly.\nWhat we are seeing with the RTX 3080 and 3090 also appears to be a similar problem where the hardware is being bottlenecked by software. AMD's GPUs are usually fondly referred to as finewine but if my gut instinct is correct, the RTX 3000 series is going to turn out to be the biggest load of finewine silicon the gaming world has ever seen. With the cards only delivering half of the performance promised by NVIDIA I am fairly certain we are going to get massive incremental performance improvements pushed via software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think is the explaination behind the non linear scaling of shader count vs performance?\n\n\n It is what it is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Software bottleneck (finewine)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Something else\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Meh.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080/3090 GPU, Laptop, and Desktop Purchases Come Bundled with Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man Remastered for a Limited Time\n\nUle Lopez\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Almost Launched As The RTX 3090 SUPER As Leak Reveals\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Compares GeForce RTX 3090 Rendering Performance To An AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X 64 Core CPU, Cuts An Hour of Render Time\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Behemoth Graphics Card Up To 10% Faster Than RTX 3090 & Clocks Around 2 GHz\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n109\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n53\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n44\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n35\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

After showing various performance slides comparing the RTX 30 series with various older GeForce cards, he addressed Pascal GPU (GTX 10 series) owners directly and told them \"it is safe to upgrade now.\" This statement and the new more reasonable looking pricing structure seen with the GeForce RTX 30 series of GPUs makes it look like the RTX 20 series was something of a misfire by the green team.\n\nAs reported by VG247, the latest Steam Hardware Survey figures provide some background to the relative success of the GeForce Pascal and Turing lines of GPUs with consumers. While Nvidia products still hold a dominant 73 per cent share of GPUs among Steam gamers, the GTX 10 series is by far the dominant presence in the PC video card usage charts.\n\nAbove I've reproduced the latest video card chart, truncated to the top 10. Look at the relative strength of the top four, all Pascal designs and accounting for a quarter of all GPU models used by Steam gamers. The best selling Turing cards, the GeForce GTX 1650 and GTX 1660 Ti eschew fancy RTX features to provide entry level 1080p and mid-range fast refresh 1080p gaming capabilities, respectively. In seventh place we get the GeForce RTX 2060, which some might say has only just started to become viable to use with RTX On thanks to the latest DLSS advancements. Finally, the only 'high-end' RTX 20 card in the top 10 is the GeForce RTX 2070 Super, in position 10 with a smidgeon over 2 per cent of Steam users packing this GPU.\n\nSo, in over two years of market availability the Turing GPUs look to have failed to replace the Pascal GPUs already in consumer hands. Will Nvidia's first self-proclaimed \"RTX On and FPS On\" graphics cards be able to unseat the GeForce GTX 1060, for example, and can we expect to see RTX 3060 and RTX 3070 models in the top 10 before the RTX 40 series starts to be teased? This is what Nvidia seems to dearly want, so hopefully its as yet unveiled lower tier Ampere consumer GPUs will make a big splash.\nAt the same time, it would be good for AMD to be able to penetrate the top 10, or top 25 in the coming year. At present the red team has the Radeon RX 580 in position 9 of the Steam video cards chart, you have to move down to position 16 to see the RX 570, with the only RDNA GPU in the top 25 being at position 25 - the Radeon RX 5700 XT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 43 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

CrashingYou know what also starts with a C? Crashingby  Taylor LylesSep 29, 2020, 9:17 PM UTCLinkFacebookThreadsIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeFollowing multiple reports of third-party Nvidia RTX 3080 cards crashing, PC builders are now trying to figure out how many capacitors are in their new GPU.That\u2019s right: capacitors. On Friday, concerned buyers stumbled upon one theory for the crashes: a site called Igor\u2019s Lab speculated that Nvidia\u2019s partners were cheaping out on the capacitors used in their third-party RTX 3080s. And over the weekend, that theory spread: numerous outlets cited Igor\u2019s Lab to publish headlines like \u201cNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Stability Woes Traced To Cheap Capacitors\u201d and \u201cCapacitor issues are causing RTX 3080/3090 crashes.\u201dA day later, it appeared there might actually be some evidence that capacitors could have caused the cards to crash. EVGA weighed in on the RTX 3080 capacitor controversy on Saturday, citing its own issues with the capacitor layout it originally used in its RTX 3080 cards, although the company claims it never shipped the original layout to customers. In that note, EVGA explained that while a design with six POSCAPs \u201ccannot pass the real world applications testing,\u201d it later tried a design with four POSCAPs and 20 MLCC caps that worked better.\u201cIt is false that POSCAP capacitors independently could cause a hardware crash.\u201d \u2014 GigabyteAs Tom\u2019s Hardware explains, there are typically two types of capacitors found underneath a modern GPU\u2019s chip: MLCC and POSCAPS. Both capacitors reportedly have pros and cons; MLCC is smaller but performs better at higher clock speeds. POSCAPS are larger but are not as good when running at high clock speeds. At this point, we don\u2019t actually know whether capacitors are causing these crashes, but the demand has certainly gotten the industry to respond: MSI, Gigabyte, and Zotac have all issued statements claiming the capacitors are not the problem, and that new Nvidia drivers can address any stability issues in the cards. That\u2019s Nvidia\u2019s position too, and it released a new driver today to address stability issues with the RTX 30 GPU line.PC World reports one of its cards that was previously crashing doesn\u2019t do it after the update. The outlet had a pre-production EVGA GeForce RTX 3080 FTW3 for review, which had the original capacitors instead of the ones shipped out to retailers. PC World notes that there\u2019s a tradeoff: the update \u201cslightly limits\u201d the top clock speed on the GPU boost.See More: EntertainmentGamingNewsNvidiaPC GamingTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019Lego announces Pok\u00e9mon sets are coming next yearInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Luckily for us, we have the \u201cflagship\u201d GeForce RTX 3080 in our hands right now along with an unboxing video for you to enjoy.\r\n\n\nAs we detailed before the GeForce RTX 30 Series was even revealed (thanks to leaks), the GeForce RTX 3080 uses a\u00a0push-pull cooling system\u00a0with a blower exhausting hot air through the PCIe slot (as we\u2019ve typically come to expect). However, there is a second fan on the opposite side of the board that draws air through the actual graphics card and exhausts it on the side of the card closest to your CPU.\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA says that this new fan arrangement not only vastly improves cooling performance, but also results in quieter operation. We should mention that this new cooling design is only applicable to NVIDIA\u2019s own cards; we\u2019ve seen more traditional dual- and triple-fan cooling setups for third-party cards from the company\u2019s board partners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther items of mention include a design that still takes up two expansion slots, and a new 12-pin power connector that replaces the old 8-pin design. On the\u00a0GeForce RTX 3080\u00a0reference design, the 12-pin connector is mounted in the middle of the card at an angle due to the truncated nature of the PCB. Finally, there are three DisplayPort connectors that are joined by a single HDMI port. The USB-C port dedicated to VirtualLink on the GeForce RTX 20 Series has been removed, as the universal VR headset connection standard never took off and has since been abandoned.\u00a0\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3080 comes with 8,704 CUDA cores, a base clock of 1.44GHz, and a boost clock of 1.71GHz. It also includes 10GB of GDDR6X memory operating on a 320-bit interface. NVIDIA claims performance of 30 shader TFLOPs, 58 RT-TFLOPS, and 238-Tensor-TFLOPS. All of this adds up to a card that will be twice as fast as the previous generation GeForce RTX 2080, at least according to NVIDIA\u2019s benchmarks. The GeForce RTX 3080 will be priced at $699 when it launches on September 17th, so stay tuned for our upcoming review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, (nasdaq:nvda), ampere, geforce rtx 3080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 (Image credit: Nvidia)If you're set on purchasing one of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 30-series (codename Ampere) graphics cards, don't think twice. Chinese news outlet Commercial Times (via Twitter user @chiakokhua) reported that there probably wouldn't be enough graphics cards to go around. As a result, some vendors are purportedly preparing high-end motherboard bundle deals to force an upsell on customers. It also appears that ASUS's flagship Strix 3080 cards won't be available at launch, either.According to the outlet, the limited availability at launch wouldn't just affect the GeForce RTX 3080, which is the new king of gaming graphics cards, but the entire Ampere product stack. We can't say we didn't see it coming, though, since there were early signs of the GeForce RTX 30-series having a tight supply problem. For one, no retailer is accepting preorders for Ampere, which means everyone has the same chance of securing a graphics card at launch time. Sadly, this has also opened the floodgates for scalpers to capitalize on the situation with the GeForce RTX 3080 release. Furthermore, mainstream Ampere relies on a custom Samsung 8nm process node, which might require a bit of time for yields to improve. The global supply chain disruptions from the coronavirus pandemic likely also play a role, too.\u00a0According to the Commercial Times report, the short supply originated in the second quarter of this year. Initially, the transition from Turing to Ampere slowed down the production schedule. Consequently, the shortage of other components contributed to elongating the schedule and negatively impacting delivery times. The lead time for Ampere is estimated to have increased by two to three weeks. There is hope that it will improve in the fourth quarter, though.Some vendors are adopting a new marketing strategy to take advantage of the shortage to maximize their profits. The plan reportedly consists of bundling Ampere graphics cards with high-end motherboards to bolster the sales of the latter. Intel Z490 and AMD X570 and B550 motherboards will seemingly be part of the rumored bundles. Commercial Times mentioned that manufacturers will only use the bundling tactic in certain major markets, but didn't allude to which countries. In terms of supply, the publication's channel industry sources estimated that there would only be around a couple of thousand units of the GeForce RTX 3080 for the Chinese mainland market.The GeForce RTX 3080 goes on sale tomorrow for $699, followed by the $1,499 GeForce RTX 3090 and $499 GeForce RTX 3070 in September 24 and October 15, respectively.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nrtx\nGeForce RTX 3090\nGeForce RTX 3080\nGeForce RTX 3070\nasus\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (4)\n\n\n\nZhiye LiuSocial Links NavigationNews Editor and Memory ReviewerZhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

When it came time to sell it yesterday morning, however, the train went a bit off the rails. NVIDIA apparently failed to account for the excitement it created, as the $699 RTX 3080 Founder\u2019s Edition sold out nearly instantly. On top of that, the site went down almost immediately after sales opened, shutting out most buyers.In a post on its forums (via Gamerant), NVIDIA said \u201cwe apologize to our customers for this morning\u2019s experience,\u201d explaining that \u201cthe NVIDIA store was inundated with traffic and encountered errors.\u201d It said that managed to resolve the issue and resumed sales, adding that it was taking actions, including manually reviewing orders, to stop bots and scalpers. EngadgetHowever, frustrated buyers figure that the stock was snapped up by bots, with one user tweeting that he \u201cstayed up all night just to get crashed servers and everything sold out within two minutes without me even seeing the item as available.\u201d As Gizmodo noted, plenty of cards have popped up on eBay at double or more the retail price and one Founder\u2019s Edition card apparently sold for $70,000 (there\u2019s one on the site right now that\u2019s been bid up to $43,900 as of 4AM ET today).ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementAs for the lack of stock, NVIDIA said that it\u2019s \u201cshipping more RTX 3080 cards every day to retailers.\u201d Newegg tweeted that it \u201cexperienced more traffic than the morning of Black Friday\u201d and sold out of RTX 3080 cards in five minutes, saying \u201cbot protection was in place, orders were human.\u201d The company promised to release more of the cards \u201cas we get more.\u201dThose wanting RTX 3080 GPUs, here's some info:This morning we experienced more traffic than the morning of Black FridayLimited inventory sold out in 5 minsWe'll release more as we get moreBot protection was in place, orders were humanTurn on Auto Notify & check back\u2014 Newegg (@Newegg) September 17, 2020If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

Learn more here.\n GeForce RTX 30 Series Founders Edition Graphics Cards\nOur Founders Edition GeForce graphics cards feature excellent cooling and stunning designs that make your PC a striking showcase. For our new GeForce RTX 30 Series, we\u2019ve created an innovative dual axial flow through cooling solution, featuring two fans - one at the left front, and another on the right rear that draws air through the card (the GeForce RTX 3070 flow through design differs slightly, with its fans both mounted on the top of the card).\nAs heat is drawn away from components into the hybrid vapor chamber, it is efficiently distributed across the length of the card and throughout the massive aluminum fin stack. The left fan pushes air heated by the fin stack out through extra-large GPU bracket vents, while the right fan draws the air towards the top chassis exhaust.\n   \nOrdinarily, GPU circuit boards (PCBs) are the length of the graphics card. To insert a full-sized fan in the rear of the card we had to get creative! To that end, our engineers designed a much smaller PCB, shrank the NVLink and power connectors, and still managed to pack in 18-phases for improved power delivery. Don\u2019t worry, we included an adapter that allows Founders Edition cards to work with users\u2019 existing power supplies.\nThese changes, among others, gave us the space to chop a large fan-sized chunk from the PCB, giving our dual axial flow through cooling solution plenty of space to breathe.\n   \u00a0   \u00a0   \n   \u00a0   \u00a0   \n   \u00a0   \u00a0   \nAcoustically, the new Founders Edition design is quieter than traditional dual axial coolers, while still delivering nearly 2x the cooling performance of previous generation coolers. The aforementioned NVLink and power design changes help here, creating more space for airflow through the largest fin stack seen to date, and the larger bracket vents improve airflow in concert with individually shaped shroud fins. In fact, wherever you look, every aspect of the Founders Edition cards are designed to maximise airflow, minimize temperatures, and enable the highest levels of performance with the least possible noise.\nThese card-wide cooling innovations allow us to give you more performance, without a corresponding increase in temperature or noise over prior-generation graphics cards.\n   \nGeForce RTX 30 Series Founders Edition graphics cards will be available directly from our website. Purchase when the cards are released on the GeForce RTX 3090, GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3070 landing pages.\n GeForce RTX 30 Series Hardware\nThe blistering performance of our new GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards is made possible by a combination of cutting-edge tech and over two decades of gaming graphics R&D. Here\u2019s a brief overview of the highlights; if you wish to know more, check back on September 17th for the GeForce RTX 30 Series Whitepaper, which will delve into every aspect of our new graphics cards in exhaustive detail.\n NVIDIA Ampere Streaming Multiprocessors\nStreaming Multiprocessors (SMs) are at the heart of NVIDIA GPUs, and our newest NVIDIA Ampere Streaming Multiprocessors are our best yet. Compared to the previous-gen SM on the Turing-architecture GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, the new SMs offer 2x FP32 throughput for superior performance.\n   \nAnd as with previous generations, we\u2019ve also increased performance per watt, getting gamers even higher frame rates. Together with PCIE 4.0 support, an 18-phase power supply, and new innovative cooling solutions, GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs deliver new performance records even before you overclock.\n  \n 2nd Generation Ray Tracing Cores & 3rd Generation Tensor Cores\nNVIDIA made real-time videogame ray tracing a reality with the invention of Ray Tracing Cores, dedicated processing cores on the GPU specifically designed to tackle performance-intensive ray tracing workloads. On GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs, we are introducing 2nd Generation RT Cores, which have up to 2x the throughput.\n   \u00a0   \nThese enhancements accelerate ray tracing performance by up to 2X.\nTo further accelerate performance in rasterized and ray-traced games, we invented NVIDIA DLSS, a deep learning neural network powered by dedicated AI processors called Tensor Cores that boost frame rates while maintaining crisp, clear image quality.\nGeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs feature our 3rd generation Tensor Cores, with up to 2x the throughput of Turing-architecture Tensor Cores, making it faster to run AI-powered technologies and techniques, and opening the door to future features.\nWhen enabled, DLSS improves performance in titles such as Control, Minecraft with RTX for Windows 10 and Death Stranding, while generating beautiful, crisp game images that are often clearer and sharper than native resolution rendering with Temporal Anti-Aliasing. And now, we\u2019re introducing a new Ultra Performance mode that enables DLSS to run at up to 8K on the GeForce RTX 3090.\n GDDR6X - World\u2019s Fastest Graphics Memory\nMemory manufacturer Micron is debuting its new GDDR6X memory on the GeForce RTX 3090 and GeForce RTX 3080. GDDR6X uses innovative PAM4 signal transmission technology to once again double the data rate per clock, delivering unprecedented graphics memory performance to feed the most data-hungry workloads, such as gaming, professional visualisation, and AI inference.\n   \nThese enhancements ensure the GPU\u2019s compute cores and other components receive a constant stream of data, rather than stalling while they wait, maximising efficiency and performance.\n HDMI 2.1 Support\nThe development of new monitor and TV technology has rapidly outpaced HDMI\u2019s capabilities in recent years. Display panels capable of 4K and 8K resolutions have been available for some time, but previous-gen single-cable connections and outputs were limited to 4K HDR at 98Hz. At higher refresh rates and resolutions, you\u2019d either have to compromise by enabling Chroma Subsampling, or start using multiple display outputs and display cables.\nTo resolve this, GeForce RTX 30 Series are the world\u2019s first PC GPUs to support HDMI 2.1, the newest display standard. With a certified HDMI 2.1 TV or monitor with DSC, 4K can run at high refresh rates without compromise, and 8K single-cable TVs are now a reality.\n AV1 Decode Support\nThe planet\u2019s biggest Internet companies have banded together to create AV1, a royalty-free, highly efficient video codec. This reduces the bandwidth required to stream high resolution video by up to 50% compared to H.264, and makes 4K and 8K high resolution streams feasible for consumers lacking the fastest Internet connections and unmetered contracts.\nGeForce RTX 30 Series are the first discrete GPUs with AV1 decoders (as part of our new 5th generation NVIDIA Decoder), enabling users to take advantage of AV1 on desktops and in media centers.\n NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency Technologies\nInput lag, otherwise known as system latency, makes games less responsive, increasing the time it takes for your actions to be reflected in-game. With the launch of our GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs, we\u2019re introducing NVIDIA Reflex, a revolutionary suite of GPU, G-SYNC display, and software technologies that allow gamers to measure and optimise system latency.\nLower latency makes your PC more responsive to mouse input, which can make all the difference between winning and losing in fast paced games where milliseconds matter. Support for the new NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency Mode is coming soon for top competitive titles, including Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Call of Duty: Warzone, Destiny 2, Fortnite,and Valorant.\n  \nFor a detailed rundown of NVIDIA Reflex and how it helps measure and reduce system latency, head here.\n GeForce RTX 30 Series Performance\nAll this tech, along with driver optimisations, memory compression techniques, and other NVIDIA Ampere architecture enhancements, makes GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards the absolute fastest available.\nIn ray-traced games, performance is up to 2X faster compared to our previous-generation graphics cards. And in rasterized games without ray tracing and DLSS, GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards deliver the performance necessary for max setting, high resolution, high framerate gameplay, giving you the definitive experience.\n   \nWhether you\u2019re a competitive player seeking 360 FPS in eSports titles, or a gamer wanting zero compromise experiences with the absolute highest levels of fidelity, GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards will exceed your expectations.\nEagerly anticipating Cyberpunk 2077, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Watch Dogs: Legion, or any other game? GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards are primed and ready for them, and as you\u2019ll see below, NVIDIA is already working with their developers to ensure flawless experiences enhanced with our latest technologies and features.\n Blockbuster Games add NVIDIA Technologies, including RTX and DLSS\nNVIDIA constantly works with developers, optimising PC performance, crafting Game Ready Driver updates, and incorporating game-changing technologies like ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS, and NVIDIA Reflex.

It's possible the vendor ran out of preorder inventory (the 3080 is anticipated to be in high demand, as well as the 3070), or it could have jumped the gun on accepting orders.Original story:The wait is on for new Nvidia Ampere cards to land on retail shelves, starting with the 'flagship' GeForce RTX 3080. That GPU gets released next Thursday, September 17, but if you want to order one right now, however, you can.I have found exactly two models that are available to preorder, both at B&H Photo, and both from from Asus and its TUF Gaming line. They include:Asus TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3080 O10G: $799.99, B&H PhotoAsus TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3080 10G: $779.99, B&H PhotoThe more expensive of the two is presumably an overclocked model, though curiously Asus does not list the specifications on its product page (and neither do any of the vendors that have the part listed).Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: the top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest graphics card: your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: get into the game ahead of the restFor reference, Nvidia's blueprint for a 3080 calls for a 1.44GHz base clock and 1.71GHz boost clock. It also features 8,704 CUDA cores and 10GB of GDDR6X memory at 19Gbps on a 320-bit bus, which yields 760.3GB/s of memory bandwidth.Nvidia considers the 3080 its flagship consumer GPU, with the higher spec'd 3090 primarily intended for creators.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The Founders Edition variant with Nvidia's fancy cooler runs $699. Looking solely at B&H Photo's listings (because they include pricing information), custom models currently range from $720 on up to $905.I'd suggest hanging tight, as there will inevitably be overclocked models priced closer to Nvidia's MSRP. For example, Gigabyte's Eagle OC model is listed at $730, it's just not available to preorder.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nAsus\nNvidia\n\n\nPaul LillySocial Links NavigationPaul has been playing PC games and raking his knuckles on computer hardware since the Commodore 64.

Photo by Kristoffer Tripplaar Sipa USA via AP\n\nKristoffer Tripplaar/Sipa/AP\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nTaiwan could become the next flashpoint in the global tech war  \n\n\n\n\n            Chinese regulators haven\u2019t spoken publicly about the deal, but state-run media is often viewed as a barometer of sentiment among senior officials. And China\u2019s influence is key: The last time a semiconductor deal of this size was attempted, it failed. In 2018, Beijing declined to approve American chip company Qualcomm\n            \n                (QCOM)\u2019s proposed $44 billion takeover Dutch counterpart NXP.\n    \n\n            Given the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China, \u201cwe believe that obtaining all necessary global regulatory approvals will be challenging,\u201d Citi analysts Atif Malik and Amanda Scarnati wrote in a note on Monday. \n    \n\n            Nvidia and Arm said they expect that the deal will take 18 months to close, \u201cwhich we believe signals that they expect a protracted and detailed review by [the Ministry of Commerce] in China,\u201d the analysts added.\n    \n\n        Tightening US restrictions\n\n\n            Semiconductors power everything from smartphones to self-driving cars. The industry has consolidated over the years because designing and manufacturing cutting edge computer chips requires huge amounts of cash for research and development. \n    \n\n            Arm, which is based in Cambridge and is known as one of Britain\u2019s most successful tech companies, designs chips used by Samsung, Apple\n            \n                (AAPL) and other major smartphone makers. Many leading Chinese semiconductor design firms \u2014 such as Huawei subsidiary HiSilicon \u2014 use Arm intellectual property for their cutting edge designs, too. \n    \n\n            \u201cArm has been really useful for China because UK [export] rules are a bit more lax,\u201d said James Lewis, senior vice president and director of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). \n    \n\n            Nvidia and Arm have offered reassurances that the British firm will remain neutral. \n    \n\n            As part of Nvidia, Arm will continue \u201cmaintaining the global customer neutrality that has been foundational to its success,\u201d the companies said in a statement announcing the deal on Sunday.\n    \n\n            But if Arm is acquired by an American company, it would likely be subject to US regulations \u2014 and Washington has been increasingly using export controls to cut Chinese tech firms off from key technology.\n    \n\n            \u201cIf they moved to Nvidia they would fall under American export rules which have significantly tightened over the last few years,\u201d Lewis said.\n    \n\n            Earlier this year the United States issued fresh sanctions against Huawei that restricted the Chinese tech company from buying chips from semiconductor manufacturers that use American machinery, software or technology. Analysts called the move a \u201clethal blow\u201d and a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d for Huawei, which needs leading edge chips to power its smartphone and telecommunications gear. \n    \n\n            The US Department of Defense and other government agencies are also reportedly considering banning exports to SMIC, China\u2019s biggest chipmaker, which would significantly hamper Beijing\u2019s efforts to build an advanced domestic semiconductor industry. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJen-Hsun Huang, president and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., speaks during the company's event at the 2019 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., on Sunday, Jan. 6, 2019.

He called the paper an \u201cexcitable mouthpiece\u201d for the Chinese government.\n    \n\n            And even if the Nvidia-Arm deal gets the go-ahead from China, it may not be entirely out of the clear. \n    \n\n            Some politicians in the United Kingdom have expressed concern about preserving jobs at Arm, which could come up as the deal is reviewed there. And Nvidia\u2019s rivals \u2014 which purchase chip designs from Arm \u2014 are likely to object.\n    \n\n\u2014 Michelle Toh contributed to this report. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN Business Videos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEEP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\nCould humans live underwater?

At the same time, overclockers who had received their cards from board partners were pushing the card to its limits and achieving new world records which leave NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 2080 Ti and Titan RTX in the dust.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Graphics Cards Pushed Beyond 2300 MHz With LN2 Overclocking, Reach Over 10,000 Points in Time Spy Extreme\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080's standard overclocking results may not be highly impressive as the best dies are kept for the top custom variants that will be introduced later on. However, even with existing GA102 dies, overclockers managed to hit clock speeds north of 2300 MHz. Interestingly, all overclockers have not touched the memory during the overclocks which means that we could get even higher scores in the coming days as more overclockers get access to custom-designed board partner cards.\nRelated Story NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\nComing to the results, the top 2 positions in the 3DMark Time Spy Extreme Hall of Fame are now conquered by the GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card. The top position has been scored by Ronaldo Buassali whose in-house overclocker at GALAX based in Latin America. Ronaldo is well-known in the overclocking scene but most of you would remember his famous video on YouTube where he along with his team transformed an RTX 2080 Ti graphics card into an RTX 2080 Ti SUPER by using faster GDDR6 dies from RTX 2080 SUPER series cards. You can check that out over here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nRonaldo pushed his GALX GeForce RTX 3080 SG sample to 2310 MHz and proceeded to post 10,595 points in the Graphics segment which is 7% faster than the fastest RTX 2080 Ti (overclocked to 2745 MHz).\n\nThe second score was posted by Indonesian overclocker Lucky_n00b (Alva Jonathan). He pushed his MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Gaming X Trio to 2160 MHz and scored 10,024 points in the Time Spy Extreme benchmark which is also faster than the same RTX 2080 Ti (2745 MHz) used to compare above.\nIt doesn't stop at just 3DMark's Time Spy Extreme since the Port Royal Hall of Fame is now also conquered by the RTX 3080. The top position is held by Ronaldo's RTX 3080 SG (GALAX) which was overclocked a bit more to 2340 MHz and posted a score of 13,488 points which outperforms the fastest RTX 2080 Ti entry running at 2700 MHz. The overclocks definitely make the GeForce RTX 3080 the fastest graphics card on the planet right now but one can only imagine the level of GPU performance the RTX 3090 would be able to achieve when it hits the store shelves next week.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n192\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n145\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n97\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n67\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n39\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1158\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The Switch collection throws together new versions of beloved Mario titles for sixty bucks, and on paper, it seems like a pretty good deal. While I have my reservations about that, I'll put them to the side for now, because something about the collection's been bothering me. \nWithout a doubt, 3D All-Stars' port of Super Mario Galaxy is the flagship of this package. Running 60 FPS at 1080p, it's a definite upgrade from the 480p Wii original I played as a kid. It's Galaxy as I remember it, as opposed to how it actually looked, and that's a magical feeling.\nOr it would be, if a nagging question didn't bother me while playing it. You see, while most people seem to be running with the line that this is an all-new version of Galaxy, I don't buy it. Instead, I think this is actually an earlier project retrofitted into this collection, and sold off in America as a new product.\nI'm convinced that this version of Super Mario Galaxy was not made for this collection. Instead, I'm of the belief that this is a new version of the China-exclusive Nvidia Shield port released in 2018. \n                        Wait, The Nvidia Shield?\n               \nUnknown to many, four major Wii titles were ported to the Nvidia Shield in China. In 2018, new versions of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Punchout, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, and Super Mario Galaxy were made available on the platform. As Eurogamer reported, the ports of these games were great, but a bit baffling. \"The quality of the emulation and the effort put into it seems rather extreme when the end result is a limited release of four games [...] only available in one territory,\" wrote Thomas Morgan, \"where Shield sales are likely to be microscopic.\"\nMorgan specifically wrote on the Galaxy port in his article, which he walked away very impressed by. If you watch footage of the game, it's easy to see why - it looks incredible. Without a doubt, it's the most visually accomplished version of the game to date. By contrast, the Wii original looks blurry, muddy, and slow.\nTake a look at Digital Foundry's video here.\n\nSo, why did Nintendo release these four games on the Shield in China - and with such great versions, to boot? It definitely seems like a suspect allocation of time and resources if those versions weren't going to be universally available for a global player base.\nThis is where another interesting wrinkle comes into play. See, the Nvidia Shield is powered by the versatile, lightweight Tegra X1 chip, which allows for powerful gaming experiences in a lightweight package. It's an impressive, albeit niche, piece of tech. However, the Shield isn't the only system out there using the Tegra X1. There's another consumer device on the market that's more popular, more widely adopted, and more universally beloved.\nThat device is the Nintendo Switch.\nRelated: Internet Mourns Loss Of Super Mario 64\u2019s Beloved \u201cGay Bowser\u201d Voice Line \n                        Super Tegra X1 Galaxy\n               \nTo recap, Nintendo tapped either an external or internal dev to port Super Mario Galaxy to the Shield. By proxy, they built a version of the game that works around all the strengths and limitations of the Tegra. That same Tegra is what powers the Nintendo Switch, which is what this latest version of the game has just been released on.\nNow, it would be easy to assume that the version of Galaxy in 3D All-Stars is the Shield port based on this alone. However, that's purely circumstantial evidence, and we'd need a more definitive comparison to back this claim up.\nOh, wait, somebody already made one. (Thanks, Direct-Feed Games!)\n\nRight off the bat, it's worth noting that the Switch version actually looks worse. Even with full RGB enabled on my own console, my version of the game looks identical to the Switch capture here. That is to say, it's a bit washed-out, brighter colors blend together, and there's a general muddiness about the whole game. However, muddy colors on the Switch are a known issue, as a quick Google search will show you.\nWhat about the actual texture quality and aliasing, then? When you watch this side-by-side, both versions of the game might look practically identical at first. Certainly, I think it's fair to say that the Switch port is likely based on this Shield version. Take a look at this comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the textures and reflections look almost identical. However, you might notice that in the lower right-hand corner of each screenshot, there's a bit more detail on the Switch version's stair textures. Of course, that can be chalked up to the aforementioned color issue with the Switch. The following scene with Rosalina gives us a better view of just how vastly different the colors in both versions are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia Direct-Feed Games\n\n\n\nNote that Rosalina is a bit more washed out on the Switch. The definition on her hair blends in with the light behind her, resulting in a frankly ugly picture quality. However, despite that clear visual downgrade, one last comparison shot complicates matters just a bit more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile you might not notice very many differences at first, take a closer look at the tower and the brick to the right of Mario. Note that Shield version of the roof is lacking tile textures, while the Switch version definitely has them. Meanwhile, the bricks in the lower right-hand-corner are more muddy on the Switch, and more defined on the Shield. In addition, the skybox in the Switch version is definitely more defined.\nSo... what does all this mean? \n                        A Prototype?\n               \nWithout any official word from Nintendo, it's impossible to say whether or not this is the same version of the game that released in China. While they do have subtle differences, they look almost the exact same and perform identically - right down to the Switch featuring the Shield's control scheme. It would be strange for Nintendo to put all that time and effort into a Shield port, then do an entirely different version on the Tegra X1 for this one collection two years later.\nSo, what's the truth here? Unfortunately, anything I can say will just be speculation. However, from the facts in front of me, it seems an awful lot like Nintendo could've used the Shield as a testing ground for future Wii ports. It would make sense to put out four different types of game onto a small platform in one region as a test. That way, they could put the powerhouse behind the Switch to the test, without risking any damage to their carefully curated brand.\nAnd as far as making it exclusive to China goes? That's easy - Nintendo wasn't an established brand in the country for years, so there wasn't as much of a hit to their reputation should the ports prove to be subpar. They could write it off as a novel way to bring Nintendo to China, much like the iQue Player, then go about their merry way.\nIf I were a betting woman, I'd wager a few bucks that the version of Super Mario Galaxy in 3D All-Stars is based off that Shield port, and isn't an entirely new port made for the collection. However, until Nintendo makes any sort of official statement about, we'll be left in the dark.\nNext: Super Mario 3D All-Stars Players Have Found Something Strange in Super Mario Sunshine \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheGamer Originals\n\n\n\n\nSuper Mario Galaxy\n\n\n\n\nSuper Mario\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMarvel Rivals Is Bringing Back Its Spider-Punk 2099 And Steam Power Iron Man Skins\n\t\t\n\n\nMarvel Rivals\n\nThat Spider-Punk skin was too good to leave behind with the beta.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tExclusive - The First Berserker: Khazan Boss Week - Volbaino Reveal\n\t\t\n\n\nThe First Berserker: Khazan\n\nWe're on day two of TheGamer's week of exclusive The First Berserker boss battle reveals.

That\u2019s the simple message that Justin \u201cMr. Fascinate\u201d Shaifer evangelizes to young people around the world.\nThrough social media and other platforms, Shaifer fascinates children with STEM projects \u2014 including those that can be created using AI with NVIDIA Jetson products \u2014 in hopes that more students from underrepresented groups will be inspired to dive into the field. NVIDIA Jetson embedded systems allow anyone to create their own AI-based projects.\nGrowing up on Chicago\u2019s South Side, Shaifer didn\u2019t know anyone with a career in STEM he could look up to \u2014 at least no one he could relate to. Now, he\u2019s become that role model for thousands of kids, working to prove that STEM is cool and attainable for anyone who has a passion for it.\nAbout the Maker\nShaifer is a STEM advocate, animator and TV host who educates students about the importance of STEM and diversity within it. He has a YouTube channel, gives keynote speeches and hosts the Escape Lab live science show on Twitch.\nHe\u2019s also the founder of Fascinate Inc., a nonprofit with the mission of exciting underrepresented students about careers in STEM and providing schools and after-school programs with fun science curricula.\nThe organization also launched the Magic Cool Bus project, filling a real-life bus with cutting-edge tech gadgets and bringing it to schools so students can hop on board and explore.\nGrowing up in a single-parent home, Shaifer was fascinated by science, earning scholarships from NASA and NOAA that covered his expenses to study marine and environmental science at Hampton University. He\u2019s currently working toward a Ph.D. in science education at Columbia University.\nHis Inspiration\nShaifer was inspired to transition from being a scientist in a lab to a science educator for others in 2017, while volunteering at a museum in Washington.\n\u201cI was freestyle rapping about a carbon cycle exhibit, and this nine-year-old Black kid came up to me and said, \u2018What do you do, man?\u2019\u201d said Shaifer.\nWhen Shaifer told him he was a scientist, the child said, \u201cThat\u2019s so cool. When I grow up, I want to be a scientist just like you!\u201d\n\u201cThat made me reflect on the fact that at nine years old, I\u2019d never seen an example of a scientist that looked like me,\u201d said Shaifer. \u201cI realized that students need to be exposed to a role model in STEM that they can identify with, at scale.\u201d\nLater that year, Shaifer founded Fascinate Inc.\n\nHis Favorite Jetson Projects\nShaifer is passionate about exposing students to the world of AI, and he says using NVIDIA Jetson platform is a great way to do so.\nWatch him highlight Jetson products:\nNVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX Unboxing and Impression\n\nNVIDIA SparkFun JetBot AI Kit Unboxing and Impression \n\nOne of Shaifer\u2019s favorite real-world applications that uses the NVIDIA Jetson Nano developer kit is Qrio. The bot, created by Agustinus Nalwan, recognizes a toddler\u2019s toy and plays a relevant YouTube video.\n\u201cEspecially since I work with young kids, I think that\u2019s a really cool application that allows a child to be engaged, interactive and always learning as they play with their toys,\u201d said Shaifer.\nWhere to Learn More\u00a0\nGet fascinated by STEM on Shaifer\u2019s website and YouTube channel.\nDiscover tools, inspiration and three easy steps to help kickstart your project with AI on our \u201cGet AI, Learn AI, Build AI\u201d page.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Inner Geek | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Education | Embedded Computing | Jetson \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

For our first look at the performance of NVIDIA\u2019s new RTX 3080, we\u2019re tackling rendering with the help of Octane, Blender, V-Ray, KeyShot, Arnold, and Redshift, comparing it against the previous generation of RTX cards, and also the $699 GPU from two generations ago: The GTX 1080 Ti. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t miss our newer results featuring RTX 3090!\nThe GeForce RTX 3080 has arrived, and for creators, NVIDIA\u2019s latest offers a lot to love. Whereas the Turing generation introduced ray tracing and deep-learning cores, the Ampere architecture supercharges each of those. Now, if you think back some of the jaw-dropping performance we saw with RTX-enabled design software, the thought of an (up to) doubling of performance is pretty exciting.\nWe\u2019re not afraid to say up front that the RTX 3080 is one hell of a graphics card \u2013 either for creation or gaming. We\u2019re starting our launch coverage with more of a creative twist, looking specifically at CUDA and OptiX-specific renderers, in addition to Blender 2.90, which will have results enhanced with competitor cards.\n\nPriced at $699, the RTX 3080 follows in the footsteps of the 2080 SUPER, but targets the 2080 Ti in performance. Even the TITAN RTX is about to be taught a harsh lesson. For creators, the biggest limitation of the RTX 3080 is going to be the 10GB frame buffer, although for most users, that will still be sufficient for a while, something helped by the fact that the Ampere\u2019s memory architecture with GDDR6X is really efficient.\nFor top-end users, the RTX 3090 is likely to be a no-brainer. In a single generation, NVIDIA took a card like the TITAN RTX, vastly improved its performance, kept the 24GB frame buffer, and dropped the price by $1,000. We\u2019re not sure if there will be a TITAN for this Ampere generation, but a 40GB option priced at $2,500~$2,999 released at some point seems plausible (to us).\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of NVIDIA\u2019s current lineup:\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s GeForce Gaming GPU Lineup\n\n\n\nCores\nBase MHz\nPeak FP32\nMemory\nBandwidth\nTDP\nSRP\n\n\nRTX 3090\n10,496\n1,400\n35.6 TFLOPS\n24GB 1\n936GB/s\n350W\n$1,499\n\n\nRTX 3080\n8,704\n1,440\n29.7 TFLOPS\n10GB 1\n760GB/s\n320W\n$699\n\n\nRTX 3070\n5,888\n1,500\n20.4 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n512GB/s\n220W\n$499\n\n\nTITAN RTX\n4,608\n1,770\n16.3 TFLOPS\n24GB 2\n672 GB/s\n280W\n$2,499\n\n\nRTX 2080 Ti\n4,352\n1,350\n13.4 TFLOPS\n11GB 2\n616 GB/s\n250W\n$1,199\n\n\nRTX 2080 S\n3,072\n1,650\n11.1 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n496 GB/s\n250W\n$699\n\n\nRTX 2070 S\n2,560\n1,605\n9.1 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n448 GB/s\n215W\n$499\n\n\nRTX 2060 S\n2,176\n1,470\n7.2 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n448 GB/s\n175W\n$399\n\n\nRTX 2060\n1,920\n1,365\n6.4 TFLOPS\n6GB 2\n336 GB/s\n160W\n$299\n\n\nGTX 1660 Ti\n1,536\n1,500\n5.5 TFLOPS\n6GB 2\n288 GB/s\n120W\n$279\n\n\nGTX 1660 S\n1,408\n1,530\n5.0 TFLOPS\n6GB 2\n336 GB/s\n125W\n$229\n\n\nGTX 1660\n1,408\n1,530\n5 TFLOPS\n6GB 4\n192 GB/s\n120W\n$219\n\n\nGTX 1650 S\n1,280\n1,530\n4.4TFLOPS\n4GB 2\n192 GB/s\n100W\n$159\n\n\nGTX 1650\n896\n1,485\n3 TFLOPS\n4GB 4\n128 GB/s\n75W\n$149\n\n\nGTX 1080 Ti\n3,584\n1,480\n11.3 TFLOPS\n11GB 3\n484 GB/s\n250W\n$699\n\n\nNotes\n1 GDDR6X; 2 GDDR6; 3 GDDR5X; 4 GDDR5; 5 HBM2\nGTX 1080 Ti = Pascal; GTX/RTX 2000 = Turing; RTX 3000 = Ampere\n\n\n\nWhile the RTX 3080 is going to prove itself to be a lot faster than the 2080 Ti, or even TITAN RTX, its TDP has been boosted, so you can expect a higher power drain from the wall. Something tells us that the performance gain will make that a non-issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition - In Box\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition - Fan Closeup\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition - Power Connector\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition - 12-pin Power Adapter\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition - Size Comparison with 2080 Ti\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition - Founders Edition Packaging\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition - In Opened Box\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Founders Edition of the RTX 3080 can be seen in the photos above. The card features a new 12-pin power connector that will require an adapter to be used for any current PC. As time goes on, more power supply vendors are expected to adopt this connector, though that\u2019s something that may happen quicker if AMD decides to also adopt it.\nOn this particular card, the positioning of the power connector on the GPU seems a bit strange, since the fact that it\u2019s front-facing means that you won\u2019t be able to avoid having a cable hanging in front of the card. The card PCB underneath is much shorter than the shroud, so NVIDIA couldn\u2019t have moved it to the end like on most designs.\nTo learn more about what the RTX 3000 series brings to the table, you should refer to our announcement article. As mentioned above, this article is going to focus exclusively on rendering with CUDA or OptiX-infused renderers, but we will have plenty more performance coming for gaming, including RTX-specific testing.\nAn important note on general creator performance: We quickly tested things like SPECviewperf, Adobe Premiere Pro, MAGIX Vegas Pro, and so on, but didn\u2019t find the performance to be so notably different on the RTX 3080 (vs. 2080 Ti) that it warranted full retesting of the stack. We\u2019ll get those other benchmarks tested in the meantime for a fuller look down-the-road. For video encoding, don\u2019t expect any significant gains right now unless you heavily use GPU-accelerated filters.\n\n\n\n\nTechgage Workstation Test System\n\n\nProcessor\nIntel Core i9-10980XE (18-core; 3.0GHz)\n\n\nMotherboard\nASUS ROG STRIX X299-E GAMING\n\n\nMemory\nG.SKILL FlareX (F4-3200C14-8GFX)\n4x8GB; DDR4-3200 14-14-14\n\n\nGraphics\nNVIDIA RTX 3080 (10GB, GeForce 456.16)\nNVIDIA TITAN RTX (24GB, GeForce 452.06)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti (11GB, GeForce 452.06)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER (8GB, GeForce 452.06)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER (8GB, GeForce 452.06)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER (8GB, GeForce 452.06)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (6GB, GeForce 452.06)\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (11GB, GeForce 452.06)\n\n\nAudio\nOnboard\n\n\nStorage\nKingston KC1000 960GB M.2 SSD\n\n\nPower Supply\nCorsair 80 Plus Gold AX1200\n\n\nChassis\nCorsair Carbide 600C Inverted Full-Tower\n\n\nCooling\nNZXT Kraken X62 AIO Liquid Cooler\n\n\nEt cetera\nWindows 10 Pro build 19041.329 (2004)\n\n\nAll product links in this table are affiliated, and help support our work.\n\n\n\nOTOY OctaneRender 2020\n\nOTOY released the latest version of its OctaneBench benchmark a couple of days ago, and like OctaneRender itself, it supports NVIDIA\u2019s latest graphics series. In fact, if you follow OTOY on Twitter, you\u2019ve probably noticed that the company has been really excited for this release. And looking at these results, it\u2019s not hard to see why.\nWhen we wrote our RTX 3080 launch article, we mentioned that it was a \u201c2080 Ti Killer for $700\u201d, but the truth is, this new GPU even has the TITAN RTX in its sights. Versus that, the RTX 3080 is 47% faster, but in comparison to the previously-gen $699 2080 SUPER, it\u2019s 103% faster. It\u2019s 3x faster than the 1080 Ti, released also at $699 a few years ago.\nWith a couple of projects in hand, we also tested the OctaneRender itself, which now has an RTX benchmarking option built-in:\n\n\nThese OctaneRender results paint an even better picture of the RTX 3080 vs. any other card in the lineup. With God Rays, it\u2019s shown to be 58% faster than TITAN RTX, and more than twice as fast as the 2080 SUPER. You could say things are going well so far, so let\u2019s move onto Blender:\nBlender 2.90\n\nWhile we expected huge performance gains with rendering in particular, we were immediately blown away when we saw the result above In Blender and the ubiquitous BMW test. The TITAN RTX just brushed 40 seconds before, whereas the RTX 3080 breaches the 30 seconds mark, comfortably, and without OptiX. With this first project, NVIDIA managed to cut the render time in half between last-gen\u2019s 2080 SUPER and the new RTX 3080.\nCycles rendering absolutely loves OptiX, but Eevee isn\u2019t paying any attention to it right now, so those gains are not quite as impressive:\n\nEven without RTX acceleration, 14% faster for the RTX 3080 over the TITAN RTX is nothing to balk at, especially when that is not even the target GPU. Compared to the 2080 SUPER, the RTX 3080 is 35% faster in Eevee. While we\u2019re testing a single still here, this performance directly scales with animation renders with smaller iteration counts.\nBack to Cycles, where we introduce NVIDIA\u2019s OptiX ray tracing acceleration to the mix:\n\nWhat can be said that isn\u2019t obvious? With CUDA itself, the gains are huge gen-over-gen, and then OptiX improves that further. It\u2019s actually incredible in a way how the $700 RTX 3080 stomps the previous-gen $2,499 TITAN RTX.\n\nWith our viewport test, we\u2019re seeing another healthy gain with the RTX 3080 over the TITAN RTX, or in the most reasonable comparison, a nearly 50% gain over the previous-gen $699 2080 SUPER. We\u2019re going to be posting this and more performance for a dedicated Blender 2.90 article soon, but what we\u2019ll see there is that 1440p and 1080p will require huge models/scenes to show an improvement on top-end GPUs. We have six GPUs in our 1080p test that all perform the same thanks to a CPU bottleneck.\nChaos Group V-Ray 5\n\nWe\u2019ll start our look at the V-Ray results with a GPU and CPU+GPU comparison. As you\u2019d expect (or at least hope for), adding the CPU to a render can help out the end render time quite a bit, but that assumes you\u2019re using a processor that can offer enough cores to be useful (our test PC has 18, although that\u2019s far from necessary for a good workstation.)\nLooking at CUDA only, we see the RTX 3080 performing significantly faster than the TITAN RTX. We can see the last-gen cards slowed their impressive render times down as we moved higher up the stack, but the RTX 3080 effectively sets a new bar. It\u2019s going to be really interesting to see what some of the more budget-oriented Ampere cards will look like.\nLike many of the other renderers here, V-Ray offers an OptiX option, so we also tested that out:\n\nWith these results, we\u2019re seeing more impressive gains on the RTX 3080, with it proving to be 45% faster than the TITAN RTX with OptiX, and 58% faster than 2080 SUPER. The odd OptiX results between the 2070S and 2080S held true after retesting. Both of those GPUs have given us strange results in other tests, and we just have to chalk them up to being the oddities that they are.\nAnother interesting angle to look at these results with is the 1080 Ti using CUDA and RTX 3080 using OptiX. While CUDA alone proves 60% faster than 1080 Ti, OptiX bolsters that gain further. Interestingly, thanks to the beefier CPU in our test PC, only the RTX 3080 delivers a better OptiX result over the heterogeneous test.\n\nWith what we\u2019re sure will be an outgoing benchmark (assuming Chaos Group is going to release a newer version), we see the RTX 3080 continuing to dominate.\nAutodesk Arnold 6\n\n\nAutodesk\u2019s Arnold uses OptiX by default, which means any GPU that has RT cores will automatically have them exercised, leading to some great performance out of the top of the stack. Like a few others in this article, these charts really highlight the improvements seen since the 2080 Ti. In the E-Type render, the RTX 3080 was much quicker than TITAN RTX, and dramatically faster than the 2080 SUPER.\nNot that it\u2019s relevant to this review, per se, but 6GB GPUs don\u2019t seem to fare too well in Arnold, as the RTX 2060 and the Sophie test can attest. The 6GB GeForce 1660 Ti gives us the same issue (this is what\u2019s referred to as an out-of-core problem, where the GPU\u2019s framebuffer is too small for the scene, and can not access system memory to compensate, resulting in a very slow or failed render). As for the 1080 Ti, it\u2019s looking long in the tooth, with the RTX 3080 proving 77% faster in Sophie, and an even more impressive 85% faster in the E-Type render. Or, in other math, the 3080 took just 15% of the time to render Sophie than the 1080 Ti, which was a drool-worthy GPU not too long ago.\nLuxion KeyShot 9\n\n\nIt\u2019s beginning to look like every CUDA/OptiX renderer will see a huge gain on Ampere, isn\u2019t it? KeyShot continues the pattern of the first test earlier, with the RTX 3080 proving 40~50% faster than the 2080S. For an even more impressive match-up: it\u2019s 80% faster than the older Pascal-based 1080 Ti in the Circuit Board render, and 86% faster with the Character render.\nThe gains seen at the top-end are also really impressive, with the RTX 3080 showing cutting the Character render to 3/5ths the total time, vs. 2080 Ti. That 2080 Ti cost $1,199 when it launched in 2018, so the RTX 3080 continues to look seriously strong here.\nMaxon Redshift 3\n\nWith Redshift\u2019s built-in benchmark, we immediately see some nice gains over the TITAN RTX, but not to the same extent as some of the other tests. But, it\u2019s worth remembering that the better comparison is the 2080 SUPER, which has been sufficiently obliterated here.\n\n\nProjects like those used for our manual Redshift tests really highlight the fact that not every project will render the same way (though, coincidentally, KeyShot does give us that impression sometimes.) With the simpler Radio render, the RTX 3080 only proved slightly faster than the TITAN RTX with CUDA, but OptiX bumped that to a much healthier gain, evidence of the much stronger RT core setup in Ampere.\nWith the much more complex Age of Vultures scene, the RTX 3080 improved its performance significantly in both CUDA and OptiX compared to the TITAN RTX. It feels weird to compare this $700 GPU to last-gen\u2019s $2,499 GPU, so if we bring the $699 2080 SUPER into the mix, the RTX 3080 looks to be 40% faster when OptiX is used.\nSept 17 Addendum: Standalone benchmark results added due to popular demand.\nPower & Temperatures\n\n\nOur power testing revealed a few interesting results, primarily because we\u2019ve taken care of both rendering and gaming performance at the same time. The RTX 3080 drew around the same amount of power regardless of whether we were running the render or gaming stress. Interestingly, the Radeon VII used far less power while rendering than we expected (sanity checked, of course), yet it managed to peak with the highest temperature during the same test.\nClearly, the RTX 3080 is power hungry compared to the rest of the stack, but the level of performance gained negates that issue pretty easily. Faster renders also means the power draw won\u2019t be peaked for as long as it would on an older generation card.\nFinal Thoughts\nWhen NVIDIA released its Turing-based graphics cards in late 2018, the addition of dedicated ray tracing and AI cores felt really exciting to us. The only issue at the time was the fact that we had to endure a bit of a wait before software developers augmented their solutions with the RT acceleration. Today, we\u2019re at the point where you can easily trip over a supported solution when roaming around.\nOnce Blender added its OptiX option, we really began to see what could be gained through accelerated ray tracing cores. While OptiX isn\u2019t used in Eevee, it offers major performance advantages in Cycles. Fortunately, even the minor gains seen in Eevee are still appreciated \u2013 we\u2019re still talking about a $699 graphics card that\u2019s faster than last-gen\u2019s 2080 Ti and TITAN RTX.\n\nAs we saw across most of these results, the performance gains seen with the new generation Ampere GeForces is simply incredible. There\u2019s no other way to say it. The strong performance seen because of the RT cores makes AMD\u2019s next move an important one. We\u2019ve already known for ages that the new consoles all use ray tracing, and those are of course built with AMD Radeon GPUs. How that will all carry over to the desktop, we\u2019re not sure, but we will gain a better understanding in late October when AMD makes its RDNA2 \u201cBig Navi\u201d announcement.\nEven in the most modest of cases, the RTX 3080 outperformed the last-gen TITAN RTX by around 10%, and that\u2019s not even the comparison card we should be choosing. That wouldn\u2019t even be the 2080 Ti, which NVIDIA has said the RTX 3080 would easily beat out. The best comparison would be the 2080 SUPER, which also cost $699 ahead of this launch. Compared to that card, the RTX 3080 simply slays. We do not see gains like these come around to GPUs all too often.\nAs mentioned before, the only limitation we can think of with this card on the creator side is the 10GB frame buffer, but we don\u2019t see that being a common complaint anytime soon. For those with the biggest needs, the 24GB frame buffer on the RTX 3090 should solve your quandary. Hopefully NVIDIA has other SKUs planned that will help fill that 10GB~24GB void (of course it does).\nWhile this article took care of the ProViz aspect of the new GeForce RTX 3080, a forthcoming article will take an in-depth look at gaming, which will include a number of new RTX-infused titles.

Unfortunately, some buyers lucky enough to score one of these hotly desired graphics cards have encountered stability issues that result in some games crashing to the desktop. Deeper analysis has led to speculation that the hardware some vendors used for their custom cards could be to blame.\nShould you be worried about the RTX 3080 crashing? Are some graphics cards more unstable than others? It\u2019s complicated, but here\u2019s what you need to know about the GeForce RTX 3080 crashing issues.\n\n\nUpdate:\u00a0We\u2019ve tested Nvidia\u2019s new Game Ready drivers and they fix the crashing issue, albeit by slightly dialing back the maximum GPU Boost clock speed in ultra-fast RTX 3080 models. Read the details in \u201cTested: Nvidia\u2019s new drivers fix RTX 3080 crashes by sacrificing clock speed\u201d and download the new drivers here.\nThe root cause of the crashing remains unknown. Nvidia didn\u2019t specify what stability changes were made in the driver. Our original article below gets into the speculation, and we\u2019ve also added a statement from Nvidia about the POSCAP vs. MLCC debate.\n\n[ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ]\nWhat\u2019s the problem?\nIn the week after the GeForce RTX 3080\u2019s launch, users began reporting that their graphics cards were crashing to the desktop when playing games. Videocardz compiled a list of some of the reports from forums around the Internet. Further testing by affected users seemed to reveal that the crashes happened in some games when their GPU boost clock speeds hit roughly 2GHz or above.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the RTX 3080 crashing problems are not universal, and many people have been able to game without any issues.\n\n\n\nDoes RTX 3080 crashing only affect overclocked graphics cards?\nYes and no\u2014but also not necessarily. (Hey, I said this was complicated.)\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$1,494.68 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3080 and 3090 are rated for boost clock speeds of roughly 1.7GHz, but that\u2019s only part of the story. Nvidia graphics cards have a feature called GPU Boost that lets the core clock speeds increase in 15MHz increments if the card hasn\u2019t hit its power or thermal limits. It\u2019s a wonderful technology that lets your graphics card run faster than advertised if possible to give you extra performance. In practice, for example, we observed Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition running between 1800MHz and 1900MHz during many games.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThat\u2019s comfortably below 2GHz (2000MHz) and while there have been some reports of Nvidia Founders Edition cards crashing, they\u2019re relatively rare. It appears to be a somewhat more common issue with custom cards from Nvidia partners like Zotac and MSI\u2014though again, this is far from a universal problem.\nCustom graphics cards often feature beefed-up cooling solutions and often ship with a factory-applied overclock out of the box. If you\u2019ve got a factory overclocked GeForce RTX 3080 with a capable cooling system, Nvidia\u2019s GPU Boost technology could push your card to 2GHz in some games out of the box, with no manual overclocking required. Some of these cards seem to be the ones affected the most by the RTX 3080 crashing issues.\n\nWhy are some RTX 3080 graphics cards crashing?\nNobody knows for sure. It could be the drivers, it could be poorly \u201cbinned\u201d GPUs, it could be power delivery concerns, or it could be something else entirely. It could also be a mix of several factors.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMSI\u2019s Gaming X Trio includes MLCC\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080 Gaming X Trio 10G\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$750 at  Newegg \n\n\n\n\n\nA technical analysis by Igor Wallossek at Igor\u2019s Lab\u2014a highly respected PC enthusiast site run by the former head of Tom\u2019s Hardware Germany\u2014suggests that the capacitors responsible for filtering voltage on the back of the GPU itself may be partly to blame. Vendors can choose between using larger POSCAPs or SP-CAPs, or groups of smaller \u201cMLCC\u201d capacitors. The MLCC capacitors are more expensive, but better at filtering high-frequency components. Custom RTX 3080 cards that include at least one bank of the MLCC capacitors seem more stable when they approach 2GHz speeds per these early user reports.\nThat\u2019s the gist of the MLCC vs. POSCAP debate you may have seen online. Igor\u2019s analysis is pretty technical, but the JayzTwoCents video below does a good job of breaking it all down in lay terms if you want even more info. \n\n\n \n\n\nConcerns about MLCC vs. POSCAP usage were bolstered by an EVGA statement issued after Igor\u2019s findings. The company\u2019s EVGA GeForce RTX 3080 FTW3 was delayed at the RTX 3080 launch, and product manager Jacob Freeman says that its initial all-POSCAP configuration is the reason why:\n\n\n\u201cDuring our mass production QC testing we discovered a full 6 POSCAPs solution cannot pass the real world applications testing. It took almost a week of R&D effort to find the cause and reduce the POSCAPs to 4 and add 20 MLCC caps prior to shipping production boards, this is why the EVGA GeForce RTX 3080 FTW3 series was delayed at launch. There were no 6 POSCAP production EVGA GeForce RTX 3080 FTW3 boards shipped.\nBut, due to the time crunch, some of the reviewers were sent a pre-production version with 6 POSCAP\u2019s, we are working with those reviewers directly to replace their boards with production versions.\nEVGA GeForce RTX 3080 XC3 series with 5 POSCAPs + 10 MLCC solution is matched with the XC3 spec without issues.\u201d\n\nI have one of those early review samples with six POSCAPs, and will be receiving the new version with MLCC as well. I\u2019ll be testing them soon.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nThe cut-out reveals the capacitors on the back of the MSI RTX 3080 Gaming X Trio.\n\n\nYou can see the capacitors on the rear of the GPU on the fantastic MSI RTX 3080 Gaming X Trio above. The five large black squares are POSCAPs or SP-CAPs; the smaller array of white dots in the middle of the bottom row are MLCC capacitors. Nvidia\u2019s Founders Edition uses two MLCC capacitor arrays, and four POSCAPs.\nTo be clear, it\u2019s not certain the POSCAP capacitors are the issue behind GeForce RTX 3080 crashing. Most available GeForce RTX 3080 variants deploy MLCC capacitors in some form, and some people are seeing crashes even with those cards.\u00a0Update:\u00a0An Nvidia spokesperson told PCWorld the following:\n\n\u201cRegarding partner board designs, our partners regularly customize their designs and we work closely with them in the process. The appropriate number of POSCAP vs. MLCC groupings can vary depending on the design and is not necessarily indicative of quality.\u201d\n\nIt appears that overall power delivery for these power-hungry Ampere GPUs is much more finicky than in prior generations, and the capacitors are just one part of that system. Prior to the launch, Asus warned that old or hard-run power supplies could cause issues with GeForce RTX 30-series GPUs. The company was silent on the topic over the weekend, but its TUF and ROG Strix cards use only MLCC capacitors.\u00a0The ROG Strix RTX 3080 includes LED indicators over its 8-pin power connectors that warn if your power supply isn\u2019t delivering enough clean energy.\n\n Asus\n\nAsus has built a function into its ROG STRIX Ampere cards to sense if the PSU is unable to keep up with loads. It will blink if there is a power sag.\n\n\nPoor chip \u201cbinning\u201d could also play into this. Graphics card vendors often test the GPUs supplied by Nvidia and AMD, then sort them into different \u201cbins\u201d based on quality and performance. Higher-quality GPUs are more efficient and better at overclocking; vendors use these binned chips in their overclocked models.\nIgor claims that Nvidia sent final RTX 3080 drivers to partners like Asus and Zotac very late. As a result, many custom board makers weren\u2019t able to use the drivers to bin the GPUs they received before production. If so\u2014and EVGA\u2019s statement above seems to lend credence to that theory if you read between the lines\u2014the crashes could be occurring because some overclocked RTX 3080 graphics cards include GPUs that simply can\u2019t handle such high frequencies, but didn\u2019t have time to be properly binned. They\u2019d be better used in lower-cost, non-overclocked models that stick closer to reference specifications.\nIt also remains possible that these are simply driver issues, or an issue that could be fixed via driver updates. The Ampere GPUs inside the RTX 30-series graphics cards are a new architecture on a new transistor process node for Nvidia. Graphics cards built on new technology often have driver issues, too. AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 5700 woes may be the most notorious in recent memory, but issues also occurred in the early days of the RTX 20-series.\nTo that point, as I was writing this, Nvidia released Game Ready 456.55 drivers. The high-level overview only boasts of Call of Duty support improvements, but if you dig into the release notes, they say \u201cThe new Game Ready Driver also improves stability in certain games on RTX 30 Series GPUs.\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t had time to test it yet, but if the stability woes really are tied to GPU clock speeds in excess of 2GHz, Nvidia could simply release drivers that make GPU Boost less aggressive at the top end.\u00a0Update:\u00a0After testing, it seems like that\u2019s exactly what Nvidia did, curing RTX 3080 crashing woes by slightly dialing back maximum clock speeds.\nHow can I fix my crashing GeForce RTX 3080?\nIf you were lucky enough to score a GeForce RTX 3080 but unlucky enough to be experiencing these crashes, there are a few things you can attempt besides simply returning the card or asking for a repair.\nFirst, try installing those new Nvidia drivers. If those fix your issues, great!\u00a0Update: After testing, it appears that installing the new drivers could fix crashing problems.\n EVGA\n\nOverclocking tools like EVGA\u2019s Precision X1 can also be used to underclock your GPU slightly, which could potentially fix RTX 3080 crashing issues.\n\n\nIf not, you can try manually lowering your GPU\u2019s performance slightly using a third-party tool like MSI Afterburner or EVGA\u2019s Precision X1. These applications are normally used for overclocking, but you can use them to reduce clock speed as well. Users who have encountered crashing report that dialing back the GPU clocks 30MHz to 100MHz can cause them to stop. Start with a smaller number first, as downclocking your graphics card will slightly reduce peak performance. Undervolting your GeForce RTX 3080 is another option, and one that could potentially improve power efficiency, but it\u2019s more complicated.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping Nvidia and its partners figure this issue out sooner rather than later. The crashing issues aren\u2019t universal, and we\u2019re not sure why they\u2019re happening, but it for-sure sucks to spend $700-plus on a graphics card only for it to be unstable. We\u2019ve reached out to Nvidia for comment and will update this post if the company responds.\nRelated Nvidia RTX 30-series stories:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition review: Staggeringly powerful\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition review: Titan for work, luxury for play\nNvidia GeForce RTX 30-series vs GeForce RTX 20-series: Full spec comparison\nHow Microsoft and Nvidia plan to kill game-loading times on PCs\nNvidia\u2019s $500 GeForce RTX 3070 gets an October 15 release date\nWhy there\u2019s no GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (yet)\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Upgrade Now          Nvidia Buys SoftBank\u2019s Arm in Record $40 Billion Chip Deal    Nvidia Buys SoftBank\u2019s Arm in Record $40 Billion Chip Deal \u00b7 Bloomberg     Ian King   September 15, 2020 6 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   AAPL   -0.64%    GOOGL   -2.39%    QCOM   -0.97%    AVGO   -3.00%     SFTBF   0.00%      (Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. agreed to buy SoftBank Group Corp.\u2019s chip division Arm Ltd. for $40 billion, taking control of some of the most widely used electronics technology in the semiconductor industry\u2019s largest-ever deal.Nvidia will pay $21.5 billion in stock and $12 billion in cash for the U.K.-based chip designer, including a $2 billion payment at signing. SoftBank may receive an additional $5 billion in cash or stock if Arm\u2019s performance meets certain targets, the companies said Sunday in a statement. An additional $1.5 billion will be paid to Arm employees in Nvidia stock.  SoftBank shares surged about 9% on Monday on news of the deal and renewed talks for the company going private. Shares of Nvidia were up 5% at 2:39 p.m. in New York. Read more: SoftBank Soars After Arm Deal, Renewed Talks to Go Private Arm\u2019s importance far outweighs its revenue, which comes from licensing chip fundamentals and selling processor designs. Its technology is at the heart of the more than 1 billion smartphones sold annually. Chips that use its code and its layouts are in everything from factory equipment to home electronics. \u201cIt\u2019s a company with reach that\u2019s just unlike any company in the history of technology,\u201d Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re uniting Nvidia\u2019s leading AI computing with Arm\u2019s vast ecosystem.\u201d The acquisition is fueled by the drive to bring artificial intelligence to everything that has an on-switch, the CEO said. Having succeeded in selling Nvidia\u2019s graphics chips to owners of data centers to speed up image recognition and language processing, Huang is looking to make sure his technology helps spread that to everything from self-driving vehicles to smart meters.\u200b  \u200bThe initial payment from Nvidia marks a small premium over the $31.4 billion that SoftBank paid to acquire Arm in 2016, previously the semiconductor industry\u2019s biggest deal. The Japanese company is expected to own less than 10% of Nvidia following the transaction, according to the statement. Regulatory approvals may well prove challenging. The companies said sign-offs are needed from China, U.K., European Union and U.S. authorities and may take as long as 18 months. China\u2019s approval may be particularly difficult given rising tensions with the U.S. \u200b\u201cNow Arm will become a U.S. firm, and the conflict over semiconductors between the U.S. and China is becoming fierce as China still controls Arm China,\u201d said Koji Hirai, head of M&A advisory firm Kachitas Corp. in Tokyo. In comments after the deal announcement, Huang said his team \u201cfully expect to spend time with the regulatory bodies in China,\u201d but have every confidence in getting approval for the takeover.   Story Continues Another major concern is whether the acquisition will upset Arm\u2019s relationships with customers like Apple Inc. and Intel Corp. The chip designer has been able to work with a broad range of partners in part because it didn\u2019t compete with them.\u201cWe would imagine the bulk of Arm\u2019s current licensees will be (no pun intended) up in arms,\u201d Sanford C. Bernstein analysts including Stacy Rasgon wrote in reaction to the news.Huang said he will preserve Arm\u2019s neutrality and wants to expand its client list. He argued Nvidia is spending a lot of money for the acquisition and has no incentive to do anything that would cause clients to walk away.Nvidia said the U.K. company will \u201ccontinue to operate its open-licensing model while maintaining the global customer neutrality that has been foundational to its success.\u201d Nvidia will add its technology to the offerings licensed by Arm, the Santa Clara, California-based company said.Arm CEO Simon Segars told reporters on a call early Monday that he\u2019d \u201chad dialog with many of our customers as the various rumors swirled around.\u201d He said it was important that ARM is able to maintain its current business model \u201cto continue to serve the licensees who\u2019ve been so loyal to us over the years.\u201dUnder Huang, Nvidia has risen rapidly up the ranks of technology companies in market value and influence. Already the dominant force in graphics chips that make video games more realistic, Nvidia has carved out a slice of the market for data center chips and is moving into self-driving vehicles.Cambridge, U.K.-based Arm has created a successful niche for itself by being independent. Fierce rivals such as Apple, Intel, Samsung Electronics Co., Qualcomm Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. are all licensees. They either use Arm\u2019s designs as the basis of their own chips or license its instruction set, the fundamental code used by processors to communicate with software, for proprietary efforts.Read more: Nvidia-Arm $40 Billion Deal Will Upend Chip Industry: Tae KimThe acquisition by Nvidia, also a licensee, is a challenge to that neutrality. SoftBank\u2019s purchase four years ago went ahead largely uncontested because the Japanese company wasn\u2019t a competitor to any of Arm\u2019s customers.One client that will be directly challenged is Intel. Huang said a priority will be investing in Arm\u2019s efforts to design chips for data-center computing. While he\u2019s carved out a $3 billion niche in the business of supplying Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc. with graphics processors that help with their artificial intelligence workloads, Huang said he wants to speed up the adoption of Arm-based central processors, or CPUs. That\u2019s a lucrative market dominated by Intel, which has about 90% share.Nvidia announced it will keep Arm\u2019s headquarters in the U.K. and will invest in a new facility there to push forward AI research, educate customers and provide a place for experimentation in robotics and automation. Huang said that commitment demonstrates how the acquisition will add to the U.K.\u2019s technology footprint rather than detracting from it.SoftBank\u2019s sale of Arm unwinds another strategic investment in favor of boosting liquidity and enabling founder Masayoshi Son to focus on the more tactical investing he has said he wants to pursue.Nvidia\u2019s Huang runs a company that\u2019s captured the attention of investors like few others in the past decade. Like Son, he\u2019s a charismatic leader espousing a long-term vision of where technology is headed. The Taiwan-born entrepreneur is more engineering-focused than his Japanese counterpart, though, and often publicly delves into the minutiae of semiconductor and computer science.His latest successful recasting of Nvidia\u2019s technology involves the processing of AI work done in data centers. The company\u2019s chips are among the best at breaking up the manipulation of data into small pieces and then executing that in parallel at high speed.Huang will also get a large footprint in the mobile industry and smartphones. A previous attempt by Nvidia to break Qualcomm\u2019s dominance of that business failed. The biggest rival to Qualcomm in smartphone processors is Apple\u2019s internal effort. Those two companies are among Arm\u2019s biggest customers.Even without a presence in mobile, Nvidia\u2019s value has soared in the past decade. It has a market value of just over $300 billion, almost $100 billion more than Intel, the world\u2019s largest chipmaker with seven times the revenue of Nvidia.A spokesperson for SoftBank said the company was advised by Zaoui & Co., Raine Group and Morrison & Foerster. Morgan Stanley and Latham & Watkins advised Nvidia, a filing showed.(Updates shares starting in the third paragraph, add advisers starting in the final paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.

It designs software and semiconductors \u2013 components of electrical circuits that are used to manage the flow of current.It is not just the UK\u2019s largest tech company but a genuine global powerhouse that has, in the space of 30 years, grown into a $40bn (\u00a331bn) business with more than 6,000 employees.What\u2019s so great about it?Its semiconductor chips are the building blocks of a string of consumer favourites. Apple uses them in its iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch products, but you will also find Arm chips in the Playstation Vita and Nintendo DS and Wii gaming devices and Garmin satnavs, as well as Sony Ericsson and Samsung Galaxy phones. Its chips are increasingly used in the rapidly-expanding web of connected devices known as the \u201cinternet of things\u201d.UK tech giant Arm Holdings to be sold to US company Nvidia in $40bn dealRead moreIn short, unless you live off grid, there\u2019s a good chance you have used Arm technology within the last week.What\u2019s different about its business model?The company has been described by its co-founder Hermann Hauser as \u201cthe Switzerland of the semiconductor industry\u201d. It maintains independent relations with hundreds of customers around the world, many of which are rivals.Unlike some other firms in the industry, such as Intel, Arm does not manufacture, sell and ship its own products, preferring instead to license its intellectual property in return for a fee.This allows the British company to work with any chip manufacturer, including Nvidia\u2019s rivals.What is Nvidia?Nvidia is a multinational US-based technology giant, headquartered in Santa Clara, California, but incorporated in the tax-light and secrecy-heavy state of Delaware. Founded three years after Arm, the company invented the graphics processing unit (GPU), which powers interactive graphics on computers and mobile devices, both for video gaming and for professional purposes. It is led by Taiwanese-American Jensen Huang, who is one of the company\u2019s three co-founders.The Nasdaq-listed firm is valued at $338bn, more than twice the valuation of the FTSE 100\u2019s largest company, the pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca.Are there concerns about the deal?The sale of British firms to foreign buyers always raises concerns, particularly when targets are genuinely world-leading in their field. In this case, the horse had already bolted to some extent. The business, previously known as Arm Holdings, was sold to the Japanese asset-hoovering behemoth Softbank for $32bn in 2016. The Conservative government hailed the deal as a vote of confidence in post-Brexit Britain, although it was partly facilitated by the fall in the value of the pound after the referendum, which made Arm cheaper for Softbank.The Japanese investment firm\u2019s sale to Nvidia for $40bn \u2013 for a cool $8bn profit inside four years \u2013 has sparked fresh anxiety about the loss of jobs, intellectual property and British ownership of a strategically important business.Fears have been also been voiced that Nvidia will abandon Arm\u2019s neutral approach and keep new technological advances for itself.Who is worried?Some of the loudest misgivings come from Hauser: \u201cIt is very much in Nvidia\u2019s interest to kill Arm,\u201d Hauser told the Guardian, likening the deal to a sale of Trident, the UK\u2019s nuclear capability.He described the takeover as an \u201cabsolute disaster\u201d which would destroy the company\u2019s business model and lead to job losses at its Cambridge headquarters and elsewhere in the UK.Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said the government should seek \u201clegally binding assurances\u201d from Nvidia that it would not move Arm\u2019s headquarters out of Cambridge.What does Nvidia say?Nvidia boss Huang has sought to allay such fears, promising to keep the Arm brand and expand its Cambridge HQ.ign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk \u201cWe will expand on this great site and build a world-class artificial intelligence research facility, supporting developments in healthcare, life sciences, robotics, self-driving cars and other fields,\u201d he said.Can the government stop the deal?Under the Enterprise Act 2002, ministers can block deals that pose a threat to national security, media plurality and financial stability. Since the pandemic, deals that could threaten the UK\u2019s Covid-19 response have been added to the list, via hastily-drafted legislation.The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, is thought to be considering whether to \u201ccall in\u201d the transaction, triggering a review of its implications by the Competition and Markets Authority. The government would have the final say over any intervention. If Dowden does call in the deal, it is likely to be on national security grounds, given Arm\u2019s role in supplying the defence industry.Explore more on these topicsArmTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedBusinessEconomicsBankingMoneyMarketsProject SyndicateB2BRetailNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But progress, she waits for no-one, and so the new most powerful graphics card in the world is up next on the benchmark block.But the GeForce RTX 3090 is a special class of graphics card. It sports the most powerful GPU in the Ampere family, comes with a vast frame buffer, and an equally large price tag. In fact the green team wants to coin a whole new class all of its very own: the big ferocious GPU, or BFGPU.And it's only called that because, as a PG13 company, Nvidia can't actually be seen to call it a 'big fucking GPU.' But it most certainly is; the RTX 3090 is MASSIVE.\u00a0Unfeasibly so, in fact. It makes my standard MSI Z490 motherboard look like a mini ITX just by its sheer weight of presence. And it's also worth noting it has a not inconsiderable actual weight too, though with a triple slot bracket there is at least some robustness to its mounting. Your PCIe slot could be in for a hammering if you are wont to shift your PC around a lot, however.But in whose PC is this chonk $1,500 graphics card going to find itself? The obvious answer is that the RTX 3090\u2014the fastest graphics card now available to humanity\u2014will be snapped up by the elite PC gamer who just has to have the most powerful GPU they can possibly strap into their machine. We all know the type. They don't care about value, common sense, or the fact that at 1440p you're only getting around 7 percent higher frame rates on average than an Nvidia RTX 3080.You tell them the cheaper Ampere card will absolutely deliver all the gaming performance their QHD gaming monitor can handle and they'll still turn around and tell you they want to drop the entirety of their bank balance on an RTX 3090 because they couldn't handle just having the second fastest graphics card.(Image credit: Future)There is, however, another PC user to whom this monster GPU makes far more sense: the pro-creator. Sure, your big 3D studios and development houses are going to be chock full of Quadro or Tesla GPUs\u2014those professional class Nvidia graphics cards with serious software optimisations and support levels\u2014but there is another class of user that will find a $1,500 GPU eminently worthwhile if it can save them time, pain, and suffering while working on a graphics-intensive job.These people are arguably even more prevalent in our working-from-home times too. The home-working 3D artist, the freelance editor operating out of a shed at the bottom of their garden, for these people time literally is money. And if a consumer GPU can halve their render time, and enable them to work with larger data sets in almost real time, you can bet they're willing to drop serious cash on it, even if they can't drop Quadro cash. Perhaps especially if they can't afford Quadro cash.This is the Ampere generation's Titan. That's how you justify selling a GeForce GPU, with only 11 percent higher 4K gaming performance over its closest sibling, with a 114 percent higher sticker price.\u00a0Specifications(Image credit: Future)Nvidia RTX 3090 SpecsWe've covered the new Nvidia Ampere architecture in depth in our RTX 3080 Founders Edition review. It's a smart architectural design, which constructs the GPU on the triple pillars of a redesigned SM with twice as many FP32 units, 3rd gen Tensor Cores, and smarter 2nd gen RT Cores. The RTX 3090 uses the same architecture, and in fact the same essential GPU, as the RTX 3080.RTX 3090 specsGPU - GA102\nLithography - Samsung 8nm\nDie size - 628.4mm2\nTransistors - 28.3 bn\nCUDA cores - 10,496\nSMs - 82\nRT Cores - 82\nTensor Cores - 328\nGPU Boost clock - 1,695MHz\nMemory bus - 384-bit\nMemory capacity - 24GB GDDR6X\nMemory speed - 19.5Gbps\nMemory bandwidth - 936GB/s\nTGP - 350W\nMSRP - $1,500Its GA102 GPU is more core-rich than the 8,704 core silicon at the heart of the RTX 3080, though still doesn't come with the full complement of CUDA cores available to the complete design. But with the RTX 3090 sporting 10,496 CUDA cores, we can probably forgive Nvidia for keeping those two SMs and 256 cores back in reserve for emergencies.\u00a0Whether we're looking at a comparison against the RTX 2080 Ti, or Titan RTX from the Turing generation\u2014at 4,352 and 4,608 respectively\u2014we're still talking about more than twice the floating point units. Those last-gen cards both used the same GPU, though the $2,000 Titan RTX houses another 256 CUDA cores than the $1,200 2080 Ti, and comes with a full 24GB of GDDR6 vs. 11GB.Which means, on a spec-for-spec basis you're arguably looking at the RTX Titan as the real comparison here. But I'm always up for an argument, and I'd say that at this price point, and given that the 2080 Ti more or less occupied the Titan segment at the initial launch of the 20-series, that makes the Ti card more of a close comparison.There are more RT Cores in the RTX 3090 than in either last-gen GPU, yet fewer Tensor Cores. Those little silicon extras represent Nvidia's AI smarts, and the company figured it could get more performance by dropping fewer into the GPU, but making them work harder.\u00a0There are notably more CUDA cores in the RTX 3090 than in the RTX 3080, but what gives the top 30-series card its real relevance is that huge frame buffer. At 24GB it really is leaning into proper Titan territory. That was the one place the RTX 2080 Ti wasn't really able to shoulder the Titan burden, and where the subsequent Titan RTX golden boi, with its own 24GB worth of GDDR6 VRAM could.(Image credit: Future)The RTX 3090, however, is working with another step up in performance video memory. That 24GB is built on the newer GDDR6X technology, offering much greater throughput, higher speeds, and memory bandwidth of 936GB/s versus the 672GB/s of the Titan RTX or the 616GB/s of the 11GB RTX 2080 Ti.The latest RTX 30-series card is clocked slower, however, with a boost clock of just 1,695MHz. That's still far higher than the RTX 2080 Ti, but a shade off the pace of the Titan RTX.\u00a0But this is where we need to talk about the cooler, because Nvidia's GPUs don't pay a whole lot of attention to the rated Boost clock speed if they have the cooling chops to go further. And that's going to be something to pay attention to when it comes to the third-party versions to follow. In my testing this Founders Edition card peaks at just 70\u00b0C, with an average gaming temperature of 65\u00b0C, and that's what allows the GPU inside to actually average out at 1,787MHz. Sometimes a lot quicker.It's the same innovative offset push-pull design as the RTX 3080, but bigger. Honestly it's like the designer simply hit the multiplier button on the CAD illustration package because it's like the frame has simply been scaled up. It's hilarious seeing them cheek by jowl, because I thought the RTX 3080 looked pretty sizeable until I put the RTX 3090 next to it. But damn, is it effective? It's cool, quiet, and did I mention it was quite intimidating too? I'm going to need a bigger case\u2026Benchmarks and performance(Image credit: Future)Nvidia RTX 3090 benchmarks and performance\u00a0So yeah, here it is: the fastest graphics card\u2026 sorry, I'm getting kinda bored saying that each time a new GPU rolls up. But you know the drill\u2014it's newer, with a chunkier GPU, is more expensive, and therefore faster. The big issue, however, is just how much faster is it than the already spectacularly good RTX 3080?This is every inch the Titan card Jen-Hsun said it would beThat inaugural Ampere GPU\u2014hailed by Jen-Hsun as the flagship card of the new RTX 30-series despite knowing the RTX 3090 was following a week after the initial launch\u2014 already delivers gen-on-gen performance to make the RTX 2080 Ti look like a mid-range GPU. That's no mean feat from a card that's almost half the price.You can see why it's been in such demand post release.And the RTX 3090's own gaming performance only goes to highlight what a stunning new GPU Nvidia has unleashed, and what an uphill battle AMD has got on its hands when it comes to bringing a pair of meaningful RDNA 2, Navi 21 cards to the table in October/November.And why is that? Because it's not actually that much quicker. Certainly not enough to justify that huge sticker price for the average gamer. I did test 1080p performance, because I'm a completist, at least when it comes to benchmarking. But it's irrelevant... honestly if you're using an RTX 3090 to power a 1080p panel you deserve a slap. Sure, I've been running Football Manager 2020 on it, but at least I've been running it at 4K.It's borderline pointless discussing its 1440p performance as well, hell the RTX 3080 itself is almost getting on for being CPU bound at that level in a lot of games, and that partially explains why I've seen just a 7.28 percent performance gain for the RTX 3090 at 1440p averaged across my test suite. At best you're talking 12 percent in Horizon Zero Dawn and the same in Metro Exodus with RTX enabled.Image 1 of 14(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)4K benchmarksWe really just need to be looking at 4K performance, and there it's still not a huge uplift over its slightly older Ampere sibling, at just 11.16 percent faster on average. Again it's Metro Exodus RTX which gives the big win, and only then at 16 percent higher than the RTX 3090.\u00a0Told you, the RTX 3080 really is ****ing great.But Nvidia is also talking about 8K gaming, and that the RTX 3090 can actually deliver playable gaming frame rates, with ray tracing enabled, at that heady resolution. It's niche, I'll give you that, but it's also true. In certain circumstances.Nvidia has created a new DLSS 8K level, or DLSS Ultra Performance. It's a 9x AI super resolution, which essentially upscales a 1440p gameworld to deliver 8K gaming at reasonable frame rates. The promise is that DLSS 8K offers higher image fidelity at upscaled 8K than native 1080p or native 4K images.I don't currently have an 8K panel to test the veracity of that, but I can speak to the actual performance, with a margin of around 3 percent variance owing to faking it with dynamic super resolution (DSR) using the Nvidia driver. Anyways, using the standard DLSS version currently baked into Wolfenstein Youngblood I managed a still pretty healthy 45fps at 8K. Shifting to the new DLSS Uberperformance mode (because of course it is\u2026) the Nazi robot dogs were running at 77fps.Remember 8K is 33 million pixels. Each frame. That's four times the raw pixel processing demands of 4K.Not all games support DLSS Ultra Performance yet, however, not even those which support DLSS (Metro Exodus hit 32fps at 8K while ray tracing). So it's still a little too niche a feature to completely hang a $1,500 purchase on, impressive a start though it is.But really this isn't a card made for the gamer. Yes, PC gamers will buy it, and five-figure system builds from boutique PC manufacturers will sell a bunch I'm sure, but they're almost by-products of Nvidia slapping the GeForce branding on a proper Titan card, and admitting as such.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)Test rigCPU - Intel Core i7 10700K\nMotherboard - MSI MPG Z490 Gaming Carbon WiFi\nRAM - Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro @ 3,200MHz\nCPU cooler - Corsair H100i RGB Pro XT\nPSU - NZXT 850W\nChassis - DimasTech Mini V2\nMonitor - Philips Momentum 558M1RYPro renderingAnd this is where it gets a bit trickier, and I have to go a little off-piste for PC Gamer and into serious rendering territory. I've taken the most recent versions of Maya and Blender for a spin, using the latest updates and RTX rendering plugins, to see what that 24GB of frame buffer will get you.In short, it gets you some speedy render times, access to features that would have otherwise taken an age to deliver, and real-time manipulation of scenes with huge data footprints.\u00a0To be fair, the RTX 3080 already does a lot of that. You can see in the comparative render times that the cheaper Ampere card hoses the RTX 2080 Ti in every test, and again isn't far off the RTX 3090. But those data points don't really speak to the experience of actually trying to manipulate and manage a graphically intense scene in Maya.It's not quite real-time, but if you want to shift depth of field, or focal lengths on an RTX 3080 you're in for an often frustrating time. It can run dry of that 10GB frame buffer surprisingly quickly and start eating into system memory. And that's when it chugs. The RTX 3090, on the other hand, is better able to keep such scenes entirely within the frame buffer, which will save a huge amount of time in the actual creation process, if not the final render.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)Thermals and powerFinally, as you might expect, this 350W TGP card chews on a lot of power to do what it does. Though, that said, in my testing it was only a shade ahead of the lower-spec, third-party Asus TUF Gaming RTX 3080 and Colorful RTX 3080 cards I've put through the wringer.Verdict(Image credit: Future)Nvidia RTX 3090 verdict\u00a0This is a toughie because there are very, very few people who I would recommend the $1,500 RTX 3090 to. And none of them are gamers.\u00a0This is every inch the Titan card Jen-Hsun said it would be. It's a creator's card, one with a stunningly powerful GPU and a frame buffer that allows personal creation on a level not seen on a GPU this side of $6,000. I hesitate to speak to any value proposition here, but for someone with paid 3D art, or high-end video editing gigs in the pipeline, a $1,500 graphics card with this much power inside it could help pay for itself in a relatively short amount of time.I've worked with artists (you know who you are, Paul) who picked up the very first Titan the day it launched because of what it meant for their work. It's not some fictional customer type magicked up by the Nvidia marketing department, the Titan cards really were in demand.(Image credit: Future)On the gaming side, though, the RTX 3090 offers little extra performance over the far more affordable RTX 3080, and I struggle to see why you'd put the money down if all you were aiming to do was hit Night City at 4K. But then I've never been the sort who could justify such wanton excesses of hardware buying just to have the very latest, the very fastest, and hang the financial sense of it.\u00a0Maybe that's why I struggle with the GeForce branding being used for a Titan class card. Keep it a Titan. Keep it ostensibly for the creators, but with a little nod to the ultra-enthusiasts. Again, I know some of those people too, people who are willing to spend what it takes to be at the forefront of gaming, who genuinely would regret their RTX 3080 purchase knowing there was an RTX 3090 out there offering higher frame rates.But Nvidia maintains that by giving it the GeForce moniker it's able to take it out of the exclusive realm the Titan sits in\u2014being sold only in Nvidia trim, from Nvidia's own store\u2014and offer it out to the third-party AIBs to create their own versions. That's fine if it means there are more cards on offer for those who want one, but I can't help but feel we're going to see RTX 3090s sitting dangerously close to the $2,000 mark just for the love of a needless factory overclock. If not more.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)The even more cynical side of me wonders if the benefit of having at least two GeForce GPUs ahead of the incoming red-tinted competition was given more than a passing thought as the decision was being made to not title it a Titan. The AMD Navi 21 cards are expected to be sitting somewhere between the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 after all.And hell, there's probably still an actual Ampere Titan in the post. There's still that full GA102 silicon as an option, but it does call into question the rumours of the 20GB RTX 3080. If that card does find its way out into the wild it's going to make the RTX 3090 an even tougher recommendation when even its VRAM lead is cut.For now though, the RTX 3090 is today's GPU Lamborghini.\u00a0Well, maybe it's more like a 5-door Lamborghini with a really capacious boot. One you could also use moonlighting as a courier, or Uber driver. A practical supercar, for a specific user then.\u00a0Alright, I'm losing this analogy now and likely losing you, but I guess what I'm saying is that this humongous, almost novelty-scale graphics card, is supremely powerful and in some circumstances makes utter, practical sense. It's not worth the money for ninety percent of PC gamers, but is potentially very worth it for today's booming WFH army.Gigabyte Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090: Price Comparison No price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \n\n\n\nThe Verdict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n84\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead our review policy \n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090\n\nThis frankly enormous graphics card is supremely powerful, but is more worthy of its Titan credentials than the GeForce branding.

Indeed, we've already seen what kind of a leap it offers over the existing RTX 2080 and its Super-fied sibling in my Nvidia RTX 3080 vs 2080 showdown, but today I thought I'd take a closer look at how it fares against Nvidia's previous top-end flagship, the RTX 2080 Ti, a card that has always cost at least \u00a31000 / $1000 ever since it came out at the end of 2018. Can the \u00a3649 / $699 RTX 3080 pose any kind of threat to Nvidia's best 4K best graphics card? Let's find out via the medium of some lovely graphs.\n\n\n\nSims 4 Realm Of Magic Review | 8 Best And Worst Features\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nTo test the RTX 3080 and the 2080 Ti, I put them head to head in my general games benchmarking suite, taking an average frame rate from either their own built-in benchmark tools or from my own repeated manual gameplay tests. The games includes Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Total War: Three Kingdoms, Final Fantasy XV, Monster Hunter: World, The Witcher III, Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey, Metro Exodus and Forza Horizon 4.\nFor this particular test, I used the Nvidia Founders Editions of the RTX 2080 Ti and Asus\u2019 TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3080 OC Edition, as these were the cards used in my individual GPU reviews. I've also included my Nvidia Founders Edition RTX 2080 Super results, too, just as a point of comparison. All three cards ran at their default, out of the box clock speeds, so they should be fairly representative of their respective card categories. As for the rest of my PC specs, I tested each card with my trusty Intel Core i5-8600K CPU and 16GB of Corsair Vengeance LED RAM, because these are the standard components in my RPS Test PC. \nI should note that newer, more powerful CPUs will be able to get more out of the RTX 2080 Ti and RTX 3080 at 1080p and 1440p resolutions, but I found that each card's 4K results were pretty much identical regardless of whether I was testing them with my Core i5-8600K or Intel's newer Core i5-10600K (which is pretty much just as fast as the Core i7-9700K, let's not forget). This is because games are still GPU-bound at 4K, making your CPU less important overall. As a result, the key metric we're looking at here - each card's 4K performance - should be broadly what you can expect to see from any modern gaming PC.\nRTX 3080 vs 2080 Ti: 4K benchmarks\nStarting with our 4K Ultra results, you can see the RTX 3080 is already way ahead of the RTX 2080 Ti here, coming out in front in every game going. Some titles provide more of a boost than others, admittedly. Total War: Three Kingdoms is only a fraction smoother on the RTX 3080, as is Assassin's Creed Odyssey, and in both cases you're probably better off knocking the quality setting down a notch if you want a constant 60fps frame rate. \n\nHowever, whereas the RTX 2080 Ti sometimes struggled to play all games at 60fps on max settings, the RTX 3080 really does bump almost everything up to near or over that hallowed 60fps mark (with the exception of Total War, of course). I was particularly impressed with how it handled Shadow Of The Tomb Raider's tough SMAA x4 anti-aliasing setting at this resolution, as this has traditionally crippled Nvidia's previous crop of RTX cards, as evidenced by the 30-40fps frame rates of both the RTX 2080 Super and the 2080 Ti. The RTX 3080, though, can handle it quite comfortably, almost scraping past that all-important 60fps average.\nIt's also much better equipped to deal with Final Fantasy XV's various extra Nvidia settings, too. The results above don't include any of these additional effects, but I was still able to get an average of 59fps with TurfEffects and HairWorks switched on with the RTX 3080 (with lows of 54), which dropped to just 50fps (with lows of 45) on the RTX 2080 Ti. Similarly, I didn't even need to contemplate using Metro Exodus and Monster Hunter: World's DLSS support to get a smooth frame rate with the RTX 3080, as its average frame rates were already lovely and smooth from the outset.\nLet's move on to each card's 4K High benchmarks. I've removed Forza Horizon 4 and The Witcher 3 from this set of results as these were already perfectly playable on Ultra, but as you can see, the RTX 3080 still offers quite the boost over the RTX 2080 Ti here.   \n\nWhile the RTX 2080 Ti is perfectly capable of playing almost all of today's big games at near-60fps speeds on High settings at 4K, the RTX 3080 pushes performance firmly over that 60fps line and well into the 70s and 80s depending on the game. I've used the regular SMAA setting for Shadow Of The Tomb Raider here, just to show it is, in fact, playable at 4K on all three cards here, and how much faster the RTX 3080 is when it's not having to cope with ludicrously demanding anti-aliasing options. \nFinal Fantasy XV also doesn't include any of the extra Nvidia effects here, either, but needless to say, the RTX 3080's extra horsepower here puts it in much better stead for adding in option such as TurfEffects, HairWorks, ShadowLibs and its tough VXAO setting without dipping below that 60fps mark. The same goes for Metro Exodus's ray tracing support, too. Admittedly, both cards still need DLSS switched on to achieve steady frame rates at this resolution with ray tracing enabled, but while the RTX 2080 Ti's average of 53fps with Ultra-fied ray tracing on High is admirable, it's still got nothing on the RTX 3080's 67fps average using the same settings.\nOf course, both the RTX 2080 Ti and RTX 3080 are more than capable of playing games on 4K Medium settings, but I'd thought I'd include benchmarks for the remaining games that didn't quite hit 60fps on High on the RTX 2080 Ti, just so we've got the full picture of how all three cards stack up here. \n\nWith the RTX 3080, you're absolutely flying on Medium, filling up those high refresh rate monitors like nobody's business as you push into the 90s and low 100s. The RTX 2080 Ti does a pretty decent job here with its 70-80-odd frame rates, but once again, the extra headroom you're getting for adding in things like ray tracing and DLSS pales in comparison to what you've got with the RTX 3080.\nRTX 3080 vs 2080 Ti: 1440p benchmarks\nSpeaking of high refresh rate monitors, the RTX 3080 also gives you a decent boost in this department when you're playing on 1440p Ultra settings, too. Again, there are some games here where the boost isn't quite as large as you'd expect, such as Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Total War: Three Kingdoms, but you're still getting a boost of at least 10fps in a lot of cases, if not closer to 20fps - which isn't too shabby, all things considered.\n\nI should note, I haven't included any 1080p results here, because, let's be honest, no one should be buying any of these cards just to play games at 1080p. There are plenty of GPUs that can do that for a fraction of the price of these expensive cards, such as the excellent AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT, and you shouldn\u2019t be spending upwards of \u00a3650 / $700 on a 1080p graphics card. \nRTX 3080 vs 2080 Ti: Conclusion\nSo yes, the conclusion of this RTX 3080 vs 2080 Ti benchmark comparison is much the same as my RTX 3080 vs 2080 vs 2080 Super showdown. Namely, that the RTX 3080 offers quite a substantial leap in performance over Nvidia's previous flagship GPUs, and its lower price of \u00a3649 / $699 compared to the RTX 2080 Ti's \u00a31000 / $1000+ makes it look like extremely good value. \nAt least it does right now, anyway. We still don't know what AMD have up their sleeve with their upcoming Big Navi launch, for example, or how much they will cost by comparison, and we're still awaiting the launch of Nvidia's RTX 3070, too, which also promises RTX 2080 Ti-level speeds for even less than the RTX 3080. The RTX 3080 certainly sets a high bar for the next crop of 4K graphics cards - and will no doubt be a solid choice for anyone looking to play games on max settings at 4K at 60fps - but with so many \"next-gen\" graphics cards still to come at time of writing, I'd strongly advise holding fire on any potential upgrades until we've seen everything that Nvidia and AMD have to offer.\nFor more GPU comparisons check out:\n\nNvidia GTX 1650 vs 1050 Ti\nNvidia GTX 1650 vs 1060\nNvidia GTX 1650 vs AMD RX 570\nNvidia GTX 1660 vs 1060\nNvidia GTX 1660 vs 1660 Super\nNvidia GTX 1660 vs 1660 Ti\nNvidia GTX 1660 Super vs 1060\nNvidia GTX 1660 Super vs 1660 Ti\nNvidia GTX 1660 Ti vs 1060\nNvidia GTX 1660 Ti vs 1070\nNvidia GTX 1660 Ti vs RTX 2060\nNvidia RTX 2060 vs GTX 1060\nNvidia RTX 2060 vs 2060 Super vs AMD RX 5700 vs RX 5700 XT\nNvidia RTX 2070 vs 2070 Super vs AMD RX 5700 XT\nNvidia RTX 2070 Super vs 2080 Super\nNvidia RTX 2080 vs GTX 1080\nNvidia RTX 2080 Ti vs GTX 1080 Ti\nNvidia RTX 3080 vs 2080 vs 2080 Super\nNvidia RTX 3060 Ti vs RTX 3070\nNvidia RTX 3070 vs 3080\nNvidia RTX 3080 vs 2080 Ti\nAMD RX 5600 XT vs RX 5700\nAMD RX 6800 vs RX 6800 XT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nKatharine Castle: Katharine was RPS' editor-in-chief from 2021 to 2024.

A botched launch for both RTX 3080 & RTX 3090 graphics cards was soon followed by user reports where several cards were crashing during gaming. It was soon highlighted that the cause of these issues could be related to the GPUs boosting algorithm but more recent reports suggest that the issue could have more to do with the hardware design that AIB partners have implemented on their custom products. NVIDIA has now come forward with an official statement regarding the matter.\nNVIDIA Officially Responds To GeForce RTX 30 Series Issues: SP-CAP vs MLCC Groupings Vary Depending on Design & Not Indicative of Quality\nThere's more than one part to this story so let's start with what NVIDIA has to officially say on the matter. The statement was given to PCWorld's Senior Editor, Brad Chacos, and is as follows:\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\"Regarding partner board designs, our partners regularly customize their designs and we work closely with them in the process. The appropriate number of SP-CAP vs. MLCC groupings can vary depending on the design and is not necessarily indicative of quality.\"\nvia NVIDIA\nIn the statement, NVIDIA specifically states that their partner cards are based on custom designs and that they work very closely with them during the whole design/test process. NVIDIA does give AIBs reference specs to follow and gives them certain guidelines for designing customized boards. That does include the limits defined for voltages, power, and clock speeds. NVIDIA goes on to state that there's no specific SP-CAP / MLCC grouping that can be defined for all cards since AIB designs vary compared to each other. But NVIDIA also states that the number of SP-CAP / MLCC groupings are also not indicative of quality.\n\nThere have been recent reports suggesting that MLCC is the way to go with AIB cards as they offer the most stable experience but NVIDIA here is saying otherwise. The discussion of SP-CAP /MLCC groupings started when Igor Wallossek from Igor's Lab posted in his technical report that the caps might be a possible reason behind the crashes that users were facing.\nIn our previous report, it was pointed that the GeForce RTX 30 series generally crashed when it hits a certain boost clock above 2.0 GHz. Some users also found out that cards with full SP-CAP layouts (Conductive Polymer Tantalum Solid Capacitors) were generating more issues compared to boards that either use a combination of SP-CAP / MLCCs (Multilayer Ceramic Chip Capacitor) or an entire MLCC design.\nSP-CAP / SP-CAP & MLCC Groupings on Various GeForce RTX 30 AIB Cards (Image Credits: Igor's Lab):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nDifferences Between SP-CAP & MLCC Capacitors:\nThe difference between the SP-CAP & MLCC capacitors is vast and Videocardz has explained it in a simpler way as stated below:\n\n\nThe MLCC is cheap and small, they operate at current ratings, voltages, and temperates, but they are prone to cracking and piezo effects, they also have bad temperature characteristics.\nThe SP-CAP is bigger and has lower voltage ratings and is worse at high frequencies. They are however stronger and not prone to cracking, they also have no piezo effects, SP-CAPs should also operate better at higher temperatures.\n\n\nSince this discovery, there have been statements from various AIBs on the matter. We also have had several AIBs who have told us that they believe that the issue is mostly a hardware flaw that they're rectifying while others believe that it can be solved through a driver fix but that would lead to lower clocks and voltages that could slightly affect the overall performance of the card. However, that remains to be seen. The following are the statements from the AIBs:\nEVGA\nRecently there has been some discussion about the EVGA GeForce RTX 3080 series.\nDuring our mass production QC testing we discovered a full 6 SP-CAPs solution cannot pass the real world applications testing. It took almost a week of R&D effort to find the cause and reduce the SP-CAPs to 4 and add 20 MLCC caps prior to shipping production boards, this is why the EVGA GeForce RTX 3080 FTW3 series was delayed at launch. There were no 6 SP-CAP production EVGA GeForce RTX 3080 FTW3 boards shipped.\nBut, due to the time crunch, some of the reviewers were sent a pre-production version with 6 SP-CAPs, we are working with those reviewers directly to replace their boards with production versions.\nEVGA GeForce RTX 3080 XC3 series with 5 SP-CAPs + 10 MLCC solution is matched with the XC3 spec without issues.\nAlso note that we have updated the product pictures at EVGA.com to reflect the production components that shipped to gamers and enthusiasts since day 1 of product launch. Once you receive the card you can compare for yourself, EVGA stands behind its products!\n\u2014 Jacob Freeman,\u00a0EVGA Forums\nMSI\n\"MSI became aware of reports from customers, reviewers, and system integrators that there may be instability when GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards core clocks exceeded a certain amount. The latest GeForce driver (456.55) includes fixes for the issue. As such, MSI recommends owners of GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards update to the latest driver release which can be downloaded from the\u00a0NVIDIA GeForce website.\nMSI stands behind its design decisions for its GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards catalog which consists of GAMING models and VENTUS models. MSI utilizes a mixed capacitor grouping in its designs to benefit from the strengths of both SP-Caps and MLCCs. All MSI GeForce RTX 30 Series cards that have shipped out since the beginning of production, which include media review samples, feature the PCB configurations as shown in the updated images below.\nMSI would like to express its appreciation to customers, reviewers, and system integrators that raised awareness of the issue, and to NVIDIA for the cooperation in quickly resolving the problem.\nASUS\nAll retail ROG Strix and TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3080 and 3090 graphics cards use only MLCC capacitors for decoupling close to the GPU.\nDuring development, we discovered the improvement this makes to RTX 3090 and 3080 overclocking headroom, so we made specification changes before we started shipping cards to reviewers and customers. Please note that some of the product images used on etail sites and our product pages were from early development samples, so are not final. All images will be updated soon.\nPlease bear with us!\nSource\nGigabyte\n\u201cIn response to the recent reports speculating that the use of POSCAP capacitors on the GeForce RTX 3080/3090 graphics cards could lead to stability issues and crashes, we would like to clarify the issue with the following statement:\nIt is false that POSCAP capacitors independently could cause a hardware crash. Whether a graphics card is stable or not requires a comprehensive evaluation of the overall circuit and power delivery design, not just the difference in capacitor types. POSCAPs and MLCCs have different characteristics and uses, thus it is not true to assert that one capacitor type is better than the other.\n\u201cThe GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 30 graphics cards are designed in accordance with NVIDIA specifications, and have passed all required testing, thus the product quality is guaranteed. GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 3080/3090 GAMING OC and EAGLE OC series graphics cards use high-quality, low-ESR 470uF SP-CAP capacitors, which meet the specifications set by NVIDIA and provide a total capacity of 2820u in terms of GPU core power, higher than the industry\u2019s average. The cost of SP-CAP capacitors is not lower than that of MLCCs. GIGABYTE values product integrity highly and definitely does not reduce costs by using cheap materials.\n\u201cNVIDIA has released a driver (version 456.55) on September 29, 2020 that improves stability. Users are advised to update to the latest driver for optimized performance. For users who encounter power-related issues with GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards, GIGABYTE will provide product replacement, free of charge.\n\u201cGIGABYTE has been constantly improving and optimizing product quality, especially in terms of thermal designs, to provide the best gaming experience to the consumers for decades. For the latest AORUS GeForce RTX 30 graphics card series, we have also paid extra attention to the cooling performance and introduced industry-leading solutions such as MAX-Covered Cooling to ensure that the operation of each component is stable.\nSource\nZOTAC\nRegarding the recent RTX 3080 issue, the investigation is undergoing and we will update you shortly.

Recently, we received the voice of market players\u2019 inquiries. Many players are very concerned about our company\u2019s just released 30 series products. Regarding the specific usage of the capacitors on the back of the chip, we hereby explain the situation:\nAll the RTX 3080 10GB graphics cards released by Gainward currently use 5 SP-CAP capacitors on the back of the chip and 10 MLCC capacitors. The versions currently on the market are all the original commercial versions.\nAll the RTX 3090 graphics cards released by Gainward currently use 4 SP-CAP capacitors on the back of the chip and 20 MLCC capacitors. The versions currently on the market are all the original commercial versions.\nAs a long-term AIC partner of Nvidia, Gainward has always been adhering to the product standard to design and produce completely according to Nvidia\u2019s requirements. Therefore, currently players are concerned about the problem of capacitors and new product failures on the Internet. Currently Gainward has not generated such feedback. .\nIn addition, all Gainward graphics card products support three-year warranty and personal warranty service. Thank you consumers and players for your support and love to Gainward.\nSource\nWere AIBs Constrained By Time & Rushed To Launch Their Custom Designs?\nIn the meantime, MSI and ASUS have started updating their product pages for the GeForce RTX 3090 and GeForce RTX 3080 graphics cards with retail board pictures. Previously, the product pages had pictures from the pre-production models which were still using older designs with a different SP-CAP /MLCC layout. The new ones show an increased number of MLCC caps on the back then before.\nWe know for a fact that several AIBs were finalizing clock speeds even after the GeForce RTX 3080 was announced and clock speeds for RTX 3080 custom variants were revealed just a few weeks prior to launch. So it could be that AIBs didn't get the time they needed to evaluate the clock speeds extensively or even their board designs. The same is true for the GeForce RTX 3090 and GeForce RTX 3070 custom models since their clock speeds have not been finalized yet either.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nFollowing are the GeForce RTX 3080 Gaming X Trio, GeForce RTX 3080 Ventus 3X, and ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3080 pictures from before and after showcasing the updated layouts on the back of the PCB (Image Credits: Videocardz):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nNVIDIA's New Driver Offers A Preliminary Fix While AIBs Evaluate Their Custom Designs With The First NVIDIA Test Drivers\nThere have also been reports that users are facing fewer issues after installing the new GeForce 456.55 drivers compared to the older ones on the same cards. Users have stated that their cards run at lower clock speeds but are more stable and don't spike as often and as high as they were before. So if you were one of the users facing crashes or issues with the cards, you can try out the new drivers. The cards we were running (MSI RTX 3080 / RTX 3090 Gaming X Trio) didn't produce any issues while our tests before and the new drivers hardly impact the clock speeds of the cards.\nSome users have also manually undervolted/underclocked their cards for a more stable experience while gaming. Undervolting is only possible through the MSI Afterburner 4.6.3 BETA 2 utility which can be\u00a0found here for download. It is also advised to users who are facing these issues to reinstall a fresh set of drivers.\nWith that said, AIBs have confirmed to me that they are indeed working with the first test drivers from NVIDIA. The 456.55 release doesn't specifically state any fixes for the issues and only adds in fixes for a certain number of games. NVIDIA might have introduced a preliminary measure to halt the crashes for now but a more fine-tuned approach in the form of a driver is still a couple of days away. We will keep you posted within this article for any more information we get related to the RTX 30 series issues.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n371\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n133\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n72\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n41\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n38\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The company published a white paper in which every card mentioned was written without any specific memory details but the RTX 3080 was written specifically with the 10GB suffix - indicating there are more variants planned and they wanted the whitepaper to be futureproofed for any discrepancies or confusion with the 20GB variant.\nNVIDIA RTX 3080 20GB is in the pipeline - waiting for AMD to make its Big Navi move\nThe RTX 3080 10GB is an amazing card but it has one major caveat: it only has 10GB of vRAM. With titles like MSFS 2020 already out and requiring at least 16GB of vRAM to run comfortably, the low amount of memory on the 3080 will bottleneck it in future titles. This is why, even without any confirmation, we were sure that the company would release a 20 GB variant as well. This seems to have been more or less indirectly confirmed by NVIDIA in their recently released Ampere whitepaper.\n\n\nAn RTX 3080 with 20GB of vRAM would be the perfect graphics card for the next generation of titles. Combined with RTX IO it would allow asset streaming of huge quantities of data and 20 GB of RAM would be sufficient for even demanding killer titles like Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. While we have no concrete date on when the card will be launching/available, we do know this will come in response to AMD's 16GB big navi GPU which is scheduled to be released in late October. This means NVIDIA should be announcing the 3080 20GB card within a few weeks of October 28.\nWe would heavily encourage any prospective buyers to wait for the 20GB variant because unless NVIDIA prices that in a TITAN fashion (which is unlikely considering this is their response to AMD's 6900XT) it will offer much higher value for money and will also represent a card that will not be bottlenecked by any future title - no matter how demanding it might be.\nWhat we know about NVIDIA SKUs so far:\nSince we now know the nomenclature and naming schemes of at least some of the cards, I have taken the liberty to fill them against their respective board numbers.\n\nThe crown jewel of NVIDIA's lineup is the PG132-10 board with 24GB of vRAM. This is the card known as the RTX 3090. It is going to be replacing the RTX 2080 Ti and is currently scheduled to be available in the second half of September.\nWe then have the PG132-20 and PG132-30 boards, both of which are the RTX 3080 20 GB and RTX 3080 10 GB respectively and will be replacing the RTX 2080 SUPER graphics card. The RTX 3080 20 GB with PG132-20 board is going to be available after Navi (late october) while the RTX 3080 10 GB (PG132-30 board) is going to be available in mid-September. It is worth adding here that these three parts are likely the SKU10, 20 and 30 we have been hearing about and the SKU20 is going to be targetted dead center at AMD's Big Navi offering (and hence the staggered launch schedule). Since AMD's Big Navi will *probably* have 16GB worth of vRAM, it also explains why NVIDIA wants to go with 20GB.\nThe PG142-0 and PG142-10 are both going to be replacing the RTX 2070 SUPER and will feature 16GB and 8GB worth of vRAM respectively. While the PG142-10 has a known launch schedule in the second half of September, the PG142-0 board has no confirmed launch date yet.\nFinally, we have the PG190-10 board which is going to be replacing the RTX 2060 SUPER graphics card and will have 8GB of vRAM as well. The launch schedule for this board has not been decided yet either.\n\nNVIDIA Ampere GPUs Partial Specs And Launch Dates\n\n\n\nBoard ID Replacement ClassvRAMBus WidthLaunch Schedule \n\n\n\n\nPG132-102080 Ti 24 GB384 bit2H Sept. \n\n\nPG132-202080 Super20 GB320 bit1H Oct. \n\n\nPG132-302080 Super10 GB320 bitMid.

With access to Arm's IP and the Arm instruction set architecture that underpins Arm-based chips, Nvidia will look to develop its own custom CPUs to fuel an ever broadening push into the data center, AI, big data, autonomous vehicles, supercomputers, and more. \nFollow-up analysis:\u00a0Nvidia purchase of Arm completely resets semiconductor landscape\nNvidia has announced that it has reached an agreement with SoftBank to acquire Arm Limited, in a transaction worth $40 billion financed using common stock and cash. While Nvidia will take possession of Arm and its lucrative IP portfolio, the transaction does not include Arm's IoT Services Group, which will remain with SoftBank.\nThe transaction is expected to be \"immediately accretive to Nvidia's non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP earnings per share.\" Additionally, SoftBank notes it will continue to remain invested in Arm through its shareholder stake in Nvidia, which is expected to come in under 10 percent.\nThere will be several regulatory hurdles to be cleared in the process, and Nvidia notes that the acquisition could take up to 18 months to complete. The deal will require regulatory approval from the U.K., China, the European Union, and the United States.\n\nNvidia has stated that they will remain committed to maintaining Arm's neutrality in licensing its IP. \"Arm's business model is brilliant. We will maintain its open-licensing model and customer neutrality, serving customers in any industry, across the world, and further expand Arm's IP licensing portfolio with Nvidia's world-leading GPU and AI technology,\" said Jensen Huang in a letter to Nvidia employees.\nFurthermore, Nvidia intends to keep Arm based in the U.K., as well as keeping Arm's IP and trademarks registered in the U.K. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\n Arm wants to build its own chips, so it may be poaching from chip-making clients \n\n\n\nNvidia has committed to make substantial future investments in Arm's home base of Cambridge, with plans to expand Arm's research and development presence, as well as building a new Arm-based supercomputer that will be housed at a new AI research center.\nThe new AI research center will also see Nvidia and Arm host research fellowships, AI training, as well as a startup accelerator that will build on Nvidia's Inception program. Nvidia will be hosting a conference call and webcast on Monday, September 14, to further discuss the details of the acquisition.\n\n\n\n\n 23 comments\n \n597 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nChip industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan is Intel's new CEO\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern Digital exits SSD market, shifts focus to hard drives as SanDisk takes over NAND operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

It also designs ICs for mobile computing, automotive, data center and AI applications.Arm, headquartered in Cambridge, UK, provides the RISC (reduced instruction set computer) architecture used in most mobile phone processors, both Android and Apple, as well as designs for system-on-chip (SoC) ICs used in numerous other applications. More ICs have been produced based on designs from Arm than from any other company.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s strategic goal is to combine the two companies\u2019 technologies and dominate the market for artificial intelligence-related computing. \n\n\n\n\nLatest stories\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLimited ceasefire agreed \u2013 at least between the US and Russia \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn Syria, Sunni Muslim militias are killing Alawites and Christians \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nA South Korean conservative identity crisis as political tides shift \n\n\n \nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes that\u00a0\u201cAI is the most powerful technology force of our time\u201d and \u201cIn the years ahead, trillions of computers running AI will create a new internet-of-things that is thousands of times larger than today\u2019s internet-of-people.\u201dThe consideration includes $21.5 billion in NVIDIA common stock, $12 billion in cash, $1.5 billion in equity issued to Arm employees, and up to $5 billion in cash or stock determined by\u00a0\u201can earn-out construct, subject to satisfaction of specific financial performance targets by Arm.\u201dNVIDIA\u2019s press release, issued on Sunday, September 13, notes that\u00a0\u201cNVIDIA will continue Arm\u2019s open-licensing model and customer neutrality and expand Arm\u2019s IP licensing portfolio with NVIDIA technology.\u201d\u00a0This should answer most of the conflict of interest concerns that have been raised.NVIDIA also plans to expand Arm\u2019s R&D activities in Cambridge, UK, through the establishment of an AI research center equipped with supercomputer based on Arm technology. This should calm British politicians who were upset when the Japanese bought Arm and who are upset again now.The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of NVIDIA, SoftBank Group and Arm. Assuming no objections from regulators in the UK, the US, the EU and China, it should be completed in about 18 months.\u00a0Softbank bought Arm for $31 billion in 2016, implying a capital gain of 8% to 24% depending on the earn-out.The gain over four years is modest, but it is a gain and will make a meaningful contribution to the strengthening of Softbank\u2019s balance sheet. On Monday, SoftBank Group\u2019s share price jumped almost 9%.Also depending on the earn-out, Softbank will acquire between 6.7% and 8.1% of NVIDIA, making it one of the company\u2019s top three shareholders. (Vanguard currently owns 7.5% and Fidelity 7.3%.)\u00a0In January 2019, the Vision Fund sold its entire $3.6 billion stake in NVIDIA. Since then, Nvidia\u2019s share price has tripled. That was not the kind of \u201cvision\u201d that investors were looking for.\u00a0 \nSign up for one of our free newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Daily Report\nStart your day right with Asia Times' top stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAT Weekly Report\nA weekly roundup of Asia Times' most-read stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHowever, the press release quotes Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son as saying that\u00a0\u201cNVIDIA is the perfect partner for Arm\u2026 We look forward to supporting the continued success of the combined business.\u201dAn acrimonious dispute between Arm headquarters and Arm China over the alleged\u00a0\u201cirregularities and conflicts of interest\u201d\u00a0of Arm China CEO Allen Wu has apparently been resolved. Chinese investors purchased 51% of Arm China in 2018.But it remains unclear how American ownership will affect Arm\u2019s relations with Chinese customers. Already it has been forced to limit its dealings with Huawei.And it remains to be seen whether or not Chinese regulatory approval of the deal will be contingent upon changes in American policy toward China.\u00a0Scott Foster is an analyst with Lightstream Research, Tokyo. \n\n\n\nSign up here to comment on Asia Times stories\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSign in with Google\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tOr\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSign in to an existing account\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for registering!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn account was already registered with this email.

The temptation is great, if you\u2019re a DIY PC-building enthusiast who is tired of watching your games stutter when you crank them to \u201cUltra\u201d quality settings. Nvidia\u2019s new RTX 30-series graphics cards are beasts. But should you pre-order one? I wouldn\u2019t.I get the temptation, though: Even if Nvidia\u2019s marketing is overselling their capabilities a bit, you\u2019re going to get solid performance for a reasonable price even if you go for the bottom-rung, $499 Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070. This card is allegedly faster than Nvidia\u2019s previous flagship, the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti\u2014a card that cost $1,000, at minimum, at its launch. This all but seals the deal if you\u2019re upgrading from anything older than that, especially if your graphics card starts with the number \u201c10\" or lower. But I\u2019m still going to put on my skeptic\u2019s hat and be that annoying voice of reason: Don\u2019t pre-order a new graphics card.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                What to Do With Your Old Graphics Card if You Upgrade to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 GPU\n            \nRead More\n\n\nBut if I don\u2019t pre-order I won\u2019t get oneI get it. There\u2019s an absolute thirst out there for new graphics cards, because Nvidia hasn\u2019t offered up a new line (microarchitecture, really) since the September 2018 launch of its GeForce RTX 2080. I bet you\u2019re going to see some sellouts come launch day (September 17), which means you might have to wait some time to get your hands on a new 30-series card. That\u2019s OK.First, we still don\u2019t have hands-on, confirmed benchmarks of what these 30-series cards can do. Good on Nvidia for doing a lot of the initial work and throwing out some pretty charts to show how these new graphics cards stomp previous models. (They\u2019re going to make a lot of recent upgraders upset, especially those who recently overpaid for top-of-the-line 20-series cards.)\u00a0But Nvidia\u2019s figures are PR, not real-world performance-testing.You owe it to yourself to wait for everyone else\u2014journalists and YouTubers alike\u2014to put these graphics cards through their paces. Not only will this give you the best possible indication of how these cards perform in regular conditions, but you\u2019ll learn a lot about the nuances that those simpler \u201c200% faster!\u201d charts don\u2019t get into. For example, will CPU bottlenecking impact your ability to hit high frame rates no matter how good your graphics card is? How much extra power will these cards draw when you\u2019re playing your favorite games maxed-out? Will these graphics cards will turn into miniature space heaters or jet engines when you\u2019re gaming? Will these cards boost your frame rates to a noticeable degree in the games you love most, at the resolution and quality settings you typically play? (Hint: You probably don\u2019t need a $1,500 graphics card to play Fortnite).Will the 30-series see sales sooner than later?The launch of the GeForce 30-series cards comes at a delightful time. It\u2019s September; pandemic-September, sure, but still September. That means that those big ol\u2019 shopping days toward the end of November are oh-so-near. While you probably won\u2019t see amazing cash deals for, say, Nvidia\u2019s $1,500 GeForce 3090, you might at least be able to buy the graphics card and get some freebies\u2014games, extra months to try a subscription service, a discount on other gear you might need (such as a new power supply), and so on.I\u2019m not one to say \u201cwait for two months to save $50,\u201d because that seems a bit silly, but given just how close we are to some major geeky sales events, it\u2019s worth holding out for a little time if you haven\u2019t fully convinced yourself to buy a new 30-series graphics card on launch day. And you might also see some more-aggressive-than-usual pricing because of...\n\n\n\n\n\n                Unlock Nvidia's New App to Kill Annoying Background Noise\n            \nRead More\n\n\nDon\u2019t call AMD a comeback, it\u2019s been here for yearsBig Navi. We won\u2019t see AMD announce its counteroffer to Nvidia\u2019s 30-series graphics cards until October 28, which means we have no idea what kind of performance to expect, nor how AMD is planning to counter Nvidia\u2019s already-aggressive pricing for its 30-series graphics cards. But with these being AMD\u2019s first major graphics cards to (finally) support ray tracing, you can expect some healthier-than-normal competition.What does that mean? Even if you\u2019re an Nvidia loyalist, I wouldn\u2019t buy a 30-series graphics card until I\u2019ve at least seen what AMD is prepping. If AMD\u2019s offers are compelling enough, maybe Nvidia will have to do a little scrambling (or price-dropping) to stay enticing. Who knows, perhaps AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 6000-series GPUs might actually come out on top\u2014possibly for performance and price. If so, you\u2019d be a sucker to blow $1,500 on Nvidia\u2019s top-shelf card right now if something better can be had after a mere month\u2019s wait.Simply put, the latest graphics card generational battle hasn\u2019t even kicked off yet. There\u2019s no reason to upgrade immediately; if you\u2019ve held out this long to upgrade, you can handle a few extra weeks. It\u2019s the smarter move.\n\n\n\nThe power move: pre-order anyway, but...I wrote this article, and even I\u2019m still contemplating a pre-order for a 30-series graphics card because I don\u2019t want to be stuck waiting for months if there are inventory issues. If I haven\u2019t been able to convince you to not pre-order a new card, I take no offense; however, I do suggest that you place your pre-order at a retailer that has a great return policy (and no restocking fee).Nvidia? Amazon? B&H? You\u2019re good to go, assuming you have an unopened graphics card. Newegg? No.Buy your new Nvidia graphics card if you must, but sit on it for as long as you possibly can without using it. You still might not know about AMD\u2019s announcements unless we see some leaks prior to October 28, so I\u2019d try to place your 30-series order as close to the end of September as possible. Of course, now you\u2019re playing everyone\u2019s favorite graphics card guessing game: How long can you hold out before the cards go out of stock at wherever you\u2019re trying to purchase them? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get a sense of the demand once Nvidia\u2019s new cards launch, which should hopefully help you figure out whether it\u2019s worth waiting or pulling the trigger sooner than later. No matter what, consider the power of a good return policy, and you might be able to get a better deal later\u2014or a better graphics card entirely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Murphy\n\n\n\nRead David's full bio\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore by David\n\n\n\n\n\nEvil Week: How to Hide Porn on Your Windows PC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        October 30, 2023\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware\n\n\nHow to Buy a Burner Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        September 11, 2023\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\n                See More\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\nTake These Steps Now to Protect Your Data From Medusa Ransomware\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        March 18, 2025\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\nWhat People Are Getting Wrong This Week: Secret Tunnels Under Gene Hackman's House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        March 18, 2025\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputing\n\n\nGIMP 3's New Features Make the Best Free Image Editor Even Better\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        March 18, 2025\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        February 20, 2025\n    \n\u00a0\n                    \nHow to Get Your Hands on One of Nvidia's New Graphics Cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        February 10, 2025\n    \n\u00a0\n                    \nI Tested Nvidia\u2019s AI Tool for Making Your Webcam Better, and Oof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        January 15, 2025\n    \n\u00a0\n                    \nThe Apple Watch Series 9 Just Hit Its Lowest Price Ever\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        May 21, 2024\n    \n\u00a0\n                    \nBest Buy Will Give You a Free TV When You Preorder a Microsoft Surface Device\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

To say it was challenging launch would be an understatement. Nvidia had near-exclusivity to sell the 3080 Founder's Edition through its own Nvidia storefront. It sold out instantly, with many believing that bot-driven scalpers claimed the entirety of Nvidia's available cards. Nvidia has now acknowledged issues with the 3080's launch, issuing an apology. \n\"We apologize to our customers for this morning's experience,\" reads a message posted in Nvidia's official forums. In its summary of this morning's 3080 graphics card launch, Nvidia describes demand as \"unprecedented.\" That goes for the launch on Nvidia's own store, as well as on retailer websites across the world. Nvidia doesn't clarify whether its apology is just for Nvidia store shoppers or for all potential 3080 buyers, but it can be assumed to be all-encompassing.\nRELATED:\u00a0Nvidia Drops Hint About RTX 3080 With 20 GB Memory\nWith regards to the specific issues that Nvidia's own storefront experienced, Nvidia doesn't go into detail. It does acknowledge \"an error\" that was encountered when traffic hit. What this error was isn't clear, but Nvidia says that it was resolved and that \"sales began registering normally\" afterward. In other words, Nvidia believes that its 3080 sales were normal. This runs contrary to the belief of many PC enthusiasts who tried to purchase a new card Thursday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for whether bots or scalpers were involved, Nvidia again has an ambiguous response. Nvidia says that it's doing \"everything humanly possible\" to stop bots and scalpers. Nvidia is even going so far as to manually review orders. But Nvidia does not say whether it believes there was a massive bot or scalper presence in this morning's orders, leaving PC enthusiasts to their theories.\nIn other words, while Nvidia did apologize for the situation, it doesn't clarify exactly what it's apologizing for and it doesn't offer any solutions regarding why a similar situation won't happen again. As far as apologies go, it's not the best. But at the very least, it acknowledges that people are frustrated. The 3080s are just that popular, which Nvidia is probably quite happy about.\nWhat's next for PC gaming enthusiasts is up in the air.\u00a0Amazon still hasn't opened up availability of its entire 3080 stock, so that's one option. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 card, which retails for $1,499, launches on September 24. That will be followed by the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 in October. In other words, PC gaming enthusiasts will have other options for upgrades in the weeks and months ahead, as well as some restocks of the 3080. If all goes to plan, everyone will hopefully have the card of their choice by the time Cyberpunk 2077 launches in November. But given the state of things, that might be a pipe dream.\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is now available, as stock allows.\nMORE:\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077 is the Perfect Game for the Nvidia RTX 3080 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming News\n\n\n\n\nPC Gaming\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHow to Get A Ranged Weapon for Yasuke in Assassin's Creed Shadows\n\t\t\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows\n\nDiscover how to quickly find a ranged weapon for Yasuke in Assassin's Creed Shadows. \n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nChristopher Norman Worcester\n\n\n1 hour ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS Plus Premium Subscribers Now Have 12 New Games to Play\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nJ Brodie Shirey\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tEA Sports College Football 25 Is Down to Just $10, Grab It While You Can\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nJeff Scott\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHow to Unlock More Resolve Upgrades and Slots in Reignbreaker\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nMuhit Rahman\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t'We Haven\u2019t Heard Anything Since May' Bad News For Horror Fans As An Upcoming Franchise Sequel Stalls Out\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nJoshua Newby\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tReignbreaker: Best Resolve Upgrades to Unlock Early\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nMuhit Rahman\n\n\n54 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSave $300 on Samsung's 55-inch QLED 4K TV, Hitting Record-Low Price of Under $500 on Amazon\n\t\t\n\n\nGame Deals\n\nGet a Samsung 55-inch Q60D QLED TV on Amazon for under $500, bringing premium visuals and smart features at a low price.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAssassin's Creed Shadows: How to Get Knowledge Points Fast\n\t\t\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows\n\nYou'll need a lot of Knowledge Points early in Assassin's Creed Shadows.

During the presentation, Jensen claimed the GeForce RTX 3080 would offer double the performance of its predecessor, with better efficiency, and it would feature leading-edge technology throughout its design, from its chip packaging, to its PCB, a new cooling solution, and its GDDR6X memory.\n\nAfter the unveiling and subsequent follow-up briefings, we were obviously eager to get our hands on the GeForce RTX 3080. So, after a brief unboxing and tour when it arrived, we installed it in our test rig and dug right in. On the pages ahead, we\u2019ve got a plethora of data share regarding Ampere, the GeForce RTX 3080, and a bunch of competitors up and down NVIDIA\u2019s and AMD\u2019s stack. And we use the term \u201ccompetitors\u201d loosely here \u2013 when you see the numbers, you\u2019ll realize the GeForce RTX 3080 doesn\u2019t have any competition, for now at least.\n\r\nHere\u2019s that quick tour of the GeForce RTX 3080 if you\u2019re the sort that digs video over the written word. However, as attractive as the card might be, the real beauty lies in the benchmarks in our opinion. We better stop jawing and get down to business...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\n\n\nSpecifications & Features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind The GeForce RTX 3080 @ Amazon.Com\n\r\nAbove is a detailed spec comparison between the new Ampere-based GeForce RTX 3080 and its Turing-based predecessors, the GeForce RTX 2080 and 2080 Super. Before we dig in though, we suggest checking out a few previous articles to lay the foundation for the product we\u2019ll be covering here today. Perusing our coverage of NVIDIA\u2019s initial GeForce RTX 30 series announcement and the deeper dive on its new features and Ampere architecture would be ideal. If you ain\u2019t got time for that though, we\u2019ll summarize much of Ampere\u2019s new mojo again here.\n\nGeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 2080 Super\n\n\r\nAs you can see in the table above, the GeForce RTX 3080 is bigger and beefier than the RTX 2080 / 2080 Super in almost every way, except for two \u2013 the RTX 3080 has fewer Tensor cores and a lower default boost clock. The GPUs additional resources are more than enough to compensate for the lower default boost clock, however, and Ampere\u2019s Tensor cores offer more than double the throughput, and support additional types of math. In terms of fillrate, memory bandwidth, and compute performance the GeForce RTX 3080 is significantly more powerful.\n\n\nGA102 Block Diagram, With Magnified SM\n\r\nThe GA102 GPU at the heart of the GeForce RTX 3080 is packing a 28 billion transistors in its 628.4mm2 die and it is manufactured on a custom, Samsung 8nm process (8N). The previous-gen Turing TA102 powering the RTX 2080 used a 12nm FinFET process and packed fewer than half the number of transistors. \n\r\nAll of those additional transistors were used to enhance Ampere\u2019s performance for essentially every type of workload you can run on GPUs. Previous-gen architectures, before Turing, had only one datapath, for example. With Turing, NVIDIA did add a second math datapath -- one for floating point and, one for integer. But with Ampere, that second Integer path has been further augmented with an additional FP32 unit, so floating point heavy workloads have significantly more resources available.\n\r\nThe 2nd Generation RT cores have been optimized for better performance as well. The 68 RT cores in the GeForce RTX 3080 (up from 48 in the 2080 Super) offer shader performance of up to 29.8 TFLOPS (vs. 11.2 on Turing), RT-TFLOPS of up to 58 (versus 34 RT-TFLOPS in Turing), and the Tensor cores offer up to 238 TFLOPS of Int8, versus 89.\n\n\n\r\nThe Streaming Multiprocessors in Ampere have also been tweaked. The new Ampere SMs double the L1 bandwidth and cache partition size and add 33% more L1 capacity, up to 8,704KB. In addition, Ampere\u2019s second-generation RT (ray tracing) cores can process triangle intersection rates at twice the speed of Turing and its third-gen Tensor cores double up math performance for sparse matrices (a matrix in which most of the elements are zero), and support many more math types and precision levels.\n\n\n\r\nWhile analyzing Turing\u2019s performance characteristics, NVIDIA found that it often had good Bounding Box intersection rates, but Triangle Intersection rates were holding things back. With Ampere, NVIDIA wanted to be able to process Bounding Box and Triangle intersection rates in parallel. So, Ampere breaks out Bounding Box and Triangle resources to run in parallel, and along with the additional GPU resources available, Triangle Intersection rates end up being about twice as fast. A new Triangle Position Interpolation unit has also been added to Ampere to help produce more accurate motion blur effects.\n\n\r\nThe top-end Ampere-based GeForce RTX 3080 and upcoming GeForce RTX 3090 also feature Micron\u2019s bleeding-edge GDDR6X memory (the 3070 coming next month uses standard DDR6), which offers significantly higher bandwidth. GDDR6X uses new 4-level PAM4 signaling that can transmit twice as much data per clock, effectively doubling bandwidth. High-end Ampere-based GeForces will used GDDR6X memory at up to 19Gbps. On the GeForce RTX 3080, which features a 320-bit memory interface, that means the GPU has up to 760GB/s of bandwidth at its disposal versus 496GB/s on the RTX 2080 Super.\n\r\nYou\u2019ll notice we haven\u2019t talked about SLI or multi-GPU much with Ampere. And that\u2019s because only the GeForce RTX 3090 supports it. The GA102 GPU has a newer 3rd Gen NVLink interface, which includes four x4 links, each providing up to 14.0625GB/sec of bi-directional bandwidth, for a total of 56.25GB/sec of bi-directional bandwidth or 112.5 GB/sec total aggregate bandwidth between two GPUs. Two GeForce RTX 3090s can be linked for operation in SLI, but 3-Way and 4-Way SLI configurations are not supported.\n\n\n\r\nAmpere also features a native PCIe Gen 4 interface and some new video decoding capabilities. The GA102 sports the same 7th Gen NVENC encoding engine as Turing, but has a newer 5th Gen NVDEC engine. NVIDIA\u2019s 5th Gen decoder supports hardware-accelerated decoding of the MPEG-2, VC-1, H.264 (AVCHD), H.265 (HEVC), VP8, VP9, and AV1 codecs. That AV1 support is brand new and makes Ampere the first GPU to support AV1 decoding in shipping hardware.\n\r\nWith such a big, powerful, complex chip, NVIDIA made some major modification in an attempt to increase power efficiency as well. With previous-gen architectures, NVIDIA had one common power rail for both the GPU cores and memory controller. A single-rail design meant that if the cores waned to run at high voltage, the memory had to as well. That changes with Ampere, however. With Ampere NVIDIA has split the core and memory power rails into separate domains, so they can operate independently. The dual power rails should allow for more energy conservation, which ultimately means improved power and thermal characteristics.\n\r\nTo help ensure the thermal part of the efficiency story is a good one, NVIDIA engineered an interesting cooling solution for its GeForce RTX 30 series cards. The cooler on the GeForce RTX 3080 features dual axial fans, and a split heatsink design that is quieter that previous-gen solutions, while offering the ability to dissipate up to 90 more watts of power. One end of the heatsink array sits directly atop a vapor chamber, that affixed to the GPU and memory. The fan above that section directs air through the heatsink and immediately funnels it out of the chassis through large vents in the case bracket. The heatsink on the back half of the card, however, which is linked to the front vapor chamber via heat-pipes allows air from the second fan to pass all the way through, where it is rises to the top of the chassis and is eventually exhausted, assuming the system\u2019s case has adequate ventilation.\n\n\n\n\nThe Mini 12-Pin Connector and Included Adapter\n\r\nThe new push/pull, passthrough cooler on the GeForce RTX 3080 works in conjunction with a denser PCB design that has a unique V-shaped rear edge. NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 3080 also features a miniaturized 12-pin power connector, though most partner boards we have seen use the traditional PCIe connectors common today. NVIDIA includes an adapter with its RTX 3080 that converts a pair of 8-pin PCIe connectors to the new mini-12-pin design, and we're told PSU manufacturers will be offering modular cables with the new connector as well.\n\r\nIn terms of outputs, the GeForce RTX 3080 has triple full-sized DisplayPorts and a single HDMI output. The USB-C connector on high-end Turing cards, which was meant to facilitate connection to VR headsets, wasn't being used often so NVIDIA nixed it. We should note that that is an HDMI 2.1 port, however. HDMI 2.1 support enables 4K120P with G-Sync on some of the latest OLED TVs and allows for 8K over a single cable.\nEven More Features Coming With the RTX 30 Series\r\nThe GeForce RTX 30 series also support a new feature called RTX IO. RTX IO minimizes CPU overhead when processing data from a fast SSDs, and reduce workloads that used to require multiple CPU cores down to a single core, freeing up resources to work on other things. With the latest PCIe Gen 4 SSDs capable of ~7GB/s transfers, transferring data to and from the drives and compressing/decompressing it can require a significant amount of CPU horsepower. RTX IO interfaces with the upcoming DirectStorage API coming to DirectX to overcome this potential bottleneck, by leveraging GPU core resources for the compression and decompression and stream data directly to the GPU memory.\n\n\r\nWe should note, however, that to use RTX IO and DirectStorage, games will have to be designed to support the feature, and there are no games available at this time. Considering similar technology is coming to both next-gen consoles, however, it\u2019s a safe bet game developers will be jumping all over this one now that something similar will be available on the PC as well.\n\r\nNVIDIA also announced NVIDIA Reflex during the GeForce RTX 30 series reveal. NVIDIA Reflex is latency reduction technology that\u2019s designed to optimize end-to-end latency, often referred to as input lag or input latency. NVIDIA Reflex streamlines multiple steps along the rendering pipeline to more efficiently make use of CPU and GPU resources, minimize driver overhead, and according to NVIDIA, reduce latency by up to 50%. NVIDIA Reflex Low-Latency Mode is currently being integrated into some esports games, like Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Warzone, Fortnite and Valorant, but others will likely be coming.\n\r\nNVIDIA Broadcast is coming to RTX GPUs as well. NVIDIA Broadcast is a plug-in that leverages the GPU and AI to enhance audio and video quality, and offer things like noise reduction, camera tracking and virtual backgrounds. NVIDIA Broadcast should be available to download soon and is compatible with any RTX-enabled GPU, both Turing and Ampere.\r\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, GeForce, Gaming, graphics, GPU, ampere, rtx 3080\n\n\n\nRelated content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Review: BFGPU Benchmarks Unleashed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung SSD 980 Pro Review: Blazing Fast PCIe 4.0 Storage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalit GeForce RTX 3080 GamingPro OC Review: Big, Custom Ampere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Review: Ampere Is A Gaming Monster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTONOR Q9 USB Microphone Kit Review: Affordable, Quality Audio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT STUFF IN PC COMPONENTS\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Review: BFGPU...\nSamsung SSD 980 Pro Review: Blazing Fast...\nPalit GeForce RTX 3080 GamingPro OC...\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Review: Ampere...\nTONOR Q9 USB Microphone Kit Review:...\nNVIDIA Reviewer Toolkit: Preparing For...\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30-Series: Under The...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEEP INFORMED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSITE\n\nHome\n\n\nReviews\n\n\nNews\n\n\nBlogs\n\nFull Site\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nPC Components\n\n\nSystems\n\n\nMobile\n\n\nIT Infrastructure\n\n\nLeisure\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nCOMPANY\n\nAbout\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nNews Tips\n\n\nContact\n\n\nPrivacy And Terms\n\n\nHotTech\n\n\n\nMORE\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nShop\n\n\n\nSTAY CONNECTED\n\nTwitter\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            As an Amazon and Howl Technologies Associate, HotHardware earns a commission from qualifying purchases made on this site.

According to NVIDIA, the GeForce RTX 3090 is designed specifically for gaming at ultra-high resolutions such as 8K and also delivers the fastest graphics performance in professional applications making it a top of the line prosumer-class product.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Is 10-15% Faster Than The GeForce RTX 3080 On Average in 4K Gaming - Designed As A Prosumer-Class Product, Expect Limited Availability on Launch\nIn their GeForce blog, NVIDIA states that the GeForce RTX 3090 is termed as \"BFGPU\" because it's not just a traditional gaming-oriented graphics card. Since its unveiling, the GeForce RTX 3090 has been seen as a Titan replacement which is evident from its specifications and market positioning.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nAccording to NVIDIA, the GeForce RTX 3090 will appeal to the most demanding users and that's not just gamers but also professionals and content creators who will use the massive horsepower the card has to offer to power data science, AI research and also supplement its rendering prowess to render next-generation cinematics and movies. As for gaming, the GeForce RTX 3090 is stated to be the first 8K-capable graphics card. Sure there have been cards before that were able to run games at 8K before but the GeForce RTX 3090 can actually deliver a playable frame-rate at the resolution in several titles.\nFor 4K gaming, the GeForce RTX 3090 is about 10-15% faster on average than the GeForce RTX 3080, and up to 50% faster than the TITAN RTX. via NVIDIA\nIn terms of standard performance, the RTX 3090 will be around 10-15% faster than the GeForce RTX 3080 on average and up to 50% faster than the Titan RTX graphics card. NVIDIA has shared a chart that shows the GeForce RTX 3090 ending up almost close to 2x faster than the Titan RTX in professional applications such as Luxmark, Blender, and Red Shift.\n\nFinally, NVIDIA has stated in advance that the GeForce RTX 3090 will be available in very limited quantities at launch and that they are working with their partners to increase the supply in the weeks to come. The card will have several custom variants available at launch but the quantities would be lower and we can expect a repeat of what happened during the GeForce RTX 3080's launch day.\nSince we built GeForce RTX 3090 for a unique group of users, like the TITAN RTX before it, we want to apologise upfront that this will be in limited supply on launch day. We know this is frustrating, and we\u2019re working with our partners to increase the supply in the weeks to come. via NVIDIA\nMeanwhile, NVIDIA gave a certain few TechTubers the chance to showcase the gaming potential of the card early-on. Videos from LinusTechTips and MKBHD were posted yesterday which were fully sponsored by NVIDIA to showcase how the card performs in 8K using an LG's Signature ZX 88 inch TV. You can see the videos below:\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Graphics Card Specifications\nThe RTX 3090 features some insane specifications such as 82 SM units which results in a total of 10496 CUDA cores. In addition to the CUDA cores, the card also comes packed with next-gen RT (Ray-Tracing) cores, Tensor cores, and brand new SM or streaming multi-processor units. The card has a base clock of 1400 MHz and a boost clock of 1700 MHz with a TDP of 350W.\n\nIn terms of memory, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 comes packed with 24 GB of memory and that too the next-generation GDDR6X design. With Micron's latest and greatest graphics memory dies, the RTX 3090 can deliver GDDR6X memory speeds of 19.5 Gbps. That along with a bus interface of 384-bit will deliver a cumulative bandwidth of 936 Gbps.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere' Graphics Card Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA106-300Ampere GA104-200Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie SizeTBC395.2mm2395.2mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBC17.4 Billion17.4 Billion28 Billion28 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores358448645888870410496\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs112 / 64152 / 80184 / 96272 / 96328 / 112\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores112 / 28152 / 38184 / 46272 / 68328 / 82\n\n\nBase Clock1320 MHz1410 MHz1500 MHz1440 MHz1400 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock1780 MHz1665 MHz1730 MHz1710 MHz1700 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute13 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs30 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPs25 TFLOPs32 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs58 TFLOPs69 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPs101 TOPs192 TOPs163 TOPs238 TOPs285 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity12 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR610 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus192-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed16 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth384 Gbps448 Gbps448 Gbps760 Gbps936 Gbps\n\n\nTGP170W175W220W320W350W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$329 US$399 US$499 US$699 US$1499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)25th February 20212nd December 202029th October 202017th September 202024th September 2020\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series Graphics Cards Price & Availability\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 will be launching to consumers on the 24th of September, 2020, or tomorrow.

Nvidia\u2019s beastly new GeForce RTX 30-series graphics cards just slammed the final nail into SLI\u2019s coffin. Well, almost.\nA glaring fact jumped out at me while I was sifting through Nvidia\u2019s product pages for our GeForce RTX 30-series vs. RTX 20-series spec comparison: Only the monstrous $1,500 GeForce RTX 3090 includes support for NVLink, the proprietary connector that enables SLI mult-GPU configurations. Even the $800 GeForce RTX 3080 lacks it, and Nvidia calls that graphics card the 30-series flagship. (The RTX 3090 is a \u201cBFGPU\u201d above and beyond the rest.) Given that\u00a0Nvidia controls 80 percent of the graphics card market, it\u00a0seems clear that the days of slapping multiple graphics cards into your PC to boost frame rates is effectively over.\u00a0\n\n\nUpdate:\u00a0Not even the RTX 3090 will support SLI. On September 17, Nvidia announced it \u201cwill no longer be adding new SLI driver profiles on RTX 20 Series and earlier GPUs starting on January 1st, 2021,\u201d and RTX 30-series GPUs will not receive SLI profiles at all. Games that use DirectX 12 or Vulkan multi-GPU implementations will continue to work, but those are very few and far between. \u201cExisting SLI driver profiles will continue to be tested and maintained for SLI-ready RTX 20 Series and earlier GPUs,\u201d the company says, and SLI will continue to work for creative and professional apps. \nOur original story continues below.\u00a0\n\nThat said, it\u2019s been effectively over for a while. Nvidia reduced SLI support to just two graphics cards during the GTX 10-series generation four long years ago. Rival\u00a0AMD phased out CrossFire multi-GPU support for its Radeon GPUs soon after. But even that reduced support has stuttered in recent years, as graphics cards became powerful enough to drive 1440p and 4K displays by their lonesome.\n Nvidia\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3080 lacks SLI connectors.\n\n\nMaking matters worse, multi-GPU support has become increasingly wonky in games themselves over the years. Such setups were always a niche consisting of deep-pocketed enthusiasts, making it hard for developers to justify supporting SLI. SLI also slowly lost its reason for being, first because many games tied physics to frame rates, and inevitably because of the rise of ultra-powerful GPUs. Even if you invested in an SLI setup, it flat-out wouldn\u2019t work in many of today\u2019s games. In the ones that did support it, it didn\u2019t work well\u2014technically implementing it was always a nightmare for devs.\u00a0Game developers can\u00a0use DirectX 12 to implement multi-GPU without a connector, but it\u2019s telling that virtually none of them have.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve warned would-be buyers off multi-GPU configurations for years now. Nvidia just sealed the deal.\nWell, almost, like I said. The GeForce RTX 3090 still supports it, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s the only card that still needs it to meet its intended use. Nvidia\u2019s pitching this beast as the first-ever 8K-capable graphics card, and that\u2019s with the company\u2019s fantastic DLSS 2.0 technology enabled. Not many games support DLSS yet, and even the ones that do could still use more help to hit smooth frame rates at such a ludicrous resolution. If you thought pushing pixels at 4K resolution was rough, check out these Nvidia performance metrics at 8K:\n Nvidia\n\nAn Nvidia-supplied chart showing the GeForce RTX 3090\u2019s performance at 8K resolution\n\n\nAn NVLink connection can also help with compute and content creation workloads for this pricey Titan-in-all-but-name.\nSo yeah, SLI isn\u2019t technically dead, but it\u2019s effectively dead for all but the top 0.1 percent of us. If you\u2019ve got $3,000 to drop on a pair of RTX 3090s, by all means feel free to lord it over your geeky pals. Just don\u2019t expect developers to spend much time making sure it works great in your games.\u00a0\n\nFarewell, SLI.

The presentation itself was a bit light on hard technical details, but the new GeForce RTX 30-series landing page on Nvidia\u2019s website followed up with much more in-depth information.\nHere\u2019s every hard spec that Nvidia has released so far for the $1,500 GeForce RTX 3090, $700 GeForce RTX 3080, and $500 GeForce RTX 3070. It\u2019s not a complete picture, but it reveals a lot. Of particular note, these GPUs pack in\u00a0far more CUDA cores than their predecessors, pushing the counts way beyond even what the loftiest rumors suggested. Even the RTX 3070 packs significantly more CUDA cores than the prior generation\u2019s\u00a0GeForce RTX 2080 Ti flagship.\n\nThese cards could be beasts in both ray tracing and traditional gaming, folks.\n Nvidia\n\nAn Nvidia-supplied comparison of how the GeForce RTX 30-series GPUs compare against the RTX 20-series in a variety of games.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve listed details on all the individual \u201cAmpere\u201d GPU-based cards below, and compiled it all in the following chart for quick comparison versus their \u201cTuring\u201d GPU-based GeForce RTX 20-series predecessors. All physical characteristics, including power needs and display connectors, refer to Nvidia\u2019s own Founders Edition version of the respective cards.\n\n\n\nCheck out our coverage of the GeForce RTX 30-series reveal for deeper insight into what some of the specifications mean, as the cards introduce cutting-edge GDDR6X memory, next-gen RT and tensor cores, and a whole lot more.\nGeForce RTX 30-series vs GeForce RTX 20-series: Full spec comparison\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nA comparison of the GeForce RTX 30-series vs RTX 20-series specifications.

Although it's not actually called a Titan \u2013 we guess RTX Titan was already taken \u2013 RTX 3090 works for us and perhaps more importantly, when compared to many of the previous Titan-class products, we feel the 3090 is more significant.\nThe RTX 3090 is similar to the Maxwell Titan X as it packs more VRAM and more cores than the next fastest GeForce GPU. In this case, it features 21% more CUDA cores than the RTX 3080 and more than twice as much VRAM with an insane 24GB of GDDR6X memory, and of course a titanic $1500 price tag.\n\nNvidia was quick to point out that gamers shouldn't expect something that's going to compete strongly in terms of cost per frame with the RTX 3090. This is a product for those who simply want the best, a no-compromise type solution. Nvidia also noted they were surprised by just how much demand there was for such a product on previous iterations. That demand came from content creators as well as gamers seeking the ultimate performance and those all important bragging rights.\nThat is the RTX 3090 in a nutshell, if you can afford it and want the best out there. The only potential use case where we'd say the 3090 is required is for those who can take advantage of the massive 24 GB VRAM buffer, which could be highly beneficial for animation and 3D modeling tools like Autodesk Maya or Blender, or video editors working with 8K raw footage.\n\n\nIf you fall into one of those categories and know your software can take full advantage of the fast and ample memory capacity, the RTX 3090 is going to be exceptionally good value. Typically though, when we review GPUs we mostly dedicate to the enthusiast and gamer crowd, and today's review won't be any different.\nThe focus of this review will be on the RTX 3090 GPU, not Nvidia's Founders Edition graphics card. But because this thing is so insane, we'll give you a few quick stats: it measures 313mm long, stands 124mm tall, and is 52mm thick \u2013 it's a beast in terms of dimensions and does take up three expansion slots. But the most impressive stat is its weight, this thing tips the scales at 2125 grams (4.7 pounds), making it the heaviest graphics card we've ever seen.\n\n\n\nPulling and pushing air through the maze of heatsinks are two 110mm fans and like the RTX 3080 FE model, air is exhausted all over the place and we'll look at thermal performance later in the review. Then around at the I/O panel we get the same configuration as the RTX 3080: one HDMI 2.1 port and three DisplayPort 1.4a outputs. It's a seriously impressive graphics card and the best design Nvidia has produced by a country mile.\nIn addition to our usual battery of gaming benchmarks, we'll briefly touch on Blender performance. Anticipating this is not a value-seeking graphics card, we won't weight our conclusions too heavily on things like cost per frame, though it will remain part of our analysis. Spoiler alert: games don't require 24 GB of VRAM yet.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nGeForce RTX 3090\nGeForce RTX 3080\nGeForce RTX 2080 Ti\n\n\nPrice\n$1500\n$700\n$1200\n\n\nRelease Date\nSeptember 2020\nSeptember 2020\nSeptember 2018\n\n\nProcess\nSamsung 8N\nTSMC12FFN\n\n\nTransistors (billion)\n28\n18.6\n\n\nDie Size (mm2)\n628.4\n754\n\n\nCore Config\n10496 / 328 / 112\n8704 / 272 / 96\n4352 / 272 / 88\n\n\nCore Clock Frequency\n1400 / 1700 MHz\n1440 / 1710 MHz\n1350 / 1545 MHz\n\n\nMemory Capacity\n24 GB\n10 GB\n11 GB\n\n\nMemory Speed\n19.5 Gbps\n19 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Type\nGDDR6X\nGDDR6\n\n\nBus Type / Bandwidth\n384-bit / 935.8 GB/s\n320-bit / 760 GB/s\n352-bit / 616 GB/s\n\n\nTGP\n320 watt\n320 watt\n250 watt\n\n\n\nHere's a side-by-side spec comparison with the RTX 3080. Both GPUs are based on the same GA102 die, the 3080 is just a cutdown version. As mentioned earlier the 3090 packs 21% more CUDA cores as well as 21% more texture mapping units, but just 17% more render output units or ROPs. In terms of core clock speeds both are similar, but the 3090 receives slightly faster GDDR6X memory hitting 19.5 Gbps and when paired with the 384-bit wide memory bus is good for 935.8 GB/s of memory bandwidth, so a 23% increase over the 3080.\n\nBased on those figures you'd expect the RTX 3090 will at most be ~17% faster than the 3080 in games, but due to the way these architectures typically scale, in most games the gains are probably going to be less than that, making the RTX 3080 the more attractive graphics card for a majority of high-end gamers.\nFor testing we're using a Ryzen 9 3950X system, featuring four sticks of low latency DDR4-3200 memory operating in a dual-channel, dual-rank configuration. The focus will be on 4K gaming results, though we'll also include 1440p benchmark data as well.\nBenchmarks\nStarting with Death Stranding we see that the 1440p results are very underwhelming, though we could be a little CPU limited here. Even when increasing the resolution to 4K, which sees the GPU become the primary system bottleneck, the RTX 3090 is a mere 6% faster than the 3080, taking the average frame rate from 107 fps to 113 fps. We weren't expecting a ton, but we've got to say this is a discouraging result.\n\n\nNext up we have Horizon Zero Dawn and we're again looking at weak performance gains at 1440p, just a 7% jump over the RTX 3080...\n\n\nAt 4K resolution the only performance limiting component is the graphics card and despite that the RTX 3090 is just 8% faster than the 3080, taking the average frame rate from 73 fps to 79 fps. We do see a healthy 18% boost to the 1% low performance, but even that is underwhelming for this comparison.\n\n\nRainbow Six Siege sees a 10% boost at 1440p which takes us from 327 fps with the RTX 3080 to 360 fps with the RTX 3090, not amazing but it is a double-digit gain.\nThe 4K results are more impressive with a 15% performance uplift and we can tell you straight away this is the biggest margin we saw in the 14 games we tested, so... we will avoid repeating ourselves with another 11 titles and simply sum it all up in one larger graph.\nPerformance Summary\nHere's our 14 game average for all the 1080p, 1440p and 4K benchmark data we gathered. We'll also check out power consumption, cost per frame, and the margins seen in individual titles. Oh, and then a quick look at the Blender render performance.\n\n\nStarting with 1080p performance, we're looking at a modest 5% uplift over the RTX 3080 and a 21% increase over the RTX 2080 Ti, the only two relevant GPUs for this comparison. At 1440p the margin over the RTX 3080 grows to 8% and there's a 32% jump over the 2080 Ti. So spending 114% more on the RTX 3090 is going to be a pretty tough sell for an 8% increase at 1440p gaming, but then who are we kidding. Those with deep enough pockets won't hesitate to snap up that price to performance ratio.\n\nFinally, for those gaming at 4K, the RTX 3090 offers on average 11% more performance over the RTX 3080. If you're coming from an RTX 2080 Ti, that's a very respectable 45% increase in performance for a 25% increase in price.\n\nThe RTX 3090 FE doesn't consume much more power than the RTX 3080, at least when measuring the entire system consumption from the wall. We're still shy of 600 watts, so a decent 750 W unit will have you more than covered, at least without overclocking.\n\nUsing the Nvidia PCAT tool we see that the RTX 3090 consumes just 6% more power than the 3080 which is surprising, though it was only 11% faster in this test. Still, not a bad result and it explains why the RTX 3090 FE card runs so cool which we'll look at in a moment, but first here is a look at performance per watt.\n\nBased on these figures, the RTX 3090 is actually better than the 3080 in terms of performance per watt, no doubt this is due to a binning process that sees the best silicon reserved for the 3090. In terms of efficiency, the 3090 is surprisingly good.\n\nThe \"cool\" thing about the massive RTX 3090 Founders Edition are the cool operating temperatures. Well, that and the fact that it is virtually silent. After an hour of gaming the fans spun at just over 1000 RPM where they were quieter than the other fans in our test system and therefore couldn't be heard. Despite that, the GPU peaked at just 66C and maintained an average clock speed of 1830 MHz. Very impressive stuff and a strong case for that massive heatsink.\n\n\nHere's a look at cost per frame, which isn't overly relevant for a product like the GeForce RTX 3090, but since we have the data, why not share it. No surprises here, the RTX 3090 is not a good value proposition for gamers, but it's also amusing to see that despite costing $1500, it's far better value than the RTX 2080 Ti.\nFurthermore, at 4K the RTX 3090 is considerably better value than the RTX 2080 Ti and it's not much worse than parts released last year like the Radeon VII, for example. It's also crazy to see that in modern games it gets close to the GTX 1080, a GPU that was class-leading for its time.\nPerformance per Game\nRTX 3090 vs RTX 3080\n\nHere's a look at the percentage gains offered by the RTX 3090 over the 3080 in all the titles tested, starting with the 1440p data. As you can see at best it was 16% faster in World War Z, but typically we're looking at high single digit gains.\n\nAt 4K we're not CPU limited in any of the tests. A 5.3 GHz 10700K for example, provides the exact same frame rates in all titles tested with the RTX 3090. The 3090 was 10% faster on average with the biggest margin seen in World War Z again, where the 3090 was 18% faster.\nRTX 3090 vs RTX 2080 Ti\n\nFor those hoping to upgrade from a 2080 Ti, the peak gain we observed was a 44% performance improvement in Resident Evil 3. Typically though you are looking at about a 30% performance uplift, which is about what the 2080 Ti offered over the 1080 Ti for a 70% increase in price.\n\nThe margins are even better at 4K and now the RTX 3090 is up to 58% faster than the 2080 Ti.\n\nWe typically don't test GPU productivity performance in any of our reviews, but we went ahead and quickly tested a few GPUs in Blender. Here we can see that the Radeon VII was comparable to the RTX 2080 Ti in this application and that made it a great value option, though it wasn't that much faster than the vanilla 2080.\n\nThe RTX 3080 is a little over twice as fast as the Radeon VII in this test, boosting performance by 108%, or if you go the other way it reduced the render time by 52%.\n\nWe see that the RTX 3090 is 18% faster than the 3080 in Blender, which is in line with our best case gaming performance margin. Unless your workload requires more than 10 GB of VRAM, you're just much better off with the RTX 3080 in terms of value. As we said earlier, it's a simple equation for those running productivity tasks: if your workload requires a lot more than 10 GB of VRAM, the 3090 could be a godsend, if not, it's kind of pointless.\nBottom Line\nThe GeForce RTX 3090 is not nearly as exciting as last week's RTX 3080 release, but as soon as Jensen said this was a Titan class product, we knew what we were in for. If you're a PC gamer, the RTX 3090 doesn't really make much sense. The massive 24GB VRAM buffer has no appeal here, and despite Nvidia's best efforts, 8K gaming just isn't a thing, hell even 4K is still niche.\nWe did try out 8K gaming and it was impressive seeing 60 fps in Doom Eternal. It was also possible to average 60 fps in Control with the help of DLSS, rendering at 1440p, but then this is not true 8K gaming. Without DLSS, Control ran at 5 fps, so it's a bit stretch claiming 8K gaming given for the most part you will require DLSS support for it to happen. Doom Eternal did work well, it looks great, and we saw VRAM usage hit 16GB \u2013 actual usage, not just allocation.\n\nEither way, we doubt gamers are keen for that 60 Hz 8K experience just yet. With most gamers targeting 1440p 144Hz, the RTX 3090 has little to offer over the 3080. This is also true when using a heavily overclocked Intel processor. Likewise, productivity tasks won't take full advantage of the RTX 3090 unless you can utilize that extra memory. If you do need 24 GB of VRAM, then the RTX 3090 is awesome. Previously you were looking at having to spend $2500 on a Titan RTX for the same memory capacity.\nLastly, the GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition model is truly outstanding and is probably going to be one of the best RTX 3090 graphics cards, if not the best.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 on Amazon\nIntel Core i9-10900K on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 9 3950X on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 9 3900X on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 94\n\n\n Got something to say?

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nWith clients spanning nearly every major technology company, and 180 billion chips shipped to-date, Arm is one of the most important semiconductor design companies in the world. It already licenses its technology out to Nvidia, but also to Apple, Qualcomm, and many more, and is used in nearly every smartphone, smart device, and TV. Today, as Nvidia announces its deal to purchase Arm (often listed as ARM or arm, for various reasons) for $40bn, the company's future is more interesting than ever.At $40bn, Nvidia's acquisition of Arm will be the company's largest to date. Nvidia's past purchases include 3dfx, AGEIA, and, most notably, Mellanox Technologies, a datacentre networking technology company for $6.9bn, at the time its largest purchase by some margin. The Arm deal easily surpasses that figure, and is evident of not only Nvidia's looser purse strings but also its incredible value.Nvidia recently surged to become more valuable than Intel, and is now worth $326bn. Intel, on the other hand, has not hit that $300bn market cap (the sum of all outstanding shares at current value) for some time, and currently sits at $210bn. It's a significant achievement for CEO and founder Jen-Hsun Huang's company, and perhaps goes some way to explaining why it can afford a purchase as lavish as Arm, the gem in the so-called Silicon Fen's (the cluster of tech businesses surrounding Cambridge, UK) crown.What is Arm and what does it do?Arm is a British semiconductor and software design company. That means that, while some companies manufacture chips, such as Intel or TSMC, which also have foundries (known commonly as fabs), Arm does not. It's like AMD or Nvidia in the fact that it designs its chips for another company to actually build, but unlike AMD and Nvidia it does not sell them directly in a way us gamers would be familiar with. Instead, Arm licenses out its intellectual property (IP) for a fee to other companies for use in their products.Hence why a company like Apple can claim to be henceforth designing its own processors for use in its laptops and phones, all the while relying on Arm architectures. Apple pays Arm for an architectural license, in this case 64-bit ARM, and builds out its own secretive chip from there.Arm does also work on its own technologies, for a sort-of direct sale. However, these are most often semi-custom designs that make use of Arm's IP, such as the Armv8-A Architecture, in a standardised CPU design, such as the Cortex A78. The brunt of actually manufacturing and selling these products still falls on whoever is licensing the chip.As part of Nvidia, Arm will continue to operate its open-licensing model, while maintaining the global customer neutrality that has been foundational to its successNvidiaWhat Arm is able to offer companies is a way to ensure compatibility across a wide range of devices and systems, with a constant instruction set, all without having to own that ecosystem outright. This is in direct contrast to Intel and the x86 instruction set (who licenses it to very few others, namely AMD), and who then also has complete control over the ecosystem and who can use it.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Another such instruction set architecture (ISA) is RISC-V (pronounced risk-five, and standing for Reduced Instruction Set Computing), which is an open-source license for all to use. Occupying some of the same space as ARM (also a RISC architecture) RISC-V also attempts to do away with closed ecosystems to an even greater extent\u2014but that's a story for another day.And for those of you wondering: arm or Arm tends to denote the semiconductor design company, while ARM tends to stand for the ISA or IP itself. Most of the time. Sometimes.(Image credit: Arm)Why was Arm up for grabs?Arm Ltd. was founded in 1990, and while it has maintained autonomy for the better part of that period, in 2016 a sale was agreed between Arm's shareholders and Japanese super-holding company Softbank for the grand total of $32bn.Softbank's purchase of the company was record-breaking at the time\u2014it was one of the largest for the UK, Japan, and the chip making business as a whole.Softbank also has a history with Nvidia, although not an altogether happy one. It was, at one time, one of Nvidia's largest shareholders with some $3.6bn in shares (relative to Nvidia's January 2019 share price, which was then around ~$150). These were a part of Softbank's grand $100bn technology Vision Fund.\u00a0Following the cryptocurrency crash, which saw Nvidia inadvertently flood the market with its own Pascal 10-series graphics cards, losing a heap of crypto-income in the process, and lose lost nearly half of its value\u2014Softbank then sold off its entire stake.Nvidia's next-gen graphics cards(Image credit: Nvidia)The Nvidia Ampere generation is nearly upon us\u2014here's everything you need to know about the RTX 3090, RTX 3080, and RTX 3070.That quarter, by Nvidia's own admission, was \"a real punch in the gut\". Yet it wasn't to remain in the dumps for long, and by the summer it had already started to gain value. By February 2020, Nvidia had regained all of the value it initially lost from that cryptocurrency crash, and it now sits at easily double that once again at around $514.On the other hand, Arm had hardly grown in value during that same period. Despite continued success serving chip designs, Softbank was reportedly looking to sell its majority stake in Arm\u2014from $32bn in 2016, it would find a suitor in Nvidia for just $40bn. Just $2bn in growth for every year it was under Softbank's control.Putting that into perspective, in 2016 Nvidia was valued, at its peak, at around $50bn, which is not that dissimilar to Arm's value when it was first purchased by Softbank. Now Nvidia is worth over $300bn and is purchasing Arm for just $40bn.Softbank will retain just under a 10 percent stake in Arm following the closure of the deal, which is expected to go through one year from now, in September 2021.Note the italicisation of just in reference to these billion dollar sums\u2014it's important to recognise the ludicrous and engorged quantities of cash in discussion here.(Image credit: Nvidia)What does Nvidia gain by purchasing Arm?Nvidia licenses Arm for many of its products, most notably its system-on-chip (SoC) platforms from which it builds Tegra systems, such as those found in some self-driving cars and the Nintendo Switch.An astounding 180 billion computers have been built with Arm \u2014 22 billion last year alone. Arm has become the most popular CPU in the worldJen-Hsun Huang, Nvidia CEOBut perhaps autonomy for a handful of use-cases is not the endgame for Nvidia's recent acquisition at all. No, it's more likely a consolidation of Nvidia's ability to offer the complete stack for a wide range of uses. It now offers GPUs, networking, and potentially CPUs\u2014Jen-Hsun Huang holds all the cards and would then be almost beholden to no-one.Huang's vision is to create the \"world's premier computing company for the age of AI\". It will do so by incorporating its own technology with Arm's to develop new AI technologies, including a new AI research centre in Cambridge, fit with \"state-of-the-art AI supercomputer powered by Arm CPUs.\"It's not quite vertical integration for Nvidia\u2014that is to say it owns the entire supply chain. But with Intel struggling with its own supply chain and manufacturing, fabless companies, such as Nvidia, appear to be thriving by comparison.What does Arm's future look like under Nvidia?One big question surrounding Nvidia's purchase of Arm, and one which wasn't present with Softbank's ownership, is whether Nvidia can continue to license Arm technology fairly and equally. Arm is successful due to its ability to license to anyone, and those licensees can be confident they're not getting the short end of the stick. With Nvidia at the helm, many of the GPU makers rivals will be wondering if Arm's impartiality and independence is as a safe bet as it once was.To try and ease concerns, Nvidia's own statement on its purchase of Arm outlines its plans to maintain customer neutrality.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: the top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest graphics card: your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: get into the game ahead of the rest\"As part of Nvidia, Arm will continue to operate its open-licensing model, while maintaining the global customer neutrality that has been foundational to its success, with 180 billion chips shipped to-date by its licensees. Arm partners will also benefit from both companies\u2019 offerings, including Nvidia\u2019s numerous innovations.\"The debate on customer neutrality will likely continue for some time too. Nvidia and Arm's deal has to be approved by the UK, China, the European Union, and the United States before going ahead. There's some precedent for a bit of a bumpy road too, as Nvidia's Mellanox deal took a little longer to get through than expected due to pushback from China, so watch this space. Nvidia at least has a year to get all its paperwork in order.At least one thing is for sure, and that's Arm's continued existence within the UK. Nvidia has stated that it intends to build up Arm's presence in its original location, Cambridge, and that it will use its investment to attract further researchers and engineers to the site. It also intends to continue to register Arm's IP within the UK.For a few, however, Nvidia's promises to keep the business in the UK are not enough to stem the losses from the initial sale of the UK company to the Santa Clara, California-based company. Arm co-founder, Hermann Hauser, has been critical of the deal, as has the opposition UK Labour Party, and science and technology workers' union Prospect.\u00a0Hauser went as far as to call the deal a disaster.\u201cIt\u2019s the last European technology company with global relevance and it\u2019s being sold to the Americans,\u201d Hauser said in an interview with Reuters.The UK government has so far announced ministers had spoken with both Arm and Nvidia in an effort to discover what the deal meant for Arm and its Cambridge headquarters. CEO Huang said talks with the UK government were yet to begin in earnest.(Image credit: Nvidia)What does Nvidia buying Arm mean for gaming?The short answer: not much. At least not right now.\u00a0Nvidia's CEO outlined Nvidia's plan to dominate the datacentre and shift away from gaming GPUs recently, and the company's acquisition of Arm is far more inclined to deliver that dream than serve another generation in the GeForce product lineup.However, it's not entirely without some possible new arrivals in the gaming space. Nvidia would be free to integrate greater Arm capabilities alongside its gaming GPUs within SoCs, which could lead to possible improvements to systems bearing a resemblance to the Nintendo Switch.An Nvidia Shield Switch with an Ampere GPU and a heterogeneous big.LITTLE hybrid Arm architecture? That's a match made in heaven. If perhaps a little bit of wishful thinking on my part.Arm and GeForce are likely to remain fairly discrete areas of Nvidia's business. Perhaps we'll feel the impact of Arm's purchase in the overall budget Nvidia sees fit to spend on its gaming segment, especially R&D budget as Nvidia appears to be hopeful of tacking its GPUs under license to Arm's big budget clients. But that potential fiscal injection is only likely to happen once the dust settles, the coin purse strings draw close, and Arm starts making good on its investment.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

While training as a surgeon, Abramoff often saw patients with diabetic retinopathy, or DR, that had progressed too far to be treated effectively, leading to permanent vision loss.\nWith the mission of increasing access to and quality of DR diagnosis, as well as decreasing its cost, Abramoff and his team have created an AI-based solution.\nThe company\u2019s product, IDx-DR, takes images of the back of the eye, analyzes them and provides a diagnosis within minutes \u2014 referring the patient to a specialist for treatment if a more than mild case is detected.\n\nThe system is optimized on NVIDIA GPUs and its deep learning pipeline was built using the NVIDIA cuDNN library for high-performance GPU-accelerated operations. Training occurs using Amazon EC2 P3 instances featuring NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs and is based on images of DR cases confirmed by retinal specialists.\nIDx-DR enables diagnostic tests to be completed in easily accessible settings like drugstores or primary care providers\u2019 offices, rather than only at ophthalmology clinics, said John Bertrand, CEO at Digital Diagnostics.\n\u201cMoving care to locations the patient is already visiting improves access and avoids extra visits that overwhelm specialty physician schedules,\u201d he said. \u201cPatients avoid an extra copay and don\u2019t have to take time off work for a second appointment.\u201d\nAutonomous, Not Just Assistive\n\u201cThere are lots of good AI products specifically created to assist physicians and increase the detection rate of finding an abnormality,\u201d said Bertrand. \u201cBut to allow physicians to practice to the top of their license, and reduce the costs of these low complexity tests, you need to use autonomous AI,\u201d he said.\nIDx-DR is the first FDA-cleared autonomous AI system \u2014 meaning that while the FDA has cleared many AI-based applications, IDx-DR was the first that doesn\u2019t require physician oversight.\nClinical trials using IDx-DR consisted of machine operators who didn\u2019t have prior experience taking retinal photographs, simulating the way the product would be used in the real world, according to Bertrand.\n\u201cAnyone with a high school diploma can perform the exam,\u201d he said.\nThe platform has been deployed in more than 20 sites across the U.S., including Blessing Health System, in Illinois, where family medicine doctor Tim Beth said, \u201cDigital Diagnostics has done well in developing an algorithm that can detect the possibility of early disease. We would be missing patients if we didn\u2019t use IDx-DR.\u201d\nIn addition to DR, Digital Diagnostics has created prototypes for products that diagnose glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. The company is also looking to provide solutions for healthcare issues beyond eye-related conditions, including those related to the skin, nose and throat.\nStay up to date with the latest healthcare news from NVIDIA.\nDigital Diagnostics is a Premier member of NVIDIA Inception, a program that supports AI startups with go-to-market support, expertise and technology.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | GPU | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | Machine Learning | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Dubbed the \"BFGPU\" of the new Nvidia Ampere family (that's a reference to Doom's BFG, in case you're wondering), the RTX 3090 is set to be the world's fastest graphics card when it launches this Thursday, September 24th, thanks to its ability to play and capture games in 8K - a feat which sounds impressive until you realise that the number of 8K displays you can actually buy at the moment is practically zero. Still, if you're dead set on having the best graphics card around for the foreseeable future, I've gathered together everything you need to know about the RTX 3090, including its specs, price, where you can buy one, and what time it goes on sale.\n\n\n\n\nThe PC Gaming Weekspot: Gotham Knights! Life Is Strange: True Colors! Forspoken! Other Stuff!\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\nI'll be updating this article on a regular basis as we get closer to the RTX 3090's launch, so be sure to check back often so you can stay up to date. I'll also be testing the RTX 3090 myself very soon, too, so it won't be long before we can see exactly what kind of speeds this ludicrously overpowered GPU is capable of producing.\n\nRTX 3090: What you need to know\nWhat is it? Nvidia's first 8K gaming GPU\nWhen is it coming out? September 24th\nWhat time does it go on sale? 6am PT / 2pm BST\nHow much is it? \u00a31399 / $1499\r\n\nRTX 3090 release date\nThe RTX 3090 is releasing worldwide on September 24th, a week after the RTX 3080. It will be the second Ampere GPU Nvidia to come out this year, followed by the RTX 3070 sometime in October. \nThis is the day that you'll be able to buy both the Nvidia Founders Edition of the RTX 3090 and third party partner versions of the card from Asus, MSI, Gigabyte, EVGA and other manufacturers. You might find it difficult to get hold of one until early next year, though, as Nvidia have already apologised about their \"limited supply\" of cards available at launch.\n\nRTX 3090 price\nThe Nvidia Founders Edition of the RTX 3090 costs \u00a31399 in the UK and $1499 in the US. Third party versions of the card, however, are likely to be a lot more expensive depending on how much they've been factory overclocked by the manufacturers.\nOn the plus side, if you buy an RTX 3090 between its release date and October 29th, you'll also get a free copy of Watch Dogs Legions and a year\u2019s subscription to GeForce Now.\n\nWhere to buy an RTX 3090\nThe RTX 3090 goes on sale at 6am Pt / 2pm BST today, September 24th, and below you'll find a list of retailers who have RTX 3090 product pages, as well as various bits of pricing information. \nIn the UK:\n\nNvidia Store\nOverclockers UK - cards now available for pre-order\nEbuyer - no availability\nScan UK - cards now available for pre-order, earliest availability is Sept 29th\nCurrys PC World - several cards unavailable for delivery or collection\nAria PC - all cards out of stock\nNovatech - all cards out of stock\n\nIn the US:\n\nNvidia Store\nAmazon US - all cards out of stock\nNewegg - all cards out of stock\nBest Buy - all cards out of stock\nB&H Photo - all cards out of stock\n\nSo far, these are the cheapest RTX 3090 prices I can find in the UK and the US, but for more information, check out our dedicated Where to buy the RTX 3090 article.\n\n\nRTX 3090 specs\nAs you'd expect from the BFGPU of Nvidia's RTX 3000 family, the RTX 3090 has the best specs of the lot, coming in with a massive 24GB of memory like the outgoing Nvidia RTX Titan, and an enormous number of CUDA cores. Nvidia haven't released all of the RTX 3090's specs just yet, such as memory speed or memory bandwidth, but I've summarised the keys specs they have announced below.\n\nRTX 3090 specs\nCUDA Cores: 10496\nBase / Boost Clock: 1.4GHz / 1.7GHz\nVRAM: 24GB GDDR6X\nMemory Interface Width: 384-bit\nPower: 350W\nRecommended System Power: 750W \nDespite being much closer in price to the RTX 2080 Ti, Nvidia have positioned the RTX 3090 as a replacement to the RTX Titan rather than the 2080 Ti. Previously, Nvidia's Titan GPUs weren't really classed as consumer graphics cards. They used the same architecture as their GeForce siblings, but were very much intended for professional content creation rather than purely for gaming. With the RTX 3090, however, Nvidia have left the Titan name behind and created a new 90 tier right at the top of their RTX 3000 family, no doubt in the hopes of persuading ardent enthusiasts to cough up a bit more cash so they've got the latest and greatest.\nThe RTX 3090 also comes with 2nd Gen ray tracing cores and 3rd Gen Tensor cores for improved ray tracing and DLSS performance. Nvidia say their RTX 3000 series will be able to offer up to twice the ray tracing performance compared to the previous generation, although so far, they've only released figures that show each card's combined ray tracing and DLSS performance as opposed to their raw ray tracing speeds. As a result, it's probably best to take this figure with a pinch of salt until proper benchmarks start to come through. Either way, the RTX 3090 is sure to be significantly faster than the RTX 2080 Ti. That much is pretty much a given at this point.\nThis graph shows how Ampere's ray tracing performance compares to Turing as a whole, but the figures aren't particularly useful.\nAs Nvidia were keen to point out during their RTX 3000 series launch event, the RTX 3090 is the first consumer graphics card to be able to play games in 8K. That's a resolution of 7680x4320, which is four times as many pixels as 4K. At the moment, 8K gaming monitors don't really exist yet. Instead, we're only just about starting to see 8K TVs coming through, and even then the cheapest of the lot will set you back at least \u00a33000 / $3000-odd. As a result, you're going to need a heck of a lot money if you're really going to make the most of what the RTX 3090 is capable of when it comes to raw gaming performance.\nAt the moment, Nvidia are promising speeds of 60fps at 8K on the RTX 3090, and have released the following graph to show you what to expect. As you can see below, some games such as Control, Wolfenstein: Youngblood and even Death Stranding will be largely unplayable in 8K without the assistance of Nvidia's DLSS tech. \n\nThe good news is that Nvidia are developing a special DLSS 8K Ultra Performance mode for the RTX 3090, which will accelerate its DLSS performance even further in supported games. At time of writing, these games include Boundary, Bright Memory: Infinite, Control, Death Stranding, Justice, Minecraft, Ready Or Note, Scavengers, Watch Dogs Legion and Wolfenstein: Youngblood, but it's currently unknown whether more games will follow in their wake (and how quickly we can expect them to get support added in). \nNaturally, you're going to need a beefy power supply so you don't end up throttling the RTX 3090, and Nvidia recommend you have a 750W PSU at the absolute minimum. The Founders Edition of the RTX 3090 will also make use of Nvidia's new 12-pin power connector, but the good news is that an adapter for this will be included in the box. Third party RTX 3090 cards, on the other hand, only need a regular 2x 8-pin power connector. \n\nThose are the headline facts for the RTX 3090, and I'll be updating this article with more information as it becomes available. In the meantime, you can read all about our favourite GPUs in our roundup of the best graphics cards, what games currently support ray tracing and DLSS, as well as find all the best current graphics card prices in our regularly updated graphics card deals hub.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nKatharine Castle: Katharine was RPS' editor-in-chief from 2021 to 2024.

For any given workload, the right mix of performance, reliability, security, efficiency and cost is vital.\nThat\u2019s why HPE is now offering the latest generation of NVIDIA Mellanox ConnectX-6 Dx Ethernet adapters to power its advanced cloud, enterprise and AI systems.\nThe adapters provide advanced, built-in capabilities that bring smart offloads and robust security down to the end-points of the network, delivering unprecedented performance and scalability while satisfying the most demanding workloads for today\u2019s modern data centers.\nCompatible with HPE ProLiant Gen 10 Plus servers (NVIDIA product number MCX623106AS-CDAT), these adapters provide dual ports of 100Gb/s connectivity, PCIe Gen4 support and up to 200Gb/s of aggregate throughput with QSFP56 optical transceivers in a low-profile PCIe form factor.\nFor the newest servers, 25Gb/s and 50Gb/s networking don\u2019t provide enough throughput. And for virtualized, cloud and AI workloads, using a standard NIC doesn\u2019t provide enough performance, efficiency or security.\nHPE ProLiant Gen 10 Plus servers are now available with the NVIDIA ConnectX-6 Dx SmartNIC.\nConnectX adapters have become the industry\u2019s choice for secure and advanced cloud smart network interface cards (SmartNICs), accelerating mission-critical data-center applications such as security, virtualization, SDN/NFV, big data, machine learning and storage. HPE ProLiant Gen 10 Plus Servers with the new NVIDIA ConnectX-6 Dx adapter can enhance many solutions, including the following:\nResilient RoCE for AI, Big Data and Storage\u00a0\nNetwork-intensive applications like networked storage or cluster computing need a network infrastructure with a high bandwidth and low latency. RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) uses advanced Ethernet networking and offloads to reduce latency for applications requiring higher throughput and faster response times.\nA key technology advancement in GPU-GPU communications has been GPUDirect RDMA, which feeds data directly to GPU memory without needing to make buffer copies or interrupt the host. ConnectX-6 Dx makes it easier to deploy GPUDirect over RoCE by enabling a direct RDMA path for data exchange between the GPU and other servers or storage.\nBuilding on the Mellanox ConnectX tradition of industry-leading RoCE innovations, ConnectX-6 Dx also enhances the Zero Touch RoCE (ZTR) feature to enable more scalable, resilient and easy-to-deploy systems. ZTR allows RoCE-accelerated workloads to run on existing networks without requiring special configuration on the network (PFC and ECN are now optional), greatly simplifying deployments.\nIf a packet is dropped, a new ZTR option resends only the lost packet, reducing delays and improving throughput. These features make it easier and faster for HPE customers to accelerate Spark and storage using NVMe over Fabrics, as well as AI, machine learning and graphics workloads that use GPUs.\nThe NVIDIA Mellanox ConnectX-6 Dx adapter accelerates AI, cloud, big data, storage and telco workloads with advanced features in RoCE connectivity, congestion control, SDN, time synchronization, storage and security.\nAdvanced SDN and Virtualization\nVirtualization is critical for enabling cloud data centers to deliver agility, flexibility and scalability. These benefits often come at the expense of performance and efficiency, as virtualization traditionally is performed by software that consumes CPU resources.\nNVIDIA Mellanox SmartNICs feature ASAP2 (Accelerated Switch and Packet Processing) technology for vSwitch/vRouter hardware offload to deliver orders of magnitude higher performance vs. software-based solutions. ConnectX-6 Dx offers enhanced ASAP2 capabilities, supporting both SR-IOV and VirtIO in-hardware offload capabilities with millions of packet processing rules.\nAdditionally, NVIDIA ConnectX offers industry-leading DPDK performance on HPE servers, which yields higher performance, better security, easier management, and better transparency and troubleshooting. ConnectX-6 Dx includes advanced on-chip networking for traffic between VMs and containers, supporting efficient private and hybrid cloud deployments.\nThese innovations enable HPE servers with ConnectX-6 Dx adapters to deliver fast, efficient networking for virtualization and containers. It boosts SDN, NFV and next-generation firewall performance using software-defined, hardware-accelerated networking.\nNVIDIA Accelerated Switching and Packet Processing (ASAP2) delivers software-defined, hardware-accelerated SDN, NFV and advanced security capabilities, now on HPE servers.\nBest-in-Class Storage Offloads\u00a0\nWith AI, big data and real-time analysis workloads, faster connections are necessary not just between servers but also to storage. Beyond just a faster connection speed, the new ConnectX-6 Dx adds a layer of innovation to enable more scalable, resilient and easy-to-deploy storage solutions. This includes acceleration and offloads for NVMe drives, NVMe over Fabric (NVMe-oF) and RDMA technology, plus optional Data Integrity Factor (T10-DIF) offloads and storage encryption for both data at rest and data in motion.\nRecent enhancements to Microsoft\u2019s Azure stack and Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) and VMware vSAN include implementation of high-speed RoCE transport for transferring large amounts of data with little CPU intervention. With ConnectX-6 Dx storage and networking offloads, the CPU is free to run more applications, which reduces the number of servers required to support a given workload, resulting in both capex and opex savings.\nAdvanced Security Features\nIn virtualized and cloud environments, perimeter-only security techniques are no longer adequate as they leave virtualized workloads, endpoints and edge devices vulnerable. In an era where privacy of information is key and zero trust is the rule, the ConnectX-6 Dx adapter offers advanced security features such as hardware root of trust (RoT) and connection tracking, enabling zero-trust security throughout the data center. ConnectX-6 Dx also enables a hardware-accelerated L4 firewall capability by offloading stateful connection tracking through ASAP2.\nSecure boot supports a hardware RoT to protect against supply chain and other physical attack vectors, enabling a chain of trust for authenticating updates to adapter firmware. This blocks installation of rogue or corrupted firmware and ensures that the executing firmware is trusted.\n5G for Time-Sensitive Networks \u2013 Time-Triggered Transmission Technology for Telco 5T for 5G\nTo support a transition to 5G networks, telco companies must address a longstanding problem of clock synchronization. This has to occur at the network edge, where the front-haul access network between radio resource units and baseband units requires an exact time synchronization for accurate management of radio resources and radio signal processing.\nA breakthrough technology offered by NVIDIA in ConnectX-6 Dx adapters is the Time-Triggered Transmission Technology for Telco, known as 5T for 5G. It delivers incredibly accurate time synchronization across front-haul and mid-haul networks, providing telecommunications providers with higher performance, precise timing and reduced costs in their 5G rollouts.\nConnectX-6 Dx is the industry\u2019s first network adapter to offer this precise time synchronization for eCPRI and provides a 5-in-1 solution: high-throughput, low-latency network connectivity, low power, a broad set of in-hardware acceleration capabilities, and 5T for 5G. It renders expensive and power-hungry FPGA devices unnecessary in front-haul networks.\nHPE servers with ConnectX-6 Dx support precise time synchronization across front-haul 5G wireless networks using 5T for 5G technology.\nFor modern data center needs, HPE offers ConnectX-6 Dx network adapters for efficient storage and security that\u2019s supported and integrated across its server and storage portfolio and to deliver faster, more efficient and more secure access to data for enterprise applications.\n\n\nCategories: Networking \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This confirms that NVIDIA and its board partners are getting ready to unveil a fourth GeForce RTX\u00a0 30 series graphics card next month that will target the mainstream segment.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti 8 GB Custom Graphics Cards Listed by EEC - Four Gigabyte Models Featuring AORUS Master, Gaming, & Eagle Series\nThe Gigabyte models that were listed at EEC were spotted by Komachi_Ensaka (via Videocardz). It looks like Gigabyte is working on at least four models which will be part of its GeForce RTX 3060 Ti series lineup. The custom models are listed below:\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\nGIGABYTE RTX 3060 Ti 8GB AORUS Master (GV-N306TAORUS M-8GD)\nGIGABYTE RTX 3060 Ti 8GB GAMING OC (GV-N306TGAMING OC-8GD)\nGIGABYTE RTX 3060 Ti 8GB EAGLE OC (GV-N306TEAGLE OC-8GD)\nGIGABYTE RTX 3060 Ti 8GB EAGLE (GV-N306TEAGLE-8GD)\n\n\nAs you can see, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is more or less confirmed now and the card will feature 8 GB of GDDR6 memory. Gigabyte will have the AORUS Master variant as its top model while the OC and standard variants of the Eagle and Gaming series will serve the gaming market at a lower price point.\n\nAs per previously leaked out specifications, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti graphics card will use the GA104-200 GPU core and the latest PG190 SKU 10 PCB design (Reference & Founders Edition). The card will feature 4864 CUDA cores arranged in 38 SMs along with 8 GB of GDDR6 memory that will be operating at 14 Gbps across a 256-bit bus interface to deliver a total bandwidth of 448 GB/s. The graphics ard is rumored to feature a TDP of around 180W.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere' Graphics Card Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA106-300Ampere GA104-200Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie SizeTBC395.2mm2395.2mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBC17.4 Billion17.4 Billion28 Billion28 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores358448645888870410496\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs112 / 64152 / 80184 / 96272 / 96328 / 112\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores112 / 28152 / 38184 / 46272 / 68328 / 82\n\n\nBase Clock1320 MHz1410 MHz1500 MHz1440 MHz1400 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock1780 MHz1665 MHz1730 MHz1710 MHz1700 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute13 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs30 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPs25 TFLOPs32 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs58 TFLOPs69 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPs101 TOPs192 TOPs163 TOPs238 TOPs285 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity12 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR610 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus192-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed16 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth384 Gbps448 Gbps448 Gbps760 Gbps936 Gbps\n\n\nTGP170W175W220W320W350W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$329 US$399 US$499 US$699 US$1499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)25th February 20212nd December 202029th October 202017th September 202024th September 2020\n\n\n\n\nThere's no word on the availability of the graphics card yet but previous reports have highlighted at a late October launch for the graphics card so we might get to hear about the card around the time the GeForce RTX 3070 is launched. As for pricing, considering that the GeForce RTX 3070 costs $499 US, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti could be priced around $349-$399 US while offering performance on par or faster than the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n160\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The RTX 30 series flagship is now available for consumers to purchase worldwide and get an amazing level of performance that is much faster than the RTX 2080 Ti for less than half the price.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Flagship Graphics Card Now Available, Starting at $699 US - Pascal Users, It's Time To Upgrade!\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card is the flagship in the Ampere lineup and can now be purchased at your local retail outlets. The reference Founders Edition variant will cost $699 US. The NVIDIA RTX 3080 will feature a price of $699 (MSRP) however custom models will vary depending on their design and the extra horse-power that they have to offer. For those who missed the train, we published a ton of performance metrics for the Founders Edition variant yesterday in our own review which you can check out over here.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nOur very own, Keith May, concluded that the GeForce RTX 3080 is not only a great upgrade from an older GeForce RTX 1080 Ti graphics card but even RTX 2080 Ti users will benefit by upgrading to the new flagship. If RTX 3080 is still not the performance they are looking for, then NVIDIA's $1499 US halo product, the GeForce RTX 3090, is also planned for release on 24th September and we'll have a review ready for that too.\nIf you've been holding out like so many with a 1080Ti you might have just found your price equivalent upgrade. Even if you have an RTX 2080 TI could see the benefit of upgrading as well if you feel you need quite the boost anyway. Ampere delivers and it's quite easy to see why NVIDIA was so AMP'd. - Wccftech GeForce RTX 3080 Review\nThere are several ways to buy a GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card.

On paper, the GeForce RTX 3080 certainly looks mighty, packing an insane 28 billion transistors \u2013 a 50% increase over the RTX 2080 Ti, the former world's fastest gaming GPU.\nToday we can finally show you how the GeForce RTX 3080 performs and you can of course expect a boatload of benchmark data in this review. There's plenty of architectural information we could go over and we could also explore the Founders Edition card's design, but both of those things easily warrant a dedicated article. Right now it's clear most of you will want the benchmark data first, so we'll cover the hardware basics and then jump into the results.\n\nWith Ampere, a big change has been made to the streaming multiprocessor (SM) and its 32-bit floating point or FP32 throughput when compared to GeForce 20 Turing GPUs. Nvidia doubled the throughput by designing a new datapath for FP32 and INT32 operations which results in all four partitions combined executing 128 FP32 operations per clock.\nNvidia says this helps improve gaming performance and while true, its effectiveness depends on a few things which we will explore in this review. Here's a side-by-side specification comparison between the RTX 3080, 2080 and 2080 Ti.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nGeForce RTX 3080\nGeForce RTX 2080\nGeForce RTX 2080 Ti\n\n\nPrice (MSRP)\n$700\n$1200\n\n\nRelease Date\nSeptember 2020\nSeptember 2018\n\n\nProcess\nSamsung 8N\nTSMC12FFN\n\n\nTransistors (billion)\n28\n13.6\n18.6\n\n\nDie Size (mm2)\n628.4\n545\n754\n\n\nCore Config\n8704 / 272 / 96\n2944 / 184 / 64\n4352 / 272 / 88\n\n\nCore Clock Frequency\n1440 / 1710 MHz\n1515 / 1710 MHz\n1350 / 1545 MHz\n\n\nMemory Capacity\n10 GB\n8 GB\n11 GB\n\n\nMemory Speed\n19 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Type\nGDDR6X\nGDDR6\n\n\nBus Type / Bandwidth\n320-bit / 760 GB/s\n256-bit / 448 GB/s\n352-bit / 616 GB/s\n\n\nTGP\n320 watt\n215 watt\n250 watt\n\n\n\nWhen compared to the 2080 Ti we're looking at the same number of SM units with the RTX 3080, but thanks to the 2x FP32 redesign, Nvidia is claiming a 100% increase in CUDA cores. That doesn't mean the 3080 will be 100% faster than the 2080 Ti, but it will offer a reasonable performance uplift. Point is, you can't make a meaningful CUDA core count comparison between different generations.\n\nComparing the memory configuration is a more straightforward affair. The RTX 2080 Ti has an 11 GB memory buffer, while the RTX 3080 offers 10 GB. This is still a 25% increase over the vanilla RTX 2080, but it's surprising since you'd expect a larger buffer for a card targeting 4K gaming.\nThe memory bandwidth has been greatly increased thanks to the use of 19 Gbps GDDR6X memory on a 320-bit wide bus, resulting in a peak bandwidth of 760 GB/s, a 23% increase from the 2080 Ti and 70% from the 2080.\n\nIt's also worth noting the increase in TGP (Total Graphics Power) from 215 watts for the RTX 2080 to 320 watts for the RTX 3080, a massive 49% increase and even a 28% increase from the 2080 Ti. It will be interesting to see how well the RTX 3080 Founders Edition graphics card deals with all that power once it's converted to heat energy.\n\nBut enough about all that, it's time to get into the blue bar graphs. For testing we're using our Ryzen 9 3950X test system, featuring four sticks of low latency DDR4-3200 memory operating in a dual-rank configuration. We also have some Core i9-10900K and PCI Express 3.0 vs 4.0 preliminary data that we'll look at, so let's get to it.\n\nBenchmarks\nStarting with Death Stranding, we're looking at a 20% performance increase over the 2080 Ti at 1440p and a 41% increase over the RTX 2080. Not bad at all, but not the 80% we suspect many of you were expecting to see. We should note the margins were identical on our Core i9-10900K test system.\n\nMoving to 4K does improve margins for the RTX 3080 and now it's 29% faster than the 2080 Ti and 62% faster than the vanilla 2080, so that's starting to get up there. Also 107 fps on average at 4K is a very impressive result, the game looked spectacular and as you might imagine, was very smooth.\n\nUnfortunately the performance gains in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 at 1440p are very weak and this is largely due to our choice to use the 3950X, the game just doesn't utilize Ryzen processors very well right now and is in desperate need of low-level API support.\n\nHere we're looking at a measly 9% increase over the 2080 Ti and 30% over the 2080, but even with an Intel CPU you're still only looking at a 20% increase over the 2080 Ti.\n\nJumping to 4K does help alleviate the CPU bottleneck and the RTX 3080 was 29% faster than the 2080 Ti. We saw the same frame rates on our 10900K test system. So with an RTX 3080 you're looking at just 40 fps at 4K over big cities in Flight Simulator 2020.\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider was one of the games that impressed me the most two years ago when testing the 2080 Ti, the 4K experience was amazing. At 1440p the RTX 3080 is seen to be 28% faster than the 2080 Ti and 57% faster than the 2080, at 154 fps on average under these conditions is very impressive.\n\nThen at 4K we see that 87 fps on average is possible with the RTX 3080, pretty impressive stuff. That's a 67% increase over the 2080 and 30% over the 2080 Ti, so both are quite impressive gains, particularly given this is a $700 GPU.\n\nMoving on to Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, we're looking at a 28% increase over the 2080 Ti and 63% over the standard 2080 or 54% over the Super version.\nWe're probably not going to reference the 2080 Super much since it offered a mere 5% increase over the original model and most of you bought the original.\n\nNow at 4K we're looking at a 29% increase over the 2080 Ti and 71% over the 2080. Those are some pretty solid gains. It also means whereas the 2080 Ti averaged 135 fps the 3080 saw 1% lows of 152 fps, providing a better experience for high refresh rate gaming at 4K.\n\nNext up we have F1 2020 and here we're seeing what has become a fairly typical 30-ish % boost over the 2080 Ti at 1440p, this time it's a 29% performance uplift to be exact. That meant the RTX 3080 was 57% faster than the vanilla 2080, so another solid performance uplift there.\n\nOnce again we see the margins grow a little at 4K and now the RTX 3080 is 36% faster than the 2080 Ti and 72% faster than the 2080, which is far more significant and much closer to the 80% that's been put out there since the announcement.\nIt's also worth noting that we're talking about 129 fps on average at 4K, that's staggering performance.\n\nMoving on to Gears 5, we see \"mild\" performance gains at 1440p. An 18% boost from the 2080 Ti and 37% over the standard 2080. It will depend on your perspective but for this title, we're talking about a 34% improvement over the 3+ year-old GTX 1080 Ti which also sold for $700.\n\nAgain increasing the resolution to 4K helps widening the gap and now the RTX 3080 is 47% faster than the GTX 1080 Ti.\n\nThis time we're looking at a 33% performance uplift for the RTX 3080 over the 2080 Ti at 1440p, so that's one of the better performance gains we've seen at this resolution so far.\nIt also means the new Ampere GPU was 76% faster than the GTX 1080 Ti which is a significant performance uplift and we also saw an almost 70% increase over the RTX 2080, so we're very impressed with these results.\n\nAnd of course, they only get better at 4K.\nThe RTX 3080 was a whopping 43% faster than the 2080 Ti, a massive performance uplift. It's also 83% faster than the 2080 and 92% faster than the 1080 Ti. Those are some of the best margins we've seen so far and certainly appear to be a best case scenario for the RTX 3080.\n\nWith Assassin's Creed Odyssey we're back to milder gains at 1440p. The RTX 3080 leads the 2080 Ti by a 25% margin and the 1080 Ti and 2080 by 42%. We know it sounds strange to say \"just 42%\" but remember the 1080 Ti cost the same amount as the 3080 when released 3.5 years ago.\n\nAt 4K, the RTX 3080 provides a 35% performance bump over the 2080 Ti and it was 51% faster than the 1080 Ti and 2080.\n\nWith no help from dynamic resolution scaling, the RTX 3080 pumped out 190 fps on average at 1440p in World War Z using the maximum in-game quality settings.\nThat's a stunning frame rate, though only a ~17% boost over the 2080 Ti and 42% over the 2080. We should note that the 3950X does create a small bottleneck in WWZ at 1440p, however the margins are virtually identical on the Core i9-10900K, moving by a few percent in the 3080's favor.\n\nMoving to 4K shows the RTX 3080's prowess, it's now 34% faster at 4K than the 2080 Ti which is a massive improvement.\n\nNext up we have Metro Exodus and the 3950X does become a problem in this title. This is a rare instance where the Ryzen CPU heavily limits performance at 1440p and as a result the RTX 3080 suffers. That's still a 25% boost over the RTX 2080, but let's see what happens at 4K...\n\nAt 4K we're no longer CPU limited and there is a 35% uplift over the 2080 Ti and 70% over the 2080.\n\nMoving on to Resident Evil 3, we see an impressive 196 fps average from the RTX 3080 when using the best visual quality settings. That meant it was 31% faster than the 2080 Ti and 66% faster than both the GTX 1080 Ti and RTX 2080.\n\nJumping up to the 4K resolution and we're seeing just over 100 fps on average for a 30% boost over the 2080 Ti and a massive 76% improvement over the RTX 2080 and GTX 1080 Ti\n\nDoom Eternal has been heavily touted by Nvidia to show off RTX 3080 performance and you'll see why once we move to the 4K testing. At 1440p the results aren't overly impressive as the 3080 is ~20% faster than the 2080 Ti and 51% faster than the 2080. Again, 50% remains an impressive gain.\nNow moving to 4K we see some interesting stuff using the 'Ultra Nightmare' preset, which in our test sees 9GB of VRAM used.\n\nHere the 3080 was 35% faster than the 2080 Ti, but quite incredibly 115% faster than the 2080. Also it was 93% faster than the 1080 Ti which does well here relative to the 2080 thanks to the extra VRAM.\nThis particular test is why many are expecting/claiming up to 100% performance gains over the 2080 after seeing Digital Foundry's Nvidia promo video. The data is accurate, but without more information can be somewhat misleading.\nAnd here is more information. By leaving all other options on 'Ultra Nightmare' with the exception of texture pool size, which we dropped to 'Ultra' reducing VRAM usage to 7GB, this is what we find...\n\nThere is no change in performance with GPUs packing 10GB or more VRAM, but for those with 8GB like the RTX 2080, we're seeing a 26% performance uplift and that means the 3080 is now 70% faster, not 115% faster.\nWe'll discuss this further, but for now let's move on to Wolfenstein: Youngblood.\n\nStarting with the 1440p data we see that the RTX 3080 is good for 242 fps on average as it boosted performance over the 2080 Ti by a 22% margin and 55% over the 2080. Fairly typical gains there for 1440p.\n\nNow at 4K we're looking at 142 fps on average with the 3080 which is extremely impressive, just 22% faster than the 2080 Ti, but 60% faster than the 2080 which is a pretty solid gain.\n\nFinally we have Hitman 2 results and this is another rare instance where the Ryzen 9 3950X limits performance at 1440p and as a result the RTX 3080 is just 5% faster than the 2080 Ti. We also tested using the Core i9-10900K and with the Intel CPU the 3080 was marginally faster (10%) at this resolution.\n\nPumping the resolution up to 4K means we're back to a GPU limitation and the RTX 3080 performs 29% faster than the 2080 Ti and 69% faster than the 2080. Once more we can see the Ampere GPU come to life at the 4K resolution.\n\nPerformance Summary\nThere is no escaping fact the RTX 3080 is very fast, particularly when compared to the 2080 GPU it replaces, but it will also need a capable system to go along all this power. We tested many different titles and the margins were a bit all over the place, so let's have a look at the 14 game average for all the GPUs tested and then we'll do a few head to heads looking at individual titles.\n14 Game Average at 1440p\n\nOn average, the RTX 3080 is 21% faster than the 2080 Ti and 49% faster than the 2080 at 1440p. It's also 58% faster than the 1080 Ti and 113% faster than the vanilla 1080. So we're looking at roughly a 50% performance boost at the $700 price point after two years, at least for 1440p gaming.\n14 Game Average at 4K\n\nPlaying games at 4K takes full advantage of what the GeForce RTX 3080 is capable of. At this resolution, it's 32% faster than the 2080 Ti, 71% faster than the RTX 2080 and 77% faster than the GTX 1080 Ti, on average. Those are far more impressive gains and makes Ampere a tremendous replacement at the same price point.\nGeForce RTX 3080 vs 2080 Ti: 14 Game Average at 1440p\n\nHere's a look at the margins on a per game basis and please note due to the way this data is calculated there can be a small discrepancy in the totals when compared to the previous graphs. As before, the 3080 is 21% faster than the 2080 Ti at 1440p and here we see performance gains range anywhere from a few percent right up to 33%.\nGeForce RTX 3080 vs 2080 Ti: 14 Game Average at 4K\n\nWe see far more predictable margins at 4K and this has little to do with the CPU used and much more to do with the Ampere architecture \u2013 we'll discuss this in better detail in the conclusion.\nWhat we see here are gains of at least 22%, with the biggest margin seen in Horizon Zero Dawn where the RTX 3080 was up to 43% faster than the prev-gen 2080 Ti.\nGeForce RTX 3080 vs RTX 2080: 14 Game Average at 1440p\n\nAt 1440p we see less predictable gains even when compared to the RTX 2080. It's clear however the 3080 is the more powerful GPU with margins going from 25% faster and then as big as 69%.\nGeForce RTX 3080 vs RTX 2080: 14 Game Average at 4K\n\nAt 4K, the new Ampere GPU can be anywhere from 51 to 83% faster. Looking at this data you could simply say the RTX 3080 is about 70% faster when gaming at 4K.\nAlso note that we used the 7GB VRAM data for Doom here as the 115% gain using the Ultra Nightmare preset was an outlier and not indicative of raw GPU performance.\nPower Consumption\nNow let's take a look at power consumption, starting with our total system power draw, so literally everything in the PC is being measured here.\nThis is useful for a few reasons: first, it lets you know roughly what kind of power supply you'd need for a certain configuration. It also lets you know just how much difference in power draw there is between say the 2080 Ti and 3080 when factoring in the entire gaming system.\n\nWe're looking at a big 21% increase in total system usage as the RTX 3080 pushes our test system up to 523 watts. That's beyond what we saw with the GTX 1080 Ti and Vega 64 to name two power hungry graphics cards. So the RTX 3080 does suck down a lot of power to output all that raw performance.\nUsing Nvidia's PCAT (Power Capture Analysis Tool) we can accurately measure the power draw of the graphics card alone, including what it draws from the PCIe power connectors and the PCIe slot. It's a seriously impressive tool and kudos go to Nvidia for providing it to testers, that's very cool of them.\n\nHere we can see that the RTX 3080 consumes 25% more power than the 2080 Ti and 29% more than the RTX 2080. And while that's a lot of power, technically it is still more efficient. See below:\n\nHere we see that the RTX 3080 offers the most performance per watt, so you can't deny its efficiency. This is a first generation node shrink GPU, meaning that if history serves any indication, in the future Nvidia will likely be able to improve upon this 8% generational efficiency gain.\nFor testing thermal performance of the RTX 3080 Founders Edition, we installed it in our Corsair Obsidian 500D test system and let it run for an hour in F1 2020 while maintaining a room temperature of 21C. After that point the GPU peaked at just 77C and maintained a core clock speed of around 1830 MHz.\n\nThis had the graphics card fans spinning at up to 1900 RPM where they could be heard but we're not overly loud. We don't have any sound measurements right now, but we found the FE model to perform well and given the performance and power draw we were pleasantly surprised. We'll say the card does tend to squeal a lot when pumping out over 300 fps, so if you are sensitive to coil whine, a frame cap will be in order.\n\nCost Per Frame\nOne key metric we like to use is cost per frame and at $700 the RTX 3080 will be delivering the goods, even at 1440p.\nYou all know we liked the value of the Radeon 5700 XT and here we're seeing that level of value despite offering a 64% performance boost. The RTX 3080 can roughly match the cost per frame of the Navi GPU and it's also 33% cheaper per frame when compared to the RTX 2080.\n\nHowever, if we look at the 4K performance, the cost per frame gets even better, much better.\nHere the RTX 3080 is the most affordable graphics card released in the last 4 years when it comes to cost per frame (value), beating even the base model RX 5700 which is almost ridiculous.\n\nDLSS / Ray Tracing\nWe plan to follow up with a more detailed analysis of DLSS and ray tracing on Ampere on a dedicated article, but for the time being, here's a quick look at both in Wolfenstein Youngblood.\nWhen enabling Ray Tracing the RTX 3080 suffers a 38% performance hit which is better than the 46% performance hit the 2080 Ti suffers. Then if we enable DLSS with ray tracing the 3080 drops just 20% of its original performance which is marginally better than the 25% drop seen with the 2080 Ti. The deltas are not that much different, the RTX 3080 is just faster to begin with.\n\nUsing only DLSS sees a 16% performance boost in the RTX 2080. So let's see if things change much at 4K.\n\nHere the RTX 3080 was good for 142 fps when running at the native resolution without any RTX features enabled. Enabling ray tracing reduces performance by 41% to 84 fps on average, which is reasonable performance, but still a massive fps drop. For comparison the RTX 2080 Ti saw a 49% drop.\nWhen using DLSS, the 2080 Ti sees an 18% performance boost whereas the 3080 sees a 23% jump. At least in this game implementation, it looks like the 3080 is faster at stuff like ray tracing because it's a faster GPU and not necessarily because the 2nd-gen RT cores are making a difference. We'll test more games in the weeks to come, of course.\nTesting with AMD vs. Intel CPUs\nThere are a number of reasons why we switched to a Ryzen CPU for game testing moving forward (this was discussed and outlined in this article). But the most important one was that the change wouldn't influence results or manipulate numbers in charts like our cost per frame summary.\nLooking at how the 3950X and 10900K compare with the RTX 3080 and 2080 Ti at 1440p across our 14 game sample, the 10900K was 4% faster with the 2080 Ti and 6% faster with the 3080, that 2% margin is not going to skew the results.\n\nThen at 4K we can appreciate that there's no difference at all between the two CPUs as both pushed the RTX 3080 to the same 108 fps average.\n\nWhat We Learned\nThis is only the beginning of the journey for Ampere GPUs and RTX 30 series graphics cards, but there you have it, that's the new GeForce RTX 3080 in a nutshell. We've got many more tests that we want to show you and many more we want to run, but for now you should have a pretty good idea of what's on offer.\nA big 70% performance jump over the RTX 2080 at 4K is impressive, and a huge improvement in cost per frame, so that's a job well done by Nvidia.\nNow, that big jump won't be experienced across the board, or more specifically, we saw less consistent improvements at 1440p where the RTX 3080 could beat the 2080 by as much as 70%, but also by as little as 25% (for a ~50% performance gain on average). That 50% boost is still great to see even though in terms of raw performance at the $700 price point we can look two years back to the RTX 2080 release or 3.5 years since the GTX 1080 Ti was released.\n\nWe've looked deeper at the RTX 3080's performance at 1440p, so we want to comment on that. As far as we can tell, CPU bottlenecking alone is not the explanation. The reason comes down to Ampere's architecture and the change to the SM configuration that we mentioned in the introduction. The 2x FP32 design can only be fully utilized at 4K and beyond. This is because at 4K the portion of the render time per frame is heavier on FP32 shaders. At lower resolutions like 1440p, the vertice and triangle load is identical to what we see at 4K, but at the higher resolution pixel shaders and compute effect shaders are more intensive and take longer and therefore can fill the SMs FP32 ALUs better.\nWe often see high performance GPUs better utilized at higher resolutions for similar reasons, so that in itself isn't unusual. Higher resolutions always do a better job of putting core-heavy GPUs to work, and they also help minimize other system bottlenecks. The 2080 Ti, for example, extends its lead over the 2080 at 4K, going from 23% faster at 1440p to 28% faster at 4K and that's with the lower quality textures in Doom, where memory capacity is not a factor. We're talking about a small 5% discrepancy, the scaling at 1440p and 4K looks very similar, and the 3950X can also be blamed for a small part of that difference. However with the RTX 3080 we're talking about a 21% margin over the 2080 Ti at 1440p and then a much larger 32% margin at 1440p (again, VRAM plays no role in the comparison). And our explanation here is that Ampere is a compute heavy, datacenter and AI optimized architecture that goes beyond gaming needs.\n\nCurrent RTX 2080 owners targeting high-refresh rates at 1440p will see a 50% performance boost, which is still pretty sweet. The fact that the RTX 3080 simply excels at 4K gaming could be seen as the cherry on top. Doesn't necessarily future proof the GPU however, as Nvidia paired it with 10GB of VRAM which might prove insufficient in a year or two, though PCIe 4.0 will be a lot more useful in mitigating those performance loses in modern platforms.\nIn the current market the GeForce RTX 3080 is an excellent value product.\nWe only have to look at the cost per frame data to see that the RTX 3080 is a massive improvement over the RTX 2080 in terms value, it's even better value than the RTX 2060 and comparable to the 5700 XT which not everyone was fond of. In the current market the GeForce RTX 3080 is an excellent value product, one of those rare instances where a high-end product is also a great value. This may be helped by an overpriced GeForce 20 series (we called this one at launch), but the fact is, those RTX boards still flew off shelves no matter what.\nIn the coming months we're bound to see more of Ampere, but also some competition from AMD and eventually Intel. We're looking forward to that, though clearly Nvidia has upped the ante on this generation. Arguably Nvidia has given AMD an opportunity to strike with a gaming focused architecture, but we'll just have to wait and see on that one.\nAs for ray tracing and DLSS, our opinion on that hasn't changed. The technology is great, and we're glad it hasn't been used as key selling points of Ampere, it's now just a nice bonus and of course, it will matter more once more games bring proper support for them.\nBottom line, we're very pleased with what the GeForce RTX 3080 delivers at the $700 price point, and it's a hell of a lot better than what we got last generation. I personally would have not bought an RTX 2080, but I would buy an RTX 3080.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090 on Amazon\nIntel Core i9-10900K on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 9 3950X on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 9 3900X on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 115\n\n\n Got something to say?

The cash and stock deal will see NVIDIA buy the semiconductor and IP design firm from SoftBank and its associated SoftBank Vision Fund, with NVIDIA taking an eye towards expanding Arm\u2019s IP licensing business while also using Arm\u2019s technology to further pierce into the datacenter market. The deal is just being formally announced today and will likely not close for some time, as it is expected to be required to clear multiple regulatory hurdles in the UK, US, China, and other governments across the globe.\nThe groundbreaking deal will see NVIDIA take over Arm Limited from SoftBank, who previously acquired the then-independent Arm in 2016 for $32 billion. At the time, SoftBank acquired Arm primarily as an investment vehicle, expecting the successful company to continue to grow as the number of chips shipped on the Arm architecture continued to explode. However, the investment firm has been under pressure in recent months as some of its other investments have taken big hits \u2013 particularly WeWork and Uber \u2013 and while SoftBank isn\u2019t officially commenting on why it\u2019s selling Arm after all of this time, there\u2019s ample reason to believe that the firm is selling off one of its more valuable assets in order to shore up its balance sheets.\nThe $40 billion transaction means that SoftBank will come out ahead on their investment, but only barely \u2013 their Arm investment has significantly underperformed relative to the broader technology industry. The deal will see SoftBank receive $12 billion in cash, along with $21.5 billion in NVIDIA stock. That transaction will give SoftBank a relatively sizable ownership stake in NVIDIA, though according to the companies the total stake is expected to be under 10 percent. Finally, the remaining $6.5B valuation of the deal will come from a further $1.5B in equity that NVIDIA will be paying out to Arm employees, as well as a $5B \u201cearn-out\u201d payment to be paid if Arm meets certain financial targets.\n\nAs for NVIDIA, the Arm acquisition marks their largest acquisition to date, easily eclipsing the Mellanox acquisition that closed just a short few months ago. Over the last half-decade NVIDIA has undergone significant growth \u2013 both in regards to revenue and market capitalization \u2013 thanks in big part to NVIDIA\u2019s newfound success in the server and datacenter market with their deep learning accelerators. While the company is well off of its 52-week high that it set earlier this month, NVIDIA now has a sizable $330B market cap that they are leveraging to make this deal possible.\nAnd according to the company, it\u2019s that success in the server market that is driving their interest in and plans for Arm. NVIDIA expects the server market to remain a high-growth opportunity, and that by acquiring Arm they can leverage Arm\u2019s recent success with Neoverse and other server products to reach an even bigger chunk of that market.\n\nTo be sure, NVIDIA isn\u2019t announcing any specific hardware plans today \u2013 the deal is easily still a year and a half off from closing \u2013 but NVIDIA has made it clear that following their success in the GPU/accelerator and networking markets, they see Arm as the perfect complement to their current product lineup, giving them a capable CPU architecture to round-out their technology portfolio. Even with Arm, NVIDIA will not be capable of complete vertical integration, but while the company today still has to rely on third-party vendors (e.g. AMD and Intel) for some of the most important silicon that goes into servers incorporating their accelerators, with an Arm-based server CPU, NVIDIA can offer a nearly complete package on its own.\n\nOf course, Arm is more than just a server CPU designer; the company has its fingers in everything from toasters to supercomputers thanks to its very broad range of IP, and any discussion about acquiring Arm has to include what happens to those businesses. Arm\u2019s core business is licensing IP, and NVIDIA is telling the public (and partners) that this won\u2019t change \u2013 that the company will continue to license out IP to other companies. The rationale for this is multifaceted \u2013 NVIDIA needs to win over everyone from regulators to customers to investors \u2013 but at the end of the day the company is in no position to compete with a lot of Arm\u2019s customers, nor would they want to. Even in the server space NVIDIA couldn\u2019t hope to address everything from microservers to supercomputers, never mind embedded controllers and smartphones. So NVIDIA is taking a complementary approach to the acquisition, using Arm\u2019s server technology to augment their own, all the while continuing to license out IP.\nIn fact, the company is looking at growing the amount of IP that Arm licenses by including IP currently held by NVIDIA; technologies such as GPUs, AI accelerators, and network processors. It\u2019s an idea that NVIDIA has played around with once before without much success, but Arm comes with a much better business model and much more experience in licensing than NVIIDA ever had. Just what this expansion entails remains to be seen, but the obvious routes include licensing out GeForce graphics IP for use in SoCs (potentially replacing Arm\u2019s Mali offerings), as well as licensing out bits and pieces of NVIDIA\u2019s tensor core and InfiniBand technologies.\n\nStill, NVIDIA knows that they face an uphill battle in convincing Arm\u2019s traditional customers that NVIDIA has their best interests at heart. The Arm deal is less than desirable for the industry as a whole, as Arm has traditionally only sold IP and related core designs, remaining fully divorced from full-scale chip design and sales. However with SoftBank seemingly set on selling Arm, there are few companies in a position to buy Arm, and even fewer that would be willing to take it on-board as a long-term investment. Ultimately, Arm being acquired by a chipmaker makes for strange bedfellows all around, and it falls on NVIDIA to convince customers that their acquisition of Arm will help the ecosystem by combining the companies engineering resources, and that they are earnest about continuing to design and sell top-shelf IP that other companies \u2013 even NVIDIA\u2019s competitors \u2013 will get reasonable access to.\n\nThe other (and perhaps more immediate) challenge for NVIDIA is convincing regulators across the globe to approve the deal. NVIDIA is pitching the deal as being complementary, combining two companies that otherwise have minimal overlap. None the less, minimal is not the same as \u201cnone\u201d, and besides the immediate and obvious overlap with Mali and GeForce GPU technologies, regulators will no doubt take a great deal of interest in the future of IP licensing. The smartphone revolution of the past decade and a half has been built on top of Arm architectures \u2013 never mind the billions of devices with Arm-based microcontrollers \u2013 so many parties have a vested interest in keeping that going.\nTo that end, while NVIDIA is just starting discussions with regulators \u2013 the deal was secret and not being discussed with partners nor regulators until this evening \u2013 the company is already making concessions and guarantees to the British government to get its approval. This includes committing to keeping Arm headquartered in Cambridge, and continuing to do a significant amount of their engineering work there. The company is also announcing that they will be building one of their AI \u201ccenters of excellence\u201d in Cambridge. Besides providing an environment for cutting-edge AI research and training, NVIDIA will be building an Arm & NVIDIA-powered supercomputer at the site. While specific plans for the supercomputer are not being announced, the company recently finished building the world\u2019s 7th-fastest supercomputer, Selene, using its DGX Pod infrastructure, so NVIDIA has significant capabilities here.\nOtherwise, no such overtures have been made to the US or China, however the situations in those countries are very different since they are not Arm\u2019s traditional home. What (if anything) NVIDIA will need to do to sell regulators in those countries remains to be seen, but it\u2019s worth noting that nothing about this deal resolves the current export impasse with China; even after the deal closes, Arm will still face the same restricts in exporting its technology to China.\n\nFinally, while this deal will see NVIDIA buying Arm wholesale, the two companies have confirmed that Arm\u2019s ongoing efforts to sell off its IoT Services Group will continue. As a non-IP business NVIDIA has no interest in it, and as a result it will still be spun-off.\nUltimately, the Arm deal will be a significant shift in the industry, one far bigger than the $40 billion price tag indicates. In one form or another, Arm and its IP are at the heart of billions of chips sold every year, a reach that few other companies can match. For NVIDIA, acquiring Arm will cement their position as a top-tier chip designer, all the while giving them an even larger technology portfolio to go after the server market, and new opportunities to sell IP to other vendors. But true success will likely hinge on how well NVIDIA can court the rest of the technology industry: Arm\u2019s reach is only as big as its customers, and so it\u2019s up to NVIDIA to convince it\u2019s customers that they can still count on Arm\u2019s neutrality even after the change in ownership.\nGallery: NVIDIA To Acquire Arm: Press Deck\nSource: NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n140 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nWreckage - Sunday, September 13, 2020 - link\nx86 is dead. \n\n\n\nnandnandnand - Sunday, September 13, 2020 - link\nARM is dead.\n\n\n\nYojimbo - Sunday, September 13, 2020 - link\nNietzsche is dead.\n\n\n\nnathanddrews - Monday, September 14, 2020 - link\nWeeesa gonna die?\n\n\n\nmrvco - Monday, September 14, 2020 - link\nRISC-V will save us.\n\n\n\nIthaqua - Tuesday, September 15, 2020 - link\nBring back Alpha\n\n\n\nJedi2155 - Thursday, September 17, 2020 - link\nHow wuude!\n\n\n\nGreenReaper - Monday, September 14, 2020 - link\nAnd we have killed him.\n\n\n\nLord of the Bored - Monday, September 14, 2020 - link\nNietzsche is dead, God is now Nietzsche. \n\n\n\nZolaIII  - Monday, September 14, 2020 - link\nOnly the man from mountain still stands as human stupidity is indestructible. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n14\n\n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

AI and HPC tools help researchers more quickly narrow down the options, like picking out a subset of correctly shaped and colored puzzle pieces to experiment with.\nAn effective small-molecule drug will bind to a target enzyme, receptor or other critical protein along the disease pathway. Like the perfect puzzle piece, a successful drug will be the ideal fit, possessing the right shape, flexibility and interaction energy to attach to its target.\nBut it\u2019s not enough just to interact strongly with the target. An effective therapeutic must modify the function of the protein in just the right way, and also possess favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity properties \u2014 creating a complex optimization problem for scientists.\nResearchers worldwide are racing to find effective vaccine and drug candidates to inhibit infection with and replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Using NVIDIA GPUs, they\u2019re accelerating this lengthy discovery process \u2014 whether for structure-based drug design, molecular docking, generative AI models, virtual screening or high-throughput screening.\nIdentifying Protein Targets with Genomics\nTo develop an effective drug, researchers have to know where to start. A disease pathway \u2014 a chain of signals between molecules that trigger different cell functions \u2014 may involve thousands of interacting proteins. Genomic analyses can provide invaluable insights for researchers, helping them identify promising proteins to target with a specific drug.\nWith the NVIDIA Clara Parabricks genome analysis toolkit, researchers can sequence and analyze genomes up to 50x faster. Given the unprecedented spread of the COVID pandemic, getting results in hours versus days can have an extraordinary impact on understanding the virus and developing treatments.\nTo date, hundreds of institutions, including hospitals, universities and supercomputing centers, in 88 countries have downloaded the software to accelerate their work \u2014 to sequence the viral genome itself, as well as to sequence the DNA of COVID patients and investigate why some are more severely affected by the virus than others.\nAnother method, cryo-EM, uses electron microscopes to directly observe flash-frozen proteins \u2014 and can harness GPUs to shorten processing time for the complex, massive datasets involved.\nUsing CryoSPARC, a GPU-accelerated software built by Toronto startup Structura Biotechnology, researchers at the National Institutes of Health and the University of Texas at Austin created the first 3D, atomic-scale map of the coronavirus, providing a detailed view into the virus\u2019 spike proteins, a key target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies and diagnostics.\nGPU-Accelerated Compound Screening\nOnce a target protein has been identified, researchers search for candidate compounds that have the right properties to bind with it. To evaluate how effective drug candidates will be, researchers can screen drug candidates virtually, as well as in real-world labs.\nDrug discovery startup Atomwise, which joined the NVIDIA Inception virtual accelerator program in 2018, developed AtomNet, a convolutional neural network for small molecule drug discovery. The AtomNet AI technology can screen more than 16 billion compounds in less than two days using the scalability of NVIDIA GPUs hosted in the cloud. Virtual screening can accelerate the time it takes to discover potential drug candidates that may be promising for further testing and development, especially for challenging targets that were previously considered \u201cundruggable.\u201d\nNew York-based Schr\u00f6dinger creates drug discovery software that can model the properties of potential drug molecules. Used by the world\u2019s biggest biopharma companies, the Schr\u00f6dinger platform allows its users to determine the binding affinity of a candidate molecule on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs in under an hour and with just a few dollars of compute cost \u2014 instead of many days and thousands of dollars using traditional methods.\nGenerative AI Models for Drug Discovery\nRather than evaluating a dataset of known drug candidates, a generative AI model starts from scratch. Tokyo-based startup Elix, Inc., an NVIDIA Inception member, uses generative models trained on NVIDIA DGX Station systems to come up with promising molecular structures. Some of the AI\u2019s proposed molecules may be unstable or difficult to synthesize, so additional neural networks are used to determine the feasibility for these candidates to be tested in the lab.\nWith DGX Station, Elix achieves up to a 6x speedup on training the generative models, which would otherwise take a week or more to converge, or to reach the lowest possible error rate.\nMolecular Docking for COVID-19 Research\nWith the inconceivable size of the chemical space, researchers couldn\u2019t possibly test every possible molecule to figure out which will be effective to combat a specific disease. But based on what\u2019s known about the target protein, GPU-accelerated molecular dynamics applications can be used to approximate molecular behavior and simulate target proteins at the atomic level.\n\nSoftware like AutoDock-GPU, developed by the Center for Computational Structural Biology at the Scripps Research Institute, enables researchers to calculate the interaction energy between a candidate molecule and the protein target. Known as molecular docking, this computationally complex process simulates millions of different configurations to find the most favorable arrangement of each molecule for binding. Using the more than 27,000 NVIDIA GPUs on Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s Summit supercomputer, scientists were able to screen 1 billion drug candidates for COVID-19 in just 12 hours. Even using a single NVIDIA GPU provides more than 230x speedup over using a single CPU.\nArgonne deployed one of the first DGX-A100 systems. Courtesy of Argonne National Laboratory.\nIn Illinois, Argonne National Laboratory is accelerating COVID-19 research using an NVIDIA A100 GPU-powered system based on the DGX SuperPOD reference architecture. Argonne researchers are combining AI and advanced molecular modelling methods to perform accelerated simulations of the viral proteins, and to screen billions of potential drug candidates, determining the most promising molecules to pursue for clinical trials.\nAccelerating Biological Image Analysis\nThe drug discovery process involves significant high-throughput lab experiments as well. Phenotypic screening is one method of testing, in which a diseased cell is exposed to a candidate drug. With microscopes, researchers can observe and record subtle changes in the cell to determine if it starts to more closely resemble a healthy cell. Using AI to automate the process, thousands of possible drugs can be screened.\nDigital biology company Recursion, based in Salt Lake City, uses AI and NVIDIA GPUs to observe these subtle changes in cell images, analyzing terabytes of data each week. The company has released an open-source COVID dataset, sharing human cellular morphological data with researchers working to create therapies for the virus.\nFuture Directions in AI for Drug Discovery\nAs AI and accelerated computing continue to accelerate genomics and drug discovery pipelines, precision medicine \u2014 personalizing individual patients\u2019 treatment plans based on insights about their genome and their phenotype \u2014 will become more attainable.\nIncreasingly powerful NLP models will be applied to organize and understand massive datasets of scientific literature, helping connect the dots between independent investigations. Generative models will learn the fundamental equations of quantum mechanics and be able to suggest the optimal molecular therapy for a given target.\nTo learn more about how NVIDIA GPUs are being used to accelerate drug discovery, check out talks by Schr\u00f6dinger, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Atomwise at the GPU Technology Conference next week.\nFor more on how AI and GPUs are advancing COVID research, read our blog stories and visit the COVID-19 research hub.\nSubscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news here.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Research | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | COVID-19 | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | Science | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a new beta release of GeForce Experience, version 3.20.5, Nvidia has added a boatload of new features to the program, including one-click GPU overclocking and a fully-featured GPU monitoring tool, brining the company up to speed with some of the features enabled in AMD's Adrenalin suite. The update also includes support for 8K 30FPS HDR shadowplay recordings via the NVENC encoder on RTX 30 series GPUs.To see all the new GPU monitoring and overclocking tools, head over to your GeForce Experience application and enable \"Experimental Features\" to get the update for yourself. Once the update is installed, press \"alt+Z\" or whatever key you have bound to open the GeForce Experience overlay. Next, head over to the \"Performance\" tab, and voila, you can access all the new monitoring + OC features.GeForce Experience Performance Menu (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The Performance Monitoring area shows off a ton of information regarding GPU specifications, like power consumption, fan speed, temperature GPU, clock speeds, etc. You also get other info like CPU utilization and a frame rate counter that measures average FPS and 1% lows. Moving on to the GPU overclocking area, it's really simple as it can be. Simply click on the slider next to \"Enable Automatic Tuning,\" and this will automatically overclock your GPU for the best performance.\u00a0Like MSI Afterburner and EVGA's Precision X1, GeForce Experience does not change the overall core clock offset. Rather, it will increase the clock speed for each voltage step from your GPU Boost 4.0 algorithm. This is more efficient as it allows the GPU to maintain higher clock speeds if you start to hit temperature/power limits. The automatic tuning utility will also increase memory frequency.In my testing, I used my personal rig with an EVGA GeForce RTX 2060 Super XC Ultra. First, I increased temperature and power targets to their maximum values; then I ran the utility. The card got an overall average of +76mhz on the core and bumped up the memory frequency an additional 200mhz. Of course, the GPU core offset is an average - some voltage points could be above or below that number.GeForce Experience Performance Tuning Utility (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)If we compare those results to my manual overclocking with MSI Afterburner, I can push the GPU core to a +100mhz core offset, and memory +500mhz at the very minimum. The OC is almost stable, the only issue I've encountered is one artifacting glitch in Rise of the Tomb Raider that never appeared again (strangely).The Nvidia utility is very conservative, not pushing memory or core frequencies anywhere near the limit of their capabilities. So expect excellent reliability from the program.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Image 1 of 2Performance Overlay/OSD Basic(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Performance Overlay/OSD Advanced(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Moving on, the last part of the monitoring tools is an overlay you can enable with the keybinding \"ALT+R.\" This option opens up an OSD with the same information as in the performance menu, but you can choose between a \"basic\" or \"advanced\" mode. The basic mode includes FPS, CPU, and GPU utilization data. But, if you switch over to advanced mode, the information extends to GPU power, GPU voltage, Fan Speed, GPU temperature, memory, and GPU clock speeds.Overall I'm impressed with these new features from Nvidia; they work flawlessly (even in the beta), and you don't have to worry about using 3rd party OSDs anymore. Finally, Nvidia graphics card owners have a counterpart to AMD's Radeon OSD with its new adrenaline drivers. Again, if you want to grab this new update right now, head over to your GeForce Experience app and enable \"Experimental Features.\" The new update supports GTX 900 series GPUs and higher, but the automatic overclocking utility is limited to RTX 20- and 30-series graphics cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more Monitors News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nrtx\nHardware\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (7)\n\n\n\nAaron KlotzSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAaron Klotz is a contributing writer for Tom\u2019s Hardware, covering news related to computer hardware such as CPUs, and graphics cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about monitors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can snag this 24-inch Asus TUF gaming monitor for $99 at Amazon \u2013 its lowest price to date\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewSonic XG2536 25-inch FHD IPS 280 Hz gaming monitor review: Incredibly quick and value priced\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina will enforce clear flagging of all AI generated content starting from September\n\n\n\nSee more latest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Comments\n\nComment from the forums\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvar \"Miles\" Udell\n\n\nIn my experience with it, with my EVGA 2070 Super XC Ultra, it only gave me a +86mhz to core and 0mhz to memory, even with the power and voltages set to max, which is a far cry from the 150mhz clock and 600mhz memory I can get in EVGA Precision X1, so OCing is still best left to the vendor programs.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCydramech\n\n\nI enabled experimental features, but I don't see the Performance tab anywhere (Alt+R also doesn't do anything while in-game).

By\u00a0Laura LovettSeptember 14, 202002:40 pm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSilicon Valley tech giant NVIDIA, which is best known as a hardware company for graphic processing units, is one of the latest companies to look into the telemedicine space.\u00a0\nResearchers at the company are working on an automated speech recognition and natural language processing technology that can transcribe and organize information from a telemedicine visit both for the patient and clinicians. The tool is specifically trained to understand clinical and biomedical language. The application framework, dubbed Jarvis, is not yet on the market but is available for early access.\nYesterday research data about the tool was presented at the Conference on Machine Intelligence in Medical Imaging. The data demonstrated promising results about the tech's ability to accurately automate a speech recognition system that captures clinical names.\u00a0\nWhile the initial research has been focused on transcribing for telemedicine, in the future there could be other medical applications for the technology.\u00a0\n\"This particular one was trained on large biomedical text and then a smaller set of clinical text ... but if we had a large amount of clinical notes like radiologist reports then the language processing trained on them would be kick-ass on recognizing radiologists reports\" Hoo-Chang Shin, research scientist at NVIDIA, told MobiHealthNews. \"It would be so much better at transcribing radiologist reports and also we have even more recognition of named entities or disease names, or possibly planned treatments, and so on.\"\nWHY IT MATTERS\u00a0\nResearchers at NVIDIA are pitching this as a way to help patients leave telemedicine visits with more information and notes.\nShin, who served as the lead researcher on the project, gave the example, of using telemedicine when his three-year old daughter got a potentially dangerous bug bite.\u00a0\n\"The doctor wanted me to show [my daughter's] leg on the web. I was holding my webcam with one hand and with the other hand I'm holding my daughter's swollen leg,\" Shin said. \"As he was seeing my daughter's leg he was saying what could have possibly happened \u2013what kind of bug might have bitten her, what kind of drug to apply to her infected area, and what kinds of drugs she needs to take to prevent further swelling. It went so fast.\u00a0My two hands were tied with the webcam and my daughter's leg so I couldn't write it down.\"\nWhile Shin comes from a tech savvy background, Dr. Mona Flores, Global Head of Medical AI at NVIDIA, argued that this tool could be most effective for patients who have less of a background in tech.\n\"You can imagine an 80-year old trying to do the same and how difficult it would be for them to gather everything that they need, and to document, and remember what happened, and can go and ask questions or share what they learned from their doctor with a loved one or the family,\" she told MobiHealthNews. \"You can image a platform like this is very useful the more technically challenged you are ... You don't have to worry about taking notes. Whether you are the physician, or patient for that matter, you can come back to a faithful transcription of what's happened and be able to ingest it at your own pace.\"\nTHE LARGER TREND\nThis is hardly NVIDIA's first time in the healthcare space. Much of its efforts have centered on radiology. In 2018, it released its AI platform, called Clara, that uses AI to create a virtual medical imaging platform. Then in 2019 it launched the Clara AI toolkit for radiologists, which included 13 classifications, and also segmentation AI and software tools.\nIt has also dipped into the genomics space. In October of 2018 it teamed up with Scripps Research Translational Institute\u00a0on an AI and deep learning tool to help analyze genomic and digital health sensor data.\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0Nvidia, Jarvis, speech recognition, automatic speech recognition, telemedicine\n\n\n\n\n\nMore regional news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisp, Origin partner to expand women's healthcare accessBy Jessica HagenMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrain.space secures $11M to grow its mental model platformBy Anthony VecchioneMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFarmboxRx unveils social needs platform for non-health related itemsBy Anthony VecchioneMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Study: Brain-computer interface allows paralyzed man to control robotic arm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor's Pick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Proposed legislation paves the way for AI to prescribe drugs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Walgreens to pay nearly $1B in COVID-19 test contract case  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n AI will continue to play a key role in healthcare but with caveats \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Highlights of HIMSS25 Smart Health Transformation Forum  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exclusive: 'STOP COVID-19' study will examine the accuracy of at-home tests \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hinge Health files for IPO amid stock market volatility \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Wisp, Origin partner to expand women's healthcare access \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Brain.space secures $11M to grow its mental model platform \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n FarmboxRx unveils social needs platform for non-health related items \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Hyperfine, NVIDIA team up to enhance AI-driven portable imaging technology \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Connecticut Children's, Xerox partner on AI-powered care delivery initiative  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Digital Medicine Society, Google Health launch free course on genAI  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Private insurer Medibank adds telehealth to portfolio and more briefs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Cigna teaming with Carrot on fertility access \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore News\nHealthcare IT News\nHealthcare IT News Australia\nHealthcare Finance News\nHIMSS TV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobiHealthNews\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd MobiHealthNews to your network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIMSS25 Global Health Conference & ExhibitionGet ready to immerse yourself in the epicenter of healthcare innovation at the 2025 HIMSS Global Health Conference & Exhibition in Las Vegas!March 3-6, 2025   |   Las Vegas, NVLearn More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIMSS25 European Health Conference & ExhibitionGet ready for knowledge-sharing, all the latest innovations, and in-depth demos with Europe's most influential healthcare community.10 - 12 June, 2025 | ParisLearn More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Menu\nAbout\nAdvertise\nReprints\nContact\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2025 MobiHealthNews is a publication of HIMSS Media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\nVideo\nProvider\nPayer\nPharma\nConsumer\nInvestor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCareer\nEvents\nJobs\nLearning Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\nAbout\nAdvertise\nContact\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegions\n\n\nANZ \n\nASIA \n\nEMEA \n\nGlobal Edition \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobiHealthNews:\nThe latest news in digital health delivered daily to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch form\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Study: Brain-computer interface allows paralyzed man to control robotic arm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Health2Sync eyes Taiwan IPO with $20M Series C fund \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Melbourne-based Heidi Health to expand AI scribe capability with new $17M fund \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)In a surprising turn of events, Nvidia today announced that it's completely killed its current model of SLI, which lets your system run more than one Nvidia graphics cards simultaneously for greater performance.\u00a0Nvidia has transferred all SLI implementation responsibilities to the game developer and game engine and won't release new SLI driver profiles for the RTX 20-series and older GPUs starting January 1.\"For GeForce RTX 3090 and future SLI-capable GPUs, SLI will only be supported when implemented natively within the game,\" Nvidia said. DirectX12 games that already support SLI natively in-game include Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Civilization VI, Sniper Elite 4, Gears of War 4, Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation and Hitman, Nvida noted.\n\nWhat does this mean for SLI? Nvidia hasn't done SLI any favors over the past several years. The GTX 900-series was the final architecture by Nvidia to fully support SLI in its entirety, specifically 3-way and 4-way SLI configurations.\u00a0Beginning with Pascal, Nvidia started strangling SLI. It began with locking out 3-way and 4-way SLI by requiring a special software key. Eventually, Nvidia dropped the requirement for this software key and, instead, limited these configurations to benchmarks only. Then, Turing debuted and cut off anything beyond 3-card SLI configurations, limiting the RTX 2080 and RTX 2080 Ti to 2-way SLI.\u00a0Now, with Ampere, Nvidia has limited SLI to the RTX 3090, which is poised to be one of if not the best graphics card on the market upon release. But there's good reason for this. Since its inception, SLI has been riddled with bugs, crashes and inconsistent frame times, resulting in choppy gameplay. Getting the tech working correctly requires a lot of optimization from the game developer and from Nvidia. Additionally, there isn't a large market of PC gamers running more than one graphics card in their PC.\u00a0With Nvidia dropping SLI support for the RTX 3080 and below, Nvidia can free up resources, allowing its driver teams to work on other things. You might get performance improvements due to low-level API support. Nvidia has stated that SLI's only purpose right now is to make the fastest gaming rigs in the world, and this is a good way to keep that going.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (20)\n\n\n\nAaron KlotzSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAaron Klotz is a contributing writer for Tom\u2019s Hardware, covering news related to computer hardware such as CPUs, and graphics cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about gpus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 50-series GPU scalping extends to system integrators \u2014 over $3,000 for a RTX 5090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI skips RDNA 4 and will not manufacture AMD Radeon 9000-series GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina will enforce clear flagging of all AI generated content starting from September\n\n\n\nSee more latest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20 Comments\n\nComment from the forums\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXxDarkMario20xX\n\n\nIt was going to happen one day they could of made this an great thing but they ruined it and now stores will have these SLI things and cant sell them as much\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhotaru.hino\n\n\nI feel like it should've been this way from the beginning. \n\nBut rendering frames in real-time is a rather different beast than other applications that scale up with more processing power.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlle P\n\n\nGiven that SLI has been on a downward slope for about 20 years it's more surprising that they haven't officially killed it sooner.\nIf anything, having a well functioning SLI could have been useful over the last five years or so, as cost/performance in graphics has stayed the same. Could have been nice to buy a $250 card, wait two years and buy another one of a newer version (but only marginally better than the old card) and add them together to get better performance. But oh no, Nvidia wanted you to spend $500 to get that level of performance...\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nedwilson\n\n\nI was a major SLI supporter all the way back to Voodoo 2. Most recently with 2x 1070. However I noticed significant lack vendor support starting a few years ago. It is my understanding that one person at Nvidia in particular was the driving force behind SLI gaming who has now left around that time. We were always a niche market but it was fun while it lasted. I was able to extend the gaming life span of every machine I built by at least 2 years simply by adding a 2nd card when time came. When it worked correctly and was supported , it was like strapping on a supercharger to your PC. RIP SLI. It was fun while it lasted.

That's going to be a problem\n        \n          Broadcom makes a $61 billion play for VMware\n        VMware and Nvidia are integrating the latter's artificial intelligence applications for unified management of apps, security and data processing unit accelerators. The partnership secures Nvidia's role in hybrid clouds as VMware outlined an architecture that incorporates data processing units (DPUs) in the data center, cloud and edge. Specifically, AI software on Nvidia's NGC hub will be integrated into VMware vSphere, Cloud Foundation and Tanzu. Both companies said the bet was that the integration would be able to speed up AI adoption in enterprises. Krish Prasad, general manager of VMware's cloud platform business, said \"AI workloads no longer need any kind of specialized set up based on bare metal or specialized tools to run it.\"VMware and Nvidia also said they will partner on Project Monterey to create an architecture based on SmartNIC technology and include Nvidia's programmable BlueField-2 DPU to support machine learning and data-focused apps.   Manuvir Das, head of enterprise computing at Nvidia, said:There is a set of companies using AI a lot and at scale and they have differentiated themselves. Our belief is that we should make AI available to the broader set of companies so they can benefit from AI too. It doesn't matter what industry you're in, if you have access to AI you can make your product and customer experience better.How Nvidia built Selene, the world's seventh-fastest computer, in three weeksIt's official: Nvidia purchases Arm in $40 billion dealNvidia's acquisition of Arm strengthens its ecosystem, brings economies of scale to the cloud, expansion to the edgeNvidia's $40 billion Arm bet all about data centers, edge computing, AIUnder the partnership, the companies outlined the following integrations. The integration of Nvidia NGC with VMware vSphere and Cloud Foundation will simplify the use of AI workloads using containers and virtual machines.   Data scientists, researchers and developers will get access to NGC's cloud GPU optimized containers, models and software developer kits. NGC software is supported on a set of pre-tested Nvidia A100 servers from vendors like Dell Technologies, HPE and Lenovo. Collaboration on the hybrid cloud architecture will support a new security model that offloads hypervisor, networking, security and storage tasks from the CPU to the DPU. VMware will extend the VMware Cloud Foundation model to bare metal servers. Project Monterey is in technical preview and features the Nvidia Bluefield 2 DPU with VMware Cloud Foundation.

Oracle\u2019s latest GPU instances enable customers in industries such as automotive and aerospace to run complex, data-intensive, high-performance applications like modeling and simulations more efficiently and at a lower cost than ever before. Get started here.\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure, running the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs on bare metal instances, can run complex AI models and deep learning systems between two-and-a-half to six times faster than instances featuring previous generations of GPUs. When running on Oracle Cloud, the new A100 GPU can help enterprises unlock more value from their data and innovate faster, enabling important breakthroughs such as testing and developing new medications, building safer airplanes, and quickly sourcing natural resources. Additionally, customers can for the first time run their complex HPC applications using GPUDirect over NVIDIA Mellanox RDMA networking, which enables clusters of thousands of GPUs, connected with microsecond latency, to deliver massive computational power on-demand.\n\u201cSince its inception, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has standardized on NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs, beginning with the Pascal generation, moving to Volta and now with Ampere. Our customers demand the best of on-premises with all the benefits of the cloud, which is what we\u2019re delivering with our latest GPU instance running on NVIDIA\u2019s latest A100 GPU,\u201d said Karan Batta, vice president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. \u201cWe have the largest, most performant, and most cost effective A100 offering in the cloud because we offer double the memory and more local storage than competitors. This is the GPU instance customers have been waiting for to move to the cloud and deliver important breakthroughs.\u201d\n\u201cAccelerated computing is essential to driving research breakthroughs for enterprises across all industries,\u201d said Ian Buck, general manager and vice president of Accelerated Computing at NVIDIA. \u201cBy bringing the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs into its cloud service, and offering the ability to scale to more than 500 GPUs interconnected with Mellanox networking, Oracle is providing the computing performance needed to accelerate the most critical work being done today in AI and high performance computing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\nThe new bare metal instance, GPU4.8, features eight NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs with 40 GB of memory each, all interconnected via NVIDIA NVLink\u2122.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Marco Chiappetta is a technologist who covers semiconductors and AI.Follow AuthorSep 28, 2020, 06:17pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.The Palit GeForce RTX 3080 GamingPro 10G OCPalit\nOne of the technologies NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang unveiled during the GeForce RTX 30-series launch event was NVIDIA Reflex. For those unfamiliar with it, NVIDIA Reflex is latency reduction technology that\u2019s designed to minimize input lag, sometimes called input latency or end-to-end latency. That\u2019s a fancy way of defining how long it takes for something to happen on-screen after a mouse click or keyboard input.\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex works by streamlining a few steps along the rendering pipeline to reduce overall latency. NVIDIA\u2019s software tweaks to enable Reflex make more efficient use of available CPU and GPU resources and minimize driver overhead, which according to NVIDIA, can reduce latency by up to 50% in games that are updated to properly support the technology. That means when a gamer clicks their mouse button to fire a weapon or whips their mouse around to get in a better position with NVIDIA Reflex enabled in a compatible title, in happens faster in-game.\nNVIDIA Reflex Performance In Call Of Duty.NVIDIA\n\nDuring the GeForce 30-series unveiling, Jensen announced that Reflex Low-Latency Mode is currently being integrated into some esports games, like Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Warzone, Fortnite and Valorant, but that others would be coming. And some new titles are here. With today\u2019s GeForce Game Ready driver release (v456.55), and updates coming to Call of Duty: Warzone and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare at 10pm PT tonight, users with the latest GeForce RTX and older GeForce GTX 900 (and-newer GPUs) will see significant latency reductions.\n\nAccording to data posted by NVIDIA, GeForce RTX 3080 cards will see end-to-end latency reductions in the 7% range, while RTX 2060 Super will see reductions of approximately 15% and GeForce GTX 1660 Super of about 17%. Keep in mind, however, that NVIDIA\u2019s testing was performed at 1440P, with maximum image quality settings, and a powerful Core i9-10900K and 144Hz display backing the GPUs. Systems capable of higher (or lower) framerates will exhibit different latency characteristics.\n\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA and AMD have both introduced latency reduction features before, but NVIDIA has added a couple of additional wrinkles this time around. A new NVIDIA Reviewer\u2019s Toolkit includes custom hardware and software to help measure latency (which has traditionally been very difficult) and perhaps foreshadows some major advantages down the road. And upcoming ultra-high refresh rate displays will include hardware built-in to monitor latency as well, which is a first for the industry.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Priced at $699, the GeForce RTX 3080 is twice as fast as the GeForce RTX 2080 and is a 4K gaming champion. But the\u00a0true\u00a0flagship of the Ampere family is actually the GeForce RTX 3090, which can drive certain games at 60fps at a stunning 8K resolution.\r\n\n\nWe already knew that the GeForce RTX 3090 would be arriving tomorrow, September 24th, but NVIDIA is further driving that point home with a new blog post. If you thought that it was nearly impossible to get a GeForce RTX 3080 last week when it launched, your fortunes will likely be much worse if you're attempting to purchase the GeForce RTX 3090, which is priced at an eye watering $1,499.\n\n\n\"Since we built GeForce RTX 3090 for a unique group of users, like the TITAN RTX before it, we want to apologize upfront that this will be in limited supply on launch day,\" said NVIDIA. \"We know this is frustrating, and we\u2019re working with our partners to increase the supply in the weeks to come.\nNVIDIA Titan RTX rendering and compute performance versus GeForce RTX 3090 (Click to Enlarge)\n\n\nGiven the high price tag of the GeForce RTX 3090, perhaps the scalpers won\u2019t be as bad as they were during the GeForce RTX 3080 launch, but\u00a0we aren\u2019t holding our collective breath.\nAs for performance, NVIDIA is giving us a little preview by indicating that the GeForce RTX 3090 is up to 50 percent faster than the preceding Titan RTX in compute performance. Compared to the GeForce RTX 3080, NVIDIA says that it is 10 to 15 percent faster on average in 4K gaming benchmarks.\u00a0\n\n\nThat last figure is a bit eyebrow-raising to us considering that the GeForce RTX 3080 is priced at\u00a0just\u00a0$699, which means that the GeForce RTX 3090 is over twice as expensive. So, you\u2019re paying twice the price for at most a 15 percent gain in gaming performance? Perhaps NVIDIA is downplaying performance a bit, but we\u2019ll likely see tomorrow when embargos start lifting on reviews for this new 8K gaming beast.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, (nasdaq:nvda), ampere, geforce rtx 3080, geforce rtx 3090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

The x86 platform remains the leader in PCs and data centers, but the future growth prospects lie in edge computing, the internet of things (IoT), and mobile devices \u2014 where Arm\u2019s designs excel. Should this deal go through, the new post-acquisition NVIDIA will be in a prime position to capture that growth.\nThe deal must still clear many hurdles, the thorniest of which will be the approvals from several governments. Since the UK approved Arm\u2019s sale to SoftBank back in 2016, it is likely to also approve this move. Antitrust concerns should be muted. While NVIDIA is already a major growth story, Intel, AMD, Broadcom, and others remain powerfully competitive in the semiconductor market. Despite this, China and the EU will likely take dimmer views of a US firm acquiring Arm and must also approve the deal, as must the US.\nWhy would NVIDIA pay more than 27 times revenue for Arm?\nThis deal is about future revenue and growth, not about past performance. Investors agree. While NVIDIA\u2019s annual revenue is $13.065 billion and Arm\u2019s is a mere $1.441 billion, the combo already has a significant enterprise value lead over Intel despite Intel\u2019s huge revenue advantage at $78.95 billion.\nNVIDIA already has a strong footprint in data centers with its GPUs. These GPUs act as companions to general purpose processors like x86 and Arm \u2014 they cannot effectively function as a stand-alone. Buying Arm allows NVIDIA to control the full processing capability \u2014 powering everything from tiny IoT devices to the data center and cloud to supercomputers.\nNVIDIA won\u2019t kill the goose that lays the golden eggs \nThere\u2019s potential for strategic peril in this deal, to be sure. Arm\u2019s success is built on being the Switzerland of silicon and licensing its designs to giants like Apple, Samsung, and Qualcomm. NVIDIA could tamper with Arm in ways that alienate these licensees. NVIDIA could start competing with those licensees or keep Arm\u2019s best designs for itself. This heavy-handed approach seems unlikely, however; NVIDIA\u2019s savvy CEO addressed this issue during his announcement. Ultimately, the synergies between NVIDIA and Arm technologies will be recognized in the medium term \u2014 for example, making chip technologies that improve the AI and graphics capabilities of endpoint devices, licensed as they have always been to OEMs.\nYou\u2019ll see some growth in Arm workloads in the cloud . . .\nForrester\u2019s data indicates that traditional infrastructure spending will decline in 2020, and 2021 also looks anemic. Firms are accelerating their moves to cloud-based services like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Alibaba Cloud. Cloud providers are already offering Arm-based instances such as AWS Graviton, but migrating workloads from x86 to Arm is difficult. Thus, technology leaders should not expect massive growth in Arm workloads via the cloud hyperscalers. We believe more potential exists in edge computing.\n. . . but the biggest growth opportunities for NVIDIA + Arm are at the edge\nThe edge computing market is still in an early stage, so the opportunity is there for any vendor and any platform. Because it has almost no inertia, it is a perfect breeding ground for Arm. It is especially attractive for AI. Enterprises see the value of distributing automated decision making to the edge \u2014 where the data exists and the actions take place. Many AI workloads are now in public cloud services, but we see evidence of a strong migration to not necessarily replace cloud but to augment it at the edge. As this AI migration happens, GPUs and other specialized chips will be needed. A likely outcome of this technology combo will be hybrid CPU-GPU processors optimized for such workloads.\nDon\u2019t underestimate the power of sustainable compute\nData centers \u2014 and technology in general \u2014 are voracious consumers of electrical power and cooling energy. With so many enterprises now taking sustainability seriously, we need to embrace tech that is more planet-friendly. Arm processors consume less power than other designs, which is why you find Arm designs in 95% of the world\u2019s smartphones. Data centers equipped with Arm processors should be more efficient. Edge devices will outnumber data center processors by multiple orders of magnitude. Using Arm chips for those devices will reduce the aggregate power load that they might otherwise have created. And Arm-powered PCs are coming, with Apple\u2019s announcement the most notable recent move. Even x86 stalwart Microsoft has now embraced Windows on Arm.\nGeopolitical tensions will complicate the Arm advantage\nThe ongoing US-China trade war is forcing Chinese companies to abandon US-based technologies and vice versa. As a result, Chinese tech vendors are moving away from x86 to Arm-based processors, many of their own design. Chinese licensing for ARMv8 remains secured, but future designs are at risk because NVIDIA is a US-based company. Thus, Chinese vendors are pursuing a difficult and risky path and developing their own processor architectures.\nx86 and Arm are not the only designs in town\nA few other platforms hold promise as alternatives. Leading contenders include the Power architecture that IBM open-sourced to the Linux Foundation in 2019 and the open RISC-V architecture. Vendors face monumental hurdles in this pursuit, but if they succeed, the shift will erode US firms\u2019 semiconductor dominance.\nC-level technology executives and teams: Don\u2019t panic\nThis deal isn\u2019t expected to close before late 2021 (at the earliest). Until then, product codevelopment between NVIDIA and Arm will be restricted to a classic partnership.
