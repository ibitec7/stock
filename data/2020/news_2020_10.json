Expected to come online by year end, the \u201cCambridge-1\u201d supercomputer will be an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD\u2122 system capable of delivering more than 400 petaflops of AI performance and 8 petaflops of Linpack performance, which would rank it No. 29 on the latest TOP500 list of the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputers. It will also rank among the world\u2019s top 3 most energy-efficient supercomputers on the current Green500 list. Among the first pharmaceutical companies to harness Cambridge-1 for research will be GSK and AstraZeneca. Additionally, researchers from Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, King\u2019s College London and Oxford Nanopore Technologies plan to take advantage of the system. \u201cTackling the world\u2019s most pressing challenges in healthcare requires massively powerful computing resources to harness the capabilities of AI,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, in his GPU Technology Conference keynote. \u201cThe Cambridge-1 supercomputer will serve as a hub of innovation for the U.K., and further the groundbreaking work being done by the nation\u2019s researchers in critical healthcare and drug discovery.\u201d NVIDIA has previously announced that it intends to create an AI Center of Excellence in Cambridge, featuring a new Arm-based supercomputer, which will serve as a hub of collaboration for AI researchers, scientists and startups across the U.K. As these plans develop, Cambridge-1 will become a part of that Center of Excellence, which will expand to include further supercomputers, and support more industries across the U.K. Four Key Focus AreasThe system\u2019s mission is to support and further enable the U.K. ecosystem of healthcare and life science researchers, which has become an epicenter for transformative healthcare research and discovery. Its four key focus areas will be: Joint industry research \u2014 Solving large-scale healthcare and data-science problems which otherwise could not be tackled due to their size, resulting in improved patient outcomes, increased success rates and decreased overall healthcare costs.University-granted compute time \u2014 Access to NVIDIA GPU time will be donated as a resource to specific studies to contribute to the hunt for cures.Support AI startups \u2014 NVIDIA will provide opportunities to learn \u2014 and it will collaborate with startups to nurture the next generation and provide early access to AI tools.Educate future AI practitioners \u2014 The system will serve as a destination for world-class researchers and provide hands-on experiences to the next generation. Cambridge-1 AI Cambridge-1 will be the first NVIDIA supercomputer designed and built for external research access. Powered by 80 NVIDIA DGX A100\u2122 systems connected by NVIDIA Mellanox\u00ae InfiniBand networking, it will give researchers and academics the ability to tackle some of the most challenging AI training, inference and data science workloads at scale. While traditional supercomputers can take years to deploy, the modular DGX SuperPOD architecture enables the system to be installed and operational in as little as a few weeks. NVIDIA will invest around \u00a340 million ($51.7 million) in Cambridge-1. NVIDIA Clara for Computational Drug DiscoveryNVIDIA will help researchers take advantage of NVIDIA Clara Discovery\u2122, a state-of-the-art suite of tools optimized for NVIDIA DGX\u2122 that brings together the power of imaging, radiology and genomics to develop AI applications for the biggest computational tasks of healthcare. It features pre-trained AI models and application-specific frameworks to help researchers define the next generation of drug discovery processes, from finding targets to building compounds to developing responses. Using a recent breakthrough in natural language processing, researchers can now leverage biomedical-specific language models to organize, understand and activate large datasets, research literature and sort through papers or patents on existing treatments and other important real-world data. Supercharging Healthcare Research with UK\u2019s LeadersTop pharmaceutical companies, tech startups and members of academia and research plan to use Cambridge-1 for solo and joint projects that expand the boundaries of science \u2014 pushing for better patient care, diagnosis and delivery of critical medicines and vaccines around the world. Each has a vision for modern healthcare with AI driving wider leaps in existing protocols and practices: Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President, R&D, GSK: \u201cAI and machine learning are like a new microscope that will help scientists to see things that they couldn\u2019t see otherwise. NVIDIA\u2019s investment in computing, combined with the power of deep learning, will enable solutions to some of the life sciences industry\u2019s greatest challenges and help us continue to deliver transformational medicines and vaccines to patients. Together with GSK\u2019s new AI lab in London, I am delighted that these advanced technologies will now be available to help the U.K.\u2019s outstanding scientists.\u201d James Weatherall, Ph.D., Head of Data Science and AI, AstraZeneca: \u201cThe use of big data, supercomputing and artificial intelligence have the potential to transform research and development; from target identification through clinical research and all the way to the launch of new medicines.\u201d Sebastien Ourselin, Head, School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences at King's College London: \u201cRecent advances in AI have seen increasingly powerful models being used for complex tasks such as image recognition and natural language understanding. These models have achieved previously unimaginable performance by using an unprecedented scale of computational power, amassing millions of GPU hours per model. Through this partnership, for the first time, such a scale of computational power will be available to healthcare research \u2014 it will be truly transformational for patient health and treatment pathways.\u201d Dr. Ian Abbs, Chief Executive and Chief Medical Officer of Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust: \u201cIf AI is to be deployed at scale for patient care, then accuracy, robustness and safety are of paramount importance. We need to ensure AI researchers have access to the largest and most comprehensive datasets that the NHS has to offer, our clinical expertise, and the required computational infrastructure to make sense of the data. This approach is not only necessary, but also the only ethical way to deliver AI in healthcare \u2014 more advanced AI means better care for our patients.\u201d Gordon Sanghera, CEO, Oxford Nanopore Technologies: \u201cCompact AI has enabled real-time sequencing in the palm of your hand, and AI supercomputers are enabling new scientific discoveries in large-scale genomic datasets. These complementary innovations in data analysis support a wealth of impactful science in the U.K. and, critically, support our goal of bringing genomic analysis to anyone, anywhere.\u201d Matt Hancock, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement from NVIDIA is an exciting moment for the U.K.\u2019s world-leading healthcare industry and a tremendous vote of confidence in the U.K. as an international centre for research, AI and innovation. Accelerating drug discovery has never been so important and it is investments like this that can make a real difference in our fight against countless diseases. I care about technology because I care about people and NVIDIA\u2019s new supercomputer will aid the U.K.\u2019s best and brightest to undertake research that will save lives.\u201d About NVIDIANVIDIA\u2018s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined modern computer graphics and revolutionized parallel computing.

Technology companies by their very nature are innovators, and that means every once in a while, one them captures lightning in a bottle. Like the iPhone, or the Echo smart speaker, or services we take for granted today like streaming video.\u00a0\nSpeaking of the iPhone and Echo, the companies behind those products have been in the spotlight for years. To realize the big gains from tech stocks, the key is pick a company that has promise \u2014 but has yet to blow up in a huge way.\nHere are a few such companies to consider:\n\n\nAlibaba\u00a0(NYSE:BABA)\nSalesforce.com(NYSE:CRM)\nDocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU)\nFastly (NYSE:FSLY)\nJD.Com (NASDAQ:JD)\nNVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\nAlarm.com\u00a0(NASDQ:ALRM)\nEnphase Energy\u00a0(NASDAQ:ENPH)\n\nEach of these has the potential to be among the top tech stocks for those looking to invest in tomorrow\u2019s next big thing.\n\nAlibaba (BABA)\n\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn a sense, Alibaba doesn\u2019t really belong on this list. The Chinese e-commerce giant is already in an elite group of high-performance tech stocks. With BABA stock repeatedly closing at all-time highs in October, the company\u2019s market capitalization now sits at $858 billion. The trillion dollar market cap club is within sight.\nHowever, the reason I have Alibaba on this list is its position in China \u2014 and potential for massive growth.\u00a0\nPrior to the novel coronavirus pandemic, Alibaba was primarily active in larger cities and with non-perishable goods. However, as the Wall Street Journal reports, the pandemic resulted in more Chinese consumers signing up for Alibaba accounts.\nThe company experienced serious growth in smaller cities. It also made inroads in home delivery of fresh food including fruits and vegetables.\nAlibaba has reached its current level of success by focusing on large urban centers. Just imagine what the future growth for BABA stock will be now that it\u2019s making inroads in smaller cities \u2014 where over 70% of China\u2019s population lives. \u00a0\nThe icing on the cake? Alibaba owns a 33% equity stake in Ant Financial \u2014 which is set for a coming IPO that could raise a record $34 billion.\n\nSalesforce.com (CRM)\n\n\nSource: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com\n\nCustomer relationship management (CRM) software began to gain speed as cloud computing entered the mix, making it easier have employees at multiple locations all feeding into the same system. Salesforce.com, which was founded in 1999, has been a CRM pioneer and remains the market leader.\nLast year, Gartner published a report on CRM software showing that it is \u201cboth the largest and the fastest growing enterprise application software category.\u201d Global CRM spending in 2018 was up 15.6% to hit $48.2 billion. With a 19.5% market share in 2018 (up from 18.3% the previous year), Salesforce.com had more than double the CRM revenue of its closest competitor.\nThat performance has already boosted CRM stock. From the start of 2017 to the end of last year, it gained 141%. That was nothing compared to 2020.\nThe pandemic \u2014 and the realization that client relationship management needs to be able to survive a remote work environment \u2014 has naturally increased investment in CRM tools. As a result, in the second quarter, Salesforce.com delivered results that Bank of America analyst Kash Rangan described as \u201cstupendous.\u201d\nUntil the September tech stock selloff, CRM stock was up 82% so far in 2020. It has yet to recover from that dip. This makes Saleforce.com an even more tempting investment if you want tech stocks in your portfolio set for big future growth.\n\nDocuSign (DOCU)\n\n\nSource: David Tran Photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nDocuSign is another company that has seen adoption of its technology greatly accelerated by the pandemic. Electronic signatures were beginning to make headway, but with people working from home and social distancing in effect? Signing documents the old-school way is no longer just inconvenient, it can be risky.\nMore importantly for future growth, now that DocuSign\u2019s eSignature is being widely adopted, it\u2019s going to remain in use. No one is going to want to go back to having to travel or courier documents around for hand signatures when they can get an eSignature instantly.\nDOCU stock had seen modest growth over the past two years. In 2020, it\u2019s been explosive. DOCU started the year at $66.37 and closed at $268.80 on September 1. That\u2019s an impressive 305% gain in just eight months.\nLike many tech stocks, DocuSign shares took a hit after the September selloff. Now trading under $220, the decline just makes DOCU stock all the more attractive.\nJust two days ago, Baird Analyst\u00a0 William Power initiated coverage on DOCU stock with an Outperform rating and $280 price target, noting that, \u201cThe company has established itself as the global eSignature leader, which should drive broader growth opportunities over time.\u201d\n\nFastly (FSLY)\n\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nI have an upcoming close-up on Fastly, the edge computing specialist. FSLY earns an \u2018A\u2019 rating in Portfolio Grader, and shows tremendous potential for growth.\nThe pandemic rapidly boosted demand for edge computing services. This is a distributed model that brings data centers closer to the areas where services are being used. Doing so makes for websites and internet services that are much faster \u2014 and everyone wants faster data, whether working from home, online shopping, streaming movies or playing a video game.\nFastly investors saw huge gains this year. Up until three weeks ago, their shares had gained nearly 500% since the start of the year.\nFSLY stock is currently a real buying opportunity. It\u2019s been hit hard in October because it\u2019s set to miss its third quarter revenue guidance. However, that is largely attributable to the challenges faced by in the U.S. by TikTok. The Chinese video sharing service just happens to be Fastly\u2019s largest customer.\nHowever, Fastly is much more than one customer and the demand for edge computing services is only going to grow.\n\nJD.Com (JD)\n\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nJD.com is another of China\u2019s e-commerce giants. The company describes itself as \u201cChina\u2019s largest online retailer and its biggest overall retailer, as well as the country\u2019s biggest Internet company by revenue.\u201d\nLast year\u2019s annual 6.18 sale event was a record-breaker for JD.com, with $29.2 billion in transaction volume. The sheer size of JD.com\u2019s market and growth potential is huge, of course. China is a massive country, and it\u2019s still early in the curve in terms of mass adoption of online shopping. All that points to ongoing growth potential for JD stock.\nHowever, I want to point out a future-looking aspect of JD.com\u2019s business. Delivery. The company has spent money to ensure it can deliver to China\u2019s vast population. During that 6.18 sale last year, JD.com said that 91% of orders from its fulfillment warehouses were delivered the same or next day. In 2017, the Harvard Business Review featured this focus on delivery:\n\u201cOne of the reasons JD stood out from the competition and expanded rapidly was due to heavy-investment in own logistics network and continuous efforts in supply chain improvement.\u201d\nThe article also noted that the company is a pioneer in last mile autonomous delivery. On October 22, JD.com announced that will be the first company in the world to deploy level-4 autonomous delivery vehicles at scale. The company has an autonomous robot delivery system in operation in the city of Changshu, with plans to employ 100 autonomous delivery vehicles by the end of the year.\nAutonomous delivery is a key to future growth in online shopping, and also offers the prospect of cutting JD.com\u2019s delivery costs. JD stock has posted 113% growth so far in 2020, but I think this is one of those tech stocks that\u2019s just beginning to take off.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\n\nSource: Steve Lagreca / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipmaker Nvidia has always been a force in the PC and gaming markets, where Nvidia video cards are the market leader. PC sales have been sliding for a decade, but PC gaming remains popular, helping to keep Nvidia sales growing. In fact, when the company released its new RT30 series video cards in September, they sold out almost instantly. There were lineups outside of stores reminiscent of the iPhone launch glory days. In a pandemic.\nVideo cards have been good to Nvidia and NVDA stock. However, I\u2019m looking at \u201ctomorrow.\u201d For Nvidia, that\u2019s data centers \u2014 the massive computing power needed for futuristic tech like AI and autonomous driving. Nvidia bet big on this technology and it\u2019s paying off.\u00a0\nRemember when cryptocurrency miners snapped up every video card they could get their hands on to build massive, parallel processing rigs? That was a short-term boost for NVDA stock, followed by a big drop when the crypto currency market crashed.\nNvidia\u2019s data center business uses the same basic concept, but on a far larger \u2014 and commercial \u2014 scale. It leverages Nvidia\u2019s GPU expertise for parallel processing providing unprecedented computational power. In its last earnings report, data center revenue surpassed gaming for the first time in Nvidia\u2019s history.\nPCs and gaming got Nvidia to where it is today, but data centers are the future that will propel NVDA stock in its next big growth phase.\n\nAlarm.com (ALRM)\n\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nHome security and home automation is a market that has begun to take off in recent years.\nWireless video cameras and doorbell cameras are becoming increasingly popular with consumers. Add in professionally monitored home security systems and the market is currently valued at $53.6 billion. And it\u2019s projected to hit $78.9 billion by 2025.\nThe companies that make these cameras and the security companies that offer professional, monitored systems are the obvious winners. However, there\u2019s another big beneficiary in the mix, and it should be on your radar if you\u2019re looking for tech stocks with high potential for future growth.\nAlarm.com operates behind the scenes of these connected solutions. It provides a cloud-based platform that integrates all these different devices and systems, plus connects them to the internet for remote access and monitoring. It has also expanded into home automation, including remote control of heating and cooling systems.\u00a0\nAs more home security and home automation solutions become mainstream, demand for Alarm.com\u2019s connectivity solution will grow. ALRM stock has posted growth of 243% over the past five years, but I expect the potential for much bigger gains in the future.\n\nEnphase Energy (ENPH)\n\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast on my list of tech stocks that could be tomorrow\u2019s next big thing, we have Enphase Energy.\nOil and gas stocks have been big losers in 2020. They represent yesterday\u2019s energy sources and while no one is counting the sector out quite yet, it\u2019s clear that clean energy is the future. We\u2019ve seen that with the surge in electric car stocks. Investors in Enphase Energy have also been richly rewarded in 2020.\nEnphase energy specializes in solar home energy solutions. The company is a leader in the supply of the microinverters needed to connect solar panels to the electrical grid. Enphase has also expanded into home energy battery solutions and Wi-Fi monitoring of home solar installations.\nFor years, Enphase investors had to be patient. The time just wasn\u2019t right for home solar installations to make a big splash. ENPH stock started out 2019 in the $5.00 range.\nHowever, with growing awareness of climate change and the growing popularity of electric cars, home solar installations were increasingly in the spotlight. ENPH shares have rocketed in value, posting growth of over 2,000% since the start of 2019.\nWith investors dumping their oil and gas investments and looking to tomorrow, Enphase Energy is positioned to ride the solar wave to continued growth in the future.\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had long positions in BABA, DOCU, JD, NVDA and ENPH.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang took part in a Q&A session yesterday, rounding off the day's GTC schedule and was surprisingly candid about the GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 shortage situation.\n\nI've read a few summaries of the Q&A, like this one from CRN's Dylan Martin, but Tom's Hardware's Paul Alcorn looks to have delivered the fullest quote-packed coverage. On the topic of GeForce RTX 3000 series GPU shortages Hunag said \"I believe that demand will outstrip all of our supply through the year\". Instead of things getting better soon, Huang warned about the \"double whammy\u2026 Ampere holiday factor\" - a Christmas-time demand spike making cards even harder to hunt down.\nTrying to provide some unforeseen demand excuses for the inadequate stock levels, Huang sais that \"Retailers will tell you they haven't seen a phenomenon like this in over a decade of computing. It hearkens back to the old days of Windows 95 and Pentium when people were just out of their minds to buy this stuff,\" and thus \"we just weren't prepared for it.\" Meanwhile the Nvidia CEO assured that partners are ramping really hard and \"yields are great,\" but he can't really do much more to boost the supplies.\n\nOne might expect the upcoming GeForce RTX 3070 to offer even broader appeal and sell in much greater quantities. Recently Nvidia made the decision to delay the RTX 3070 launch by a fortnight. A larger day one stock level should give an adequate window to ordinary gamers and enthusiasts who are keen to purchase right away.

The development comprises 429 units on a 99-year leasehold and is integrated directly with PLQ Mall and three Grade-A office towers that span one million sq ft. The three components form Paya Lebar Quarter \u2014 a bustling sub-regional hub in the heart of the Paya Lebar enclave \u2014 which costs $3.7 billion and occupies over 4ha of land.    Park Place Residences comprises 429 units on a 99-year leasehold (Credit: Lendlease) Proof of the appeal of \u201clive, work and play\u201d, the development is now fully sold. Even on the first day of its Phase One launch in March 2017, homeowners had already snapped up 50% of the units launched at Park Place Residences. As a result of Lendlease\u2019s thoughtful placemaking, the development was awarded four titles at the annual EdgeProp Excellence Awards, recognised under the Design Excellence, Innovation Excellence, Sustainability Excellence and Top Development categories.    PLQ Mall is integrated directly with Park Place Residences\u00a0(Credit: Lendlease) Lendlease ensured that there were enough communal spaces across the whole PLQ precinct. About 100,000 sq ft of space in PLQ is dedicated to cycling tracks, lush greenery and public spaces. Even the facade of the carpark is not exempt to detail, with lush greenery traversing up its exterior.  PLQ is also cycling-friendly. Wide paths, for instance, link the development to nearby park connector networks. Cyclists can also use a sheltered overhead bridge to access PLQ\u2019s retail mall, three office towers and three private residential blocks via lifts large enough to fit bicycles. Notwithstanding visitors or residents at PLQ, office tenants at the precinct also get to enjoy cycling facilities: private bicycle lots and dedicated shower facilities are available, furnished with hair dryers and lockers.    Lounge and water facilities at Park Place Residences\u00a0(Credit: Lendlease) At Park Place Residences itself, the fifth floor of the development \u201cwas conceptualised around the idea of providing a community area\u201d, says the developer. Facilities on the ground include a 50m lap pool, an aqua-therapy pool area with lounge beds, kid\u2019s wading pool, and an outdoor dining terrace, among other indoor facilities like a fully air-conditioned gym and entertainment suite. Lendlease also emphasised on sustainability within PLQ. The development integrates smart terrace gardens, which direct and filter rainwater into the Geylang Canal. The public children\u2019s playground at PLQ is also inspired by a prominent Banyan tree that formerly grew at the site. Saplings from that Banyan tree are now replanted around Singapore with the assistance of NParks, a couple of which are also located at the entrance of PLQ 3, highlights Lendlease.   Story continues As PLQ is located within the culture-rich neighbourhood of Paya Lebar, Lendlease weaved the theme of the songket, a traditional Malay textile into the exterior of the development. For example, the vertical fin walls and horizontal ledges on the residential fa\u00e7ade form a recurring songket pattern to give the towers a \u201ccoherent appearance\u201d, says the developer. The exterior of its residential towers are a blend of bronze metal elements and grey wall surfaces, meant to emulate the gold and silver hues of the songket, Lendlease shares. Bronze elements are also seen in PLQ\u2019s retail and office towers facade.  The gym at the condo\u00a0(Credit: Lendlease)Homeowners at Park Place Residences were able to choose from two colour schemes for the interior of their homes \u2014 \u201cdark warm\u201d or \u201clight warm\u201d. Selections for the dark theme included dark engineered timber flooring in the bedrooms, and a black quartz countertop and dark brown cabinets in the kitchen. Homeowners could also pick light timber flooring in bedrooms, and a kitchen set comprising white and light brown kitchen cabinets alongside a light grey quartz countertop.So far, the latest transaction at Park Place Residences was for a 678 sq ft unit on the 8th floor, which was purchased for $1.39 million ($2,050 psf) on July 27, based on caveats lodged with URA. Prior to that, a 1,076 sq ft unit on the 14th floor transacted at $1.97 million ($1,830 psf).Check out the latest listings near:\u00a0Park Place Residences, Paya Lebar Quarter, Park Place Residences\u00a0See Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools CapitaLand, CDL and UOL clinch top prizes at EdgeProp Excellence Awards 2020 Nim Collection: Capitalising on air, light and space in design  Recognising Singapore\u2019s top real estate developments in a fast-changing environment  Sustainable waterfront living at Piermont Grand En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Now, those benefits are extending to Adobe Photoshop users with the introduction of GPU-accelerated neural filters.\nThese AI-powered tools, leveraging NVIDIA RTX GPUs with the Adobe creative applications, are being showcased at Adobe MAX, which is bringing together creators from around the world virtually through Oct. 22.\nNeural filters are a new feature set for artists to try AI-powered tools that enable them to explore creative ideas and make amazing, complex adjustments to images in just seconds. Done manually, these adjustments would take artists hours of tedious work. AI allows artists to make these changes almost instantaneously.\nNVIDIA GPUs accelerate nearly all these new filters. We\u2019ll explain how to get the most out of them at a session at Adobe MAX.\nAdobe and NVIDIA are closely collaborating on AI technology to improve creative tools in Creative Cloud and Photoshop. This collaboration includes the new Smart Portrait Filter, which is powered by NVIDIA StyleGAN2 technology and runs best on NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\nWith Smart Portrait in Photoshop, artists can easily experiment, making edits to facial characteristics, such as gaze direction and lighting angles, simply by dragging a slider. These types of complex corrections and adjustments would typically entail multiple manual steps. But Smart Portrait uses AI \u2014 based on a deep neural network developed by NVIDIA Research and trained on numerous portrait images \u2014 to achieve breathtaking results in seconds.\n\nThis gives artists greater flexibility with their images long after the photo shoot has ended. And they retain full control over their work with a non-destructive workflow, while the effects blend naturally into the original image.\nVideo editors in Adobe Premiere Pro also benefit from NVIDIA RTX GPUs with virtually all GPU-accelerated decoding offloaded to dedicated VRAM, resulting in smoother video playback and sharper responsiveness when scrubbing through footage, especially with ultra-high resolution and multistream footage. Advanced, AI-powered features such as Scene Edit Detection and Auto Reframe automate manual tasks, speeding up final exports and saving editors valuable time.\n\nFor the first time, Adobe Premiere Elements adds GPU acceleration to enable instant playback of popular video effects such as adding a lens flare or an animated overlay, cropping of videos, and overall playback in real-time, all without prerendering, rapidly speeding up the editing process.\nAI and GPU-accelerated workflows are the result of the ongoing collaboration between teams at NVIDIA and Adobe. Over the years, we\u2019ve developed tools and helped accelerate workflows in Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere Pro, After Effects, Illustrator, Dimension, Substance Alchemist, Substance Painter and Substance Designer. As Adobe continues to build amazing software experiences, NVIDIA will be there to power and accelerate them, giving creators more time for creativity.\nWorking Smarter: Tapping into AI to Boost Creativity\nAdobe is hosting more than 350 sessions across 10 tracks at this year\u2019s MAX conference.

The four mark the first of eight systems to be announced this year targeting spots among the world\u2019s 50 most powerful computers.\nTogether, they\u2019ll form a regional network, \u201can engine to power Europe\u2019s data economy,\u201d said EuroHPC, the group driving the effort, in a white paper outlining its goals.\nThe systems will apply AI and data analytics across scientific and commercial applications that range from fighting COVID-19 and climate change to the design of advanced airplanes, cars, drugs and materials.\nJoining Leonardo are a wave of new AI supercomputers planned for the Czech Republic, Luxembourg and Slovenia that will act as national centers of competence, expanding skills and creating jobs.\nNVIDIA GPUs, InfiniBand Power Latest Systems\nAll four supercomputers announced use NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs and NVIDIA Mellanox HDR InfiniBand networks to tap an ecosystem of hundreds of HPC and AI applications. Atos, an NVIDIA systems partner headquartered in France, will build three of the four systems; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will construct the fourth.\nThe new systems join 333 of the world\u2019s TOP500 supercomputers powered by NVIDIA GPUs, networking or both.\nNVIDIA GPUs accelerate 1,800 HPC applications, nearly 800 of them available today in the GPU application catalog and NGC, NVIDIA\u2019s hub for GPU-optimized software.\nThe new systems all use HDR 200Gb/s InfiniBand for low latency, high throughput and in-network computing. It\u2019s the latest version of InfiniBand, already powering supercomputers across Europe.\nA Brief Tour of Europe\u2019s Latest Supercomputers\nLeonardo will be the world\u2019s fastest AI supercomputer. Atos is harnessing nearly 14,000 NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs and HDR 200Gb/s InfiniBand networking to deliver a system with 10 exaflops of AI performance. It will use the InfiniBand Dragonfly+ network topology to deliver both flexibility and scalable performance.\nResearchers at CINECA will apply that power to advance science, simulating planetary forces behind climate change and molecular movements inside a coronavirus. The center is perhaps best known for its work on Quantum Espresso, a suite of open source codes for modeling nanoscale materials for jobs such as engineering better batteries.\nA new supercomputer in Luxembourg called MeluXina, also part of the EuroHPC network, will connect 800 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on HDR 200Gb/s InfiniBand links. The system, to be built by Atos and powered by green energy from wood waste, will pack nearly 500 petaflops of AI performance.\nMeluXina will address commercial applications and scientific research. It plans to offer access to users leveraging HPC and AI to advance work in financial services as well as manufacturing and healthcare.\nEastern Europe Powers Up\nThe new Vega supercomputer at the Institute of Information Science in Maribor, Slovenia, (IZUM) will be based on the Atos BullSequana XH2000 system. The supercomputer, named after Slovenian mathematician Jurij Vega, includes 240 A100 GPUs and 1,800 HDR 200Gb/s InfiniBand end points.\nVega will help \u201censure a new generation of experts and developers, as well as the wider Slovenian community, can meet new challenges within our national consortium and contribute to regional and European HPC initiatives,\u201d said Ale\u0161 Bo\u0161njak, IZUM\u2019s director in a statement issued by EuroHPC.\nA total of 32 countries are participating in the EuroHPC effort.\nThe IT4Innovations National Supercomputing Center will host what\u2019s expected to become the most powerful supercomputer in the Czech Republic. It will use 560 NVIDIA A100 GPUs to deliver nearly 350 petaflops of AI performance \u2014 7x the capabilities of the center\u2019s existing system.\nThe supercomputer will be based on the HPE Apollo 6500 systems from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). It will serve researchers at the VSB \u2013 Technical University of Ostrava, where it\u2019s based, as well as an expanding set of external academic and industrial users employing a mix of simulations, data analytics and AI.\nThe story of Europe\u2019s ambitions in HPC and AI is still being written.\nEuroHPC has yet to announce its plans for systems in Bulgaria, Finland, Portugal and Spain. And beyond that work, the group has already sketched out plans that stretch to 2027.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep Learning | Networking | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NGC | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | NVIDIA in Europe | Science \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The foundation heads the Wallenberg Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) network \u2014 the country\u2019s largest private research initiative focused on AI innovation.\n\u201cI am extremely happy and proud that Link\u00f6ping University will, through the National Supercomputer Centre, be host for this infrastructure\u201d, says Jan-Ingvar J\u00f6nsson, vice-chancellor of Link\u00f6ping University. \u201cThis gives us confidence that Sweden is not simply maintaining its international position, but also strengthening it.\u201d\nA Powerful New AI Resource\nHosting world-class supercomputers is nothing new for the team at Link\u00f6ping University.\nThe Swedish National Supercomputer Center (NSC) already houses six traditional supercomputers on campus, with a combined total of 6 petaflops of performance. Included among these is Tetralith, which held the title of the most powerful supercomputer in the Nordics after its installation in 2018.\nBut with BerzeLiUs the team is making a huge leap.\n\u201cBerzeLiUs will be more than twice as fast as Tetralith,\u201d confirmed Niclas Andersson, technical director at NSC. \u201cThis is a super-fast AI resource \u2014 the fastest computing cluster we have ever installed.\u201d\nThe powerful new AI resource will boost collaboration between academia and leading Swedish industrial companies, primarily those financed by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, such as the Wallenberg Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) as well as other life science and quantum technology initiatives.\nFull Speed Ahead\nBuilding a leading AI supercomputer usually can take years of planning and development. But by building BerzeLiUs with NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD technology, Link\u00f6ping will be able to deploy the fully integrated system and start running complex AI models as the new year begins.\nThe system will be built and installed by Atos. Initially, the supercomputer will consist of 60 NVIDIA DGX A100 systems interconnected across an NVIDIA Mellanox InfiniBand fabric and 1.5 petabytes of high-performance storage from DDN. BerzeLiUs will also feature the Atos Codex AI Suite, enabling researchers to speed up processing times on their complex data.\n\u201cThis new supercomputer will supercharge AI research in Sweden,\u201d said Jaap Zuiderveld, vice president for EMEA at NVIDIA. \u201cIt will position Sweden as a leader in academic research, and it will give Swedish businesses a competitive edge in telecommunications, design, drug development, manufacturing and more industries.\u201d\nJoin Link\u00f6ping University at GTC\nDive deeper into the cutting-edge research performed at Link\u00f6ping University. Join Anders Eklund, associate professor at Link\u00f6ping University, and Joel Hedlund, data director at AIDA, to explore how AI is powering innovation in radiology and pathology imaging.\nIt\u2019s not too late to get access to hundreds of live and on-demand talks at GTC.

When asked, by Rowen, about the future of NVIDIA\u2019s own campus, Huang said NVIDIA\u2019s building a real-life holodeck.\nOne day, these will allow employees from all over the world to work together. \u201cPeople at home will be in VR, while people at the office will be on the holodeck,\u201d Huang said.\nHuang said he sees NVIDIA first building one. \u201cThen I would like to imagine our facilities having 10 to 20 of these new holodecks,\u201d he said.\nMore broadly, AI, Huang explained, will allow organizations of all kinds to turn their data, and their knowledge base, into powerful AI. NVIDIA will play a role as an enabler, giving companies the tools to transition to a new kind of computing.\nHe described AI as the \u201cautomation of automation\u201d and \u201csoftware writing software.\u201d This gives the vast majority of the world\u2019s population who aren\u2019t coders new capabilities. \u201cIn a lot of ways, AI is the best way to democratize computer science,\u201d Huang said.\nFor more from Huang, Herbst, Raj and Rowan, register for GTC and watch a replay of the conversation.

XR is a collective term for VR, AR and mixed reality.\nWith the ability to stream from the cloud, professionals can now easily set up, scale and access immersive experiences from anywhere \u2014 they no longer need to be tethered to expensive workstations or external VR tracking systems.\nThe growing availability of advanced tools like CloudXR is paving the way for enhanced collaboration, streamlined workflows and high fidelity virtual environments. XR solutions are also introducing new possibilities for adding AI features and functionality.\nWith the CloudXR platform, many early access customers and partners across industries like manufacturing, media and entertainment, healthcare and others are enhancing immersive experiences by combining photorealistic graphics with the mobility of wireless head-mounted displays.\nLucid Motors recently announced the new Lucid Air, a powerful and efficient electric vehicle that users can experience through a custom implementation of the ZeroLight platform. Lucid Motors is developing a virtual design showroom using the CloudXR platform. By streaming the experience from AWS, shoppers can enter the virtual environment and see the advanced features of Lucid Air.\n\u201cNVIDIA CloudXR allows people all over the world to experience an incredibly immersive, personalized design with the new Lucid Air,\u201c said Thomas Orenz, director of digital interactive marketing at Lucid Motors. \u201cBy using the AWS cloud, we can save on infrastructure costs by removing the need for onsite servers, while also dynamically scaling the VR configuration experiences for our customers.\u201d\nAnother early adopter of CloudXR on AWS is The Gettys Group, a hospitality design, branding and development company based in Chicago. Gettys frequently partners with visualization company Theia Interactive to turn the design process into interactive Unreal Engine VR experiences.\nWhen the coronavirus pandemic hit, Gettys and Theia used NVIDIA CloudXR to deliver customer projects to a local Oculus Quest HMD, streaming from the AWS EC2 P3 instance with NVIDIA Virtual Workstations.\n\u201cThis is a game changer \u2014 by streaming collaborative experiences from AWS, we can digitally bring project stakeholders together on short notice for quick VR design alignment meetings,\u201d said Ron Swidler, chief innovation officer at The Gettys Group. \u201cThis is going to save a ton of time and money, but more importantly it\u2019s going to increase client engagement, understanding and satisfaction.\u201d\n\nNext-Level Streaming from the Cloud\nCloudXR is built on NVIDIA RTX GPUs to allow streaming of immersive AR, VR or mixed reality experiences from anywhere.\nThe platform includes:\n\nNVIDIA CloudXR SDK, which provides support for all OpenVR apps and includes broad client support for phones, tablets and HMDs. Its adaptive streaming protocol delivers the richest experiences with the lowest perceived latency by constantly adapting to network conditions.\nNVIDIA Virtual Workstations\u00a0to deliver the most immersive, highest quality graphics at the fastest frame rates. It\u2019s available from cloud providers such as AWS, or can be deployed from an enterprise data center.\nNVIDIA AI SDKs to accelerate performance and enhance immersive presence.\n\nWith the NVIDIA CloudXR platform on Amazon EC2 G4 and P3 instances supporting NVIDIA T4 and V100 GPUs, companies can deliver high-quality virtual experiences to any user, anywhere in the world.\nAvailability Coming Soon\nNVIDIA CloudXR on AWS will be generally available early next year, with a private beta available in the coming months.

As the de facto replacement for GTC Europe, this fall virtual GTC is a bit of a lower-key event relative to the Spring edition, but it\u2019s still one that is seeing some NVIDIA hardware introduced to the world.\nStarting things off, we have a pair of new video cards from NVIDIA \u2013 and a launch that seemingly indicates that NVIDIA is getting ready to overhaul its professional visualization branding. Being announced today and set to ship at the end of the year is the NVIDIA RTX A6000, NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation, Ampere-based professional visualization card. The successor to the Turing-based Quadro RTX 8000/6000, the A6000 will be NVIDIA\u2019s flagship professional graphics card, offering everything under the sun as far as NVIDIA\u2019s graphics features go, and chart-topping performance to back it up. The A6000 will be a Quadro card in everything but name; literally.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Professional Visualization Card\r\n\t\t\tSpecification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nA6000\nA40\nRTX 8000\nGV100\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n10752\n10752\n4608\n5120\n\n\nTensor Cores\n336\n336\n576\n640\n\n\nBoost Clock\n?\n?\n1770MHz\n~1450MHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n16Gbps GDDR6\n14.5Gbps GDDR6\n14Gbps GDDR6\n1.7Gbps HBM2\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n384-bit\n384-bit\n384-bit\n4096-bit\n\n\nVRAM\n48GB\n48GB\n48GB\n32GB\n\n\nECC\nPartial\r\n\t\t\t(DRAM)\nPartial\r\n\t\t\t(DRAM)\nPartial\r\n\t\t\t(DRAM)\nFull\n\n\nHalf Precision\n?\n?\n32.6 TFLOPS\n29.6 TFLOPS\n\n\nSingle Precision\n?\n?\n16.3 TFLOPS\n14.8 TFLOPS\n\n\nTensor Performance\n?\n?\n130.5 TFLOPS\n118.5 TFLOPs\r\n\t\t\t(FP16)\n\n\nTDP\n300W\n300W\n295W\n250W\n\n\nCooling\nActive\nPassive\nActive\nActive\n\n\nNVLink\n1x NVLink3\r\n\t\t\t112.5GB/sec\n1x NVLink3\r\n\t\t\t112.5GB/sec\n1x NVLInk2\r\n\t\t\t50GB/sec\n2x NVLInk2\r\n\t\t\t100GB/sec\n\n\nGPU\nGA102\nGA102\nTU102\nGV100\n\n\nArchitecture\nAmpere\nAmpere\nTuring\nVolta\n\n\nManufacturing Process\nSamsung 8nm\nSamsung 8nm\nTSMC 12nm FFN\nTSMC 12nm FFN\n\n\nLaunch Price\n?\n?\n$10,000\n$9,000\n\n\nLaunch Date\n12/2020\nQ1 2021\nQ4 2018\nMarch 2018\n\n\n\nThe first professional visualization card to be launched based on NVIDIA\u2019s new Ampere architecture, the A6000 will have NVIDIA hitting the market with its best foot forward. The card uses a fully-enabled GA102 GPU \u2013 the same chip used in the GeForce RTX 3080 & 3090 \u2013 and with 48GB of memory, is packed with as much memory as NVIDIA can put on a single GA102 card today. Notably, the A6000 is using GDDR6 here and not the faster GDDR6X used in the GeForce cards, as 16Gb density RAM chips are not available for the latter memory at this time. As a result, despite being based on the same GPU, there are going to be some interesting performance differences between the A6000 and its GeForce siblings, as it has traded memory bandwidth for overall memory capacity.\nIn terms of performance, NVIDIA is promoting the A6000 as offering nearly twice the performance (or more) of the Quadro RTX 8000 in certain situations, particularly tasks taking advantage of the significant increase in FP32 CUDA cores or the similar performance increase in RT core throughput. Unfortunately NVIDIA has either yet to lock down the specifications for the card or is opting against announcing them at this time, so we don\u2019t know what the clockspeeds and resulting performance in FLOPS will be. Notably, the A6000 only has a TDP of 300W, 50W lower than the GeForce RTX 3090, so I would expect this card to be clocked lower than the 3090.\n\nOtherwise, as we saw with the GeForce cards launched last month, Ampere itself is not a major technological overhaul to the previous Turing architecture. So while newer and significantly more powerful, there are not many new marquee features to be found on the card. Along with the expanded number of data types supported in the tensor cores (particularly BFloat16), the other changes most likely to be noticed by professional visualization users is decode support for the new AV1 codec, as well as PCI-Express 4.0 support, which will give the cards twice the bus bandwidth when used with AMD\u2019s recent platforms.\nLike the current-generation Quadro, the upcoming card also gets ECC support. NVIDIA has never listed GA102 as offering ECC on its internal pathways \u2013 this is traditionally limited to their big, datacenter-class chips \u2013 so this is almost certainly partial support via \u201csoft\u201d ECC, which offers error correction against the DRAM and DRAM bus by setting aside some DRAM capacity and bandwidth to function as ECC. The cards also support a single NVLink connector \u2013 now up to NVLink 3 \u2013 allowing for a pair of A6000s to be bridged together for more performance and to share their memory pools for supported applications. The A6000 also supports NVIDIA\u2019s standard frame lock and 3D Vision Pro features with their respective connectors.\nFor display outputs, the A6000 ships with a quad-DisplayPort configuration, which is typical for NVIDIA\u2019s high-end professional visualization cards. Notably this generation, however, this means the A6000 is in a bit of an odd spot since DisplayPort 1.4 is slower than the HDMI 2.1 standard also supported by the GA102 GPU. I would expect that it\u2019s possible for the card to drive an HDMI 2.1 display with a passive adapter, but this is going to be reliant on how NVIDIA has configured the card and if HDMI 2.1 signaling will tolerate such an adapter.\nFinally, the A6000 will be the first of today\u2019s video cards to ship. According to NVIDIA, the card will be available in the channel as an add-in card starting in mid-December \u2013 just in time to make a 2020 launch. The card will then start showing up in OEM systems in early 2021.\nNVIDIA A40 \u2013 Passive ProViz\nJoining the new A6000 is a very similar card designed for passive cooling, the NVIDIA A40. Based on the same GA102 GPU as the A6000, the A40 offers virtually all of the same features as the active-cooled A6000, just in a purely passive form factor suitable for use in high density servers.\n\nBy the numbers, the A40 is a similar flagship-level graphics card, using a fully enabled GA102 GPU. It\u2019s not quite a twin to the A6000, but other than the cooling difference, the only other change under the hood is the memory configuration. Whereas the A6000 uses 16 Gbps GDDR6, A40 clocks it down to 14.5 Gbps. Otherwise NVIDIA has not disclosed expected GPU clockspeeds, but with a 300W TDP, we\u2019d expect them to be similar to the A6000.\nOverall NVIDIA is no stranger to offering passively cooled cards; however it\u2019s been a while since we last saw a passively cooled high-end Quadro card. Most recently, NVIDIA\u2019s passive cards have been aimed at the compute market, with parts like the Tesla T4 and P40. The A40, on the other hand, is a bit different and a bit more ambitious, and a reflection of the blurring lines between compute and graphics in at least some of NVIDIA\u2019s markets.\nThe most notable impact here is the inclusion of display outputs, something that was never on NVIDIA\u2019s compute cards for obvious reasons. The A40 includes three DisplayPort outputs (one fewer than the A6000), giving the server-focused card the ability to directly drive a display. In explaining the inclusion of display I/O in a server part, NVIDIA said that they\u2019ve had requests from users in the media and broadcast industry, who have been using servers in places like video trucks, but still need display outputs.\nUltimately, this serves as something of an additional feature differentiator between the A40 and NVIDIA\u2019s official PCIe compute card, the PCIe A100. As the A100 lacks any kind of video display functionality (the underlying A100 GPU was designed for pure compute tasks), the A40 is the counterpoint to that product, offering something with very explicit video output support both within and outside of the card. And while it\u2019s not specifically aimed at the edge compute market, where the T4 still reigns supreme, make no mistake: the A40 is still capable of being used as a compute card. Though lacking in some of A100\u2019s specialty features like Multi-Instance GPU (MIG), the A40 is fully capable of being provisioned as a compute card, including support for the Virtual Compute Server vGPU profile. So the card is a potential alternative of sorts to the A100, at least where FP32 throughput might be of concern.\nFinally, like the A6000, the A40 will be hitting the streets in the near future. Designed to be sold primarily through OEMs, NVIDIA expects it to start showing up in servers in early 2021.\nQuadro No More?\nFor long-time observers, perhaps the most interesting development from today\u2019s launch is what\u2019s not present: NVIDIA\u2019s Quadro branding. Despite being aimed at their traditional professional visualization market, the A6000 is not being branded as a Quadro card, a change that was made at nearly the last minute.\nPerhaps because of that last-minute change, NVIDIA hasn\u2019t issued any official explanation for their decision. At face value it\u2019s certainly an odd one, as the Quadro brand is one of NVIDIA\u2019s longest-lived brands, second only to GeForce itself. NVIDIA still controls the lion\u2019s share of the professional visualization market as well, so at face value there seems to be little reason for NVIDIA to shake-up a very stable market.\n\nWith all of that said, there are a couple of factors in play that may be driving NVIDIA\u2019s decision. First and foremost is that the company has already retired one of its other product brands in the last couple of years: Tesla. Previously used for NVIDIA\u2019s compute accelerators, Tesla was retired and never replaced, leaving us with the likes of the NVIDIA T4 and A100. Of course, Tesla is something of a special case, as the name has increasingly become synonymous with the electric car company, despite in both cases being selected as a reference to the famous scientist. Quadro, by comparison, has relatively little (but not zero) overlap with other business entities.\nBut perhaps more significant than that is the overall state of NVIDIA\u2019s professional businesses. An important cornerstone of NVIDIA\u2019s graphics products, professional visualization is a fairly stable market \u2013 which is to say it\u2019s not a major growth market in the way that gaming and datacenter compute have been. As a result, professional visualization has been getting slowly subsumed by NVIDIA\u2019s compute parts, especially in the server space where many products can be provisioned for either compute or graphics needs. In all these cases, both Quadro and NVIDIA\u2019s former Tesla lineup have come to represent NVIDIA\u2019s \u201cpremium\u201d offerings: parts that get access to the full suite of NVIDIA\u2019s hardware and software features, unlike the consumer GeForce products which have certain high-end features withheld.\nSo it may very well be that NVIDIA doesn\u2019t see a need for a specific Quadro brand too much longer, because the market for Quadro (professional visualization) and Tesla (computing) are one in the same. Though the two differ in their specific needs, they still use the same NVIDIA hardware, and frequently pay the same high NVIDIA prices.\nAt any rate, it will be interesting to see where NVIDIA goes from here. Even with the overlap in audiences, branding segmentation has its advantages at times. And with NVIDIA now producing GPUs that lack critical display capabilities (GA100), it seems like making it clear what hardware can (and can\u2019t) be used for graphics is going to remain important going forward.\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n29 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nKjella - Monday, October 5, 2020 - link\nLooks like Nvidia just killed them all.. the totally-not-Titan RTX 3090, totally-not-Quadro A6000, totally-not-Tesla compute cards... it's just Nvidia. I'm okay with that, don't feel the sub-brands added that much to the table anyway. \n\n\n\ndeil - Monday, October 5, 2020 - link\nmaybe they just want to restart naming. Everyone want to do it at some point.it makes a lot of sense to have a clear and easy to understand tiers of products....\n\n\n\nTheinsanegamerN - Monday, October 5, 2020 - link\nThe naming did serve a purpose. Driver support for quaddros is different from teslas which is different from geforce GPUs.Lumping them all together as \"nvidia GPUs\" is going to create more confusion. \n\n\n\nmichael2k - Monday, October 5, 2020 - link\nIf you didn't know that driver support for quadro is different from tesla which is different from geforce GPUs then there is already confusion.I suspect that also means NVIDIA will be unifying their driver support because creating three different release schedules for functionally the same product means three times the test/support resources. If there are key HW differences but they all use the same drivers then you focus on testing the different subsystems but the releases get easier.In any case, the confusion isn't any different now than it was before; it always boiled down to 'Which NVIDIA GPU do I want'?\n\n\n\nwebdoctors - Monday, October 5, 2020 - link\nNo it was more than that. I imagine buying a Quadro gets you longer drive support? Maybe 2X? Maybe at home tech support/HW replacement? Its gotta be more than just faster HW, usually enterprise stuff has a lot of other logistical upgrades too. \n\n\n\nLauRoman - Monday, October 5, 2020 - link\nHow does that change with a new name, though?\n\n\n\naamfk - Monday, October 5, 2020 - link\nyou're right. I love quadros because they support Windows Server for operating system selection. There isn't ANY other way to get a decent video card on Windows Server, I mean AMD / ATI has made it impossible from what I've seen (I haven't tested the firepro)\n\n\n\nOperandi - Monday, October 5, 2020 - link\nGeforce make sense as a consumer facing gaming brand.  Quadro on the other hand never made much sense.  What exactly is a \"Quadro\" and is there 4 of them?  I don't get it.\n\n\n\nMurloc - Monday, October 5, 2020 - link\nquadro means painting or square-shaped or scene in Italian. I don't think this word has any meaning in English. \n\n\n\nKjella - Monday, October 5, 2020 - link\nNot exactly quadro but you find something similar in words like quadruplets, quadratic formula, four of a kind in poker is called quads, four-cheese pasta/pizza/sauce often goes by the italian name (quattro formaggio), some car brands use quattro to indicate all (i.e. 4) wheel drive etc. so even to an English-speaker it sounds like four something. It's just completely unclear what that means for a graphics card.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

NVIDIA T4 small form factor, energy-efficient GPUs beat CPUs by up to 28x in the same tests.\nTo put this into perspective, a single NVIDIA DGX A100 system with eight A100 GPUs now provides the same performance as nearly 1,000 dual-socket CPU servers on some AI applications.\nLeadership performance enables cost efficiency in taking AI from research to production.\nThis round of benchmarks also saw increased participation, with 23 organizations submitting \u2014 up from 12 in the last round \u2014 and with NVIDIA partners using the NVIDIA AI platform to power more than 85 percent of the total submissions.\nA100 GPUs, Jetson AGX Xavier Take Performance to the Edge\nWhile A100 is taking AI inference performance to new heights, the benchmarks show that T4 remains a solid inference platform for mainstream enterprise, edge servers and cost-effective cloud instances. In addition, the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier builds on its leadership position in power constrained SoC-based edge devices by supporting all new use cases.\n\nThe results also point to our vibrant, growing AI ecosystem, which submitted 1,029 results using NVIDIA solutions representing 85 percent of the total submissions in the data center and edge categories. The submissions demonstrated solid performance across systems from partners including Altos, Atos, Cisco, Dell EMC, Dividiti, Fujitsu, Gigabyte, Inspur Electronic Information, Lenovo, Nettrix and QCT.\nExpanding Use Cases Bring AI to Daily Life\nBacked by broad support from industry and academia, MLPerf benchmarks continue to evolve to represent industry use cases. Organizations that support MLPerf include Arm, Baidu, Facebook, Google, Harvard, Intel, Lenovo, Microsoft, Stanford, the University of Toronto and NVIDIA.\nThe latest benchmarks introduced four new tests, underscoring the expanding landscape for AI. The suite now scores performance in natural language processing, medical imaging, recommendation systems and speech recognition as well as AI use cases in computer vision.\nYou need go no further than a search engine to see the impact of natural language processing on daily life.\n\u201cThe recent AI breakthroughs in natural language understanding are making a growing number of AI services like Bing more natural to interact with, delivering accurate and useful results, answers and recommendations in less than a second,\u201d said Rangan Majumder, vice president of search and artificial intelligence at Microsoft.\n\u201cIndustry-standard MLPerf benchmarks provide relevant performance data on widely used AI networks and help make informed AI platform buying decisions,\u201d he said.\nAI Helps Saves Lives in the Pandemic\u00a0\nThe impact of AI in medical imaging is even more dramatic. For example, startup Caption Health uses AI to ease the job of taking echocardiograms, a capability that helped save lives in U.S. hospitals in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThat\u2019s why thought leaders in healthcare AI view models like 3D U-Net, used in the latest MLPerf benchmarks, as key enablers.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked closely with NVIDIA to bring innovations like 3D U-Net to the healthcare market,\u201d said Klaus Maier-Hein, head of medical image computing at DKFZ, the German Cancer Research Center.\n\u201cComputer vision and imaging are at the core of AI research, driving scientific discovery and representing core components of medical care. And industry-standard MLPerf benchmarks provide relevant performance data that helps IT organizations and developers accelerate their specific projects and applications,\u201d he added.\nCommercially, AI use cases like recommendation systems, also part of the latest MLPerf tests, are already making a big impact. Alibaba used recommendation systems last November to transact $38 billion in online sales on Singles Day, its biggest shopping day of the year.\nAdoption of NVIDIA AI Inference Passes Tipping Point\nAI inference passed a major milestone this year.\nNVIDIA GPUs delivered a total of more than 100 exaflops of AI inference performance in the public cloud over the last 12 months, overtaking inference on cloud CPUs for the first time. Total cloud AI Inference compute capacity on NVIDIA GPUs has been growing roughly tenfold every two years.\nGPUs in major cloud services now account for more inference performance than CPUs.\nWith the high performance, usability and availability of NVIDIA GPU computing, a growing set of companies across industries such as automotive, cloud, robotics, healthcare, retail, financial services and manufacturing now rely on NVIDIA GPUs for AI inference. They include American Express, BMW, Capital One, Dominos, Ford, GE Healthcare, Kroger, Microsoft, Samsung and Toyota.\nCompanies across key industry sectors use NVIDIA\u2019s AI platform for inference.\nWhy AI Inference Is Hard\nUse cases for AI are clearly expanding, but AI inference is hard for many reasons.\nNew kinds of neural networks like generative adversarial networks are constantly being spawned for new use cases and the models are growing exponentially. The best language models for AI now encompass billions of parameters, and research in the field is still young.\nThese models need to run in the cloud, in enterprise data centers and at the edge of the network. That means the systems that run them must be highly programmable, executing with excellence across many dimensions.\nNVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang compressed the complexities in one word: PLASTER. Modern AI inference requires excellence in Programmability, Latency, Accuracy, Size of model, Throughput, Energy efficiency and Rate of learning.\nTo power excellence across every dimension, we\u2019re focussed on constantly evolving our end-to-end AI platform to handle demanding inference jobs.\nAI Requires Performance, Usability\nAn accelerator like the A100, with its third-generation Tensor Cores and the flexibility of its multi-instance GPU architecture, is just the beginning. Delivering leadership results requires a full software stack.\nNVIDIA\u2019s AI software begins with a variety of pretrained models ready to run AI inference. Our TAO Toolkit lets users optimize these models for their particular use cases and datasets.\nNVIDIA TensorRT optimizes trained models for inference.

It features more than 1,000 sessions \u2014 400 more than the last GTC \u2014 in 40 topic areas. And it\u2019s the first to run across the world\u2019s time zones, with sessions in English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Hebrew.\nAccelerated Data Center\u00a0\nModern data centers, Huang explained, are software-defined, making them more flexible and adaptable.\nThat creates an enormous load. Running a data center\u2019s infrastructure can consume 20-30 percent of its CPU cores. And as \u201ceast-west traffic, or traffic within a data center, and microservices increase, this load will increase dramatically.\n\u201cA new kind of processor is needed,\u201d Huang explained: \u201cWe call it the data processing unit.\u201d\nThe DPU consists of accelerators for networking, storage, security and programmable Arm CPUs to offload the hypervisor, Huang said.\nThe new NVIDIA BlueField 2 DPU is a programmable processor with powerful Arm cores and acceleration engines for at-line-speed processing for networking, storage and security. It\u2019s the latest fruit of NVIDIA\u2019s acquisition of high-speed interconnect provider Mellanox Technologies, which closed in April.\n\nData Center \u2014 DOCA \u2014 A Programmable Data Center Infrastructure Processor\nNVIDIA also announced DOCA, its programmable data-center-infrastructure-on-a-chip architecture.\n\u201cDOCA SDKs let developers write infrastructure apps for software-defined networking, software-defined storage, cybersecurity, telemetry and in-network computing applications yet to be invented,\u201d Huang said.\nHuang also touched on a partnership with VMware, announced last week, to port VMware onto BlueField. VMware \u201cruns the world\u2019s enterprises \u2014 they are the OS platform in 70 percent of the world\u2019s companies,\u201d Huang explained.\n\nData Center \u2014 DPU Roadmap in \u2018Full Throttle\u2019\nFurther out, Huang said NVIDIA\u2019s DPU roadmap shows advancements coming fast.\nBlueField-2 is sampling now, BlueField-3 is finishing and BlueField-4 is in high gear, Huang reported.\n\u201cWe are going to bring a ton of technology to networking,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIn just a couple of years, we\u2019ll span nearly 1,000 times in compute throughput\u201d on the DPU.\nBlueField-4, arriving in 2023, will add support for the CUDA parallel programming platform and NVIDIA AI \u2014 \u201cturbocharging the in-network computing vision.\u201d\nYou can get those capabilities now, Huang announced, with the new BlueField-2X. It adds an NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPU to BlueField-2 for in-networking computing with CUDA and NVIDIA AI.\n\u201cBluefield-2X is like having a Bluefield-4, today,\u201d Huang said.\n\nData Center \u2014 GPU Inference Momentum\nConsumer internet companies are also turning to NVIDIA technology to deliver AI services.\nInference \u2014 which puts fully-trained AI models to work \u2014 is key to a new generation of AI-powered consumer services.\nIn aggregate, NVIDIA GPU inference compute in the cloud already exceeds all cloud CPUs, Huang said.\nHuang announced that Microsoft is adopting NVIDIA AI on Azure to power smart experiences on Microsoft Office, including smart grammar correction and text prediction.\nMicrosoft Office joins Square, Twitter, eBay, GE Healthcare and Zoox, among other companies, in a broad array of industries using NVIDIA GPUs for inference.\nData Center \u2014 Cloudera and VMware\u00a0\nThe ability to put vast quantities of data to work, fast, is key to modern AI and data science.\nNVIDIA RAPIDS is the fastest extract, transform, load, or ETL, engine on the planet, and supports multi-GPU and multi-node.\nNVIDIA modeled its API after hugely popular data science frameworks \u2014 Pandas, XGBoost and ScikitLearn \u2014 so RAPIDS is easy to pick up.\nOn the industry-standard data processing benchmark, running the 30 complex database queries on a 10TB dataset, a 16-node NVIDIA DGX cluster ran 20x faster than the fastest CPU server.\nYet it\u2019s one-seventh the cost and uses one-third the power.\nHuang announced that Cloudera, a hybrid-cloud data platform that lets you manage, secure, analyze and learn predictive models from data, will accelerate the Cloudera Data Platform with NVIDIA RAPIDS, NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA-accelerated Spark.\nNVIDIA and VMware also announced a second partnership, Huang said.\nThe companies will create a data center platform that supports GPU acceleration for all three major computing domains today: virtualized, distributed scale-out and composable microservices.\n\u201cEnterprises running VMware will be able to enjoy NVIDIA GPU and AI computing in any computing mode,\u201d Huang said. \u201c\n(Cutting) Edge AI\u00a0\nSomeday, Huang said, trillions of AI devices and machines will populate the Earth \u2013 in homes, office buildings, warehouses, stores, farms, factories, hospitals, airports.\nThe NVIDIA EGX AI platform makes it easy for the world\u2019s enterprises to stand up a state-of-the-art edge-AI server quickly, Huang said. It can control factories of robots, perform automatic checkout at retail or help nurses monitor patients, Huang explained.\nHuang announced the EGX platform is expanding to combine the NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPU and BlueField-2 DPU on a single PCIe card. The updates give enterprises a common platform to build secure, accelerated data centers.\nHuang also announced an early access program for a new service called NVIDIA Fleet Command. This new application makes it easy to deploy and manage updates across IoT devices, combining the security and real-time processing capabilities of edge computing with the remote management and ease of software-as-a-service.\nAmong the first companies provided early access to Fleet Command is KION Group, a leader in global supply chain solutions, which is using the NVIDIA EGX AI platform to develop AI applications for its intelligent warehouse systems.\nAdditionally, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, the No. 1 hospital in Illinois and one of the top 10 in the nation, is working with Whiteboard Coordinator to use Fleet Command for its IoT sensor platform.\n\u201cThis is the iPhone moment for the world\u2019s industries \u2014 NVIDIA EGX will make it easy to create, deploy and operate industrial AI services,\u201d Huang said.\n\nEdge AI \u2014 Democratizing Robotics\nSoon, Huang added, everything that moves will be autonomous. AI software is the big breakthrough that will make robots smarter and more adaptable. But it\u2019s the NVIDIA Jetson AI computer that will democratize robotics.\nJetson is an Arm-based SoC designed from the ground up for robotics. That\u2019s thanks to the sensor processors, the CUDA GPU and Tensor Cores, and, most importantly, the richness of AI software that runs on it, Huang explained.\nThe latest addition to the Jetson family, the Jetson Nano 2GB, will be $59, Huang announced. That\u2019s roughly half the cost of the $99 Jetson Nano Developer Kit announced last year.\n\u201cNVIDIA Jetson is mighty, yet tiny, energy-efficient and affordable,\u201d Huang said.\n\nCollaboration Tools\nThe shared, online world of the \u201cmetaverse\u201d imagined in Neal Stephensen\u2019s 1992 cyberpunk classic, \u201cSnow Crash,\u201d is already becoming real, in shared virtual worlds like Minecraft and Fortnite, Huang said.\nFirst introduced in March 2019, NVIDIA Omniverse \u2014 a platform for simultaneous, real-time simulation and collaboration across a broad array of existing industry tools \u2014 is now in open beta.\n\u201cOmniverse allows designers, artists, creators and even AIs using different tools, in different worlds, to connect in a common world\u2014to collaborate, to create a world together,\u201d Huang said.\nAnother tool NVIDIA pioneered, NVIDIA Jarvis conversational AI (since renamed NVIDIA Riva), is also now in open beta, Huang announced. Using the new SpeedSquad benchmark, Huang showed it\u2019s twice as responsive and more natural sounding when running on NVIDIA GPUs.\nIt also runs for a third of the cost, Huang said.\n\u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d Huang said, referring to a catch phrase he\u2019s used in keynotes over the years. \u201cThe more you buy, the more you save.\u201d\nCollaboration Tools \u2014 Introducing NVIDIA Maxine\nVideo calls have moved from a curiosity to a necessity.\nFor work, social, school, virtual events, doctor visits \u2014 video conferencing is now the most critical application for many people. More than 30 million web meetings take place every day.\nTo improve this experience, Huang announced NVIDIA Maxine, a cloud-native streaming video AI platform for applications like video calls.\nUsing AI, Maxine can reduce the bandwidth consumed by video calls by a factor of 10. \u201cAI can do magic for video calls,\u201d Huang said.\n\u201cWith Jarvis and Maxine, we have the opportunity to revolutionize video conferencing of today and invent the virtual presence of tomorrow,\u201d Huang said.\n\nHealthcare\u00a0\nWhen it comes to drug discovery amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic, lives are on the line.\nYet for years the costs of new drug discovery for the $1.5 trillion pharmaceutical industry have risen. New drugs take over a decade to develop, cost over $2.5 billion in research and development \u2014 doubling every nine years \u2014 and 90 percent of efforts fail.\nNew tools are needed. \u201cCOVID-19 hits home this urgency,\u201d Huang said.\nUsing breakthroughs in computer science, we can begin to use simulation and in-silico methods to understand the biological machinery of the proteins that affect disease and search for new drug candidates, Huang explained.\nTo accelerate this, Huang announced NVIDIA Clara Discovery \u2014 a state-of-the-art suite of tools for scientists to discover life-saving drugs.\n\u201cWhere there are popular industry tools, our computer scientists accelerate them,\u201d Huang said. \u201cWhere no tools exist, we develop them \u2014 like NVIDIA Parabricks, Clara Imaging, BioMegatron, BioBERT, NVIDIA RAPIDS.\u201d\nHuang also outlined an effort to build the U.K.\u2019s fastest supercomputer, Cambridge-1, bringing state-of-the-art computing infrastructure to \u201can epicenter of healthcare research.\u201d\n\nCambridge-1 will boast 400 petaflops of AI performance, making it among the world\u2019s top 30 fastest supercomputers. It will host NVIDIA\u2019s U.K. AI and healthcare collaborations with academia, industry and startups.\nNVIDIA\u2019s first partners are AstraZeneca, GSK, King\u2019s College London, the Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust and startup Oxford Nanopore.\nNVIDIA also announced a partnership with GSK to build the world\u2019s first AI drug discovery lab.\nArm\nHuang wrapped up his keynote with an update on NVIDIA\u2019s partnership with Arm, whose power-efficient designs run the world\u2019s smart devices.\nNVIDIA agreed to acquire the U.K. semiconductor designer last month for $40 billion.\n\u201cArm is the most popular CPU in the world,\u201d Huang said. \u201cTogether, we will offer NVIDIA accelerated and AI computing technologies to the Arm ecosystem.\u201d\nLast year, Huang said, NVIDIA announced it would port CUDA and our scientific computing stack to Arm. Today, Huang announced a major initiative to advance the Arm platform \u2014 we\u2019re making investments across three dimensions:\n\nFirst, NVIDIA will complement Arm partners with GPU, networking, storage and security technologies to create complete accelerated platforms.\nSecond, NVIDIA is working with Arm partners to create platforms for HPC, cloud, edge and PC \u2014 this requires chips, systems and system software.\nAnd third, NVIDIA is porting the NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA RTX engines to Arm.\n\n\u201cToday, these capabilities are available only on x86,\u201d Huang said, \u201cWith this initiative, Arm platforms will also be leading-edge at accelerated and AI computing.\u201d\n\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Data Center | Deep LearningTags: CUDA | Events | GTC 2020 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

DRIVE Sim leverages the cutting-edge capabilities of the platform for end-to-end, physically accurate autonomous vehicle simulation.\nOmniverse was architected from the ground up to support multi-GPU, large-scale, multisensor simulation for autonomous machines. It enables ray-traced, physically accurate, real-time sensor simulation with NVIDIA RTX technology.\n\nThe video shows a digital twin of a Mercedes-Benz EQS driving a 17-mile route around a recreated version of the NVIDIA campus in Santa Clara, Calif. It includes Highways 101 and 87 and Interstate 280, with traffic lights, on-ramps, off-ramps and merges as well as changes to the time of day, weather and traffic.\nTo achieve the real-world replica of the testing loop, the real environment was scanned at 5-cm accuracy and recreated in simulation. The hardware, software, sensors, car displays and human-machine interaction were all implemented in simulation in the exact same way as the real world, enabling bit- and timing-accurate simulation.\nPhysically Accurate Sensor Simulation\u00a0\nAutonomous vehicle simulation requires accurate physics and light modeling. This is especially critical for simulating sensors, which requires modeling rays beyond the visible spectrum and accurate timing between the sensor scan and environment changes.\nRay tracing is perfectly suited for this, providing realistic lighting by simulating the physical properties of light. And the Omniverse RTX renderer coupled with NVIDIA RTX GPUs enables ray tracing at real-time frame rates.\nThe capability to simulate light in real time has significant benefits for autonomous vehicle simulation. In the video, the vehicles show complex reflections of objects in the scene \u2014 including those not directly in the frame, just as it would in the real world. This also applies to other reflective surfaces such as wet roadways, reflective signs and buildings.\nThe Mercedes EQS shows the complexity of reflections enabled with ray tracing, including reflections of objects that are in the scene, but not in the frame.\nRTX also enables high-fidelity shadows. Typically in virtual environments, shadows are pre-computed or pre-baked. However, to provide a dynamic environment for simulation, pre-baking isn\u2019t possible. RTX enables high-fidelity shadows to be computed at run-time. In the night parking example from the video, the shadows from the lights are rendered directly instead of being pre-baked. This leads to shadows that appear softer and are much more accurate.\nNighttime parking scenarios show the benefit of ray tracing for complex shadows generated by dynamic light sources.\nUniversal Scene Description\nDRIVE Sim is based on Universal Scene Description, an open framework developed by Pixar to build and collaborate on 3D content for virtual worlds.\nUSD provides a high level of abstraction to describe scenes in DRIVE Sim. For instance, USD makes it easy to define the state of the vehicle (position, velocity, acceleration) and trigger changes based on its proximity to other entities such as a landmark in the scene.\nAlso, the framework comes with a rich toolset and is supported by most major content creation tools.\nScalability and Repeatability\nMost applications for generating virtual environments are targeted to systems with one to two GPUs, such as PC games. While the timing and latency of such architectures may be good enough for consumer games, designing a repeatable simulator for autonomous vehicles requires a much higher level of precision and performance.\nOmniverse enables DRIVE Sim to simultaneously simulate multiple cameras, radars and lidars in real time, supporting sensor configurations from Level 2 assisted driving to Level 4 and Level 5 fully autonomous driving.\nTogether, these new capabilities brought to life by Omniverse deliver a simulation experience that is virtually indistinguishable from reality.\nWatch NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang recap all the news from GTC:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not too late to get access to hundreds of live and on-demand talks at GTC.

And consulting firm Accenture forecasts cyberattacks could cost companies $5.2 trillion worldwide by 2024.\nCredit and bank cards are a major target. American Express, which handles more than eight\u00a0 billion transactions a year, is using deep learning on the NVIDIA GPU computing platform to combat fraud detection.\nAmerican Express has now deployed deep-learning-based models optimized with NVIDIA TensorRT and running on NVIDIA Triton Inference Server to detect fraud, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang announced at the GPU Technology Conference on Monday.\nNVIDIA TensorRT is a high performance deep learning inference optimizer and runtime that minimizes latency and maximizes throughput.\nNVIDIA Triton Inference Server software simplifies model deployment at scale and can be used as a\u00a0 microservice that enables applications to use AI models in datacenter production.\n\u201cOur fraud algorithms monitor in real time every American Express transaction around the world for more than $1.2 trillion spent annually, and we generate fraud decisions in mere milliseconds,\u201d said Manish Gupta, vice president of Machine Learning and Data Science Research at American Express.\nOnline Shopping Spree\nOnline shopping has spiked since the pandemic. In the U.S. alone, online commerce rose 49 percent in April compared with early March, according to Adobe\u2019s Digital Economy Index.\nThat means less cash, more digital dollars. And more digital dollars demand bank and credit card usage, which has already seen increased fraud.\n\u201cCard fraud netted criminals $3.88 billion more in 2018 than in 2017,\u201d said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, which tracks information about the global payments industry.\nAmerican Express, with more than 115 million active credit cards, has maintained the lowest fraud rate in the industry for 13 years in a row, according to The Nilson Report\n\u201cHaving our card members and merchants\u2019 back is our top priority, so keeping our fraud rates low is key to achieving that goal,\u201d said Gupta.\nAnomaly Detection with GPU Computing\nWith online transactions rising, fraudsters are waging more complex attacks as financial firms step up security measures.\nOne area that is easier to monitor is anomalous spending patterns. These types of transactions on one card \u2014 known as \u201cout of pattern\u201d \u2014 could show a coffee was purchased in San Francisco and then five minutes later a tank of gas was purchased in Los Angeles.\nSuch anomalies are red-flagged using recurrent neural networks, or RNNs, which are particularly good at guessing what comes next in a sequence of data.\nAmerican Express has deployed long short-term memory networks, or LSTMs, which can provide improved performance in RNNs.\nAnd that can mean the closing gaps on latency and accuracy, two areas where American Express has made leaps. The teams there used NVIDIA DGX systems to accelerate the building and training of these LSTM models on mountains of structured and unstructured data using TensorFlow.\n50x Gains Over CPUs\nThe recently released TensorRT-optimized LSTM network aids the system that analyzes transaction data on tens of millions of daily transactions in real time. This LSTM is now deployed using the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server on NVIDIA T4 GPUs for split-second inference.\nResults are in: American Express was able to implement this enhanced, real-time fraud detection system for improved accuracy. It operates within a tight two-millisecond latency requirement, and this new system delivers a 50x improvement over a CPU-based configuration, which couldn\u2019t meet the goal.\nThe financial services giant\u2019s GPU-accelerated LSTM deep neural network combined with its long-standing gradient boosting machine (GBM) model \u2014 used for regression and classification \u2014 has improved fraud detection accuracy by up to six percent in specific segments.\nAccuracy matters. A false positive that denies a customer\u2019s legitimate transaction is an unpleasant situation to be in for card members and merchants, says American Express.\n\u201cEspecially in this environment, our customers need us now more than ever, so we\u2019re supporting them with best-in-class fraud protection and servicing,\u201d Gupta said.\nIt\u2019s not too late to get access to hundreds of live and on-demand talks at GTC. Register now through Oct. 9 using promo code CMB4KN to get 20 percent off.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Cybersecurity | GPU | GTC 2020 | NVIDIA DGX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

One of its most popular \u2014 recently updated and retitled as The Fundamentals of Deep Learning \u2014 will be taken by hundreds of attendees at next week\u2019s GPU Technology Conference, running Oct. 5-9.\nOrganizations interested in boosting the deep learning skills of their personnel can arrange to get their teams trained by requesting a workshop from the DLI Course Catalog.\n\u201cTechnology professionals who take our revamped deep learning course will emerge with the basics they need to start applying deep learning to their most challenging AI and machine learning applications,\u201d said Craig Clawson, director of Training Services at NVIDIA. \u201cThis course is a key building block for developing a cutting-edge AI skillset.\u201d\nHuge Demand for Deep Learning\nDeep learning is at the heart of the fast-growing fields of machine learning and AI. This makes it a skill that\u2019s in huge demand and has put companies across industries in a race to recruit talent. Linkedin recently reported that the fastest growing job category in the U.S. is AI specialist, with annual job growth of 74 percent and an average annual salary of $136,000.\nFor many organizations, especially those in the software, internet, IT, higher education and consumer electronics sectors, investing in upskilling current employees can be critical to their success while offering a path to career advancement and increasing worker retention.\n\nWith interest in the field heating up, a recent article in Forbes highlighted that AI and machine learning, data science and IoT are among the most in-demand skills tech professionals should focus on. In other words, tech workers who lack these skills could soon find themselves at a professional disadvantage.\nBy developing needed skills, employees can make themselves more valuable to their organizations. And their employers benefit by embedding machine learning and AI functionality into their products, services and business processes.\n\u201cOrganizations are looking closely at how AI and machine learning can improve their business,\u201d Clawson said. \u201cAs they identify opportunities to leverage these technologies, they\u2019re hustling to either develop or import the required skills.\u201d\nGet a glimpse of the DLI experience in this short video:\n\nDLI Courses: An Invaluable Resource\nThe DLI has trained more than 250,000 developers globally. It has continued to deliver a wide range of training remotely via virtual classrooms during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nClasses are taught by DLI-certified instructors who are experts in their fields, and breakout rooms support collaboration among students, and interaction with the instructors.\nAnd by completing select courses, students can earn an NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute certificate to demonstrate subject matter competency and support career growth.\nIt would be hard to exaggerate the potential that this new technology and the NVIDIA developer community holds for improving the world \u2014 and the community is growing faster than ever. It took 13 years for the number of registered NVIDIA developers to reach 1 million. Just two years later, it has grown to over 2 million.\nWhether enabling new medical procedures, inventing new robots or joining the effort to combat COVID-19, the NVIDIA developer community is breaking new ground every day.\nCourses like the re-imagined Fundamentals of Deep Learning are helping developers and data scientists deliver breakthrough innovations across a wide range of industries and application domains.\n\u201cOur courses are structured to give developers the skills they need to thrive as AI and machine learning leaders,\u201d said Clawson. \u201cWhat they take away from the courses, both for themselves and their organizations, is immeasurable.\u201d\nTo get started on the journey of transforming your organization into an AI powerhouse, request a DLI workshop today.\nWhat is deep learning?

The present situation, Huang explained, \u201chas accelerated the future, it has brought forward the urgency of a digital future.\u201d\nIn front of a virtual audience from all over the globe, the two spoke about their entrepreneurial journeys, NVIDIA\u2019s unique company culture, and how NVIDIA is knitting together the virtual and real worlds to help NVIDIA employees collaborate.\nHuang\u2019s appearance at Zoomtopia follows NVIDIA\u2019s GPU Technology Conference last week, where Huang outlined NVIDIA\u2019s view of data center computing and introduced new technologies in data centers, edge AI and healthcare.\nYuan playfully wore a leather jacket, matching Huang\u2019s trademark attire\u2014and briefly displayed a sleek virtual kitchen as his backdrop, paying tribute to the presentations Huang has given from his kitchen this year\u2014began their conversation with Huang by asking about his early life.\n\u201cI was fortunate that my parents worked hard and all of the people I was surrounded by worked hard,\u201d Huang said, adding that he was focused on on school and sports, especially table tennis. \u201cTo me working is living, working is breathing and, to me, it\u2019s not work at all \u2014 I enjoy it too much.\u201d\nIt\u2019s NVIDIA\u2019s mission, Huang said, that continues to motivate him, as the company has gone from inventing the GPU to pioneering new possibilities in robotics and AI.\nThe common thread: since the beginning, NVIDIA has had a singular focus on accelerated computing.\n\u201cWe built a time machine,\u201d Huang said, touching on NVIDIA\u2019s work in drug discovery as an example. \u201cSo, instead of a particular drug taking 10 years to discover, we would like drugs and therapies and vaccines to be discovered in months.\u201d\nZoom and NVIDIA, Huang said, share a \u201csingular purpose and a sense of destiny,\u201d Huang said, one that has made the world a better place.\n\u201cThe fact that Zoom existed and your vision came to reality means we can be together even if we\u2019re not together,\u201d Huang said.\n\u201cYou can look at your work and imagine the impact on society and the benefits it will bring and somehow it\u2019s your job to do it,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do it, no one else will \u2014 and that\u2019s thrilling to me, I love that feeling.\u201d\nYuan also asked about NVIDIA\u2019s culture and the future of work, one which Huang believes will increasingly meld the physical and the virtual worlds.\nToday, for example, we might report to your colleagues that we\u2019ll be WFH, or working from home.\nOffice lingo, however, may change to reflect the new reality, where being at the office isn\u2019t necessarily the norm.\n\u201cIn the future we will say we\u2019re \u2018going to the office,\u2019\u201d Huang said. \u201cToday we say \u2018WFH,\u2019 in the future we will say \u2018GTO.\u2019\u201d\nTools such as Zoom enable colleagues to meet, face to face, from home, from an office, from anywhere in the world.\nMore and more, work will take place in a hybrid of office and home, physical and virtual reality.\nNVIDIA, for example, has created a platform called NVIDIA Omniverse that lets colleagues working in different places and with different tools collaborate in real time.\n\n\u201cThe Adobe world can connect to the Catia world and so on,\u201d Huang said. \u201cWe can have different designers working with each other at their homes.\u201d\nThe present moment has \u201cbrought forward the urgency of a digital future, it has made us aware that completely physical is not sufficient, that completely digital is not sufficient,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThe future is a mixed reality world.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: Corporate \n\n\n

The positive feedback we\u2019ve received so far has been overwhelming.\nToday, the NVIDIA Broadcast Engine \u2014 a collection of SDKs with the underlying AI technology that powers these features \u2014 is being released broadly to our community of developers. This will allow app developers to implement AI effects easily while unlocking new use cases.\nThree apps have adopted features from the NVIDIA Broadcast Engine: XSplit, Notch, and Xaymar, with a fourth, NewTek, coming soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXSplit Broadcaster Integrates the Audio Effects SDK\nXSplit has integrated the Audio Effects SDK into XSplit Broadcaster, the popular live streaming client, to enable their users to apply noise removal per audio source. The latest version can be downloaded here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNVIDIA Broadcast Engine allows developers to tap into NVIDIA's RTX-powered AI effects and the XSplit team has been working closely with NVIDIA to get these enhancements into the hands of our users. In particular, we've integrated their Noise Removal technology from their Audio Effects SDK, enabling broadcasters to consistently produce a clean and noise-free stream for their viewers. We are committed to continuously bring value to our customers and look forward to future collaborations with NVIDIA in their innovations.\u201d - Miguel Malvar Molina - Director of Developer Relations, XSplit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotch Enables Face Motion Tracking with the AR SDK\nNotch is using the AR SDK to enable advanced Face Tracking, available widely later this month, providing face tracking driven animation and advanced video effects with greatly reduced processing times while improving quality and stability compared to old CPU-based solutions. Tensor Cores achieve low latency and high responsiveness in face tracking allowing for use during live broadcasts.\nWords don\u2019t do it justice, just take a look at the video below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s AR SDK in Notch Enabling Advanced Face Tracking\n\u201cThe speed and quality of the new (and easy-to-integrate!) AR SDK face tracker is incredible. Through the use of dedicated Tensor Cores, Notch users have access to sub-frame accurate face tracking with high-resolution cameras in a live environment. We're excited to see what this, as well as other NVIDIA Broadcast features, will bring to the live show and virtual production environment.\u201d - Matt Swoboda, Founder and Director at Notch \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoiceFX brings NVIDIA Broadcast\u2019s Noise Removal to VST3 Compatible Editing Apps\nXaymar, the creator of the popular StreamFX plugin for OBS Studio that already uses the AR SDK, has now added Noise Removal to a VST3 filter with VoiceFX. This allows creators to use NVIDIA\u2019s Noise Removal feature to remove background noise directly from video and audio editing applications such as Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Audition.\n\"The Audio Effects SDK is a game changer, allowing us to easily integrate Noise Removal into the VoiceFX VST3 plugin. Creators now have a simple filter to remove unwanted noise using popular apps such as Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Audition.\" - Michael 'Xaymar' Dirks, Author of VoiceFX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNDI is now NVENC accelerated\nNDI, a part of the Vizrt Group, has integrated the Video Codec SDK into NDI, their popular solution to transmit video in real-time across a local network, replacing the need for a capture card. NDI now provides NVIDIA GPU acceleration for screen capture and encoding. By offloading the encoding to the GPU, it reduces the performance impact to the CPU to almost zero, maximizing the quality of gaming or broadcast production while also producing and sharing content. With this update, users will be able to transfer frames to their stream PC at up to 4K 120 FPS! The latest version is in development and coming soon, learn more here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our mission is to make IP video easy to use and fun for anyone to make a great show,\" said Dr. Andrew Cross, head of Research and Development for the Vizrt Group and NDI\u00ae. \u201cOffering full NVIDIA GPU accelerated support for NDI allows gamers to use applications like OBS Studio to share gaming experiences with higher quality, performance, and frame-rates than ever previously possible.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry them out and let us know what you think! \nTo try out the new integrations:\n\nUpdate your app to the latest beta versions.\nFor XSplit, Notch and VoiceFX, you\u2019ll also need to download the SDK redistributable files from our SDK Resources page.\n\nMost importantly, we want to hear from you on how these improvements are working!\nAfter using the new AI features, let us know what you think by sending us feedback. You can also send us a quick clip that\u2019ll help us train and improve the AI networks.\nStream on!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Ming-Yu Liu and Arun Mallya were on a video call when one of them started to break up, then freeze.\nIt\u2019s an irksome reality of life in the pandemic that most of us have shared. But unlike most of us, Liu and Mallya could do something about it.\nThey are AI researchers at NVIDIA and specialists in computer vision. Working with colleague Ting-Chun Wang, they realized they could use a neural network in place of the software called a video codec typically used to compress and decompress video for transmission over the net.\nTheir work enables a video call with one-tenth the network bandwidth users typically need. It promises to reduce bandwidth consumption by orders of magnitude in the future.\n\u201cWe want to provide a better experience for video communications with AI so even people who only have access to extremely low bandwidth can still upgrade from voice to video calls,\u201d said Mallya.\nBetter Connections Thanks to GANs\nThe technique works even when callers are wearing a hat, glasses, headphones or a mask. And just for fun, they spiced up their demo with a couple bells and whistles so users can change their hair styles or clothes digitally or create an avatar.\nA more serious feature in the works (shown at top) uses the neural network to align the position of users\u2019 faces for a more natural experience. Callers watch their video feeds, but they appear to be looking directly at their cameras, enhancing the feeling of a face-to-face connection.\n\u201cWith computer vision techniques, we can locate a person\u2019s head over a wide range of angles, and we think this will help people have more natural conversations,\u201d said Wang.\nSay hello to the latest way AI is making virtual life more real.\nHow AI-Assisted Video Calls Work\nThe mechanism behind AI-assisted video calls is simple.\nA sender first transmits a reference image of the caller, just like today\u2019s systems that typically use a compressed video stream. Then, rather than sending a fat stream of pixel-packed images, it sends data on the locations of a few key points around the user\u2019s eyes, nose and mouth.\nA generative adversarial network on the receiver\u2019s side uses the initial image and the facial key points to reconstruct subsequent images on a local GPU. As a result, much less data is sent over the network.\n\nLiu\u2019s work in GANs hit the spotlight last year with GauGAN, an AI tool that turns anyone\u2019s doodles into photorealistic works of art. GauGAN has already been used to create more than a million images and is available at the AI Playground.\n\u201cThe pandemic motivated us because everyone is doing video conferencing now, so we explored how we can ease the bandwidth bottlenecks so providers can serve more people at the same time,\u201d said Liu.\nGPUs Bust Bandwidth Bottlenecks\nThe approach is part of an industry trend of shifting network bottlenecks into computational tasks that can be more easily tackled with local or cloud resources.\n\u201cThese days lots of companies want to turn bandwidth problems into compute problems because it\u2019s often hard to add more bandwidth and easier to add more compute,\u201d said Andrew Page, a director of advanced products in NVIDIA\u2019s media group.\nNVIDIA Maxine bundles a suite of tools for video conferencing and streaming services.\nAI Instruments Tune Video Services\nGAN video compression is one of several capabilities coming to NVIDIA Maxine, a cloud-AI video-streaming platform to enhance video conferencing and calls. It packs audio, video and conversational AI features in a single toolkit that supports a broad range of devices.\nAnnounced this week at GTC, Maxine lets service providers deliver video at super resolution with real-time translation, background noise removal and context-aware closed captioning. Users can enjoy features such as face alignment, support for virtual assistants and realistic animation of avatars.\n\u201cVideo conferencing is going through a renaissance,\u201d said Page. \u201cThrough the pandemic, we\u2019ve all lived through its warts, but video is here to stay now as a part of our lives going forward because we are visual creatures.\u201d\nMaxine harnesses the power of NVIDIA GPUs with Tensor Cores running software such as NVIDIA Riva, an SDK for conversational AI that delivers a suite of speech and text capabilities.

NVIDIA is bringing this vibrant community an expanding set of tools of our own.\nThey include:\n\nNVIDIA AI \u2013 the industry standard for accelerating AI training and inference\nNVIDIA RAPIDS \u2013 a suite of software libraries to run data science and analytics on GPUs\nNVIDIA HPC SDK \u2013 compilers, libraries and software tools for high performance computing\nNVIDIA RTX \u2013 graphics drivers that deliver ray tracing and AI capabilities\n\nFor many years, NVIDIA has used Arm cores in its Jetson SoCs for edge computing and autonomous machines and more recently in networking products such as BlueField DPUs.\nBlueField data processing units accelerate and secure networking and storage jobs for cloud, embedded and enterprise applications with support from partners and independent software vendors.\nBringing these resources to Arm, a leader in energy-efficient computing, increases customer choice and expands opportunities for Arm and NVIDIA partners across four broad sectors.\nNVIDIA\u2019s support for Arm spans from supercomputers to personal and embedded systems.\nNew Horizons in High Performance Computing\nArm is extending its processor technology with Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE) to meet the needs of the world\u2019s largest and most powerful systems. NVIDIA engineers are already working to support SVE in Fujitsu\u2019s A64FX, the processor that powers Fugaku.\nSVE is the latest addition to the Arm Neoverse platform for data center computing and networking. It\u2019s powering simulations that advance science on Fugaku, ranked No. 1 on the TOP500 list of the world\u2019s most powerful computers.\nOur work will help Arm partners and customers generate optimized software for systems that use a combination of Neoverse CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs. It\u2019s the latest step in an HPC initiative announced in June 2019 to support NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA software for accelerated computing and AI on Arm.\nIn addition to the NVIDIA HPC SDK, software for NVIDIA Mellanox InfiniBand, the networking backbone of HPC, is fully supported and deployed on Arm servers today. And engineers are expanding support for Arm in NVIDIA Magnum IO, software that maximizes storage and network performance for multinode systems.\nGames in the Cloud Create Serious Opportunities\nIn cloud computing, NVIDIA is engaged with Arm server SoC and OEM partners on a range of fronts.\nFor example, NVIDIA partnered with Ampere Computing to extend its Mt. Jade server platform to cloud gaming. Ampere Altra-based systems pack two 80-core Arm-based SoCs, four NVIDIA T4 GPUs and an NVIDIA Mellanox BlueField-2 DPU. Together they can serve 128 gaming users simultaneously, streaming sessions for the Android-in-Cloud services popular with China\u2019s growing number of 5G smartphone users.\nWith help from NVIDIA, Ampere Computing\u2019s Mt. Jade platform is pioneering an emerging market for cloud gaming.\nIn addition, NVIDIA engineers have been porting code to Arm and developing new tools to optimize how cloud games are encoded, rendered and streamed to and from Arm-based servers and users. These tools are widely available to Arm server OEMs such as GIGABYTE, Inspur Electronic Information and Wiwynn.\nNVIDIA knows firsthand the potential of cloud gaming, thanks to its experience running its own service, GeForce NOW.\nBeyond gaming, cloud service providers are embracing Arm-based servers for machine learning, storage and other applications, accelerated by GPUs. That\u2019s why NVIDIA provides a range of GPU management and monitoring tools for Arm-based servers, including the NVIDIA Container Toolkit to run Docker containers on Arm with Kubernetes.\nBringing Enterprise AI to Every Company\nThe edge of the enterprise network is the next big frontier in computing. The NVIDIA EGX edge AI platform will support all major processor architectures, including Arm.\nRecognizing the need for energy-efficient computing at the edge, NVIDIA made Arm a centerpiece of its platforms for accelerated computing and AI across vertical markets. These platforms typically pair a GPU with a multicore Arm-based CPU in embedded modules like Jetson.\nWe pair tailored versions of these modules with developers kits specific to sectors such as healthcare (Clara), robotics (Isaac), autonomous vehicles (DRIVE) and more. They provide a rich set of opportunities that Arm software partners and SoCs providers can leverage to enable enterprise AI.\nAnd they\u2019ll only get richer with NVIDIA\u2019s intention, stated in its acquisition announcement, to make its IP available through Arm.\nThe Shape of Things to Come\nWindows PCs and Chromebook from multiple providers already run on Arm processors with more consumer platforms on the way. That\u2019s fueling ideas about the future of personal systems.\nNVIDIA has a long history of supporting PCs of all shapes and sizes with its GPUs, including Arm-based systems. More than 70 percent of gaming PCs use an NVIDIA GPU, according to a recent survey.\nThe future holds opportunities for AI-accelerated personal systems, rich in graphics and connectivity, as powerful as today\u2019s PCs and more energy efficient. An NVIDIA reference design currently used in healthcare markets is an example of capabilities the Arm ecosystem can leverage into markets such as personal systems.\nThe Tools that Build the Platforms\nNew platforms are made possible by advanced technologies like the Arm portfolio of processor IP that NVIDIA supports with a wealth of tools.\nThe CUDA toolkit for Arm brings to Arm\u2019s ecosystem NVIDIA\u2019s GPU-accelerated computing and AI capabilities. Through CUDA, developers get access to TensorRT for deep learning inference, DeepStream for video analytics and more.\nNVIDIA\u2019s offers a full suite of Nsight visual developer tools supporting Arm-based SoCs and servers with profilers, debuggers and more. You can access all our tools, SDKs and platforms through our developer site.\nWatch NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang describe the potential of the intended acquisition of Arm and recap all the news from GTC in the video below.\n\nNVIDIA has been supporting Arm for more than a decade, and we\u2019re just getting started. We\u2019re excited to be part of an expanding community that powers everything from smart cards to supercomputers and so much more to come.\nWe have lots of ideas about what\u2019s possible, and there\u2019s much we hope to learn from the 13 million developers in the Arm ecosystem.\nTo get access to hundreds of live and on-demand talks at GTC, register now through Oct. 9 using promo code CMB4KN to get 20 percent off.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Data Center | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | CUDA | Data Science | Gaming | High-Performance Computing | Jetson | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Clara | NVIDIA EGX | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The new NVIDIA RTX A6000 lets us completely redefine what\u2019s possible with real-time ray tracing and machine learning.\u201d\nImage courtesy of Digital Domain.\nGroupe Renault is one of the world\u2019s largest car manufacturers and a leading player in the emerging technology field of e-mobility.\n\u201cCreating the next generation of passenger cars requires design perfection and a relentless pursuit of aesthetic beauty,\u201d said Guillaume Shan, who works in Computer Graphics and Visualization Solutions at Groupe Renault. \u201cThe Renault design team constantly pushes the boundaries to use every tool at our disposal. We have always relied on NVIDIA technology to review design concepts in ray-traced photorealism. The new NVIDIA RTX A6000 has exceeded our expectations and shown performance gains of over 2x with ray-traced exterior scenes. It\u2019s quite impressive.\u201d\nOther early adopters, including some of the world\u2019s leading architecture, manufacturing, and media and entertainment companies, are using RTX A6000 to power new content:\n\nPredator Cycling, which specializes in custom carbon bicycles and builds them by hand in the U.S., is evalutating the NVIDIA RTX A6000 to accelerate every aspect of their process. Performance gains of 2-6x across a number of key applications give the team the power to simultaneously run analysis, modeling and screen-sharing on a video call.\nHKS, Inc., a leading architectural design firm, has seen the potential of the RTX A6000 to receive near instantaneous feedback on design changes while running simulations in real time. This gives them the ability to bring real building simulation down from days and weeks, to minutes or hours.\nFramestore, an Academy Award-winning animation and visual effects company in the U.K., can do real-time ray tracing on massive datasets in a remote workstation environment, which is made possible by the new RTX A6000, HP ZCentral and NVIDIA Omniverse.\n\nSecond-Generation RTX Accelerates Professional Workloads\nThe NVIDIA RTX A6000 and NVIDIA A40 deliver enhanced performance with groundbreaking technology, including:\n\nSecond-Generation RT Cores: Delivers up to 2x the throughput of the previous generation, plus concurrent ray tracing, shading and compute.\nThird-Generation Tensor Cores: Provides up to 5x the throughput of the previous generation, up to 10X with sparsity, with support for new TF32 and BF16 data formats.\nNew CUDA Cores: Delivers up to 2x the FP32 throughput of the previous generation for significant increases in graphics and compute.\n48GB of GPU Memory: The largest memory available in a single GPU, expandable to 96GB using NVLink to connect two GPUs.\nVirtualization: With the addition of NVIDIA virtual GPU software such as the NVIDIA Virtual Workstation we can support graphics workloads and powerful virtual workstation instances at scale for\u202fremote users, enabling larger workflows for high-end design, AI, and compute workloads.\nPCIe Gen 4: Provides twice the bandwidth of the previous generation, accelerating data transfers to the GPU for data-intensive workloads like data science, hybrid rendering and video streaming in PCIe Gen 4-enabled servers and workstations such as the Lenovo ThinkStation P620.\n\nNVIDIA Ampere GPUs Deliver Incredible Performance\nThe NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture provides incredible performance compared to the previous generation. Early testing by software partners like Blackmagic, Chaos Group and Luxion showcases performance gains that users will experience with these new GPUs.\n\u201cWe were impressed with the significantly better performance we measured on NVIDIA RTX A6000 than the prior generation of GPUs, both with general grading functions as well as our recent AI-based tools. Its 48 gigabytes of main memory greatly enhances Blackmagic RAW 8K and 12K camera workflows, making editing and grading performance fluid,\u201d said Dan May, president at Blackmagic Design.\n\u201cNVIDIA Ampere is a boon to all our GPU ray tracing, more than doubling the performance of V-Ray GPU and Project Lavina when comparing the RTX 3080 to the RTX 2080,\u201d said Phillip Miller, vice president of product management at Chaos Group. \u201cNow our users can have real-time, 100-percent ray tracing at HD resolutions using a single card.\u201d\nLuxion, makers of the popular KeyShot product visualization tool, is seeing close to triple the performance using the NVIDIA Ampere architecture. The integrated benchmark in the free KeyShot Viewer gave 34.7 on the NVIDIA RTX 6000 and 88.8 on the NVIDIA RTX A6000. In the upcoming KeyShot 10 release the performance on the A6000 was even better at 95.6 \u2014 that means the A6000 is 95.6x faster than the CPU baseline.1\nNVIDIA RTX A6000 and NVIDIA A40 Available in New Systems\u00a0\nA wide range of NVIDIA RTX A6000-based workstations are expected from the world\u2019s leading systems manufacturers, including BOXX, Dell, HP and Lenovo.\nA wide range of NVIDIA A40-based servers are expected from the world\u2019s leading systems manufacturers, including Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Lenovo.\nAvailability\nThe NVIDIA RTX A6000 will be available from channel partners including PNY, Leadtek, Ingram Micro, Ryoyo and on nvidia.com starting in mid December.

Can Black Holes Destroy Earth? All FAQs Answered About The Most Mysterious Object in Space         Team Latestly   19 October 2020 2 min read          New Delhi, October 19: Black holes are among the most mysterious and fascinating objects in outer space. Conspiracy theories such as black holes eat stars and planets always do rounds. So what is a black hole? In simple words, a black hole is a place in space with extremely strong gravitational power. Albert Einstein first predicted the existence of black holes in 1916. However, the term \"black hole\" was coined by American astronomer John Wheeler in 1967.

According to National Aeronautics and Space Administration or NASA, a black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. Black holes are invisible because no light can get out. Therefore, people can't see black holes. Scientists use space telescopes with special tools to find black holes. Research over the years has shed some light on black holes, their size and how they are formed. Black Hole Devours a Star, Almost The Size of The Sun, Like a Spaghetti! Astronomers Able to Capture 'Tidal Disruption Event' (Check Pic). How Big Are Black Holes? There are four types of black holes: stellar, intermediate, supermassive and miniature. According to scientists, the smallest black holes are as small as just one atom. The largest black holes are called \"supermassive.\" These black holes have masses that are more than 1 million suns together.

Here\u2019s How You Can Watch the Red Planet Throughout October Scientists believe the smallest black holes formed when the universe began. But scientists are not certain about how supermassive black holes formed. Supermassive black holes could be a merger of hundreds or thousands of tiny black holes. Every galaxy is believed to have supermassive black holes at the centre of it. Can a Black Hole Destroy Earth? Many believe black holes go around in space eating stars, moons and planets. Scientists have debunked this perception. Earth is facing no threat because no black hole is close enough to the solar system for our planet. According to NASA, even if a black hole the same mass as the sun replace the sun, Earth still would not fall in. Instead, Earth and the other planets would continue to orbit the black hole as they currently orbit the sun.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nIt's October now, which means it's mask season. Or, it would be if this whole year weren't mask season. At any rate, it seems that Nvidia's getting in on the holiday cheer with its newly announced Nvidia Maxine video streaming platform, which (among other features) essentially lets you video chat while wearing a deepfake style mask of...yourself. Maybe the result wasn't intended to be spooky, but looking at Nvidia's video demonstrations, Maxine is perfectly fitting for October.\u00a0Maxine actually comes with a bunch of features, but the one that first caught my eye was its new AI-assisted video compression tool. Have you ever wanted to deepfake your own face? Or turn your own face into a virtual chat avatar to then animate with something like the Facerig tool that's so common among virtual youtubers like Kizuna Ai? Because that's essentially what this tool does, all with the end goal of reducing bandwidth and (maybe) improving video streaming quality.Essentially, rather than constantly sending video data to whoever you're chatting with, this new video compression tool sends them a static picture of your face, then reads the movements of your lips, eyes, cheeks and other key facial features to animate that picture on the other end using AI. Nvidia gives an example of a video stream using nearly 100KB per frame vs. an AI compressed stream using just 0.12KB per frame, meaning about a 1000X difference in size. The result is a mostly realistic depiction of what you actually look like talking, but with much less data being sent over the network. Emphasis on \"mostly.\"Because the compression tool isn't actually sending video, but is instead animating a static picture, it has to make some guesses, which results in things like blurry teeth, fuzzy edges and an animatronic style feel on some motions. It's up to you whether a lower bandwidth cost is worth some uncanny valley imagery, but it does kind of feel like a little like an alien is wearing a skin suit in Nvidia's example video.Assuming those kinks get worked out, it still feels odd that we could eventually live in a future where video chats essentially use computer-generated facsimiles of our own faces...which we would operate using actual video of those same faces. And, like deepfakes, this does raise questions as to potential impersonation. Could I send someone a picture of Tim Cook and just map my facial movements to his face? But given that this is currently being positioned as a developer-focused tool rather than a consumer-facing one, companies might consider the tradeoff in realism worth it for increased performance.Of course, Maxine doesn't stop just at recreating your face. It's also promising AI-powered 'enhancements,' like Face Re-animation. The concept here is pretty simple. Say you're focusing your eyes on a certain corner of your monitor screen, or tilting your head off to the side so you can look at a second monitor. Much like the AI video compression outlined above, Face Re-animation will use a still reference image and your facial movement data to adjust how you look on camera so that you appear to be looking directly at the screen, with your eyes focused on its center.Nvidia's example video shows that this still has a ways to go, as the re-animated face is distinctly lower quality than the input data and stutters a bit as it moves to the center. It also comes with the same uncanny valley quality as the AI video compression tool. But assuming this all gets worked out, I could see something like this being helpful for workers who need to multitask during meetings, or even students dealing with overly aggressive virtual learning software punishing them for not looking directly at the screen.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.On a less unsettling end of the spectrum, Maxine also promises AI-assisted video upscaling, which could help those who don't have the best webcams, as well as similar features to RTX Voice's noise reduction and Nvidia Broadcast's auto-frame. Nvidia's demo video also briefly shows off tools for live language translation and for mapping facial movements to cartoon avatars, which might help offset the uncanny valley nature of Maxine's AI compression and Face Re-animation tools. We currently don't know much about these features, but they seem like they'd be genuinely helpful regardless of whether someone is a developer or not.For now, Nvidia Maxine isn't coming straight to consumers. Instead, Nvidia's offering free cloud access to it to third-party firms, who can then use it to improve their own software. That's probably good, because while running these tools locally off your own RTX cards could improve performance, keeping them to the cloud will make them more accessible to the average person and will go further toward normalizing them. Still, communications firm Avaya is the only partner to have currently announced that it's using Maxine, so don't expect to see these features popping up in your Zoom calls anytime soon.All jokes aside, as work-from-home continues to be the new normal across plenty of industries, it's not surprising to see companies like Nvidia step up to try to make these spaces easier and more professional. Even if it means they have to walk through the uncanny valley first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (2)\n\n\n\nMichelle EhrhardtSocial Links NavigationMichelle Ehrhardt is an editor at Tom's Hardware.

Well, that really depends on you now doesn't it? When NVIDIA announced the RTX 30 Series in September they also touched on a few new technologies like they usually do and one of the bigger aspects was the focus on latency and what they were doing to bring the total system latency down as much as possible. And that's where NVIDIA Reflex technology comes into play. But what is NVIDIA Reflex? That seems to be a resounding question as people seem to be confusing it with the already established \"NVIDIA Low Latency Mode\" found in the control panel when it's so much more.\nTo better understand NVIDIA Reflex you need to think of it as you do RTX where it's a suite of technologies and not just one thing. See with RTX there's DXR, Vulkan RT, DLSS, and other features that are supported (at least on a hardware level) within that technology suite. The same kind of idea is going on here where NVIDIA Reflex has three distinct parts for now; The NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency SDK support IN GAME, the GeForce Experience Performance Tool within GFE, and (for now but may expand) NVIDIA G-SYNC 360Hz panels WITH Reflex Latency Analyzer build into the monitor.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Reflex 2 Only Works With RTX 50 GPUs At Launch, Older RTX Support Coming Later\n\u00a0\nWe're hoping that by the end of reading through this you have a better understanding of what NVIDIA Reflex is and what it can do you for you, if you're looking for a review of the Alienware 25 Gaming monitor that NVIDIA sent over for us to work on this with you'll have to wait a bit for that but it is what I used for this discussion so when I reference the panel, that's the one I'm speaking to.\nGame Support Through SDK\nOut of the three branches of NVIDIA Reflex, the Game Support through their SDK is the most accessible measure. This only requires GeForce gamers to toggle a switch inside the supported games to activate. Sure you could get some latency benefits by simply going into the NVIDIA Control Panel and tuning the latency to \"Ultra\" but that only does so much. In the game embedded SDK for NVIDIA Reflex, they actually optimize the game to control the controllable as the saying goes.\nTotal system latency is the end game with bringing down the time it takes from the moment you click the mouse to the action takes place on the screen. There are many steps in the total pipeline and really only two parts that NVIDIA can consistently control, somewhat. They have some control of the rendering latency through their drivers and hardware they build and then they have some control over the display (provided it's G-SYNC certified and has the hardware module). But NVIDIA Reflex SDK lets them get a bit more granular in that are working with the developers to really impact the render queue so that frames are literally pushed to the screen without delay.\nTypically the game render queue is just ahead of the GPU when you're in a GPU bound situation and is lining the frames up to be displayed, but what if the render queue was able to kick the frame out the second it was ready rather than waiting? That's essentially what it's doing, so you'll need to not be using VSYNC for this one. Typically gamers would have to brute force framerates and push as high as possible in an effort to reducing latency through resolution modification and min-maxing settings, but that will only get you so far.\nNVIDIA Reflex Low Latency Options In Fortnite\nNow in order for this to be really effective, your GPU has to be the limiting factor and not your CPU because the CPU comes earlier in the pipeline and can really slow things down. But if you're on something like the GTX 1660 like I did a lot of my testing on then you'll find a noticeable boost in responsiveness that makes it feel like you got a graphics card upgrade. But we'll get into that part a bit more towards the end.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\n\u00a0\nG-SYNC 360Hz w/Reflex Latency Analyzer\nThe real meat and potatoes of the NVIDIA Reflex package come to life within the new 360Hz G-SYNC panels with NVIDIA's Reflex Analyzer built-in. NVIDIA sent over their LDAT system along with the PCAT system just before the 30 Series started rolling out as a way to measure total system latency. While that was a good and versatile system it was also still clunky and not very fun to use, definitely not something that you would want to use on a daily driver.\nBut something like LDAT was the only real alternative to using super high frame rate cameras and light sensors and counting frames to measure latency, and that was still quite difficult to get consistent results with. the Reflex Latency Analyzer aims to fix all that, it's still early and some growing to do when it comes to the variety of availability and compatible mice (my favorite CM MM710 is not yet supported) but first with the panels.\n360Hz, that's pretty insane and if you're someone sensitive to latency you'll be able to appreciate that aspect alone. But right now there are only 4 panels and 4 gaming mice that are currently supported, we have access to the Alienware 25 Gaming Monitor and the Logitech G Pro Wireless (wired mode for our testing). But for more on the panel and our full thoughts, we'll be getting to the review later.\nThe G-SYNC module in these panels has the integrated Reflex Latency Analyzer built right into it. This takes advantage of a USB passthrough for the panel to remove the need for external readers such as high-speed cameras or something like the LDAT system by having measurement tools built into the unit. So the way it works is pretty intuitive, but there is some setup.\nYou'll need to locate the dedicated passthrough port for the monitor and have the mouse plugged straight into the panel, for the Alienware 25 it was the bottom right port just off center of the bottom side of the screen. Then you'll need to go into the OSD of the panel and navigate to the G-SYNC Processor tab and you'll find the Reflex Latency Analyzer. From there you'll be able to turn it on and set up where you want the sensor to display, then start analyzing your latency I guess is the best way to put it.\nPicture taken as gunfire was used for capturing latency in the box\nIt may seem like something very simple but what it's doing is measuring total system latency by keeping up with the moment the mouse is clicked, then waiting for a light change in the pixels of the area you've selected, and boom, you've got your total system latency. This is essentially what the LDAT system was doing but without the need for a light sensor strapped to your panel to distract you while you're gaming. The latency for each click is shown on screen, but if you want to do more with it, then you'll want to enable the next bit of the NVIDIA Reflex Suite.\nAnd for those wondering the Reflex Analyzer tool doesn't require a 360Hz panel but it's just where the tool is rolling out to first. And just like with LDAT and camera based measuring tools the fact that it's a 360Hz panel does increase the accuracy that the analyzer can read the changes at.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nGeForce Experience Performance Tool\nGeForce Experience has been constantly expanding over the past few years and, as part of NVIDIA Reflex, is now including updates to the performance overlay that allow you to track the metrics in latency as well as raw performance. This expansion of information to pair up with the G-SYNC Latency Analyzer takes almost all aspects of the guesswork out of analyzing setting up your system for maximum performance and minimal latency.\nIf you have all the boxes hardware boxes checked with a modern GeForce graphics card, a G-SYNC Reflex Latency Analyzer, AND a compatible mouse (should be expanding with time) then you'll be able to see a full rundown of the system performance. From the top, you'll have your framerate and then each component of the latency breakdown with an average system latency metric at the bottom (what we used in the end for checking comparisons).\n\nBut what if you are missing a compatible mouse? Well if it's a mouse in the Database it'll just go off the average to fill in that gap. But if it's unsupported? You can still get your PC + Display latency which is what I'd have to use if I wanted to use my CM MM710.\u00a0 As of right now, there are no output files for these results, but that could change.\nOkay, all the jargon out of the way, what does it do for your gaming?\nAim Right, Not High With NVIDIA Reflex\nI could likely go on for quite some time about how ultra-high refresh rate gaming makes a massive difference in motion fluidity and how you can pick out movement in the distance while you are strafing or swinging around a corner. Or how in Modern Warfare I've finally been able to get shot in the back and flick around catching the assailant while mid-turn, return fire, and greatly increase my chances of not just dropping dead like I always do. I'm also one of those people who can see the benefit of a 240Hz panel over a 144Hz, if you're not then you likely won't get the appeal of the move to 360Hz.\nBut, we're here for the Reflex aspect of it and short and simple is it works. But it's not just cut and dry saying it works and walking away from it, we have to measure it right? We paired up the Alienware 25 Gaming Monitor with the included Logitech Pro G Wireless with the Cooler Master NC100 that houses the Intel Ghost Canyon Core i9 NUC along with 16GB of DDR4 2666 and an ADATA Falcon 1TB drive. We wanted to test a couple of different video cards to see who really benefits the most from the Reflex Low Latency mode within Fortnite and Modern Warfare since both are games I play and support the technology. So I pulled out the Zotac GTX 1660 to represent the large swath of gamers along with the RTX 2080 Super to see how things go on the super high end, it's all at 1080p so the 2080 Super is still quite high on that performance chart.\nFrom there we loaded up the newest version of GeForce Experience, setup the overlay, and got underway. Testing was pretty straightforward for both games where we used the exact same settings for both cards. In Fortnite, we just went to the 'High' preset and landed in our personal creation island, grabbed a hand cannon and loaded it up with ammo, aimed at the mountains....and fired away! For Call of Duty Modern Warfare, we loaded up the Fog of War map and set to testing just before the aerial strike took place with the settings cranked to the highest but 'Ray Traced Shadows' disabled.\n\n\nFortnite Latency Reflex Off vs On vs On + Boost\n\nAverage System Latency\n\n\n071421283542\n\n\n\n\n\n071421283542\n\n\n\n\n\n2080S off\n\n22\n\n\n2080 on\n\n20\n\n\n2080 on + Boost\n\n19\n\n\n1660 off\n\n41\n\n\n1660 on\n\n24\n\n\n1660 on + boost\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFortnite shows amazing results for the GTX 1660 with bringing it nearly in line with latency that you get by default with the much more powerful RTX 2080. Of course, that brings something to the forefront, the RTX 2080 Super barely benefited at all but it did benefit by 10% or better. This is because the GTX 1660 was heavily limited by the GPU in the testing scenario whereas the RTX 2080 Super was not showing that when the GPU is the heavier load the payoff is much greater.\n\n\nCoD Modern Warfare Latency Reflex Off vs On vs On + Boost\n\nAverage System Latency\n\n\n0102030405060\n\n\n\n\n\n0102030405060\n\n\n\n\n\n2080S off\n\n35\n\n\n2080 on\n\n33\n\n\n2080 on + Boost\n\n32\n\n\n1660 off\n\n57\n\n\n1660 on\n\n51\n\n\n1660 on + boost\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe got somewhat similar results in Modern Warfare but not quite nearly as striking as a result. The GTX 1660 still managed to see bigger gains by enabling Reflex Low Latency mode and the RTX 2080 Super received smaller gains. But with the RTX 2080 Super you could easily push up the render resolution or enable RT Shadows and be able to bring the total system latency back down to what you were used to.\nIf you're already min-maxing settings the Reflex Low Latency mode being enabled may only give you a slight advantage in the total system latency area but it'll be an advantage nonetheless. The biggest benefit here will be the more casual player, like myself, who doesn't want to kill the settings in favor of latency, but would love to have a boost where they can get it. It's definitely noticeable with the GTX 1660 and while it doesn't boost framerates, so you'll still get the same there, it definitely makes the game more responsive.\nOkay, cool, so the software implementation is great for a lot of people, but what about that crazy expensive 360Hz 1080p panel. Who is that for and what's the deal there. Those 360Hz panels are quite frankly geared to those who want the absolute leading edge advantage. While Reflex Low Latency Mode can indeed improve latency across any refresh rate you simply can't make up for lost frames and motion fluidity. The combination of 360Hz and the ability to properly measure your tuning (via the Reflex Analyzer Tool) means you're able to tune your game settings and system component settings for every absolute advantage on the playing field.\nThere is one major disadvantage to fine-tuning your system to that level when you're not a pro and that is it's your fault when you die, not your system's. Seriously, times in MW when I would normally have said someone was cheating, I saw them, I saw what they were doing, I just wasn't fast enough. It's a surreal kind of experience for those who play competitively, nothing has come close to the fluidity that you get with a low latency 360Hz experience. So whether you're already playing competitively or want to play competitively I see a strong argument for the total NVIDIA Reflex package. But as always, if you can't see the benefit for yourself, then there might not be one for you.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nSteam Play Gets NVIDIA\u2019s Reflex Technology In New VKD3D-Proton Update\n\nMuhammad Zuhair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready Driver for GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER Out Now; Reflex Support Is in Over 100 Games\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 GPUs Offer Over 500 FPS In Counter-Strike 2, 35% Lower Latencies With Reflex\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3 Games Will Also Offer DLSS 2 + Reflex for Previous RTX Series, NVIDIA Confirms\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n137\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n84\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n78\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n52\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n49\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

(Source: HDB)   By Faris Mokhtar (Bloomberg) -- Giant solar-powered air-conditioners, vacuum garbage collection, subterranean roads for electric vehicles, urban farms and green architecture. Put them all together and you have Tengah, Singapore\u2019s most ambitious project yet to build the city of the future. Tengah, which means \u2018centre\u2019 in the local Malay language, is part of Singapore\u2019s effort to reduce a carbon footprint that\u2019s bigger than some countries that are 50 times its size, and to promote sustainability in energy, water and waste. The Southeast Asian nation, which is smaller than New York City, has set a target of capping its emissions by around 2030 and then halving them by 2050.  Key to reaching that goal will be to tackle the city\u2019s debilitating tropical heat and humidity, while cutting the nation\u2019s ever-rising energy bill for air-conditioning. Once described by founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew as the greatest invention of the 20th century, air-con is now widespread in homes and offices. The nation has more cooling units per capita than anywhere else in Southeast Asia. With tropical temperatures averaging around 27 Celsius (81 Fahrenheit) year-round and rising, the amount of power needed to cool Singapore is projected to grow 73% between 2010 and 2030, according to local research. To slow the increase, the new town will use a district cooling network based on a commercial system in Singapore\u2019s Marina Bay Financial District, where refrigeration plants and pipes were laid underground before the offices were built. In Tengah, the cooling units will be solar powered and installed on rooftops of public-housing blocks, with chilled water piped through the buildings. The system\u2019s operator, SP Group, says the network can cut energy use by 30% -- an emissions saving equivalent to 4,500 gasoline-powered cars. Residents have the option of connecting to the centralised cooling, or buying and running their own traditional air-con units.  \u201cThe biggest challenge that we face is to get residents to sign up,\u201d said S Harsha, Singapore managing director of sustainable energy solutions at SP Group. The key is to show residents how the energy-efficient system can save them money, he said. Since the government\u2019s Housing and Development Board began offering 8,000 flats in the new estate in 2018, close to 1,000 buyers have signed up for the centralised cooling, which Harsha said would be cheaper to install than a normal system. Homes in Singapore\u2019s new public housing projects are sold at a subsidised price to citizens -- mostly young married couples -- based on a ballot before construction begins. The first batch of Tengah\u2019s planned 42,000 flats will be ready by late 2022 or in 2023.   Story continues Young couple Shaun Wong and Beverly Tan said it was the project\u2019s green credentials that made them decide to apply for one of the homes.\u201cWe\u2019re merely perpetuating a practice that we\u2019ve adopted,\u201d said 23-year-old Tan, who runs an e-commerce business and said she favours eco-friendly clothes and household products and prefers to use a fan rather than air-con. \u201cPractice what you preach.\u201dOnce the site of brickworks and pepper plantations, the new town will have five districts with community farming, garden and forest themes.

(PHOTO: hoolah)   By Lyn Chan SINGAPORE \u2014 As many small companies still struggle with the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore payments startup hoolah is showing that not all is doom and gloom. The two-year-old startup offering a \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d solution is forging ahead with its plans to expand in Asia, and has also launched its solution in physical stores in Singapore in August.  Hoolah was first launched in February 2018 as a \u201cBuy Now Pay Later\u201d solution for online e-commerce platforms, offering consumers the option of completing their purchases in three separate zero interest monthly payments. The popularity of hoolah grew as online shopping boomed as the coronavirus pandemic spread and people are confined to their homes. In Singapore, e-commerce sites saw a 23 per cent in visitors for the first half of 2020 compared to a year earlier, according to a study by product comparison website iPrice and web analytics platform SimilarWeb. \u201cOver the past six months, website visitors have increased by 500 per cent, with a sevenfold increase in total transactions made via the platform,\u201d hoolah\u2019s CEO and co-founder Stuart Thornton told Yahoo Finance Singapore in a recent interview. \u201cWe deliver between 20 and 40 per cent increase in conversion and basket size for our merchants.\u201d To date, hoolah has more than 1,000 retailer store partners, a 280 per cent jump from October last year, he added.  The idea for the start-up took shape during Thornton\u2019s four-year stint at Worldpay. The UK-born executive, who has lived in Singapore since 2008, approached his three co-founders \u2014 Arvin Singh, Daniel Pieper, and Jason Van \u2014 with the proposition to introduce a similar solution to Asia. \u201cAs the idea took shape, it became obvious that it would need a variety of experience and expertise to make this idea come alive. It was at this point that the team started to form,\u201d said Thornton, adding that \u201cit was never difficult convincing them of the opportunity\u201d. Today, Singh, an ex-colleague from Worldpay, is the chief operating officer, with Pieper as chief information officer and Van holding the post of chief technology officer. The company, which hires over 75 people in the four market, is actively looking to add more staff as it expands, he said. In February this year, the company expanded to Malaysia, and partnered with two fashion tech companies, Novelship and BlinQ. Coming full circle, hoolah offered its solution to physical retail stores in Singapore, and it is available at over 150 retail outlets islandwide since August. As Singapore gears up for Phase 3 of reopening, Thornton and his team hope to partner with more outlets.   Story continues \u201cGiven the popularity of physical shopping across the Asia Pacific region, we had always intended on bringing the in-store solution to market,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal, however, wasn\u2019t to align to either e-commerce or in-store, but to build a truly omni-channel solution where a customer could seamlessly shop where they prefer but still have the same great experience.\u201dHoolah has since launched its online and in-store solution, or what it calls its \u201comni-channel solution\u201d in Hong Kong and has signed up 10 merchants in October, he said. Thornton said his team has just wrapped up talks with Thailand\u2019s regulatory bodies for the same offering, its final expansion for 2020.The expansion is funded with an eight-figure sum raised in the Series A funding, led by investment firm Allectus Capital earlier this year. The company is now actively raising funding for their Series B round, Thornton said, declining to give more details about the company\u2019s valuation. The company raised a seven-figure sum in seed funding, led by AccelerAsia Ventures and Aletra Capital Partners, eight months after it was founded.Thornton shares his experience and inspiration with Yahoo Finance Singapore:Q: What misconceptions and apprehensions do merchants and customers have about hoolah?A: To manage the misconception of hidden fees, we ensure that our customers are able to quickly identify through all of our channels, from our website to our customer support chat, the consistent message of \u201cno hidden fees\u201d / \u201cno processing charges\u201d.On the merchant side, occasionally, there is some apprehension that hoolah may not be able to deliver the same type of growth experienced by our past customers. The proof is always better when shown through a proper study with a merchant, so we benchmark upfront a merchant\u2019s existing performance using the data shared with us and control for other other variables like seasonality.What risks do you face with the \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d option?There are risks of fraud and default payment, although such cases have been very low. We built a proprietary risk decision engine that crawls through a number of data points for real-time risk assessment. In addition, measures are implemented to mitigate these risks: We communicate with consumers regularly, reminding them of payment dates and treating them respectfully throughout the process.Who inspires you the most?There are many people who have inspired me \u2013 teachers, leaders, companies and my parents. One person who inspires me, and more so, motivates me, is my daughter. She inspires me to create something and be someone she will be proud of. I want to be able to show her that hard work, and sometimes sacrifice is important and inevitable \u2014 nothing comes to you easily.What advice would you give to aspiring entrepreneurs?Creating and setting up your own business is a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows, sacrifices, hard work, and hustle. It is sometimes portrayed romantically, and a lot of people aren't ready for what it takes to succeed, and perhaps are swayed by the opportunity to work with some level of freedom.My advice to anyone is that there is never a right time to do it \u2013 but make sure you are absolutely aware of your motivation for doing it as this will be your north star. Be ready to sacrifice a lot, change your lifestyle and find ways to do the impossible. Make sure what you end up focusing on is something you are passionate about. It is vital to keep an open mind, listen to the people around you and listen to your customersRelated stories:Expansion key to emerging stronger from coronavirus crisis: ShopBack CEOShopee to focus on growing market share in Southeast Asia to maintain leadSME segment is key to growth for CIMB Bank Singapore: CEO Victor Lee  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Last month, the French asset manager launched a wealth management joint venture in Shanghai so as to tap growing wealth in that market. It also plans to establish an outbound investment business in Beijing as China becomes more welcoming to global asset management firms, as part of a broader reform of its financial sector.  The flurry of activity in China might lead some to think that Amundi is shifting focus out of Southeast Asia. But Eric Bramoull\u00e9, CEO of Amundi in South Asia, says this is not the case. In an interview with The Edge Singapore, he maintains that the region continues to play an integral part of the asset manager\u2019s bid for expansion outside its core market of Europe. Southeast Asia holds much potential for growth, despite its diverse markets, he says. As such, the asset management firm intends to expand further in Southeast Asia, apart from its existing presence in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, notes Bramoull\u00e9, who has more than two decades of experience in this industry. In particular, the Philippines and Indonesia stood out for Amundi: Both countries have a combined population of about 400 million and Bramoull\u00e9 expects the retail markets there to \u201cboom\u201d in the coming years in line with the rapid economic growth. \u201cSo, at some point [in time], if you want to develop your activity, you have to get there,\u201d he adds.  David Poh, Amundi\u2019s head of investments in Singapore, agrees. He tells The Edge Singapore that the huge populations of the Philippines and Indonesia are largely made up of young people, thus presenting a huge opportunity for Amundi to tap as more workers enter the labour market and want to increase their income. Poh also reckons the \u201cwealth effect\u201d will be flowing through the whole masses maybe in two, three, five or 10 years from now. \u201cSo, if you think long-term, this is where Amundi wants to be,\u201d he adds. But with Covid-19, many businesses have been forced to scale back ambitions for capturing new markets. Amundi is no different as its plans for the Philippines and Indonesia have been put on hold. Bramoull\u00e9 says the pandemic has introduced a lot of uncertainties, apart from wreaking havoc across many economies. \u201cWe see 2020 as [somewhat] a gap [year]. It has put some things on standby,\u201d he says. Established on January 1, 2010, Amundi is a relatively new entity. Its brand might be relatively unfamiliar to people outside the financial services industry but it can trace its roots to two larger and better known French financial institutions as Amundi is the result of the merger between the asset management businesses of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale (SocGen).   Story continues Asia pivotAchieving organic growth has been a difficult task for many asset management firms over the last decade. With the rise of passive investing \u2014 particularly in exchange traded funds (ETFs) \u2014 asset managers find it challenging to outperform the returns of ETFs. This had shifted money to passive investing from active investing. The relatively buoyant US market \u2014 the world\u2019s largest \u2014 also made it relatively simple for investors to make returns by just betting together with the indices. Many investors have wondered if active asset managers deserve their fees. The impact of Covid-19 has only made things worse.For 1HFY2020 ended June 30, Amundi recorded revenue of EUR1.24 billion ($1.9 billion), down 7.2% y-o-y. This was due to the strong negative market effect on financial income, it says. As a result, Amundi registered earnings of EUR439 million, down 13.1% y-o-y.Nevertheless, Amundi\u2019s total asset under management (AUM) grew 7.1% y-o-y to EUR1.59 trillion. This was despite investors having withdrawn 4 billion euros from its core markets of France and Italy. Amundi saw outflows of EUR10.2 billion from short-term money market funds versus inflows of EUR6.2 billion into medium and long-term strategies.The growth of its total AUM can be attributed to Amundi\u2019s operations in Asia. The region saw inflows of 5.6% in the half-year period, versus outflows of 6.6% last year. Amundi\u2019s AUM in Asia leapt 44% y-o-y to EUR292 billion.This is expected to grow further. Last December, the Chinese regulator approved the plan to create a wealth management joint venture (JV) between Amundi (55%) and BOC Wealth Management (45%). The latter is a subsidiary of Bank of China \u2014 the fourth-largest Chinese bank \u2014 with 500 million private customers and 11,000 branches. The JV is expected to launch its products by the end of this year following a final approval from the Chinese regulator.Growth in Spain will also give a boost to Amundi. Apart from starting the distribution of Amundi products through the Banco Sabadell network, the asset management firm completed the full acquisition of Sabadell Asset Management (Sabadell AM) on June 30. The latter is the fifth largest player in Spain with EUR21 billion in AUM. Amundi expects Sabadell AM to book earnings of EUR33 million in 2020.Amundi has also renewed its partnership with SocGen for five years. Under the partnership, the asset management firm remains the leading provider of savings products and services for its networks in France and the Czech Republic. It also remains the partner in employee savings schemes in France and the fund manager for the Sogecap (SocGen\u2019s life and insurance unit) mandate.Expansion plansSo, what will Amundi\u2019s expansion into the Philippines and Indonesia look like? How will it cater its products to a diverse set of demographics in the Philippines and Indonesia? How will Amundi work around the respective regulations and bureaucracy of these two markets?Bramoull\u00e9 says establishing a JV \u2014 like how it has done so in China \u2014 could be one option, but he notes that Amundi will explore all possibilities. Meanwhile, Poh adds that undertaking a partnership would probably be the easiest way to enter both markets. That will mean Amundi has to find a local partner with the right ability and marketing machinery.Bramoull\u00e9 says Amundi will customise its sales strategies and products to each market. The key is to listen to the local distributors to understand the needs of clients, he says. Amundi, he adds, does not what to offer products it thinks clients want, but products that clients want. \u201cBy answering their issues, we design to give them the solutions that are fitting their needs,\u201d he says.Still, with customisation comes the loss of economies of scale. Poh says that Amundi can leverage its global network of analysts and portfolio managers. The asset management does not rely on a small team to create products for each market. \u201cThat\u2019s how we achieve the economies of scale.A good example of customisation and partnership is the Amundi-OCBC Momentum Fund, says Bramoull\u00e9. The fund, which is managed by Amundi and exclusively distributed by OCBC Bank, was launched in Singapore in August. He describes this fund as a \u201cmilestone\u201d between the two financial institutions. \u201cIt combines the engine of Europe\u2019s largest asset manager and the expertise of one of Singapore\u2019s longest-established banks.\u201dDollar cost averaging is a well-known investment strategy but according to Amundi, there is a key difference with this fund. Instead of waiting for the investor to top up his or her investment to average down the cost, the portfolio manager of this fund has the mandate to initiate dollar cost averaging for the investor. The fund leverages the cost-averaging effect when it systematically allocates assets from an initial pool of fixed income securities to equity ETFs. Investors are paid a regular dividend and get to enjoy further capital appreciation when markets move higher. To make a bet for an upside, the fund allows up to a maximum of 25% into non-investment grade bonds, which comes with higher risks but higher coupons.Poh says the fund reflects a systematic and disciplined approach to investing. He says it is always better to be invested, rather than trying to time the market. \u201cIf the client gives us the funds, we will surely be invested in the market, regardless of the volatility of the market. It is the investment in the market that is more important [as it] is able to generate a much better alpha, than trying to time the market,\u201d he adds.See Also:Lower asset yields and lower cost of funds expected ahead of banks 3Q20 results: analysts Maybank Kim Eng expects Singapore banks' 3Q2020 trading update to be 'less bad, but not great' Analysts remain 'neutral' on Singapore banking sector following extension of loan relief measures Singapore's bank lending slowed for the sixth month in August Extension of dividend cap beyond 2020 a 'possibility': DBS   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

It is also putting up a RMB1.5 billion corporate guarantee to loans taken out by Sincere.

CDL is going to appoint an external financial advisor to help evaluate and review its investment in Sincere. \u201cThe impact on the group or its financial reporting will be prepared and calibrated together with the external financial advisor,\u201d the company says.

Originally the images were available on the Chinese Baidu social media platform but were taken down quite quickly. However, thanks to Avery on Twitter and VideoCardz we can still ponder over these images and the various details revealed.\n\nAbove you can see a tray of GA104-300 GPUs waiting to pass through their validation phase. Passing through the tests the result will be 'excellent', 'qualified' or 'unqualified', with the latter samples being re-tested before being judged to have failed to make the grade. The 'GA104-300' is a GA104 GPU being validated to the 300 spec which will be used for GeForce RTX 3070 graphics cards. VideoCardz reports that the \"GA104-300 GPU is a cut-down variant of the GA104-400.\" According to the factory validation images source, the testing line pictured is used to validate approximately a thousand GPUs per day.\n\nWe already have official confirmation that the GeForce RTX 3070 features 5,888 CUDA cores, a boost clock of 1.73GHz, and 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM. Last week Nvidia announced that the RTX 3070 was delayed by a fortnight, in order to have a better stock situation at launch. On the news blog post Nvidia shared an illuminating performance chart comparing the new RTX 3070 directly against the previous gen RTX 2070 and RTX 2080 Ti.\nNvidia will launch the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 on Thursday 29th October.\n\nAnother photo in the original Baidu post was of a similar machine validating GA102 GPUs. The original poster talked of \"tens of thousands\" of GA102 being validated this way before they were off to AIBs. Obviously Nvidia and its partners are working hard to pump out RTX 3080 products as there was a significant shortfall of stock, which remains the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 10 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

With its emphasis on green-living, the development won in the Design Excellence and Top Development categories at the annual EdgeProp Excellence Awards 2020 Virtual Ceremony held on Oct 29.    Comprising 505 units, The Clement Canopy is now fully sold (Credit: Samuel Isaac Chua/ The Edge Singapore) The Clement Canopy was envisioned to embody high-rise living amid lush greenery. The developer, UOL Group, took care to weave in the narrative of forest-living on its grounds. Trees were planted within the compound, with the anticipation that they would grow tall and tower over the residential grounds. These include the Terminalia Calamansanai, which can grow up to 30m in height.  Meanwhile, the lower layers of shrubbery include fern species such as Nephrolepis Exaltata, Phymatosorous Membranifolium, Asplenium Nidus and Philodendron Bipinnafolium. Plants such as Calathea Lutea, Heliconia and Rhapis Excelsa, were also introduced in creating screens and lush backdrops within the landscape, says UOL.    The Clement Canopy was envisioned to embody high-rise living amid lush greenery (Credit: UOL Group)\u00a0 The amenities at The Clement Canopy were also designed to emulate natural surroundings. The swimming pool, for instance, meanders around the trees planted on the ground, taking after the appearance of natural water bodies. The Clement Canopy is also touted by UOL as the tallest residential development in Singapore to adopt innovative construction methods. The two residential towers, each 40-storey tall, were built by Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction, or in short, PPVC. This means three-dimensional modules were completed with internal finishings in factories before they were transported and installed on the actual site.    The Clement Canopy was envisioned to embody high-rise living amid lush greenery\u00a0(Credit: UOL Group)\u00a0 Such a construction method has its advantages. It allows for a better construction environment, as the bulk of construction work can be carried out in factories, minimising dust and noise pollution on the actual construction site. Off-site fabrication in factories can also allow for improved quality control. PPVC can also boost the productivity of the project, cutting time and manpower during the building stages. As a result, The Clement Canopy was able to be completed nearly six months ahead of schedule. Although it was originally scheduled for completion in 4Q2019, by July 2019, several residents had already moved into their new homes.   Story continues   The two-bedroom show unit at The Clement Canopy (Credit:\u00a0Samuel Isaac Chua/ The Edge Singapore)Located at Clementi Avenue 1 in District 5, The Clement Canopy was built on a GLS site that was awarded to UOL in 2015. It was one of the first sites awarded that was mandated by the Singapore government that the construction needed to adopt PPVC construction methods for at least 65% of the total constructed floor area within the residential development.  The three-bedroom show unit at The Clement Canopy (Credit:\u00a0Samuel Isaac Chua/ The Edge Singapore)While the two residential towers were built using PPVC, the other ground-floor structures such as the multi-storey car park, groundfloor podium and condo amenities were constructed using conventional methods.The Clement Canopy is a 14-minute walk to Clementi MRT station on the East-West line. Based on caveats lodged with URA, the latest transaction at The Clement Canopy was for a 1,346 sq ft unit on the 27th floor, which transacted at $2.04 million ($1,515 psf) on Aug 5. Prior to that, on April 15, a similar-sized unit on the fourth floor transacted at $1.98 million ($1,472 psf).Check out the latest listings near:\u00a0The Clement Canopy,\u00a0Clementi Avenue 1, Clementi MRT station\u00a0See Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools CapitaLand, CDL and UOL clinch top prizes at EdgeProp Excellence Awards 2020 People-centricity at the core of CapitaLand\u2019s success Inspired by Changi\u2019s rustic charm Sophia Hills shines with integrated heritage concept  En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Additionally the PC gaming centric Dell brand has launched a number of new gaming monitors with refresh rates as high as 360Hz.\n\nAlienware Aurora R11 \nThis futuristic looking desktop now comes with Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 Series GPU options. The systems are available to buy in the US today starting at $2,381 for the RTX 3080 version and $3,577 for the RTX 3090 version (UK pricing and availability not provided yet). Other key performance components inside this machine are the 10th Gen Intel Core i9 10900KF processors, a minimum of 16GB of fast HyperX Ram, and a minimum of a 512GB PCIe NVMe boot SSD + 1TB HDD storage. There is an AMD Ryzen version of this desktop too, also with RTX 30 options, which is dubbed the Alienware Aurora Ryzen Edition R10 Gaming Desktop.\n\nWith one of Nvidia's power hungry new GPUs in this relatively compact system one might worry about thermals. Hence Alienware seems to have devoted a large chunk of its latest blog post on its custom design GeForce RTX 30 cards. Alienware's engineers have developed an AIC that takes the following design choices:\n\n\nExtensive cooling \u2013 Our new thermal design includes quad 10mm copper heat pipes with integrated vapour chambers. This provides exceptional gaming performance and is our largest diameter heat pipe design to date.\nInnovative airflow \u2013 The way air moves through the card is unique in itself\u2014it's another Alienware first that includes a dual axial fan design with positive rear pressure relief. This allows heat to escape from specially located vents, helping to aid with flow and thermal management.\nMaximum efficiency \u2013 These custom graphics cards have been designed to maximize space. They are short (measuring 267mm in length), cover 2.5x PCI slots (vs. 3) and offer a 8-pin PCI-Express power connectors.\n\n\n\nAlienware gaming monitors\nThe Alienware 25 Gaming Monitor (AW2521H) is a 24.5-inch monitor with FHD resolution, up to 360Hz refresh and 1ms gtg response time. It uses an IPS display panel and is G-Sync compatible. It includes the Nvidia Reflex Latency Analyzer system latency measurement tool. Alienware told HEXUS that the AW2521H will become available in the UK from 26th Nov starting at \u00a3599.\n\nThe new Alienware 27 Gaming Monitor (AW2721D) is a 27-inch monitor with QHD resolution, up to 240Hz refresh, and 1ms gtg response time. It uses an IPS Nano Colour curved screen. It boasts Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate certification and captivating visuals with VESA DisplayHDR 600. Alienware says it will become available in the UK on 26th Nov, at \u00a3699.\nLast but not least the Alienware 38 Gaming Monitor (AW3821DW) offers an expansive 37.5-inch, with WQHD+ resolution. Its fast IPS Nano Colour curved screen is certified for Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate and it boasts VESA DisplayHDR 600 too. It will be available in the UK on 26th November, starting at \u00a31,299.\n\nAlienware Area-51m gaming laptop with 360Hz panel\nThe last new Alienware product in this update is an updated gaming laptop with a 17-inch FHD 360Hz display panel. Inside you will find a 10th Gen Intel Core S-series processors, Nvidia GeForce RTX 20 series graphics, fast RAM and storage, and vapour chamber cooling. UK availability and pricing are to be confirmed but it is available in the US now starting at $2,720.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\nDell updates XPS and Alienware desktops with Alder Lake CPUs\n\n                    And you can spec up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090, or an AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n2\nCorsair Xenomorph PC system with AMD Ryzen 6000 APU spotted\n\n                    8C/16T 'Rembrandt' APU features an RDNA2 iGPU and is joined by DDR5-4800 memory. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n15\nFramework laptop modular marketplace goes live\n\n                    A handy place to pick and choose upgrades, replacement parts, and modules. \n                \n\n\n\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\nHP lists AiO PCs with \"AMD Ryzen 7000 Series\" CPUs\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 1 Comment\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

Follow AuthorsOct 05, 2020, 04:10pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.NVIDIA Co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang rarely disappoints his audience nor his investors. This week he once again delivered the goods at the GPU Technology Conference. Announcing a broad range of hardware and software innovations, Jensen made it clear that he intends to reshape computation, from GPUs to CPUs to NICs and switches. So, let's dive into Jensen\u2019s goody bag and see how he plans to shape the market and NVIDIA's future.\nFigure 1: Nvidia Co-founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, sans trademark leather jacketNVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA DPU Smart NIC\n\nNVIDIA led off with a new NIC from the Mellanox division. Setting the stage for a reimagining of the server, NVIDIA added multi-core Arm CPUs and AI acceleration to the staid Network Interface Card (NIC). Smart NICs have been around for a while, but have yet to reach broad-scale adoption outside a few hyperscale cloud providers. However, as networking becomes the new bottleneck for moving massive data sets (and the lynchpin for data center security), NVIDIA sees an opportunity to augment the NIC with far more processing power. This could potentially alter the data center landscape significantly. By offloading much of the work usually done by server CPUs, the Data Processing Unit (DPU) can create a new platform of high-performance processing, and leverage the GPU's AI capabilities into the networking market. If NVIDIA can gain traction here, this move could effectively capture some of the revenues currently going to CPU vendors, shifting that spend to more capable, presumably higher-margin Smart NICs. Said another way, NVIDIA is freeing up cycles on the server cores, which allows it to focus on the application that will process the data, instead of spending time unpacking TPC/IP headers and acting as a firewall.\nFigure 2: The new NVIDIA DPU will offload CPU cycles, freeing up more processing capacity for ... [+] applications.NVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA's roadmap will upgrade the NIC with more CPU and GPU intelligence, from a current performance of 70 SPECINT and 0.7 TOPS per card to 1000 SPECINT and 400 TOPS for 400 Gbps Ethernet/IB by 2023. To put that into perspective, a high-performance workstation with Intel Xeon E-2278G processor reaches some 56 SPECINT today, and 400 TOPS is in the ballpark of the new A100 GPU. For now, NVIDIA announced the Bluefield-2X, which adds an Ampere GPU to the NIC to handle workloads such as anomaly detection/response, real-time traffic analytics and dynamic security orchestration. The entry Bluefield-2 DPU features an 8-core A72 Core 64-bit CPU to accelerate security, networking and storage.\nFigure 3: The NVIDIA DPU Roadmap.

Jensen has a platform for that, too. NVIDIA offers six software stacks to support edge application development, hardware to deploy at the edge and edge data centers, over 20 partners to create solutions and the NVIDIA Fleet Management software to help service providers keep it all running. Edge AI software startups planning to take a chunk of the AI edge marketplace now have a roadmap and an idea of the scale of the challenge ahead if they want to compete in this space with NVIDIA.\u00a0\u00a0\nFigure 4: The Edge EGX platform consists of hardware, software, fleet management and a partner ... [+] ecosystem.NVIDIA\n\n\nOne of the timely enhancements to those AI software stacks is the federated learning NVIDIA is adding to its Clara platform. The idea here is bold, enabling physicians and scientists worldwide to quickly predict Covid-19 patients' outlook for oxygen levels 24 hours in advance (after intake x-ray and measurements). This AI-enabled system is up and running at 20 sites in 8 countries with measured benefits to patients.Figure 5: NVIDIA Clara's federated learning Covid-19 patient triage AI model.NVIDIA\nAnother edge enhancement is a new Jetson Nano 2GB robotics and AI starter kit, that runs all AI frameworks and models and only costs $59. Nano is another tool in Jensen's drawer to attract developers, which now number over 700,000 programmers worldwide. Unfortunately, I do not think the Nano comes with a cute Lego Jensen.Figure 6: NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2GBNVIDIA\nYet another NVIDIA-owned supercomputer: Cambridge-1\nNVIDIA already has two supercomputers located in its facilities in Silicon Valley, including the A100 powered Selene, the 7th fastest computer globally. When Jensen announced the deal to acquire Arm holdings from Softbank, he said he would build an AI Center of Excellence in Cambridge, generating a lot of social media and press speculation and skepticism about when, where and how. While not directly tied to the acquisition, the new Cambridge-1 supercomputer will undoubtedly put some lead in that pencil, providing UK scientists with a state-of-the-art platform for AI research and development. Cambridge-1 comprises 80 DGX A100 servers and should become the largest supercomputer in the UK by the end of the year.Figure 7: The Cambridge-1 supercomputerNVIDIA\nNew collaboration platforms\nLastly, Jenson announced two new software stacks designed to enable collaboration and development of graphics and AI applications. The first is the Open Beta release of Omniverse, which allows content creators to collaborate and simulate designs of intricate image and video projects.\u00a0Omniverse is being used now by companies as diverse as BMW, Volvo and Industrial Light and Magic.\nThe second collaboration offering is something many of us have wanted since work-from-home became the norm. When conducting video conferences, wouldn't it be nice if participants' gaze could appear as if looking at the camera instead of looking at a screen off to the side? Or how about real-time language translation, de-noising kitchen clatter or enhancing resolution? These features and more are now available on NVIDIA\u2019s new Maxine platform, supported on Google Cloud, Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Tencent Cloud and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\u00a0Figure 8: Maxine will significantly enhance your video conference experience. NVIDIA\nWhile Maxine probably will not add a lot to GPU sales, it will add to the GPU envy that many of us feel (I want one!).\nWrapping up\nJensen Huang's company continues to up its game, extending its technology vertically with optimized software platforms, and horizontally with the new DPU Smart NIC.\u00a0NVIDIA is truly a juggernaut, with best-in-class hardware and software, and an ecosystem. While this may be depressing news for startups hoping to take a slice of the AI pie, nobody can deny NVIDIA\u2019s impressive rate of innovation and progress.\nDisclosure:\u00a0My firm, Moor Insights & Strategy, like all research and analyst firms, provides or has provided research, analysis, advising, and/or consulting to many high-tech companies in the industry, including NVIDIA.

RTX 2080 Ti: And The Winner Is?ByAntony LeatherFollowShareSaveInnovationConsumer TechNvidia RTX 3070 Vs. RTX 2080 Ti: And The Winner Is?ByAntony Leather, Senior Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorOct 27, 2020, 09:00am EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.Nvidia's RTX 3070 Founders Edition will cost $499Emma Griffiths\nNvidia (NVDA) has finally allowed us tech reviewers to reveal the real performance of the RTX 3070 - its $499 mid-range Ampere-based graphics card. The big question we all want to know? Is Nvidia's claim that this $500 card can match or even better the RTX 2080 Ti in games - a card that currently retails for over $1500 - really true?\n\nNvidia's RTX 3070 retails for $499 and is smaller and less power hungry than the RTX 3080 (above)Antony Leather\nSee my review of the RTX 3080 for more technical information on Nvidia's new graphics cards.\n\n\n\n\nThe Nvidia RTX 3070 is significantly more powerful than the RTX 2070Nvidia\n\nTest system and benchmarksMy graphics test systemAntony Leather\n\n\nI used Nvidia's 456.96 driver for the testing along with a fully up-to-date version of Windows 10. The benchmarks now include results for 1080p performance versus the RTX 2080 Ti, as the RTX 3070's price will likely mean owners of high-refresh rate monitors who game at 1080p might consider it, as well as this looking to future-proof their system. Similarly, as the RTX 3070 proved more than capable of handling games at 4K, I've compared it against several other cards both at 4K and 1440p.\n\nThe test system used an MSI MEG Z490 Ace, Intel Core i9-10900K, 16GB 3466MHz Corsair memory and an Intel 760p SSD along with a custom watercooling system.\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\nFar Cry New Dawn\nA comparatively easy title to tame on gaming PCs, Far Cry New Dawn saw the RTX 2080 Ti ahead but only by a few frames at 1080p and 1440p and a little more at 4K, meaning the RTX 3070 is absolutely the card you should be buying given it's price and will devastate new and second hand prices of Nvidia's old flagship.\nWolfenstein: Youngblood\nIt was a similar story in Wolfenstein: Youngblood, with the RTX 3070 posting a slightly higher average frame rate, but was a couple of frames down on the minimum 99th percentile at 1080p. At 1440p, the two were within the margin of error I'd expect to see and at 4K, the RTX 3070 edged out a small lead.\n\nBorderlands 3\nBorderlands is slightly tougher than Wolfenstein and Far Cry, but once again the two cards are even at 1080p and within spitting distance at 1440p and 4K too.\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\nWithout any ray tracing or DLSS features, the investigation showed Shadow of the Tomb Raider to prefer the RTX 2080 Ti at 1080p and 1440p, with clear leads for the older card. Even with DLSS and ray tracing enabled at 4K the RTX 2080 Ti still had a commanding lead. Still a clear win overall for the RTX 3070, though, given it costs a third of the price.\nMetro Exodus\nYet another equal fight with no clear winner, both cards were practically indistinguishable until we reached 4K where the RTX 2080 Ti drew slightly ahead. The RTX 3070, though, and Ampere and the 3000-series a clear generational leap over its predecessor here and in general though.\nLoad system power consumption\nDespite matching the previous flagship in performance - a card that saw my test system draw around 403W under load, the RTX 3070 managed the same performance at just 343W. This makes it the ideal partner for small form factor systems too, where undervolting might yield far lower power draw and temperatures than the RTX 2080 Ti.\nConclusion\nThe RTX 3070 is an easy recommendation for anyone with around $500 to spend on a graphics card for several reasons. It offers the same performance as the RTX 2080 Ti, at least in my benchmarks, as the RTX 2080 Ti, which while a two year-old card is still a mighty piece of silicon. However, the latter costs three times as much, which really highlights the value proposition of the RTX 3070, which holds true both with RTX features on and off.Nvidia's RTX 3070Antony Leather\nSecondly, with little to no competition from AMD - yet - the RTX 3070's only other issue might have been the RTX 2080 Super, but it was significantly slower and still costs a lot more. The RTX 3070 easily kept itself cool, too, peaking at 71\u00b0C and was supremely quiet in testing as well.\nAs for resolutions, the RTX 3070 is primarily a 1440p card, where it managed at least 75fps on the average frame rate in all the games tested here - usually a lot more. However, it's also more than capable of handling 4K and never dipped below a minimum 99th percentile of 35fps and average of 50fps. In this sense, whether you're a casual 4K gamer or 1080p high-refresh rate obsessed, the RTX 3070 seems to have pretty much every base covered for a reasonable price tag, plus it's smaller and less power hungry than the RTX 3080 too. Want RTX 2080 Ti performance for less than $500? The RTX 3070 is for you.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

vulnerabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA patches high severity GeForce Experience vulnerabilities\n\n\n                            By Sergiu Gatlan\n\n\n\n\nOctober 22, 2020\n07:01 PM\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA released\u00a0a security update for the Windows NVIDIA GeForce Experience (GFE) app to address vulnerabilities\u00a0that could enable attackers to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, gain access to sensitive info, or trigger a denial of service (DoS) state on systems running unpatched\u00a0software.\nNVIDIA GFE\u00a0is a companion utility for\u00a0GeForce GTX graphics cards\u00a0that \"keeps your drivers up to date, automatically optimizes your game settings, and gives you the easiest way to share your greatest gaming moments with friends\"\u00a0according to NVIDIA,\nWhile these flaws require attackers to have local user access and cannot be exploited remotely, they can still be abused using malicious tools deployed on systems running vulnerable NVIDIA GFE\u00a0versions.\nAdditionally, attacks that would exploit these bugs are of low complexity according to NVIDIA, while also requiring low privileges, and need no user interaction.\nUncontrolled search path bug leads to code execution\nCVE\u20112020\u20115977, the bug with the highest severity rating patched today by NVIDIA, can lead to privilege escalation and code execution following successful exploitation.\nIt also allows attackers to\u00a0render Windows computers running unpatched NVIDIA GFE unusable by triggering a denial of service state.\nThe\u00a0CVE\u20112020\u20115977 vulnerability was reported by Decathlon's Xavier DANEST and it consists of an uncontrolled search path used when loading an NVIDIA Web Helper NodeJS Web Server\u00a0node module.\nThe other high severity bug,\u00a0CVE\u20112020\u20115990, exists in the\u00a0ShadowPlay component and it was reported by\u00a0Hashim Jawad of ACTIVELabs.\nThe three\u00a0vulnerabilities fixed\u00a0in the\u00a0October 2020 security update are\u00a0detailed below, together with full descriptions and the CVSS V3 base score\u00a0assigned by NVIDIA.\nCVE IDs\nDescription\nBase Score\nCVE\u20112020\u20115977\nNVIDIA GeForce Experience contains a vulnerability in NVIDIA Web Helper NodeJS Web Server in which an uncontrolled search path is used to load a node module, which may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, and information disclosure.\n8.2\nCVE\u20112020\u20115990\nNVIDIA GeForce Experience contains a vulnerability in the ShadowPlay component which may lead to local privilege escalation, code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.\n7.3\nCVE\u20112020\u20115978\nNVIDIA GeForce Experience contains a vulnerability in its services in which a folder is created by nvcontainer.exe under normal user login with LOCAL_SYSTEM privileges which may lead to a denial of service or escalation of privileges.\n3.2\nNVIDIA says\u00a0that the \"risk assessment is based on an average of risk across a diverse set of installed systems and may not represent the true risk of your local

impact only computers running\u00a0Windows and\u00a0 NVIDIA GeForce Experience\u00a0versions before 3.20.5.70, the version that comes with fixes for the three bugs.\nTo apply the\u00a0security update, you have to download the latest software version (i.e., 3.20.5.70) from the\u00a0GeForce Experience Downloads\u00a0page\u00a0or to\u00a0launch the GFE client to automatically apply it via the inbuilt update mechanism.\nIn July, NVIDIA fixed another security flaw in all\u00a0GeForce Experience versions prior to 3.20.4 which could lead to\u00a0code execution, denial of service, or escalation of privileges.\nLast month, the company also addressed multiple high severity security issues in the Windows GPU display driver and the\u00a0Virtual GPU Manager software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 MITRE

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I write about disruptive companies, technologies and usage models.Follow AuthorOct 08, 2020, 05:11pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.This week, I tuned into NVIDIA\u2019s annual GPU Technology Conference, or GTC, albeit virtually due to the pandemic. The processor powerhouse has a long history of category-defining innovation, dating back to its launch of the first 3D GPU in 1999. This week\u2019s keynote was chock full of news and innovation, including another all-new processor category designed to muscle NVIDIA into the datacenter market. Let\u2019s take a look at the new processor and several other announcements from GTC 2020.\n\nLook out, data center market\n\nOne of the most significant announcements was the unveiling of the DPU (data processing unit)\u2014a whole new category of processors designed to offload networking, security, and storage tasks from CPUs in the data center. Essentially, you can think of these DPUs as smart NICs. Under the new family moniker BlueField, NVIDIA unveiled the first two of these accelerators: the BlueField-2 and the BlueField-2X.\n\nNVIDIA Bluefield-2 DPUNVIDIA\nBlueField-2 brings together an array of fully programmable Arm cores, a ConnectX-6 Dx network adapter (derived from NVIDIA\u2019s acquisition of Mellanox) and an NVME-optimized Controller to deliver up to 200 GB/s performance for both traditional and modern workloads. The DPU includes hardware offloads for workloads such as software-defined storage, zero-trust security, networking and management. By offloading these functions from the CPU, NVIDIA says a single BlueField-2 can perform the same services that can require as many as 125 CPU cores. Just think about what those freed-up CPU cores could accomplish.\u00a0\n\n\nThis claim isn\u2019t \u201ccrazy-talk.\u201d I look at what the teams is doing at AWS with \u201cNitro\u201d and offload and virtualization is very much a reality at the cloud giant. \u00a0NVIDIA can offer this capability to every cloud giant and enterprise OEM who does not have an in-house silicon team.NVIDIA Bluefield-2XNVIDIA\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nThe second DPU, BlueField-2X, includes the same key attributes as BlueField-2 but bolsters them with AI via an NVIDIA Ampere GPU. Leveraging Ampere\u2019s 3rd gen Tensor Cores, BlueField-2X can perform real-time, AI-driven security analytics functions detailed in the graphic above.\n\nComplimenting the BlueField DPUs is the DOCA SDK, shorthand for \u201cdata-center-infrastructure-on-a-chip architecture.\u201d Arguably the most impactful announcement, this open platform enables developers to design cloud-native, software-defined, infrastructure services accelerated by the new DPUs. You can think of it as analogous to the programming tack NVIDIA took with CUDA and GPU-accelerated applications. Additionally, DOCA integrates NVIDIA NGC, a containerized software environment that NVIDIA says will allow 3rd party developers to use DPU-accelerated services to build, certify and deploy their apps to customers.\n\n\nStraight out of the gate, NVIDIA announced numerous global server manufacturers who have plans to employ NVIDIA DPUs into their offerings as soon as 2021. These include ASUS, Atos, Dell, Fujitsu, Gigabyte, H3C, Inspur, Lenovo, Quanta/QCT and Supermicro. BlueField-2 is currently sampling, while BlueField-2X is projected for availability next year.\nGraphics-related news\nIn the realm of graphics, NVIDIA\u2019s long-time bread and butter, the company announced NVIDIA Maxine, a cloud-AI video streaming platform. Maxine is essentially a toolkit designed to give service providers a host of audio, video and conversational AI features to enhance video communication. These features include background noise removal, facial alignment, real-time translation, context-aware closed captions and more. But perhaps the most significant attribute is its employment of GANs (generative adversarial network) to enable high-resolution video conferencing, even over low bandwidth connections.\nAnyone who\u2019s tried to make a video call on a less-than-optimal bandwidth knows how frustrating it is to have their call break up and freeze mid-conversation. It\u2019s an all too familiar story in this era of increased remote work. Maxine replaces video codecs (the traditional method of video compression and decompression) with GANs, an approach which NVIDIA says allows for placing calls at one-tenth of the network bandwidth traditionally necessary for smooth transmission. Video calls may never be the same\u2014I\u2019ll be the first in line to try it.\nIn other graphics-related news, NVIDIA announced the open beta deployment of its Omniverse platform, which it calls \u201cthe world\u2019s first NVIDIA RTX-based 3D simulation and collaboration platform.\u201d To paint a picture, Omniverse is a bit like the Star Trek holodeck\u2014a photorealistic, real-time simulation that melds the physical and virtual worlds. Though such technology has wide-reaching implications and potential, NVIDIA envisions it as a tool to bring remote teams together to work collaboratively on projects in areas such as design, engineering and animation.\nOmniverse is made possible by Pixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description format, the gold standard for universal interchange between 3D applications. Meanwhile, NVIDIA provides the technological muscle for \u201creal-time photorealistic rendering, physics, materials and interactive workflows between industry-leading 3D software products.\u201d I believe Omniverse has potential, and I\u2019m excited to hear more about it as it moves through beta.\nTargeting tomorrow\u2019s AI developers \nNVIDIA also unveiled an entry-level developer kit for its Jetson Ai at the Edge open platform. The Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit seeks to encourage the next generation of AI and robotics enthusiasts through various hands-on projects, online trainings and AI-certification programs. Additionally, users will have access to the Jetson developer community\u2019s wealth of resources, including open-source projects and instructional materials.\nThough it targets students, hobbyists, and educators, Nano isn\u2019t just kid stuff\u2014it contains the same NVIDIA CUDA-X accelerated computing stack that the company leverages in advanced applications such as self-driving cars, healthcare, IoT, smart cities and more. At the incredible price of $59, Jetson Nano looks to be a great gateway into the Jetson AI at the Edge ecosystem. There\u2019s plenty of room on the Jetson platform to move upwards for those who advance beyond tinkering with entry-level AI devices\u2014all the way up to fully autonomous machines. NVIDIA is democratizing IoT AI for everybody.\nAccelerating healthcare research\nThe last area of news I\u2019ll touch on is healthcare\u2014of particular importance in this current global moment. NVIDIA lifted the curtain on a new supercomputer it calls \u201cCambridge-1,\u201d which will be the most powerful system in the UK when it goes online (expected at the end of this year). Pharmaceutical companies and medical researchers will be able to leverage Cambridge-1\u2019s 400 petaflops of AI performance and eight petaflops of Linpack performance for urgent medical research (yes, that includes Covid-19). Researchers from GSK, AstraZeneca, Guy\u2019s and St. Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, King\u2019s College London and Oxford Nanopore Technologies have announced they will leverage the system (and I would expect more to come). Upon completion, the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD system will rank 29th on the TOP500 list of the most powerful supercomputers, and in the top three most energy-efficient systems on the Green500.\nNVIDIA also announced a partnership with GSK, a global healthcare company, and its London-based lab for AI-based medicine and vaccine discovery. By marrying GSK\u2019s wealth of genetic and genomic data with advanced computing platforms and AI techniques, the lab hopes to unlock biomedical data's potential, at scale, for \u201ctransformational\u201d medicines and vaccines. NVIDIA has compute power and expertise that could prove indispensable to these efforts. GSK\u2019s AI lab will employ NVIDIA\u2019s DGX A100 Systems (and NVIDIA data scientists) and will have access to the Cambridge-1 supercomputer, as mentioned above. With the whole world laser-focused on the search for the elusive Covid-19 vaccine, this partnership comes as welcome news.\nMy takeaway here is that NVIDIA is delivering on its promise it made with the Arm acquisition and working with the right partners to extend its medical research.\nWrapping up\nFrom the DPU to the DOCA SDK, NVIDIA\u2019s networking and offload play for the datacenter looks more promising from here. If there\u2019s one thing we know about NVIDIA, it\u2019s that it does not pull its punches\u2014competitors beware. I believe the novel approach of offloading storage, security, and networking functions onto a high-powered Smart NIC will free up crucial CPU space and serve NVIDIA well, especially if its claims of a 10x performance improvement bear out. DOCA is critical and given the company\u2019s CUDA-success, it knows this, too.\nBeyond the datacenter news, it is encouraging to see NVIDIA apply its compute power to relevant, timely causes such as medical research and video conferencing and democratize IoT AI. I\u2019m happy with what I heard from NVIDIA at GTC 2020\u2014here\u2019s to hoping we\u2019ll be able to attend the next one in person.\n\nNote: Moor Insights & Strategy writers and editors may have contributed to this article.\u00a0\nDisclosure: Moor Insights & Strategy, like all research and analyst firms, provides or has provided paid research, analysis, advising, or consulting to many high-tech companies in the industry, including 8x8, Advanced Micro Devices, Amazon, Applied Micro, ARM, Aruba Networks, AT&T, AWS, A-10 Strategies,\u00a0Bitfusion, Blaize, Calix, Cisco Systems, Clear Software, Cloudera,\u00a0Clumio, Cognitive Systems, CompuCom, Dell, Dell EMC, Dell Technologies, Diablo Technologies, Digital Optics,\u00a0Dreamchain, Echelon, Ericsson, Extreme Networks, Flex, Foxconn, Frame, Fujitsu, Gen Z Consortium, Glue Networks, GlobalFoundries, Google (Nest-Revolve), Google Cloud, HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Honeywell, Huawei Technologies, IBM, Ion VR,\u00a0Inseego, Intel, Interdigital, Jabil Circuit, Konica Minolta, Lattice Semiconductor, Lenovo, Linux Foundation,\u00a0MapBox,\u00a0Mavenir, Marseille Inc, Mayfair Equity, Meraki (Cisco),\u00a0Mesophere, Microsoft, Mojo Networks, National Instruments, NetApp, Nightwatch, NOKIA (Alcatel-Lucent), Nortek,\u00a0Novumind, NVIDIA, ON Semiconductor, ONUG, OpenStack Foundation, Oracle, Poly, Panasas,\u00a0Peraso, Pexip, Pixelworks, Plume Design,\u00a0Portworx, Pure Storage, Qualcomm, Rackspace, Rambus,\u00a0Rayvolt\u00a0E-Bikes, Red Hat,\u00a0Residio, Samsung Electronics, SAP, SAS, Scale Computing, Schneider Electric, Silver Peak, SONY,\u00a0Springpath, Spirent, Splunk, Sprint, Stratus Technologies, Symantec, Synaptics, Syniverse, Synopsys, Tanium, TE Connectivity,\u00a0TensTorrent,\u00a0Tobii\u00a0Technology, Twitter, Unity Technologies, UiPath, Verizon Communications,\u00a0Vidyo, VMware, Wave Computing,\u00a0Wellsmith, Xilinx, Zebra,\u00a0Zededa, and Zoho which may be cited in this article.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

While Nvidia\u2019s flagship card was designed to push 4K, the $499 RTX 3070 is $200 less expensive and still promises big performance gains over the previous-generation RTX 2080 and even the RTX 2080 Ti. Like all of Nvidia\u2019s RTX cards before it, the RTX 3070 can also take advantage of ray tracing and Nvidia\u2019s AI-powered DLSS technology to boost frame rates and still maintain great image quality.This combination of performance and price puts the RTX 3070 in the ideal sweet spot for 1440p gaming. The vast majority of PC gamers are still using 1080p displays, and the RTX 3070 offers up an upgrade path to 1440p without the steep cost of an RTX 3080 and the extra power draw.I\u2019ve spent the past week testing out the RTX 3070 at both 1440p and 4K ahead of its October 29th debut, and it\u2019s fair to say this card will give you a lot of headroom for games coming in 2021 and beyond so long as you\u2019re playing at 1440p or below. If you\u2019re considering the move to 1440p, the RTX 3070 is the more budget-friendly option if you want to futureproof along the way.8Verge ScoreNvidia RTX 3070$0The GoodVery quiet and coolGreat for 1440p gamingDLSS boosts frameratesThe Bad650W power supply requirement and extra power drawNot enough headroom for 4K8GB of memoryHow we rate and review productsHardwareNvidia made some big changes to the cooling on the Founder\u2019s Edition RTX 3080, but it\u2019s maintained a traditional dual-fan setup with the RTX 3070. The dual-axial fans work in tandem to keep the card cool, with the right fan pushing air all the way through the card\u2019s shroud to the opposite side, while the left directly cools the GPU cores with air that can exhaust out the rear of your chassis.During my testing, I rarely heard the fans spin up, even with the card hitting temperatures of 75 degrees Celsius. While the RTX 3070 doesn\u2019t benefit from the same push-pull system found on the RTX 3080, it does pick up some of the other hardware improvements found on the flagship.The hardware design on the RTX 3070 is very similar, allowing Nvidia to use a dense PCB that\u2019s a lot smaller to improve airflow throughout the card. And just like the RTX 3080, Nvidia is using its new 12-pin single power connector, as opposed to the separate 6- and 8-pin or twin 8-pin connectors on prior cards.Nvidia\u2019s new RTX 3070 graphics card.\ufeff Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeThe rear ports of the RTX 3070. Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeNvidia has included its own adapter inside the box. Since the RTX 3070 only needs a single 8-pin power connector, it makes the adapter a little less wieldy than the one found on the RTX 3080. Still, I would highly recommend picking up a direct 12-pin connector from your PSU manufacturer instead of using the ugly adapter.The RTX 3070 also includes a single HDMI 2.1 port and three DisplayPort 1.4a ports. Much like the RTX 3080, Nvidia has dropped the USB-C VirtualLink port found on the RTX 2080, which never saw any real adoption for VR. While the RTX 3080 has pure white LEDs around the fan and to light up the GeForce RTX branding, the RTX 3070 ditches this for a simple look without any lighting.Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3000 series cards have introduced a bump in power requirements, and the RTX 3070 pulls up to 220 watts by itself. That\u2019s a 19 percent jump from the previous RTX 2070 but still slightly less than the RTX 2080. Nvidia is recommending a 650W power supply for the RTX 3070, compared to the 550W recommendation for the RTX 2070.1440p testingI\u2019ve been testing the RTX 3070 on a newly built machine using Intel\u2019s latest Core i9-10900K inside. I previously tested the RTX 3080 on an older Core i7-7700K, so I\u2019ve gone back and tested Nvidia\u2019s flagship on this new system to provide a comparison between the RTX 2080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3080. For 1440p tests, I hooked up the RTX 3070 to a 27-inch Asus ROG Swift PG279Q monitor. This monitor supports refresh rates up to 165Hz plus G-Sync, so it\u2019s a great match for the RTX 3070\u2019s power. I\u2019ve also been testing 4K performance, which you can find below.Test machine for 1440p and 4K:Processor: Intel Core i9-10900K 3.7GHz 10-CoreCPU Cooler: Corsair H150i PRO RGBMotherboard: Asus ROG STRIX Z490-E GAMINGRAM: Corsair Vengeance Pro 32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR4-3200Storage: Samsung 970 Evo Plus 2TB M.2 SSDCase: Corsair Crystal 570XPSU: Corsair 850W RMx Series RM850xLike my RTX 3080 testing, I\u2019ve been playing a variety of AAA games to understand what the RTX 3070 is capable of. I\u2019ve also performed average frame rate testing and used built-in benchmarks across a variety of games, including Fortnite, Control, Death Stranding, Metro Exodus, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Microsoft Flight Simulator. All games were tested at max or ultra settings, and nearly every title exceeded the 100fps average mark at 1440p.Fortnite came close to hitting my monitor\u2019s max refresh rate with maxed-out settings, averaging 138fps. Call of Duty: Warzone also came close, averaging 130fps. Normally, I\u2019d adjust graphical settings way down to hit these types of frame rates, but the RTX 3070 was able to handle both games with ease. As you can see in the benchmark chart below, you won\u2019t often need an RTX 3080 to max out today\u2019s games with a 1440p monitor.

Nvidia\u2019s DLSS technology uses neural networks and AI supercomputers to analyze games and sharpen or clean up images at lower resolutions. DLSS allows a game to render at a lower resolution and use Nvidia\u2019s image reconstruction technique to upscale the image and make it look as good as native 4K or better.Most games that implement DLSS allow you to pick between performance or quality modes, and in Fortnite, I tested both. I was able to get a 215fps average with the performance DLSS mode enabled, and a 172fps average when I favored quality. It\u2019s difficult to notice the impact on image quality in the performance mode, and the quality mode looks the same if not better. I\u2019m still surprised at how well DLSS works.Even without DLSS, demanding titles like Control still hit 95fps with maxed-out settings, and Metro Exodus managed to hit 30fps with the highest-level settings enabled. The RTX 3080 felt like a very comfortable option for 1440p and may have more staying power, but the RTX 3070 is so close behind that you could skip it and save $200 at this resolution.RTX 3070 vs. RTX 3080 vs. RTX 3090. Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge4K testingWhile I\u2019m happy with the 1440p performance of the RTX 3070, its 4K performance isn\u2019t nearly as impressive. I\u2019ve been testing the RTX 3070 with Acer\u2019s 27-inch Nitro XV273K, a 4K monitor that offers up to 144Hz refresh rates, G-Sync, and even HDR support. It\u2019s more of a 50 / 50 split on how many games hit 60fps or more on the RTX 3070 with maxed-out settings at 4K. Shadow of the Tomb Raider didn\u2019t quite make it, nor does Control, which regularly drops below 30fps during gameplay even without ray tracing. Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone do well to maintain above a 60fps average, but there\u2019s not enough headroom in most modern games to make this a capable 4K card without compromise. You\u2019ll need to drop visual quality to maintain higher frame rates at 4K, which was the story of the RTX 2080 as well. Only this time, you\u2019ll pay $200 less to get better performance.DLSS certainly helps here, though. While Control is unplayable at 12fps with ray tracing enabled at 4K, if you use the DLSS quality mode alone the frame rate jumps to a reasonable 83fps. Likewise, I managed to get a 139fps average in Fortnite with the DLSS performance mode enabled.RTX 3070 review (4K)BenchmarkRTX 2080 Founders EditionRTX 3070 Founders EditionRTX 3080 Founders EditionMicrosoft Flight Simulator19fps23fps36fpsShadow of the Tomb Raider45fps54fps76fpsShadow of the Tomb Raider (DLSS)61fps69fps93fpsCoD: Warzone62fps74fps93fpsCoD: Warzone (RT)58fps70fps84fpsFortnite52fps73fps93fpsFortnite (DLSS quality)79fps105fps133fpsFortnite (DLSS perf)107fps139fps162fpsGears 546fps57fps76fpsCS:GO203fps210fps267fpsDeath Stranding64fps72fps101fpsDeath Stranding (DLSS quality)89fps104fps135fpsDeath Stranding (DLSS perf)120fps158fps164fpsControl41fps48fps68fpsControl (DLSS quality + RT)49fps57fps78fpsControl (RT)13fps12fps49fpsControl (DLSS quality)60fps83fps112fpsMetro Exodus15fps16fps34fpsMetro Exodus (RT)10fps9fps19fpsMetro Exodus (DLSS+RT)29fps37fps48fpsDLSS alone means the RTX 3070 can stretch to be a 4K, 60fps card in most of today\u2019s games, even if it might not be enough tomorrow. As Metro Exodus and Microsoft Flight Simulator show, there are already games where this brand-new card can\u2019t hit 30fps without lowering graphical fidelity.Speaking of futureproofing, the RTX 3070 only has 8GB of video memory, lower than the 10GB of memory that was already slightly worrisome on the RTX 3080. 4K games currently average between 4GB and 6GB, and some titles are already demanding that much at 1440p. While 8GB should be enough for 1440p, I would still have liked to have seen at least 10GB on the RTX 3070 and 12GB on the RTX 3080. There\u2019s room for Nvidia to launch additional 3080 and 3070 cards with more memory on board, probably in a future Super branded edition.I should also note here that I had two back-to-back driver crashes while using the RTX 3070 in Call of Duty: Warzone. The RTX 3080 had some early driver issues with certain games that were later fixed, so this could have simply been some quirks in the review drivers. I haven\u2019t been able to replicate the issues, though.The RTX 3070 design includes a 12-pin connector. Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeThe RTX 3070 measures up against Nvidia\u2019s other GPUs. Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeNvidia\u2019s big performance promises for the RTX 3000 Series of cards are holding up. I\u2019m surprised at how small, powerful, and quiet the RTX 3070 is. While the RTX 3080 ushers in a 4K gaming era for those with the budget to really go all out, the RTX 3070 offers a slightly more affordable option for moving from 1080p to 1440p.The RTX 3070 is the 1440p sweet spot right now. With more games supporting DLSS, and even ray tracing, I think it\u2019s going to be a card that will be great at 1440p for years to come. I wouldn\u2019t recommend an RTX 3070 for 4K gaming, though. If you\u2019re willing to spend extra for 4K, then the RTX 3080 is a far more capable option.The biggest problem with the RTX 3070 will be similar to the RTX 3080: availability. Nvidia promised that it had \u201cgreat yields\u201d for the 3080, and it was \u201cmaking them as fast as we can.\u201d Unfortunately, the launch was messy, with demand massively outstripping supply. I expect the same will happen with the RTX 3070, even with the delay to its launch to build up stocks.If you\u2019re upgrading from a GTX 1070 or even a GTX 1080, particularly if you\u2019re moving from 1080p to 1440p, the RTX 3070 feels ideal to me. I think this card, and whatever other lower-priced GPUs Nvidia has planned, will help usher in a move toward 1440p for a lot of people wanting to upgrade their PCs. If you can get your hands on one, the RTX 3070 will make the leap to 1440p just that little bit more affordable.Photography by Tom Warren / The VergeCorrection: This review originally stated that the RTX 3070 required a 750W power supply. It requires a 650W power supply.

Looking at the RTX 3070 page on Nvidia's website you'll notice a small detail has been added under the Notify Me button, the date that the new card will be available. Previously this wasn't mentioned directly on the site, but Nvidia had informed us the availability date for the RTX 3070 would be October 15.Given the performance we've seen from the Nvidia RTX 3080 and the RTX 3090, we're pretty confident that the RTX 3070 is going to be impressive. So we think it's likely to be worth the wait.\u00a0Nvidia hasn't had a lot of luck with its first two launches. First there's the ongoing problems actually getting a card, which has seen demand for the new cards far outstripping the initial stock. Something that hasn't been helped by the resellers buying cards and then turning straight to eBay to try and make a tidy profit.This was followed up by reports of new RTX 3080 cards crashing. There was speculation that this was down to the quality of the capacitors used, with a fair amount of mud slinging from pundits and manufacturers. The end result though was that Nvidia released a new driver, which seems to have calmed things (and clock speeds) down somewhat.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: the top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest graphics card: your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: get into the game ahead of the restNvidia needs a smoother launch for the RTX 3070, and surely this delay will help. We're hopeful Nvidia pushing the date back two weeks is because it wants to get enough stock in the channel before making it publicly available. And we predict the demand for the more expensive cards will be nothing compared to what we'll see for this more affordable $499 (\u00a3469) card.\u00a0There's another reason that the delay could work in Nvidia's favour, though. AMD is set to announce its Radeon RX 6000-series graphics cards on October 28. Is this Nvidia's way of muddying the waters and stealing some of the Radeon thunder?\u00a0The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Rumour has it AMD's Big Navi will offer performance somewhere between the RTX 3070 and RTX 3080, but if the Nvidia card isn't out at the time it makes its announcement, that could present some confusing message for AMD. We'll have to see how AMD handles the announcement.\n\n\nAlan DexterSocial Links NavigationAlan has been writing about PC tech since before 3D graphics cards existed, and still vividly recalls having to fight with MS-DOS just to get games to load. He fondly remembers the killer combo of a Matrox Millenium and 3dfx Voodoo, and seeing Lara Croft in 3D for the first time. He's very glad hardware has advanced as much as it has though, and is particularly happy when putting the latest M.2 NVMe SSDs, AMD processors, and laptops through their paces. He has a long-lasting Magic: The Gathering obsession but limits this to MTG Arena these days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest in Graphics Cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis MSI Afterburner file unlocks 36 Gbps RTX 50-series memory overclocks for, y'know, the few people that actually own a card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI RTX 5090 Suprim SOC review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n92% of Nvidia users turn on DLSS... if they've been lucky enough to bag an RTX 50-series card at launch AND have the Nvidia App installed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsus appears to have quietly changed the design of its Q-Release PCIe slot after claims of potential GPU pin damage \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree lucky folks in India can win the dubious honour of buying an RTX 5080 GPU at Nvidia MSRP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup allegedly trying to smuggle Nvidia Blackwell chips stare down bail set at over $1 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest in News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZenless Zone Zero developer finally embraces its divine domain as the god of jiggle physics, goes mad, adds them to cat balls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpace Marine 2 CEO puts the boot into the Saints Row team's twitching corpse from his private jet: 'Who's going to fund them for the next game after that disaster?'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSennheiser says it 'will not become a gaming brand' but its new HD 550 are a good excuse to use audiophile headphones for gaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe future of robots is looking ever more meaty as MIT researchers grow first bidirectional muscle tissue machine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was 'super popular to hate Palworld' after launch, says community manager: 'A lot of companies might crumble under the threats, under the pressure' \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'It was a very depressing day': Palworld community manager reveals studio's reaction to Nintendo lawsuit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about graphics cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis MSI Afterburner file unlocks 36 Gbps RTX 50-series memory overclocks for, y'know, the few people that actually own a card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI RTX 5090 Suprim SOC review\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZenless Zone Zero developer finally embraces its divine domain as the god of jiggle physics, goes mad, adds them to cat balls\n\n\n\nSee more latest\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZenless Zone Zero developer finally embraces its divine domain as the god of jiggle physics, goes mad, adds them to cat balls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpace Marine 2 CEO puts the boot into the Saints Row team's twitching corpse from his private jet: 'Who's going to fund them for the next game after that disaster?'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSennheiser says it 'will not become a gaming brand' but its new HD 550 are a good excuse to use audiophile headphones for gaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe future of robots is looking ever more meaty as MIT researchers grow first bidirectional muscle tissue machine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday's Wordle answer for Tuesday, March 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArk 2 is still on: The next Ark expansion 'leads into the events of Ark 2,' says Studio Wildcard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was 'super popular to hate Palworld' after launch, says community manager: 'A lot of companies might crumble under the threats, under the pressure' \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'It was a very depressing day': Palworld community manager reveals studio's reaction to Nintendo lawsuit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA gorgeous ground-up remake of Counter-Strike 1.6 is on its way to Steam, and one of the game's original creators says 'it really gives me old vibes'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a new Portal game and it costs $12,500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE BUYING GUIDESLATEST GAME REVIEWS1Best Steam Deck accessories in Australia for 2025: Our favorite docks, powerbanks and gamepads2Best graphics card for laptops in 2025: the mobile GPUs I'd want in my next gaming laptop3Best mini PCs in 2025: The compact computers I love the most 4Best 14-inch gaming laptop in 2025: The top compact gaming laptops I've held in these hands5Best Mini-ITX motherboards in 2025: My pick from all the mini mobo marvels I've tested 1Lenovo Legion Go S (Windows) review2Cherry Xtrfy K4V2 TKL review3MSI MAG CoreLiquid A15 360 review4MSI RTX 5090 Suprim SOC review5Fragpunk review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia Quadro is dead, long live Nvidia Quadro. Following in the footsteps of the Nvidia A100 that replaces the previous generation Tesla V100, and the Nvidia RTX 3090, which we called the \"heir to the Titan throne\" in our review, Nvidia today announced two new graphics cards that have the power of the workstation-focused Quadro line, but not the branding. These are the Nvidia RTX A6000 and Nvidia RTX A40, and they each pack Ampere architecture with 10,572 CUDA cores and 48GB of VRAM.\n\nWe're not sure why Nvidia's dropping the Quadro branding, but much like the A100 and RTX 3090, it might be that the company's trying to centralize all of its new cards under a simpler \"RTX + number\" format. We don't know too much about these cards yet, from release date to specs to price. What we do know is that the cards will use 48GB GDDR6 VRAM, which is twice as much as the RTX 3090 but without the 'X' factor.It appears these cards will basically be RTX 3090s with 16Gb memory modules and Quadro features enabled. That means improved performance in many professional applications, which is an area the Titan line used to straddle and an area where the RTX 3090 falls short.It appears the choice of memory comes down to ECC (error correcting code) support, which is available on GDDR6 modules but perhaps not GDDR6X. Or it could be that GDDR6X 16Gb modules aren't yet ready for deployment, or that for stability purposes Nvidia prefers the slower speeds of GDDR6. Whatever the case, the A40 specs show 696 GBps of bandwidth (the A6000 doesn't explicitly state bandwidth but does say GDDR6); the RTX 3090 by comparison uses GDDR6X to deliver 936 GBps.(Image credit: Nvidia)The two cards will also have roughly the same specs, with the key difference being that the A6000 is intended for personal use while the A40 will have connectivity features that make it perfect for data centers. Nvidia also revealed that these cards will only use DisplayPort for video output and will connect to your computer through PCIe Gen 4. And just in case you were worrying about cards that are more powerful than the 3090 not being able to support VR, yes, they will.These specs are probably going to be overkill for most gamers, so like the previous-gen Quadro line, these cards will instead be positioned toward professional design, research and business markets. To this end, they'll also have features like easy virtualization, which will let you split a single workstation into several virtual instances that can be accessed remotely. They'll also be compatible with NVLink, allowing you to connect multiple copies of each card to take on memory-intensive workloads.The Quadro RTX 8000, which was the last high-end workstation GPU that Nvidia released, cost $5,800 at launch (and will still run you about $5300 to buy now), so don't expect either the A6000 or the A40 to come cheap. You can sign up to be notified of availability for both of these cards on Nvidia's website. Nvidia says the cards should begin shipping in December.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nrtx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (5)\n\n\n\nMichelle EhrhardtSocial Links NavigationMichelle Ehrhardt is an editor at Tom's Hardware.

For the 3090, there were pros and cons to dropping the Titan branding. Reviewers are more likely to include it on all their testing. You could argue that the fact that it isn't under Titan branding means it is less likely to appeal to those who just buy it to show off. On the other hand, you could argue that the fact that it uses a new (alright, the GTX 590 doesn't count :P) xx90 naming scheme makes it stand out more. TLDR there were benefits.

In the product design-focused rendering software Luxion KeyShot the performance increase could be 255% or even more, says Nvidia.\nProfessional users can also expect a significant boost in graphics, VR, and AI workflows in sectors including product design, automotive design, and architectural visualisation.\nThe Nvidia RTX A6000 is the first professional GPU to be built on the Nvidia Ampere architecture. It is also the first to support PCIe Gen 4, in workstations such as the Lenovo ThinkStation P620, which features the new AMD Threadripper Pro CPU.\nThe Nvidia RTX A6000 is expected to be the top-end model in the range and will be available in December. Replacements for the mainstream Quadro RTX 4000 and RTX 5000 will likely come next year but Nvidia would not be drawn on any details.\nThe new GPU features 48 GB of GDDR6 GPU memory, double that of the Quadro RTX 6000, plus significantly improved processing cores, delivering a \u20182x performance per watt increase\u2019.\nAccording to Nvidia, a total of 84 second-generation RT cores deliver up to 2x the throughput of the pervious generation, plus concurrent ray tracing, shading and compute.\nMeanwhile, 10,752 new CUDA cores deliver up to 2x the FP32 throughput for significant increases in graphics and compute, while a total of 336 third-generation Tensor Cores provide up to 5x the throughput in AI workflows.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nOther specifications include four DisplayPort 1.4 connectors, support for Framelock and NVlink, and a max power consumption of 300W.\nEarly adopters of the Nvidia RTX A6000 have reported significant benefits in a range of workflows. Car manufacturer Renault, who uses Quadro to review design concepts in ray-traced photorealism, has reported performance gains of over 2x with ray-traced exterior scenes.\nPredator Cycling, which specialises in custom carbon bicycles, has seen performance gains of 2-6x across a number of key applications, including Luxion KeyShot and Ansys Discovery CFD.\n\u201cThe real power is that our team can run CFD analysis, be modelling and screen-sharing on a video call, all simultaneously,\u201d said co-founder Aram Goganian.\nKohn Pedersen Fox, one of the world\u2019s largest architecture firms, has noted the ability to triple the resolution and accelerate real-time visualisation of complex building models in cityscapes.\nThe Nvidia RTX A6000 is focussed very much on graphics. It does not have accelerated double precision performance, which is important for applications including engineering simulation. Nvidia told DEVELOP3D that for customers that need double precision there\u2019s the Quadro GV100 or Nvidia A100 for the data centre.\nThe Nvidia RTX A6000 is primarily a GPU for desktop workstations, but support for vGPU Software including Nvidia GRID, Nvidia Quadro Virtual Data Center Workstation, and Nvidia Virtual Compute Server, will come next year. vGPU profiles will be available for 1 GB, 2 GB, 3 GB, 4 GB, 6 GB, 8 GB, 12 GB, 16 GB, 24 GB and 48 GB.\nNvidia has also released a new datacentre GPU, the Nvidia A40, which is almost identical to the Nvidia RTX A6000, but is passively cooled.\nNvidia RTX A6000-based workstations are expected from BOXX, Dell, HP and Lenovo and others, while Nvidia A40-based servers are expected from Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and more. Pricing was not disclosed.\nThe Nvidia A40 is almost identical to the Nvidia RTX A6000, but is designed for the datacentre and passively cooled.\nRelated articles:Royal Academy backs The Africa Prize for innovatorsWorkstations and GPUs for VRIntel offers fast track evaluation of cloud-based workstations for CADA shiny space saving kitchen product - the Armadillo colanderNebumind and Authentise integrate for Digital Twin inspectionsVero's Radan adds in 180 enhancements to latest version of the sheet metal softwareTell us where it hurts...Prodways' SLS 3D printing now available in UK via service bureau 3DDC \n\n\n\nPrevious Post \n\nNext Post \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStay informed\nJoin the DEVELOP3D community\nNewsletter \u2022 FREE digital magazine \u2022 print magazine\nGo\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nLatest content \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nControlled Permeability added to AM parts by Dyndrite and Elementum3D\n\nMarch 13, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n3D printing the Nozzle office chair\n\nMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSiemens PAVE360 uses AMD GPUs to run on Microsoft Azure\n\nMarch 12, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWhy additive manufacturing needs AI\n\nMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nELM Mobility\u2019s special delivery\n\nMarch 17, 2025\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \u00a9 2008-2024 X3DMedia\r\n19 Leyden Street.

The announcement comes just weeks after the launch of the GeForce RTX 3090 and GeForce RTX 3080 graphics cards which had severely limited quantities at launch and to make sure that it isn't the case with the RTX 3070, NVIDIA has updated its schedule.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Retail Launch Now A Day After AMD's Radeon RX 6000 Series Unveil\nAs per the latest schedule, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 would now be available for retail on the 29th of October. This is almost a 2 weeks delay compared to the previous launch day of 15th. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 specifications and prices remain unchanged but it looks like users who were planning to get the GeForce RTX 3070 graphics card on launch should now just wait to see what competition has to offer as AMD's Radeon RX 6000 series would be unveiled just a day prior to the retail launch.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB MemoryNVIDIA releases GeForce RTX 3070 performance metrics versus the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti & RTX 2070 at 1440P.\nFollowing is NVIDIA's official statement regarding the GeForce RTX 3070's availability update:\nProduction of\u00a0GeForce RTX 3070\u00a0graphics cards are ramping quickly. We\u2019ve heard from many of you that there should be more cards available on launch day. To help make that happen, we are updating the availability date to Thursday, October 29th.\nWe know this may be disappointing to those eager to purchase a GeForce RTX 3070 as soon as possible, however this shift will help our global partners get more graphics cards into the hands of gamers on launch day.\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 delivers incredible performance and features, including\u00a0NVIDIA Reflex\u00a0and\u00a0Broadcast, for $499. Across a variety of ray-traced and rasterized DirectX and Vulkan titles, the GeForce RTX 3070 delivers similar or faster performance than the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti (which sold for twice the price) and is on average 60% faster than the original GeForce RTX 2070. via NVIDIA\nIn the latest performance metrics, NVIDIA shows that the GeForce RTX 3070 trades blows with the RTX 2080 Ti while being 60% faster on average than the GeForce RTX 3070. In some gaming titles, the GeForce RTX 3070 is a good bit ahead of the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. Also what's really interesting here is that NVIDIA is showcasing the performance of its GeForce RTX 3070 in several professional and content creation applications which is something that NVIDIA hasn't done before for its **70 tier graphics cards. The games were once again measured at 1440p resolution with an Intel Core i9 CPU at the highest possible settings (RTX / DLSS enabled).\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Graphics Card Specifications - GA104 GPU & 8 GB GDDR6 Memory\nAt the heart of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 graphics card lies the GA104 GPU. The GA104 is one of the many Ampere GPUs that we will be getting on the gaming segment. The GA104 GPU is the second-fastest Ampere chip in the stack. The GPU is based on Samsung's 8nm (N8) process node. The GPU measures at 392.5mm2 and features 17.4 Billion transistors which are almost 93% of the transistors featured on the TU102 GPU. At the same time, the GA104 GPU is almost half the size of the TU102 GPU which is an insane amount of density.\nFor the GeForce RTX 3070, NVIDIA has enabled a total of 46 SM units on its flagship which results in a total of 5888 CUDA cores. In addition to the CUDA cores, NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3070 also comes packed with next-generation RT (Ray-Tracing) cores, Tensor cores, and brand new SM or streaming multi-processor units.\n\nIn terms of memory, the GeForce RTX 3070 features 8 GB of GDDR6 memory. The GeForce RTX 3070 comes with memory at speeds of 14 Gbps. That along with a full uncut bus interface of 256-bit will deliver a cumulative bandwidth of 448 Gbps. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 will be powered by a single 12-pin Micro-Fit 3.0 connector. As for pricing, the Founders Edition will hit retail at $499 US while custom models would cost either the same or come at a premium price point.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere' Graphics Card Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA106-300Ampere GA104-200Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie SizeTBC395.2mm2395.2mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBC17.4 Billion17.4 Billion28 Billion28 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores358448645888870410496\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs112 / 64152 / 80184 / 96272 / 96328 / 112\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores112 / 28152 / 38184 / 46272 / 68328 / 82\n\n\nBase Clock1320 MHz1410 MHz1500 MHz1440 MHz1400 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock1780 MHz1665 MHz1730 MHz1710 MHz1700 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute13 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs30 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPs25 TFLOPs32 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs58 TFLOPs69 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPs101 TOPs192 TOPs163 TOPs238 TOPs285 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity12 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR610 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus192-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed16 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth384 Gbps448 Gbps448 Gbps760 Gbps936 Gbps\n\n\nTGP170W175W220W320W350W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$329 US$399 US$499 US$699 US$1499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)25th February 20212nd December 202029th October 202017th September 202024th September 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n160\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The GeForce RTX 2080 Ti sat atop Nvidia\u2019s RTX 20-series graphics card stack, offering performance as scalding as its $1,200 price tag. Could the $500 GeForce RTX 3070 and its new-look Ampere GPU really go toe-to-toe with the last generation\u2019s luxurious flagship for a whopping $700 less?\nSpoiler alert: Yep. It wins some and loses some, but on the whole, the GeForce RTX 3070 is effectively just as fast as the RTX 2080 Ti in gaming (and much more so in some creative tasks) for well under half the price. And it absolutely smokes its RTX 2070 predecessor. That\u2019s a massive step forward for PC gamers\u2014but AMD\u2019s counterpunch looms, with the Radeon RX 6000 series scheduled to be unveiled Wednesday. Whether the GeForce RTX 3070 continues to rock\u00a0 oursocks in the wake of AMD\u2019s announcement remains to be seen, but at least for one day, Nvidia\u2019s new graphics card rules the school.\n\nLet\u2019s dig in.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nThe backplate of the RTX 3070 Founders Edition.\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3070: Specs, features, and price\nFirst, the technical info, as the RTX 3070 Founders Edition differs quite a bit from previously released RTX 30-series graphics cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$1,494.68 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 use Nvidia\u2019s biggest \u201cGA102\u201d Ampere GPU, the new GeForce RTX 3070 is built using the smaller \u201cGA104\u201d GPU. This GPU supports up to 48 streaming multiprocessors in its full incarnation, but the RTX 3070 pares that back slightly with 46 SMs, presumably to help compensate for potential defects during the manufacturing process. Check out our RTX 3080 review or Nvidia\u2019s own Ampere whitepaper for a deeper look at the most significant architectural changes, as we won\u2019t be rehashing those GPU-level technical details here.\nHere\u2019s a high-level look at the $500 GeForce RTX 3070\u2019s insides and outsides, compared against the tech specs for its predecessor, the $500 RTX 2070, and the $1,200 RTX 2080 Ti that Nvidia is so keen to compare it against.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe \u201cAmpere\u201d GPUs in the RTX 30-series sport a new design that effectively doubles the CUDA core count compared to the older generation. Not all of those can be used at once in most games, however, so performance doesn\u2019t scale linearly. Likewise, the RTX 3070 packs more advanced RT and tensor cores\u2014the dedicated hardware used for ray tracing and AI tasks like DLSS, respectively\u2014than the last-gen GPUs, so don\u2019t be scared off by the lower counts there. This card handles real-time ray tracing on a par with what the RTX 2080 Ti could handle, and it\u2019s clocked much higher.\nMemory is the biggest difference here. The RTX 3080 and 3090 upgraded to much faster, much more efficient GDDR6X memory, which gives those cards hefty bumps to overall memory bandwidth. The GeForce RTX 3070 doesn\u2019t. It comes with the same 8GB of GDDR6 memory as last-gen\u2019s RTX 2070, over the same 256-bit bus. That\u2019s a disadvantage compared to the RTX 2080 Ti it usurps, both in raw capacity (8GB vs 11GB) and overall memory bandwidth (448GBps vs. 616GBps). It shouldn\u2019t make a difference at 1440p resolution, but you have to wonder if 8GB of GDDR6 will be enough for 4K gaming in a couple of years, especially because the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles are both moving to 16GB of VRAM when they launch in a couple of weeks. Today, though, it\u2019s fine for the vast majority of 4K games.\n\nDespite the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090\u2019s earned reputation as power hogs, the GeForce RTX 3070 shows that Ampere is indeed more power-efficient than the Turing GPUs inside the older RTX 20-series. The GeForce RTX 3070 delivers performance roughly on a par with the former RTX 2080 Ti flagship, but the newer graphics card consumes 30 watts less power, and drops from 2x 8-pin connectors to a single 8-pin connector. That said, it still draws significantly more than the RTX 2070 it\u2019s replacing, which drew 70W less and could run on a less potent power supply.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nThe RTX 3070 FE still uses Nvidia\u2019s proprietary 12-pin connector, but in a different place than other Founders Edition models.\n\n\nThe Founders Edition model we\u2019re reviewing today still uses Nvidia\u2019s tiny, highly customized PCB with a notch taken out of it to help with airflow. This means that like the other FE cards revealed so far, it powers on via a proprietary 12-pin connector. Nvidia includes an (ugly, short) adapter in the box. Unlike the more powerful RTX 30-series Founders Edition cards, however, the 12-pin connector is located horizontally in the middle of the edge of the card, rather than positioned vertically and at a 45-degree angle. If your case\u2019s power supply shroud has a cutout for wires underneath your GPU, this is a much better placement.\nThat\u2019s not the only design change. Nvidia created a highly unique custom \u201cflow-through\u201d cooling solution for the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090, with independent push-pull fans and bristling, thick metal heat fins comprising the body of the card itself. It\u2019s very effective.\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 changes things up a wee bit. Rather than having one fan on the top and the bottom of the card in a push-pull configuration, the RTX 3070 FE places both fans in their standard places in the face of the card and adds a sleek backplate to the top. The two fans pushes air through the heatsink; the blower-style fan at the rear of the card expels heat through the 3070 FE\u2019s I/O bracket, while the other one sends the hot air through a cut-out in the backplate back into the top of your system, where it can be sucked out by your case\u2019s rear outtake fan. It\u2019s functionally the same idea as the cooler on the more powerful RTX 30-series cards, but it takes a different path to get there.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nRTX 3080 Founders Edition (top) vs. RTX 3070 Founders Edition (bottom)\n\n\nBetween the cooler redesign and the less demanding power requirements, the GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition wound up much smaller than its FE siblings, as well as the RTX 2080 Ti. This 2-slot card measures just 9.5 inches long and 4.4 inches wide. Like the other RTX 30-series FE cards, the RTX 3070 Founders Edition offers three DisplayPort 1.4 connections and a single HDMI 2.1 port capable of 8K video output, along with AV1 decode support for watching 8K videos with much less stutter and fewer dropped frames.\nThe RTX 3070 also supports other neat features that Nvidia introduced with the RTX 30-series. If you\u2019re a streamer or video creator, you\u2019ll want to check out Nvidia Broadcast, a suite of tools that uses the AI capabilities of Nvidia\u2019s tensor cores to enable automatic noise cancellation and software-based greenscreen, background blur, and head tracking capabilities. You can also take advantage of Nvidia\u2019s Reflex suite of technologies built to minimize latency in competitive esports games. We tested Nvidia Reflex recently and were highly impressed. Finally, the RTX 3070 also supports RTX I/O, an upcoming technology that allows your GPU and NVMe SSD to talk directly. Here\u2019s how Microsoft and Nvidia plan to kill loading times in games. If it takes off after debuting next year, it could be a true game-changer.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nThe RTX 3070 Founders Edition still uses thick, black heat fins for most of its construction.\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s new generation also upgraded to PCIe 4.0 connectors, which can currently be utilized only on AMD Ryzen systems, though Intel plans to move up from PCIe 3.0 next year. Of course, the card also works with traditional Nvidia features like Shadowplay, NVENC, and one-click game optimization via the GeForce Experience app.\nBut enough about the features. Let\u2019s get to the games (and a couple of creative workloads, too).\n\nNext page: Our test system, gaming benchmarks begin\n\n\nOur test system\nOur dedicated graphics card test system is a couple of years old, but it\u2019s packed with some of the fastest complementary components available to put any potential performance bottlenecks squarely on the GPU. Most of the hardware was provided by the manufacturers, but we purchased the cooler and storage ourselves.\n\nIntel Core i7-8700K processor ($300 on\u00a0Amazon) overclocked to 5GHz all cores\nEVGA CLC 240 closed-loop liquid cooler ($105 on\u00a0Amazon)\nAsus Maximus X Hero motherboard\n64GB HyperX Predator RGB DDR4/2933 ($355 on Amazon)\nEVGA 1200W SuperNova P2 power supply ($352 on\u00a0Amazon)\nCorsair Crystal 570X RGB case, with front and top panels removed and an extra rear fan installed for improved airflow\n2x 500GB Samsung 860 EVO SSDs ($70 each on\u00a0Amazon)\n\nWe\u2019re comparing the $500 GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition against a bunch of other FE cards: Nvidia\u2019s $800 GeForce RTX 3080, $1,200 RTX 2080 Ti, $800 RTX 2080 and the older $700 GTX 1080, as well as the \u201cSuper\u201d upgrades for the RTX 2070 and 2080. (MSRPs for the 1080 and 2080 started at $100 less, but Nvidia charged a premium for the FE models.) Because so many owners of the $700 GTX 1080 Ti decided to skip over the lackluster performance increase in the similarly priced RTX 2080, we\u2019re also including the EVGA GTX 1080 Ti SC2 in our roundup. We also included AMD\u2019s $400 Radeon RX 5700 XT, which matched or even beat the RTX 2070\u2019s performance in many games despite starting at $100 less.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 FE in our test system.\n\n\nWe test a variety of games spanning various engines, genres, and graphics APIs (DirectX 11, DX12, and Vulkan). Each game is tested using its in-game benchmark at the highest possible graphics presets unless otherwise noted, with VSync, frame rate caps, real-time ray tracing or DLSS effects, and FreeSync/G-Sync disabled, along with any other vendor-specific technologies like FidelityFX. We\u2019ve also enabled temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) to push these cards to their limits.\u00a0We run each benchmark at least three times and list the average result for each test.\n\nGeForce RTX 3080 gaming benchmarks\nHorizon Zero Dawn\nYep, Sony exclusives are hitting the PC now. Horizon Zero Dawn hit Steam with some performance issues, but the most egregious ones have been mostly cleared up thanks to hard work from the developers, and the game topped the sales charts for weeks after its release. It also seems to respond somewhat to PCIe 4.0 scaling, which will make this an interesting inclusion when we shift to a PCIe 4.0-based system in the future.\nHorizon Zero Dawn runs on Guerrilla Games\u2019 Decima engine, the same engine that powers Death Stranding. Ambient Occlusion can still offer iffy results if set to Ultra, so we test with that setting at Medium. Every other visual option is maxed out.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 draws equal with the RTX 2080 Ti at both 4K and 1440p resolution. In our RTX 3080 and 3090 reviews, we found that Nvidia\u2019s Ampere architecture doesn\u2019t seem to scale down to lower resolutions as well as older \u201cTuring\u201d-based RTX 20-series options. We see that again with the 1080p results, where the RTX 3070 winds up roughly 12 percent slower than the RTX 2080 Ti.\nThe less efficient scaling at lower resolutions is also apparent when you compare the RTX 3070 against the RTX 2070 it replaces. The 3070 is 63 percent faster at 4K, but 54 percent faster at 1440p. Regardless, that\u2019s a stellar gen-on-gen leap.\n\nGears Tactics\nGears Tactics puts it own brutal, fast-paced spin on the XCOM-like genre. This Unreal Engine 4-powered game was built from the ground up for DirectX 12, and we love being able to work a tactics-style game into our benchmarking suite. Better yet, the game comes with a plethora of graphics options for PC snobs. More games should devote such loving care to explaining what flipping all these visual knobs mean. You can\u2019t use the presets to benchmark Gears Tactics, as it intelligently scales to work best on your installed hardware, meaning that \u201cUltra\u201d on one graphics card can load different settings than \u201cUltra\u201d on a weaker card. We manually set all options to their highest possible settings.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 winds up a couple of frames behind the RTX 2080 Ti at all resolutions here, but again, it\u2019s effectively a tie. Versus the RTX 2070, the RTX 3070 winds up 69 percent faster at 4K and 52 percent faster at 1440p.\nNext page: Gaming benchmarks continue\n\n\nWolfenstein: Youngblood\nWolfenstein: Youngblood isn\u2019t the most fun game in the world unless you can play cooperatively with a buddy, but it\u2019s a fearless experiment\u2014and an absolute technical showcase. Running on the Vulkan API, Youngblood achieves blistering frame rates, and it supports all sorts of cutting-edge technologies like ray tracing, DLSS 2.0, HDR, GPU culling, asynchronous computing, and Nvidia\u2019s Content Adaptive Shading. The game includes a built-in benchmark with two different scenes; we tested Lab X.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThis is the first game that clearly prefers the RTX 2080 Ti\u2019s Turing architecture. Each Turing core has dedicated FP32 and integer pipelines. In Ampere, each core has a dedicated FP32 pipeline, and a second pipeline that can be used for either shading or integer (compute) tasks. That design lets Ampere generally perform better at higher resolutions that can tap those FP32 pipelines more fully. But in games that lean heavily on GPU compute tasks\u2014like Youngblood\u2014it can take some performance off the top, because if the second pipeline is being used to perform integer tasks, it can\u2019t be used for rendering. Or maybe\u00a0Wolfenstein just prefers the 2080 Ti\u2019s larger 11GB memory buffer.\nEither way, the RTX 3070 is 12 percent slower at 4K and 8 percent slower at 1440p, though the cards draw equal at 1080p. It\u2019s worth noting that Wolfenstein hits very, very high frame rates at all three resolutions, though.\nCompared to the RTX 2070, the RTX 3070 is 47 percent faster at 4K, and 41 percent faster at 1440p.\nMetro Exodus\nOne of the best games of 2019, Metro Exodus is one of the best-looking games around, too. The latest version of the 4A Engine provides incredibly luscious, ultra-detailed visuals, with one of the most stunning real-time ray tracing implementations released yet. We test in DirectX 12 mode with ray tracing, Hairworks, and DLSS disabled for our basic benchmarks.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nAgain, the RTX 3070 can\u2019t quite match the RTX 2080 Ti\u2019s pace here, though it\u2019s effectively identical from a practical standpoint. The 2080 Ti is 8 percent faster at 4K, and 6 percent faster at 1440p and 1080p. That\u2019s only a few frames per second in real life, and your eyes won\u2019t see the difference.\nYou\u2019ll feel the upgrade from an RTX 2070, though. The RTX 3070 is 53 percent faster at 4K and 1440p resolutions, and 50 percent faster at 1080p. Notably, the RTX 2070 manages 54 frames per second at 1440p, while the RTX 3070 hits 52fps at 4K. That\u2019s a great gen-on-gen upgrade.\nBorderlands 3\nBorderlands is back! Gearbox\u2019s game defaults to DX12, so we do as well. It gives us a glimpse at the ultra-popular Unreal Engine 4\u2019s performance in a traditional shooter.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe RTX 3070 indeed bests the 2080 Ti here, though it\u2019s by a scant frame at all three resolutions. You can witness the effect of Ampere and Turing\u2019s different GPU configurations when you compare it against the RTX 2070, though, as this game takes heavy advantage of async compute. Nvidia\u2019s new card is 47 percent faster at 4K, a whopping 64 percent faster at 1440p, and 59 percent faster at 1080p.\n\nStrange Brigade\nStrange Brigade\u00a0is a cooperative third-person shooter where a team of adventurers blasts through hordes of mythological enemies. It\u2019s a technological showcase, built around the next-gen Vulkan and DirectX 12 technologies and infused with features like HDR support and the ability to toggle asynchronous compute on and off. It uses Rebellion\u2019s custom Azure engine. We test using the Vulkan renderer, which is faster than DX12.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe RTX 3070 is slower than the RTX 2080 Ti here, but only just. It\u2019s 3 percent slower at 4K and 1080p, and 5 percent slower at 1440p. Again, your eyes wouldn\u2019t see the scant few frames separating the two in the real world. Compared to the 2070, the RTX 3070 is 56 percent faster at 4K resolution, 52 percent faster at 1440p, and 48 percent faster at 1080p.\nTotal War: Troy\nThe latest game in the popular Total War saga, Troy was given away free for its first 24 hours on the Epic Games Store, moving over 7.5 million copies before it went on proper sale. Total War: Troy is built using a modified version of the Total War: Warhammer 2 engine, and this DX11 title looks stunning for a turn-based strategy game. We test the more intensive battle benchmark.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nOnce again, the RTX 3070 falls behind the RTX 2080 Ti\u2019s pace but delivers the same essential playing experience. It\u2019s 5 percent slower at 4K by the numbers, but in reality, that\u2019s just 2.4\u00a0 frames per second less in a scenario already running well under the hallowed 60-fps mark. It\u2019s 8 percent slower at 1440p, and 5 percent slower at 1080p.\n\nNext page: Gaming benchmarks continue\n\n\nF1 2020\nThe latest in a long line of successful racing games,\u00a0F1 2020 is a gem to test, supplying a wide array of both graphical and benchmarking options, making it a much more reliable (and fun) option that the\u00a0Forza\u00a0series. It\u2019s built on the latest version of Codemasters\u2019 buttery-smooth Ego game engine, complete with support for DX12 and Nvidia\u2019s DLSS technology. We test two laps on the Australia course, with clear skies on and DLSS off.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nHere, the RTX 3070 is 3 percent\u2014and just 3 frames\u2014behind the RTX 2080 Ti at 4K, but the tables turn at 1440p and 1080p. The two cards tie at 1440p, while the RTX 3070 pulls ahead by a full 14 percent at 1080p.\nThe RTX 2070 is 58 percent slower than the RTX 3070 at 4K and 1440p, and 48 percent slower at 1080p.\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0concludes the reboot trilogy, and it\u2019s utterly\u00a0gorgeous. Square Enix optimized this game for DX12, and recommends DX11 only if you\u2019re using older hardware or Windows 7, so we test with DX12.\u00a0Shadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0uses an enhanced version of the Foundation engine that also powered\u00a0Rise of the Tomb Raider and includes optional real-time ray tracing and DLSS features.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe RTX 3070 is technically slower than the RTX 2080 Ti but it\u2019s a functional tie, with the two cards within 5 percent and a handful of frames of each other.\nNvidia\u2019s new card keeps a large lead over its predecessor. The RTX 3070 is 53 percent faster at 4K, 49 percent faster at 1440p, and 21 percent faster at 1080p than the RTX 2070. The 1080p difference could have been even larger, but the RTX 3070 is bumping against the upper limits of the game engine, which won\u2019t push much beyond 135 fps on our system in any circumstance.\nGrand Theft Auto V\nThis DX11 game isn\u2019t really a visual barn-burner like the (somewhat wonky) Red Dead Redemption 2, but it still tops the Steam charts day in and day out, so we deem it more worthy of testing. RDR2 will melt your graphics card, sure, but GTA V remains so popular years after launch that upgraded versions of it will be available on the next-generation consoles. That\u2019s staying power.\n\nWe test\u00a0Grand Theft Auto V\u00a0with all options turned to Very High, all Advanced Graphics options except extended shadows enabled, and FXAA.\u00a0GTA V\u00a0runs on the RAGE engine and has received substantial updates since its initial launch.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nLike in Borderlands, the RTX 3070 technically wins here, but it\u2019s a functional tie, with only a frame or so\u2019s difference between all three major resolutions. At 1440p and 1080p, all of the high-end cards are pushing GTA V as fast as it can go, so the 4K results show the most separation. Versus the RTX 2070, the RTX 3070 is 47 percent faster at 4K and 13 percent faster at 1440p.\nRainbow Six Siege\nLike GTA V, Ubisoft\u2019s Rainbow Six Siege still dominates the Steam charts years after its launch, and it\u2019ll be getting a visual upgrade for the next-gen consoles. The developers have poured a ton of work into the game\u2019s AnvilNext engine over the years, eventually rolling out a Vulkan version of the game that we use to test. By default, the game lowers the render scaling to increase frame rates, but we set it to 100 percent to benchmark native rendering performance on graphics cards. Even still, frame rates soar.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe RTX 3070 falls a few frames behind the RTX 2080 Ti at 4K and 1440p, but both cards deliver functionally the same results. The RTX 2080 Ti pulls ahead a bit more at 1080p, where it\u2019s 8 percent faster.\nNvidia\u2019s new card is 51 percent faster than the RTX 2070 at 4K, 47 percent faster at 1440p, and 25 percent faster at 1080p.\nThat\u2019s it for traditional gaming benchmarks. Now let\u2019s take a peek at how the GeForce RTX 3070 performs with real time ray tracing enabled.\nNext page: RTX 3070 ray tracing performance\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3070 ray tracing performance\nThe Ampere GPUs inside Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 30-series graphics cards include upgraded versions of the dedicated RT and tensor cores that debuted in the RTX 20-series, helping them process ray tracing faster and enable Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS).\nWe\u2019ve already determined in our RTX 3080 review that the upgraded hardware doesn\u2019t make ray tracing more efficient in games that only activate one or two ray tracing effects, like the titles benchmarked below. You should see bigger differences in games that more fully embrace the technology, like Minecraft RTX and Quake II RTX, which are fully path-traced, and the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077, which supports a wide range of ray tracing effects.\n\n\n \n\n\nNonetheless, we feel it\u2019s useful to benchmark these titles to see what you can expect by turning on ray tracing and DLSS. Even with DLSS on, activating ray tracing sent most RTX 20-series graphics cards to their knees, but the raw firepower of Ampere helps the RTX 30-series maintain more playable frame rates at higher resolutions. Ray tracing may not be more efficient in these titles compared to the RTX 20-series, but the Ampere GPUs are pumping out frames so fast, it\u2019s a lot easier to hit 60 fps-plus with all the eye candy cranked up. For more information about ray tracing and DLSS, check out our Nvidia RTX retrospective from the end of the RTX 20-series\u2019 lifespan.\nWe test these games using the same settings discussed in the previous section, but with DLSS enabled and all ray tracing options cranked to Ultra. We\u2019ll include two charts. The first shows standard performance with ray tracing disabled, while the second shows results with ray tracing active, so you can also see the performance impact imparted by flipping it on.\n\nFirst up: Metro Exodus, which includes ray-traced Global Illumination and the first-gen DLSS technology.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe RTX 3070 can\u2019t quite match the RTX 2080 Ti\u2019s pace with ray tracing and DLSS off, so it\u2019s no surprise to see it lagging slightly behind here. But the more practical takeaway is that even with ray tracing and all visual options cranked to the max, you can still get very playable experiences at 1440p and 1080p resolution. Nvidia\u2019s former $500 option, the RTX 2070, was significantly slower with ray tracing enabled, and could basically only deliver a smooth 60 at 1080p resolution.\nBoth the RTX 3070 and 2080 Ti fall behind the 60-fps mark at 4K resolution with ray tracing enabled, but 45 to 50 frames per second isn\u2019t terrible in this slower-paced shooting adventure, especially if you have an adaptive-sync (G-Sync or FreeSync) display to help smooth things out.\nShadow of the Tomb Raider was one of the first games to support Nvidia\u2019s RTX endeavors. It includes ray-traced shadows and DLSS 1.0. This game doesn\u2019t let you play at 1080p with DLSS 1.0 on, so you won\u2019t see those results here.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe older RTX 2070 couldn\u2019t get to 60 fps in any situation with ray tracing turned to ultra, even with DLSS enabled. The RTX 3070 far exceeds that mark at 1080p, and comes within spitting distance at 1440p. Given the slower nature of this adventure game, the RTX 3070 and RTX 2080 Ti\u2019s results are definitely playable at 1440p. The RTX 3070 is a bit slower than the RTX 2080 Ti, just like it is with ray tracing off, but turning on the strenuous lighting effect amplifies the difference.\nWolfenstein Youngblood includes ray-traced reflections, as well as Nvidia\u2019s faster, better DLSS 2.0 technology that will be powering the next generation of RTX-enabled games. We\u2019re only including 4K results here, as at lower resolutions, enabling ray tracing wound up delivering a hard, uniform 135-fps cap across these cards. We\u2019re still investigating why that is, but 4K resolution is strenuous enough to show performance differences.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nAs you can see, turning on ray tracing with DLSS 2.0 doesn\u2019t result in a major performance impact, and the RTX 3070 and 2080 Ti once again deliver similar results. Ray tracing and the ability to push a 4K, 120Hz monitor to its fullest? Yes please. Again, though, note the performance change generation over generation. The RTX 3070 is 50 percent faster than the RTX 2070 with ray tracing on.\nBut you don\u2019t need to have ray tracing turned on to get DLSS 2.0\u2019s delicious performance-boosting benefits. F1 2020 supports DLSS 2.0 but not ray tracing, and activating it (as an antialiasing option) delivers a healthy speed bump with no noticeable visual downgrades.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nOnce again, the RTX 3070 and RTX 2080 Ti are in a dead heat, while Nvidia\u2019s new card winds up a whopping 50 percent faster than its RTX 2070 predecessor.\nBottom line? The $500 RTX 3070 lets you play ray traced games at playable frame rates at 1440p, and sometimes at 4K if you don\u2019t mind falling slightly below 60 fps, or tinkering with some graphics settings. You couldn\u2019t say that about the RTX 2070, nor most of the RTX 20-series lineup.\nNext page: Creative benchmarks\n\n\nCreative benchmarks\nAfter witnessing how well Ampere performed in creative tasks versus Turing as part of our GeForce RTX 3090 review, we decided to test a few content creation benchmarks on the RTX 3070, too. Full-time creators would probably be better off investing in a more powerful GPU with more memory capacity and drivers optimized around professional applications, but if you want to do some video rendering on the side of your gaming, the RTX 3070 often tramples over the RTX 2080 Ti thanks to Ampere\u2019s improved RT and tensor cores. Using the RT cores for motion blur acceleration isn\u2019t a big deal in gaming (yet, at least), but it can make a world of difference in some creative workloads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$1,829.99 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve only recently started testing some creative workloads, so you won\u2019t find the RTX 2070 compared here, nor many other GPUs. But these should show how the RTX 3070 stacks up against previous-gen flagships, including the RTX 2080 Ti and GTX 1080 Ti.\nLet\u2019s quickly start with Geekbench 5. This quick cross-platform benchmark measures GPU compute performance \u201cusing workloads that include image processing, computational photography, computer vision, and machine learning.\u201d The app supports OpenCL and CUDA. Any GPU can run OpenCL, but CUDA requires specialized hardware and software from Nvidia, and delivers faster performance. We\u2019ve focused on CUDA results here, so you\u2019ll only see Nvidia GPUs compared.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe RTX 3070 is just behind the RTX 2080 Ti, but only barely. Let\u2019s move on to more practical rendering benchmarks.\nLuxmark 3.1 is a pure OpenCL benchmark based on the LuxRender v1.5 engine. It offers three different scenes to test. The \u201csimple\u201d Luxball HDR renders 217K triangles; the \u201cmedium\u201d Neumann TLM-102 Special Edition renders 1769K triangles; and the \u201ccomplex\u201d Hotel Lobby renders 4973K triangles. Higher scores are better.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe $700 RTX 3080 stands head and shoulders above the others, but the RTX 3070 pulls ahead of the RTX 2080 Ti by a notable margin.\nNvidia\u2019s software stack is a key ace in the hole. Many developers swear by CUDA software optimizations, and now that RTX is here, Nvidia\u2019s been rolling out \u201cOptiX\u201d technology that leverages all those RT and tensor cores for creative purposes. Blender is a very popular free and open-source 3D graphics program used to create visual effects and even full-blown movies. In 2019, Blender integrated Nvidia OptiX into Cycles, its physically based path tracer for production rendering, to tap into GeForce\u2019s RT cores for hardware-accelerated ray tracing.\nWe tested Blender using the Blender Open Toolkit. We tested two scenes: Classroom and Victor, with the latter being the most strenuous scene the benchmark offers. AMD\u2019s Radeon VII consistently crashed when trying to run Victor, but worked fine with Classroom. We tested each graphics card with the best-performing GPU acceleration possible for that card. That\u2019s OpenCL for the Radeon VII, CUDA for the GTX 1080 Ti, and OptiX for the GeForce RTX cards. The results show total rendering time, so lower is better.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nOnce again, the RTX 3070 finishes its tasks at a much faster clip than the RTX 2080 Ti. The advanced motion blur acceleration inside Ampere is pulling its weight here. If you render 4K or 8K videos, though, the larger 11GB memory capacity of the RTX 2080 Ti might wind up more useful than the faster render times provided by the 8GB RTX 3070.\n\nOctaneBench 2020 v1.5. is a canned test offered by OTOY to benchmark your system\u2019s performance with the company\u2019s OctaneRender, an unbiased, spectrally correct GPU engine. OctaneBench (and OctaneRender) also integrate Nvidia\u2019s OptiX API for accelerated ray tracing performance on GPUs that support it. The RTX cards do; the GTX 1080 Ti again sticks to CUDA. The benchmark spits out a final score after rendering several scenes, and the higher it is, the better your GPU performs. OctaneRender requires CUDA or Optix, so again, you won\u2019t find the Radeon VII here.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe creative conquering is complete. After witnessing back-and-forth results in games, if Nvidia wants hard proof that the $500 GeForce RTX 3070 is faster than the $1,200 RTX 2080 Ti, the company can point to its rendering chops.\nNext page: Power, thermals, and noise\n\n\nPower draw, thermals, and noise\nWe test power draw by looping the\u00a0F1 2020\u00a0benchmark at 4K for about 20 minutes after we\u2019ve benchmarked everything else. We note the highest reading on our Watts Up Pro meter, which measures the power consumption of our entire test system. The initial part of the race, where all competing cars are onscreen simultaneously, tends to be the most demanding portion.\u00a0\n\nThis isn\u2019t a worst-case test; we removed the Core i7 8700K\u2019s overclock and specifically chose a GPU-bound game running at a GPU-bound resolution to gauge performance when the graphics card is sweating hard. If you\u2019re playing a game that also hammers the CPU, you could see higher overall system power draws. Consider yourself warned.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nFor all the complaints about the RTX 30-series being power hungry, Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3070 draws considerably less power than the RTX 2080 Ti that it rivals in gaming performance. It requires a bit more juice than the RTX 2070 did, though.\nWe test thermals by leaving GPU-Z open during the\u00a0F1 2020\u00a0power draw test, noting the highest maximum temperature at the end.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNothing to complain about here. The slightly altered RTX 3070 Founders Edition design keeps the GPU at a frigid 72 degrees under an extended load, which compares favorably against well-designed cooling solutions we\u2019ve seen on custom cards in the past. It\u2019s a lot cooler than the (much more powerful) RTX 3080 Founders Edition. That said, while the RTX 3080 FE was very quiet, the much smaller RTX 3070 Founders Edition sounds like your average graphics card. It\u2019s not loud, but it\u2019s definitely not silent.\n\nNext page: Should you buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition?\n\n\nShould you buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition?\nIf you\u2019re on the hunt for a graphics card capable of feeding a 4K monitor, or high-refresh rate 1440p or 1080p display, the $500 Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition is a spectacular option. It looks great, runs cool, and keeps reasonably quiet.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe RTX 3070 isn\u2019t always faster than the RTX 2080 Ti, the $1,200 flagship from the former generation, but they\u2019re always in the same ballpark. It\u2019s just as fast from a practical standpoint, and if you dabble in creative tasks, the upgraded Ampere architecture helps the RTX 3070 blow past the RTX 2080 Ti in rendering benchmarks, all while drawing materially less power. The GeForce RTX 2080 Ti\u2019s bigger 11GB memory capacity might give it the edge in 4K games and creative applications that stress your VRAM buffer, though.\nCompared to the GeForce RTX 2070 that preceded it for the same $500 price point, the RTX 2070 winds up 45 to 69 percent faster in GPU-bound scenarios. Generation-on-generation it\u2019s a massive step forward (though to be fair, the RTX 2070 wasn\u2019t much faster than the GTX 1080 that cost a similar amount). Better yet, the increased firepower in the RTX 3070 means you can play games with ray tracing turned on at 1440p or even\u00a0(sometimes) 4K resolution and still achieve playable frame rates\u2014something you definitely could not say with the RTX 2070.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nUnlike the pricier GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3090, the GeForce RTX 3070 sticks to 8GB of traditional GDDR6 memory rather than upgrading to the much faster GDDR6X. That gives it an identical memory configuration to the RTX 2070, and an inferior one to the RTX 2080 Ti.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe RTX 3080 has 10GB of faster VRAM\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$1,494.68 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\n\nThe 8GB memory buffer gives me pause for 4K gaming. It holds up just fine in most (but not all) games today with all visual options cranked to Ultra, but it may hold back performance in a couple of years, especially since the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles are both moving to 16GB of VRAM when they launch in a couple of weeks. It\u2019s hard to know what the future holds, but it\u2019s worth considering before you make your purchase. If you plan to hold onto your graphics card for four or five years, and plan to play at 4K resolution, you might want one with more memory. The 8GB VRAM capacity shouldn\u2019t be a concern for high-refresh-rate 1440p gaming, though.\nThat\u2019s not the only unknown worth considering. Nvidia\u2019s embargo for this GeForce RTX 3070 review is on October 27. Tomorrow, on October 28, AMD will reveal its hotly anticipated \u201cBig Navi\u201d Radeon RX 6000-series graphics cards, powered by the company\u2019s upgraded RDNA 2 architecture. AMD already showed an unnamed Radeon RX 6000 GPU keeping neck-and-neck with the pricier RTX 3080, but stressed it didn\u2019t say which card powered the preview. Rumors also suggest that AMD\u2019s graphics cards could pack much more memory capacity than Nvidia\u2019s RTX 30-series.\nThe looming specter of the Radeon RX 6000-series makes it hard to give the GeForce RTX 3070 a firm \u201cyes or no\u201d recommendation today. I\u2019d counsel waiting to see what AMD has to offer before making a decision.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nTake AMD\u2019s potential counterpunch out of the equation, though, and there\u2019s no question that the $500 GeForce RTX 3070 is a fantastic graphics card. It\u2019s remarkably faster than its direct RTX 2070 predecessor, delivers gaming performance effectively on a par with last generation\u2019s $1,200 flagship (and much better creative rendering performance) while drawing less power, and runs very cool without getting too noisy. Nvidia\u2019s Founders Edition design continues to rock my socks aesthetically too. I wish Nvidia included more memory capacity in the RTX 3070 for people wanting to play at 4K resolution, but other than that, there\u2019s not much to complain about. The GeForce RTX 3070 will melt your face for a stunning $700 less than you used to have to pay for this level of performance.\nBut you should still wait to see what AMD has on tap before buying one. The sky-high rating we awarded this card might not prove long-lived. Fortunately, while reviews are going live today, the RTX 3070 doesn\u2019t actually hit the streets until October 29, the day after AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 6000 reveal. We don\u2019t expect AMD to hard-launch its new-look Radeon GPUs immediately, but regardless, the timing of all this means you should be much better informed before being asked to plunk down your hard-earned cash on the RTX 3070.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBest Prices Today: GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition\t\t\n\n\n\n\nRetailer\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$520\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nView Deal \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They're packed with innovations and features that make your experiences better, and are the first to feature support for HDMI 2.1 and AV1.\nReviews are great, gamers love them, and developers are adopting RTX, NVIDIA DLSS, and NVIDIA Reflex en masse.\nTo ensure that every gamer can find the perfect GeForce RTX GPU for their needs, our partners at ASUS, Colorful, EVGA, Gainward, GALAX, GIGABYTE, Inno3D, MSI, Palit, PNY and ZOTAC are rapidly releasing custom cards. Nearly 90 models are available at the time of writing, each with different clock speeds, cooling solutions, extra features, and cool enhancements, such as clip-on fans and pop up LCD screens.\nTo help you find the ideal card for your system, we\u2019ve rounded up every model currently announced, and detailed the main features. For further info, card dimensions, feature breakdowns, power requirements, and pictures, be sure to visit the manufacturers\u2019 product pages linked below.\nNote, to improve manufacturing speeds, reduce costs, decrease e-waste, and to ensure all products are cooled to the max, manufacturers are in almost all instances using the same coolers on both their GeForce RTX 3080 and 3090 models. In cases where there are differences, they\u2019re mentioned in the descriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS\nGeForce RTX 3080s\nASUS TUF-RTX3080-10G-GAMING\nBoost Clock: 1740 MHz (OC mode)\nPower Connectors: Two 8-pin\nSize: 2.7-Slot\nMSRP: $699.99\nManufacturer\u2019s Product Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS\u2019s TUF Gaming brand gets a new design with the launch of the GeForce RTX 30 Series. Now featuring tri-axial fans, the central fan runs in the opposite direction to reduce turbulence, decrease noise and increase static airflow pressure, for an overall improved experience. And when the card\u2019s idling or at low usage levels, the fans stop, decreasing computer noise.\nTaking cues from the Founders Edition flow through design, the PCB and metal backplate feature cut outs and vents to help exhaust hot air, keeping temps lower, and allowing fans to run at slower, quieter speeds.\nThe TUF Gaming card also features a dual BIOS switch (for folks wanting to indulge in overclocking), minimal RGB, and two HDMI 2.1 outputs, as well as three DisplayPort 1.4a outputs.\nAn O10G variant (ASUS TUF-RTX3080-O10G-GAMING) ups the factory overclock to 1815 MHz (OC mode), and has a MSRP of $729.99.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS ROG-STRIX-RTX3080-10G-GAMING\nBoost Clock: 1740 MHz (OC mode)\nPower Connectors: Three 8-pin\nSize: 2.9-Slot\nMSRP: $829.99\nManufacturer\u2019s Product Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS\u2019s STRIX model increases the depth of the card to enlarge the heatsink, further improving cooling capabilities. Higher-grade components improve power delivery, and an extra 8-pin power connector increases power and overclocking headroom.\nBeneath 55C the fans sit idle; the heatsink has been machine lapped to improve contact with the GPU die, for better thermal transfer and performance; there\u2019s the same 2x HDMI 2.1, 3x DP 1.4a output setup; and a large RGB light strip stretching the length of the card illuminates its top and the fans.\nThe O10G model (ASUS ROG-STRIX-RTX3080-O10G-GAMING) increases the factory overclock to 1935 MHz (OC mode), and has a MSRP of $849.99.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3090s\nASUS TUF-RTX3090-24G-GAMING\nBoost Clock: 1725 MHz (OC mode)\nPower Connectors: Two 8-pin\nSize: 2.7-Slot\nMSRP: $1499.99\nManufacturer\u2019s Product Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe O24G variant (ASUS TUF-RTX3090-O24G-GAMING) boosts the factory overclock to 1770 MHz (OC mode), and has a MSRP of $1529.99.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS ROG-STRIX-RTX3090-24G-GAMING\nBoost Clock: 1725 MHz (OC mode)\nPower Connectors: Three 8-pin\nSize: 2.9-Slot\nMSRP: $1749.99\nManufacturer\u2019s Product Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe O24G model (ASUS ROG-STRIX-RTX3090-O24G-GAMING) raises the factory overclock to 1890 MHz (OC mode), and has a MSRP of $1799.99. And a white special edition Gundam version is in the works for Asia with a MSRP of $2530.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColorful\nGeForce RTX 3080s\nColorful GeForce RTX 3080 NB 10G-V\nBoost Clock: 1710 MHz\nPower Connectors: Two 8-pin\nSize: 3-Slot\nMSRP: $699\nManufacturer\u2019s Product Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColorful is the most popular GPU vendor in China, producing numerous models of each card for different price brackets.

These libraries use the onboard hardware to accelerate operations such as inference and decision making by trained neural networks. That means you can prototype your application on your PC and later run it on the board to see how it fares with Nvidia's CUDA-based acceleration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll you need to do is install, on your PC, the emulator package along with the Anaconda Python environment, and import the emulator directly into your Python scripts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Jetson Nano is actually quite intense and can be out of reach for some hobbyists,\u201d Huang told The Register.\n\u201cIt\u2019s $99 for the board with the CPU and GPU only. You need to add other things to it to actually make it do useful things, like getting your own HDMI display and camera. It creates quite a barrier for students. And even when you buy it, you need to set it up and get it to run on Linux.\u201d\n\nNvidia unveils $59 Nvidia Jetson Nano 2GB mini AI board, machine learning that slashes vid-chat data by 90%, and new super for Britain\nREAD MORE\nOn the subject of pricing, we note that the first generation Nvidia Jetson Nano cost $99 with 4GB of RAM with a Maxwell GPU with 128 CUDA cores to run AI workloads, and four Arm Cortex-A57 CPU cores at 1.43GHz. You can now get a $59 version with just 2GB of RAM.\nThe emulator is aimed at complete beginners who are curious about machine learning, and it specifically mimics aspects of Nvidia\u2019s JetPack SDK, which offloads work to CUDA cores in a GPU to speed up execution. Since the emulator is a Python-level simulation of the real deal \u2013 it won't run native Arm Linux binaries, for instance \u2013 it\u2019s fairly limited beyond getting your feet wet with this technology. It's good for toying with image recognition, object detection, and image segmentation, though users cannot add their own pictures to analyze, and it instead relies on images chosen by Huang. If anything, it demonstrates the limits of machine learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that I wish I had when I was just getting interested in AI,\u201d he told us. \u201cIt returns the data in a format that is exactly what a Jetson Nano would give, and you learn that nothing is 100 per cent concrete in machine learning. It\u2019s all guesswork and prediction.\n\u201cFor example, users can see that models give outputs in terms of a bounding box and a percentage. It\u2019s not totally confident that it\u2019s just detected, say, a bicycle. That\u2019s what AI is like in real-life too. It shows people the realistic boundaries of AI.\n\"Imagine something like a self-driving car: it uses an object detection model to detect other cards, road signs, so on; if an object it\u2019s looking at is obstructed by something like a tree it becomes less confident in identifying that object.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code for the emulator can be tweaked and added to. Huang said he hopes people use it and add new features, such as a virtual camera stream. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Python\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Python\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                Programming Language\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n                    COMMENTS\n            \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Python\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Python\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                Programming Language\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOpen source maintainers are drowning in junk bug reports written by AI\nPython security developer-in-residence decries use of bots that 'cannot understand code'\n\nDevops10 Dec 2024 | 91\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPython dethrones JavaScript as the most-used language on GitHub\nYearly report finds explosion of GenAI projects, new users from outside the coding community responsible for boost\n\nSoftware5 Nov 2024 | 51\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOpen source LLM tool primed to sniff out Python zero-days\nThe static analyzer uses Claude AI to identify vulns and suggest exploit code\n\nSecurity20 Oct 2024 | 7\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHow legacy storage infrastructure could endanger your future\nYour data is critical to AI success.

The benchmarks were leaked by AdoredTV and show us what to expect from the fastest workstation graphics card in NVIDIA's stack which will be replacing its Quadro RTX 6000 solution from 2018.\nNVIDIA RTX A6000 Flagship Workstation (GA102 GPU) Graphics Card's Benchmarks Leak Out, 11% Faster Than Its Predecessor\nThe NVIDIA RTX A6000 was announced earlier this month and after dropping the Tesla branding, NVIDIA has decided to drop Quadro branding from its professional workstation graphics cards too. The card will simply be called the RTX A6000 and is aimed at the workstation and content creation market segment.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB MemoryNVIDIA RTX A6000 Graphics Card Specifications\nComing to the specifications, the RTX A6000 is powered by the full GA102 GPU core with 84 SMs or 10752 CUDA cores. We don't have the exact clock speeds since NVIDIA did not share the TFLOPs or Tensor numbers for the card yet but we do know that the Quadro RTX A6000 will offer higher clocks than the A40 due to its blower-fan design which offers higher cooling performance.\n\nIn terms of memory, the NVIDIA RTX A6000 features 48 GB of GDDR6 memory. The A6000 offers 768 GB/s speeds with its 16 Gbps memory dies. The RTX A6000 cards support vGPU with various graphics configurations starting at 1 GB up to the whole 48 GB VRAM buffer. Power is provided through the new EPS 12V 8-pin connector which is featured on the back of the card and delivers up to 300W of power to the GPU. Interconnect comes in the form of the latest NVLINK which offers 112.5 GB/s (bi-directional) speeds while the native PCIe Gen 4 interface provides a 16 GB/s link. Display options include four DisplayPort 1.4 on the A6000.\nNVIDIA Workstation Graphics Card Lineup:\n\n\n\nGraphics CardRTX PRO 6000RTX 6000 AdaRTX A6000Quadro RTX 8000Quadro RTX 6000Quadro GV100\n\n\n\n\nGPUBlackwell GPUAda Lovelace GPUAmpere GPUTuring GPUTuring GPUVolta GPU\n\n\nGPU SKUGB202AD102GA102TU102TU102GV100\n\n\nGPU Process5nm5nm8nm12nm12nm12nm\n\n\nDie Size750mm2608mm2628mm\u00b2754mm\u00b2754mm\u00b2815mm\u00b2\n\n\nGPU Cores24064 Cores18176 Cores10752 Cores4608 Cores4608 Cores5120 Cores\n\n\nTensor Cores752 Cores568 Cores656 Cores576 Cores576 Cores640 Cores\n\n\nBoost ClockTBD2.50 GHz1.80 GHz1.77 GHz1.77 GHz1.62 GHz\n\n\nSingle Precision125.0 TFLOPs91.1 TFLOPs38.7 TFLOPs16.31 TFLOPs16.31 TFLOPs16.66 TFLOPs\n\n\nRay Tracing SpecTBD210.6 TFLOPs75.4 TFLOPs10 GigaRays/Sec10 GigaRays/SecN/A\n\n\nVRAM96 GB GDDR748 GB GDDR648 GB GDDR648 GB GDDR624 GB GDDR632 GB HBM2\n\n\nNVLINK VRAMN/AN/A96 GB With NVLINK96 GB With NVLINK48 GB With NVLINKN/A\n\n\nMemory Bus512-bit384-bit384-bit384-bit384-bit4096-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth1.8 TB/s960 GB/s768 GB/s672 GB/s672 GB/s870 GB/s\n\n\nTDP600W\n300W (Max-Q)300W300W~225W~200W250W\n\n\nLaunch PriceTBD$6800 US$4650 US$10000 US$6300 US$9000 US\n\n\nLaunch Date2025Q1 2023Q4 2020Q4 2018Q4 20182018\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX A6000 Graphics Card Benchmarks\nIn terms of performance, the benchmarks were reported within the SPECviewperf 2020 benchmark suite at a resolution of 3800x2120. Both the Quadro RTX 6000 and RTX A6000 were compared head on. The RTX A6000 scored a lead in almost all benchmarks with a maximum reported lead of up to 25%. On average, the RTX A6000 turned out to be 11% faster than the Quadro RTX 6000 which is a bit disappointing for a graphics card that features much better specifications and a better graphics architecture.\nNVIDIA RTX A6000 Ampere Workstation Graphics Card Benchmarks Leak vs Quadro RTX 6000 (Image Credits: AdoredTV)\nThere's no explanation why the lead is just 11% over the predecessor but it could be due to several factors that range from drivers or poor optimization in SPECviewperf for the graphics card. NVIDIA will be releasing the RTX A6000 graphics card through its partners in mid of December with a wider GPU availability planned for early next year.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n160\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Dave Altavilla is a Tech Analyst covering chips, compute and AI.Follow AuthorOct 27, 2020, 09:01am EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Founder's Edition Nestled In Its BoxDave Altavilla\nUsually, when it comes to PC gaming graphics cards, you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too. Typically, dramatically higher levels of performance command either higher power consumption or higher price points, and sometimes it\u2019s actually both. However, with the launch of the new GeForce RTX 3070 Founder\u2019s Edition, a new $499 upper-midrange offering direct from NVIDIA, the company seems focused on breaking through the perf-per-watt and perf-per-dollar watermarks it previous set with the launch of its Turing GPU architecture and GeForce RTX 20 series of cards. We\u2019ve already seen what NVIDIA\u2019s new Ampere GPU architecture can do for ultra-high-end gaming with the launch of the GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3090. However, today marks the company\u2019s official appeal to the mainstream and, from what I\u2019ve seen so far, the value proposition on a number of fronts is strong.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Versus GeForce RTX 2070 GPU ResourcesNVIDIA \nArchitecturally, NVIDIA\u2019s new GeForce RTX 3070 series of cards is a case study in silicon optimization. Compared to the previous generation RTX 2070, the new RTX 3070 offers significantly more resources with over twice the number of CUDA cores, as well as 10 more second gen RT (ray tracing) cores, 40 more texture units and 32 more ROPs (Render Output Units). Tensor cores for NVIDIA DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) and machine learning (AI) workloads are scaled back, to 184 (versus 288 in the previous gen) but NVIDIA notes Ampere\u2019s RT cores are two times more powerful than the previous generation. The RTX 3070 Founder\u2019s Edition card\u2019s power requirements scale up an additional 35 Watts, but available memory bandwidth and total available VRAM memory are essentially unchanged versus the previous generation. The card\u2019s GPU boost clock is also only slightly higher at 1725MHz (versus 1710MHz in the previous gen RTX 2070), and its GDDR6 memory clock (7Ghz) remains the same as well.\n\nForeground - GeForce RTX 3070, Background - GeForce RTX 2080Dave Altavilla\nRegardless, the performance, power and acoustic profile NVIDIA is able to strike with this new gaming GPU sets new levels of efficiency. NVIDIA claims its GeForce RTX 3070, at $499, will offer roughly equivalent performance to its previous generation GeForce RTX 2080 Ti that currently retails for no less than $1200, and occasionally best it by a hair in certain workloads. In my personal testing, and in Marco Chiappetta\u2019s deep dive at HotHardware.com, that\u2019s exactly what we found.\n\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Performance - Metro Exodus With Ray TracingHotHardware.com\nGeForce RTX 3070 Performance - Red Dead Redemption 2 - DX12HotHardware.com\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s new GeForce RTX 3070 was consistently within approximately 2 \u2013 8% of the significantly more expensive GeForce RTX 2080 Ti\u2019s performance levels. This translates to 4K resolutions with Ultra image quality settings in almost any triple-A game title, at 50 \u2013 60 FPS or higher, no matter what you throw at it. \u00a0If you tack on ray tracing with NVIDIA RTX and DLSS enabled, the gap between the RTX 3070 and RTX 2080 Ti tends to shrink even further.\nGeForce RTX 3070 Power Consumption Under LoadHotHardware.com\nWhat\u2019s perhaps more impressive for me though, is the RTX 3070\u2019s power consumption that shows the card sips roughly 60 Watts less power under load while gaming, versus a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. In fact, we measured the GeForce RTX 3070 only consuming approximately 13 Watts more under load (about 5% higher) than a previous generation GeForce RTX 2070 Super, though it offers approximately 25 \u2013 30+% better performance.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Graphics Card - Rear Side ViewDave Altavilla\nSo, in short, with the RTX 3070 we\u2019re talking roughly a 25 - 30% performance gain (or more), at a lower price point than NVIDIA\u2019s previous generation GeForce RTX 2070 Super card, while consuming only 5% more power. Or from a different perspective, with the RTX 3070, you\u2019re looking at similar performance to NVIDIA\u2019s previous generation, high-end $1200 RTX 2080 TI GPU, at a fraction of the price, and with roughly 25% less power consumption.\nHere\u2019s a quick view of some hands-on time I had with the card, as well as a few runs around the gaming benchmark test track...\nAny way you slice it, the GeForce RTX 3070 is a win-win for PC gamers. The only proverbial shoe left to drop is AMD\u2019s forthcoming \u201cBig Navi\u201d Radeon RX 6000 Series. We\u2019ll be getting a closer look at that tomorrow in fact, and I\u2019ll be keying in on performance claims intently. Stay tuned. This could quickly get even more interesting.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I cover the exciting intersection of Linux and handheld gaming.Follow AuthorOct 06, 2020, 01:39pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.Graphics cards come and graphics cards go, but when it comes to the powerhouse that is Nvidia, there is one constant: CEO Jensen Huang is a marketing genius. When the company announced a delay for its upcoming RTX 3070, it wasn\u2019t due to shortages. Nope, it was a direct response to community feedback and a move to ease consumer frustration. Well, Nvidia\u2019s got more bad news when it comes to the highly sought-after RTX 3080 and RTX 3090: don\u2019t expect buying one to be easy until 2021. But that\u2019s not remotely how Nvidia\u2019s Huang is framing it.\nThe Nvidia RTX 3080 Founders Edition graphics card: it's kinda hard to findNvidia\n\nIn a meeting with press, Mr. Huang set expectations about the availability of RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 graphics cards, explaining that the \u201cAmpere factor\u201d (Nvidia\u2019s newest GPU architecture) coupled with the holiday shopping period will make it incredibly challenging for consumers to find the aforementioned cards in stock.\nUS-LIFESTYLE-IT-CES-NVIDIAAFP via Getty Images\n\nAfter dealing with astronomical prices on Amazon and eBay and constant \u201csold out\u201d status on Nvidia.com and a variety of online shops, angry would-be customers might be inclined to point an accusatory finger at Nvidia. No no, dear reader. It\u2019s not Nvidia\u2019s fault. It\u2019s your fault!\n\n\u201cThe 3080 and 3090 have a demand issue, not a supply issue,\" says Huang. \"The demand issue is that it is much much greater than we expected \u2014 and we expected really a lot.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just brilliant. A masterclass in turning all the bad press and social media outbursts surrounding shortages into an undeniable win. A page right out of Nintendo\u2019s Wii playbook, even.\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nAnyway, a recent investigative video from Gamers Nexus found the staff speaking with various Nvidia board partners and retailers, the majority of which said the RTX 3080 drove record traffic and interest. Some shops spoke off the record, claiming that supply of the RTX 3080 was equal to or higher than their quantities for the 20 Series launch.\n\n\n\nHuang goes even further than tipping the shortage conversation on its head. He paints a vivid picture of frenzied PC enthusiasts who will stop at nothing to acquire their beloved technology: \u201cRetailers will tell you they haven't seen a phenomenon like this in over a decade of computing,\u201d Huang tells Tom\u2019s Hardware. \u201cIt hearkens back to the old days of Windows 95 and Pentium when people were just out of their minds to buy this stuff.\u201d\nThe guy is a mad genius. It won\u2019t necessarily make the cards materialize on the shelves for you to buy, but this kind of dialogue with press with only bolster the already overwhelming demand.\nFollow me on\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia opted not to use its Quadro and Tesla brands for its latest Ampere products, designed for professional graphics and compute applications.Apparently, the company decided to retire both trademarks, since many cards were overlapping with each other, and dropping them is expected to simplify Nvidia\u2019s product line-up significantly.We've built a list of the\u00a0best mobile workstations\u00a0out thereCheck out the best laptops for video editingHere are the\u00a0best workstations\u00a0you can buyThe two brandsNvidia introduced its first Quadro card in early 2000 with the release of its NV10GL-based solution (GeForce 256, the Celsius architecture), aimed at CAD/CAM and digital content creation (DCC) professionals.Because of Nvidia\u2019s fine OpenGL drivers and superior hardware, Quadro graphics cards quickly became popular in the ProViz community and drove renowned providers of professional solutions - such as 3DLabs, Appian Graphics, and FireGL - out of business.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually, Quadro became one of the most iconic brands in the graphics industry, which was then commanded by two players: Nvidia and ATI Technologies (acquired by AMD in 2006). Today, Nvidia\u2019s Quadro commands the lion\u2019s share of ProViz graphics cards market.The first Tesla products emerged seven years after the first Quadro graphics cards. The series got its name after the name of the GPU architecture that powered the first Tesla boards.Nvidia realized early enough that graphics processors could be used for general-purpose processing (GPGPU), but one of the main obstacles for popularization of GPGPU was the lack of a proper application programming interface (API).Are you a pro?

CUDA rapidly gained recognition among GPGPU enthusiasts in mid-2000s and eventually Tesla became a workhorse for numerous Top 500 supercomputers.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s Tesla managed to outlive numerous brands that were aimed at the same GPGPU and HPC markets, including AMD\u2019s FireStream and FirePro Server-series as well as Intel\u2019s Xeon Phi accelerators.Differentiation and confusionIn a bid to differentiate its Quadro and Tesla cards from consumer-oriented GeForce and Titan boards, Nvidia disabled certain graphics and compute functionality on the latter and supplied the former with drivers certified by ISVs of professional applications.But on the hardware level both Quadro and Tesla were similar as they both used \u2018full\u2019 GPUs with all capabilities enabled. Therefore, it was rather confusing when Nvidia recommended engineers use Quadros for visualization and Teslas for simulation (something that happened back in the days).\u00a0At some point, Nvidia\u2019s Quadro and Tesla boards started to overlap and caused even more confusion both externally and internally. Quadro cards are actively cooled and can be used in a desktop to run neural network prototyping even though they are positioned for CAD/CAM and DCC applications. Meanwhile, passively-cooled Tesla V100 can provide a virtual Quadro instance for VDI applications even though it is meant for computing.In a bid to avoid confusion in the future, Nvidia plans to retire its Quadro and Tesla brands and cover both professional graphics and compute markets using just one brand, its own name. This underlines how flexible Nvidia\u2019s solutions are potentially allows Nvidia to reduce the number of SKUs it has by eliminating overlapping products.Simple enough?Nvidia is striving to simplify its portfolio, but there's still plenty of room for confusion.The company has the\u00a0Nvidia A100 that is designed purely for computing, is based on the GA100 GPU and comes in mezzanine board and add-in-card form-factors.It also has the\u00a0Nvidia A40\u00a0product that is designed for virtual workstations as well as server-based compute workloads and carries the GA102 GPU. Finally, there is the\u00a0Nvidia RTX A6000\u00a0, a workstation-grade card powered by the GA102.\u00a0\u00a0At this point, RTX points to a client product, whereas the lack of any letters points to a datacenter product. Meanwhile, Nvidia also has\u00a0DGX A100\u00a0and\u00a0EGX A100\u00a0products that are designed for different applications, but which are still datacenter-grade devices.\u00a0But when it comes to consumer-grade client PCs, many people and even stores omit the word GeForce when they talk about Nvidia\u2019s gaming cards. Therefore, they call the latest boards as \u2018Nvidia RTX 3090\u2019, \u2018Nvidia RTX 3080\u2019 as well as \u2018Nvidia RTX 3070\u2019 and these products can eventually be confused with lower-end professional \u2018Nvidia RTX A-series\u2019 cards (think Nvidia RTX A4000).\u00a0Of course, only time will tell whether many people will be confused with the Nvidia\u2019s new naming scheme that omits Quadro and Tesla, yet keeps GeForce, RTX, DGX, and introduces EGX. The company believes it has made life easier for its datacenter and workstation customers, while remaining consistent for gamers with client PCs.This super-powered workstation could be the biggest rival to Nvidia A100Source:\u00a0AnandTech\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationAnton Shilov is the News Editor at AnandTech, Inc.

Then a team of NVIDIA simulation experts combined the best tools from multiple industries to let the researchers see their data in a whole new way.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been repeatedly amazed with the unprecedented scale of scientific collaborations,\u201d said Zimmerman, a postdoc fellow at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, which hosts one of eight labs that keep the Folding@home research network humming.\nAs a result, Zimmerman and colleagues published a paper on BioRxiv, showing images of 17 weak spots in coronavirus proteins that antiviral drug makers can attack. And the high-res simulation of the work continues to educate researchers and the public alike about the bad actor behind the pandemic.\n\u201cWe are in a position to make serious headway towards understanding the molecular foundations of health and disease,\u201d he added.\nAn Antiviral Effort Goes Viral\nIn mid-March, the Folding@home team put many long-running projects on hold to focus on studying key proteins behind COVID. They issued a call for help, and by the end of the month the network swelled to become the world\u2019s first exascale supercomputer, fueled in part by more than 280,000 NVIDIA GPUs.\nResearchers harnessed that power to search for vulnerable moments in the rapid and intricate dance of the folding proteins, split-second openings drug makers could exploit. Within three months, computers found many promising motions that traditional experiments could not see.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve simulated nearly the entire proteome of the virus and discovered more than 50 new and novel targets to aid in the design of antivirals. We have also been simulating drug candidates in known targets, screening over 50,000 compounds to identify 300 drug candidates,\u201d Zimmerman said.\nThe coronavirus uses cunning techniques to avoid human immune responses, like the Spike protein keeping its head down in a closed position. With the power of an exaflop at their disposal, researchers simulated the proteins folding for a full tenth of a second, orders of magnitude longer than prior work.\nThough the time sampled was relatively short, the dataset to enable it was vast.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone consists of 442,881 atoms in constant motion. In just 1.2 microseconds, it generates about 300 billion timestamps, freeze frames that researchers must track.\nCombined with the two dozen other coronavirus proteins they studied, Folding@home amassed the largest collection of molecular simulations in history.\nOmniverse Simulates a Coronavirus Close Up\nThe dataset \u201cended up on my desk when someone asked what we could do with it using more than the typical scientific tools to really make it shine,\u201d said Peter Messmer, who leads a scientific visualization team at NVIDIA.\nUsing Visual Molecular Dynamics, a standard tool for scientists, he pulled the data into NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform built for collaborative 3D graphics and simulation soon to be in open beta. Then the magic happened.\nThe team connected Autodesk\u2019s Maya animation software to Omniverse to visualize a camera path, creating a fly-through of the proteins\u2019 geometric intricacies. The platform\u2019s core technologies such as NVIDIA Material Definition Language (MDL) let the team give tangible surface properties to molecules, creating translucent or glowing regions to help viewers see critical features more clearly.\nWith Omniverse, \u201cresearchers are not confined to scientific visualization tools, they can use the same tools the best artists and movie makers use to deliver a cinematic rendering \u2014 we\u2019re bringing these two worlds together,\u201d Messmer said.\n\nSimulation Experts Share Their Story Live\nThe result was a visually stunning presentation where each spike on a coronavirus protein is represented with more than 1.8 million triangles, rendered by a bank of NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\nZimmerman and Messmer will co-host a live Q&A technical session Oct. 8 at 11 AM PDT to discuss how they developed the simulation that packs nearly 150 million triangles to represent a millisecond in a protein\u2019s life.\nThe work validates the mission behind Omniverse to create a universal virtual environment that spans industries and disciplines. We\u2019re especially proud to see the platform serve science in the fight against the pandemic.\nThe experience made Zimmerman \u201cincredibly optimistic about the future of science. NVIDIA GPUs have been instrumental in generating our datasets, and now those GPUs running Omniverse are helping us see our work in a new and vivid way,\u201d he said.\nVisit NVIDIA\u2019s COVID-19 Research Hub to learn more about how AI and GPU-accelerated technology continues to fight the pandemic. And watch NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang describe in a portion of his GTC keynote below how Omniverse is playing a role.\n\n\n\nCategories: Graphics VirtualizationTags: 3D | COVID-19 | GTC 2020 | NVIDIA RTX | Omniverse | Science | Scientific Visualization | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Head to a near-future London oppressed by authoritarian opportunists and recruit the city\u2019s citizens to join the DedSec Resistance. Each has different skills, allowing you to traverse and tackle missions in numerous ways.\nOn PC, the open-world game is enhanced with ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS, higher detail levels, ultra-widescreen support, and multi-monitor support. When RTX is enabled, London\u2019s streets, buildings, vehicles and famous sights will feature realistic opaque and transparent reflections, and performance will be boosted by DLSS, our AI rendering technology that\u2019s powered by dedicated Tensor Core processors, found exclusively on GeForce RTX GPUs.\nTake a first look in our new ray tracing trailer, captured on the GeForce RTX 3080 with DLSS enabled:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-Time Ray-Traced Reflections\nWatch Dogs: Legion makes extensive use of real-time ray-traced reflections, replacing and complementing cube maps and screen space reflections to bring dynamic high-detail reflections to windows, vehicles, wet surfaces, bodies of water, buildings, and all other suitably reflective objects and game details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith three detail levels, ray tracing can be scaled across configurations, enabling all GeForce RTX gamers to enjoy the increased detail, fidelity, realism and immersion that we\u2019ve worked with Ubisoft to bring to Watch Dogs: Legion.\nAs the detail level is raised, additional rays are traced, helping to display more detail, and the maximum distance rays travel is increased, enabling distant game elements to be accurately reflected. As the distance from the camera increases further still, ray-traced reflections smoothly blend with the game\u2019s rasterized reflection techniques to give players the best possible experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enable Ray-Traced Reflections in Watch Dogs: Legion, download and install our latest Game Ready Driver, the latest version of the game from Uplay, and the latest Windows 10 updates. Enter the game\u2019s video options, head to the \u201cQuality\u201d tab, switch to DirectX 12 if currently using DirectX 11, scroll down the list of options, and select a Ray-Traced Reflections detail level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Dogs: Legion is the first open world game to launch with ray traced reflections, perfectly demonstrating the advantages of ray tracing for similar titles, which have long struggled with immersion-breaking cubemaps on the hundreds of thousands of windows found throughout each virtual city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS\nNVIDIA DLSS, is our critically acclaimed AI rendering technology that boosts frame rates with uncompromised image quality via dedicated AI processing Tensor Cores found exclusively on GeForce RTX GPUs.\nIn Watch Dogs: Legion, DLSS accelerates frame rates by up to 2X at 4K using the recommended DLSS Performance mode, enabling the GeForce RTX 3080 to run at playable frame rates at 4K Ultra with ray tracing. And with the new Ultra Performance mode, you can play at 8K on the GeForce RTX 3090.\nTo enable DLSS, simply scroll down the list of settings in Options > Video > Quality, and select a DLSS mode. Quality is recommended for 1920x1080; Balanced for 2560x1440; Performance for 3840x2160; and Ultra Performance for 7680x4320.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more on 8K Ultra Performance mode, check out our GeForce RTX 3090 8K HDR Gaming article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Dogs: Legion RTX System Requirements\nIf you\u2019re wondering how much horsepower is required to enjoy Watch Dogs: Legion with these features enabled, Ubisoft has compiled a handy chart, giving you all necessary info in a single glimpse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, our new GeForce RTX 3070 will deliver a RTX ON experience at 1440p with DLSS. While the GeForce RTX 3080 let\u2019s users crank up ray tracing to Ultra at 4K with great frame rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Dogs: Legion Game Ready Driver \u2013 Download Now\nTo ensure you receive the highest levels of performance, and the best possible overall experience, be sure to download and install our new Watch Dogs: Legion Game Ready Driver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou grab our new driver direct from GeForce Experience, where you\u2019ll also find Optimal Playable Settings for your system, helping you automatically configure the game\u2019s many settings with a single click.\nAnd using ShadowPlay, accessible via Alt+Z, you can record gameplay at high resolutions, with HDR enabled. Edit and trim within the Alt+Z GeForce Experience Share interface, and upload straight to YouTube and social media to show friends and fans your best Watch Dogs: Legion moments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce NOW - Play Watch Dogs: Legion Now\nIf you don\u2019t own a ray tracing-capable PC, you can still experience the beauty of ray-traced Watch Dogs: Legion, with DLSS, on GeForce NOW, NVIDIA's cloud game streaming service.

According to the rumor, NVIDIA has told its AIB partners to cancel all plans for the GeForce RTX 3080 20 GB and GeForce RTX 3070 16 GB graphics cards.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 20 GB & GeForce RTX 3070 16 GB Graphics Cards Canned, Alleges Rumor\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 20 GB and GeForce RTX 3070 16 GB did exist and there were plans to launch these cards at some point in late 2020. However, the latest developments & news from AIBs that the source has received suggests that these two graphics cards are more or less canned & will not see a launch this year.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSRumors and speculation for the doubled memory GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards picked up the heat soon before the cards were officially introduced. There were reports of multiple variants which include the GeForce RTX 3080 20 GB, GeForce RTX 3070 Ti 16 GB, and the GeForce RTX 3070 16 GB to launch later this year to tackle the AMD Radeon RX 6000 series graphics cards with double the memory.\n\nHowever, the latest information suggests that this won't be the case anymore. The exact reason for the cancellation is unknown but there could be two main reasons. We know that NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 series lineup currently has a tight stock due to huge demand which NVIDIA is unable to full-fill.\nNVIDIA's CEO himself stated that the GeForce RTX 30 series supply issues will be resolved by the next year (2021). However, at the same time, NVIDIA may have decided to just move ahead with the lineup they have and adjust their GPU stock to them rather than the higher-memory variants. So in a way, NVIDIA is focused on delivering its current products rather than launching more products in their stack which they cannot fulfill in demand till 2021.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti listed in GPU Support List for PSUs by SilverStone. (Image Credits: Momomo_US)\nEven NVIDIA's integration partners had these cards popping up and listing various times in their catalogs. The most recent one was the SilverStone GPU support list for its PSUs which clearly listed the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti but was later removed. The partners were provided plans for the GeForce RTX 3080 20 GB, GeForce RTX 3070 Ti 16 GB, and GeForce RTX 3070 16 GB graphics cards but are now seemingly abandoned with only traces like this left.\nThe other reason and this is a more crucial factor is the availability of GDDR6X memory. Unlike GDDR6, Micron is the only memory manufacturer which is producing GDDR6X memory and the reports have suggested poor availability of GDDR6X DRAM for GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3090 graphics cards. The GeForce RTX 3070 may not be affected as much as the higher end cards since it relies on GDDR6 memory and that is made by several manufacturers including Samsung and SK Hynix.\nhttps://twitter.com/KOMACHI_ENSAKA/status/1318968680772874240\nKomachi states in his tweet that the issue is more so to do with Samsung's 8nm process node yields rather than GDDR6X memory availability. This is obviously up for debate but it looks like NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3080 20 GB and GeForce RTX 3070 16 GB, which many users were waiting to get, won't see the light of day. There's a slight possibility that we may see higher memory variants next year under a new branding and name but for now, it looks like the cards are done and dusted.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n64\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n41\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n24\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n20\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\n\n\n17\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Features like DLSS and ray tracing have also been heavily pushed, and today we'll be checking out whether Reflex is something you should care about.\nReflex is currently split into two similar, but separate features. One is just called Nvidia Reflex, and it's the feature you'll find added to games with the goal of improving latency. If you fire up a game's settings and see the option to turn on or off Nvidia Reflex, this is what we're talking about.\n\nThe second is Nvidia's Reflex Latency Analyzer, which is a collection of hardware and software tools you can use to analyze game and total system latency. The goal is to provide latency information to gamers, so they can optimize their system for the best responsiveness.\nIn this article we plan to cover both. First we'll look at how well Reflex works across some of the supported games so far like Fortnite, Valorant, and Call of Duty Modern Warfare - in a variety of conditions. Then we'll take a look at some of Nvidia's Reflex Latency Analyzer tools including the GeForce Experience overlay and the new monitors with built in latency tools.\nWe have the Asus ROG Swift PG259QNR on hand, so we'll take a brief look at what's on offer.\n\nLatency is a complicated matter, so we're going to break it down to the simplest terms possible. Existing low latency modes are driver based, including Nvidia's Ultra Low Latency mode (otherwise known as NULL), as well as the regular low latency mode. They work by adjusting the way the GPU buffers frames, usually reducing the number of frames in the buffer, and by modifying the render queue. However, as they are driver based, features like NULL only work with older DirectX 11 titles. DirectX 12 games, which are becoming more popular, have full control over most aspects to queuing and buffering, so driver modes are not compatible.\nReflex is the next step for low latency modes. This is a feature that is built into the game with the goal of further reducing latency, beyond just modifying queues and buffers. Nvidia is being a bit cagy over exactly how it works, but it can be summarized as this: through Reflex, your Nvidia GPU tells the game engine what it is doing, and the game engine responds by looking at this info, and doing its work just before the GPU is ready to render. This means the game engine is doing just-in-time processing, which allows it to grab the freshest inputs from your system, and deliver that to your display with the least latency.\n\nIt's only possible to get this latency reduction when there is good communication between the GPU, CPU and game engine, which is why something like Reflex is required. You can think of this a bit like a kitchen at a restaurant, you don't want to have your steak cooked well before the chips are ready or it'll get cold; good communication in the kitchen allows both to be ready at the same time for the freshest, hottest and tastiest meal. That's what Reflex is doing, but with your game.\n\nDue to this, you might be able to realize why Reflex requires game integration, and why it's exclusive to Nvidia's GeForce 900 series GPUs and newer. It won't work as a driver solution as it needs deep integration with the game engine, and it also requires knowledge of how the GPU is operating.\n\nThe Nvidia GPU driver provides that information and apparently it goes beyond just the regular telemetry that performance overlays can access. So this isn't an open solution, it doesn't work with AMD GPUs, and it requires game-level integration. But, it doesn't require new RTX 30 GPUs, so it works with older GeForce cards from the past few generations which will let you access Reflex.\n\nTime to look at how much of a benefit we actually get from Reflex. Our test bed will be performing some CPU-limited testing today at 1080p, so we're using a Core i9-10900K test rig for all benchmarking. The system has been equipped with 16GB of DDR4-3200 memory and the MSI Z490 Unify motherboard.\n\nFor Reflex testing we're using Nvidia's LDAT or Latency Display Analysis Tool, which is essentially a photodetector you can place on the screen to measure game latency. This is a better version of the tools we were already using for latency measurements, which were also based on a photodetector, and we've confirmed it to be very accurate. Later we'll be exploring the Reflex Latency Analyzer, but for now, we're measuring total system latency from mouse click, to action on screen, using LDAT.\nBenchmarks\nWe wanted to start off by looking at how Reflex improves latency when we are gaming with the maximum in-game quality settings. This is where Nvidia says we should see the most benefit; the more GPU bound you are, the more likely Reflex will deliver a latency improvement.\nFirst up we are testing in Fortnite's Creative mode, using DirectX 12, the Epic Preset and maximum ray tracing. we're also using the DLSS Performance mode and a GeForce RTX 3090 FE GPU, with the display being a 4K 144Hz panel with adaptive sync enabled, the LG 27GN950 in this instance.\n\nAt 4K, we saw the most benefit from using Reflex, and in fact the gains are quite impressive. Total system latency was around 104ms with Reflex disabled, but when turning on the feature, we saw latency halved to under 50ms. There wasn't much difference between Reflex On, and Reflex On + Boost - which keeps the GPU clocked up high to further improve latency - but with either Reflex mode we saw a significant latency improvement. In contrast, Nvidia's Ultra Low Latency Mode doesn't improve the experience, as NULL doesn't work with DirectX 12 titles.\nAt 1440p, gains were still present, but not as significant as 4K. While at 4K we were gaming around 45 FPS, reducing the resolution to 1440p saw us jump up to 85 FPS. We are no longer seeing half the latency with Reflex enabled, but a 12ms reduction is still decent and something that we could notice while gaming. This is all with G-Sync enabled and Vsync disabled, so we're getting the optimal Vsync related latency.\nThere are also gains to be had at 1080p, with about a 10ms improvement in our testing. Given the RTX 3090 is quite powerful, still being able to achieve better latency at 1080p with Reflex enabled is decent. But the largest gains, and the most notable improvement in responsiveness, was observed when we're more GPU bound at below 60 FPS.\n\nHowever you aren't always going to be GPU bound. The RTX 3090 makes easy work of Valorant for example, running at over 600 FPS in our test area at all resolutions with the Core i9-10900K. It's here that, even when playing on the maximum quality settings, that Reflex delivers next to no improvement. With latency around the 16ms mark in all situations, which is very responsive, there isn't much else Reflex can do in terms of optimization.\n\nWe also saw less of a gain when playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's Warzone mode. Even when playing at 4K, using the highest settings with ray tracing enabled, Reflex only provided about a 3ms reduction to input latency with all of the resolutions we tested. There was a consistent gain, but with this sort of GPU power at hand, the improvement wasn't in the same league as with Fortnite.\n\nWhile you do clearly need to be GPU bound to see large improvements with Reflex, and that isn't as possible with the RTX 3090, if you have an entry-level GPU like the GeForce GTX 1650 Super, you are much more likely to get a latency improvement using the Reflex mode...\n\nIn Fortnite, with the Epic preset but without ray tracing as the 1650 Super doesn't support it, Reflex provided a similar benefit to what we saw with the 3090 at 4K, but this time at 1440p and 1080p. In both of these modes, the game is pretty GPU bound and runs below 100 FPS on our test island. Here we see Reflex halving the input latency, which makes quite a significant difference to gameplay on these systems where you still want all the visual effects cranked up.\n\nWe also saw a latency improvement in Valorant using this class of GPU. We're no longer seeing over 600 FPS, in fact at 4K the 1650 Super is more like an 80 FPS GPU using the highest quality settings. In this situation, we saw a healthy 19ms latency improvement, which is a significant jump in this sort of title.\nGains were more modest at 1440p, with a 9ms drop to latency, and at 1080p, with just a 6ms drop. But still, in these conditions it doesn't appear the game is fully GPU bound, so we don't see a situation like with the 3090 where Reflex is useless.\n\nCall of Duty Warzone consistently delivered the least impressive latency improvements. Even with a GTX 1650 Super, which runs below 60 FPS at 1440p with high quality settings, we only saw about a 10-12ms improvement to system latency when enabling the feature, and this was at both 1440p and 1080p. To me this was pretty hard to notice, especially with a frame rate around 50 FPS which isn't the most responsive, but for more highly tuned competitive gamers this might be a significant difference.\nIn general though, our testing shows that when you are playing on high to ultra quality settings, and you're mostly GPU bound, Reflex will provide a latency improvement, especially in titles like Fortnite. The gains are going to be more pronounced on lower end cards as your system in general will be more GPU limited, and that seems to be key for Reflex: the more your CPU is sitting idle, the more potential there is for a latency improvement. We would expect that on systems with a weaker CPU, like say a Ryzen 5 1600, you'd get the reverse effect and there would be less of a gain.\nWith this in mind we wanted to test Reflex with competitive esports settings. Most of the time if you're a serious competitive gamer, you'll be playing using mostly low settings. This allows you to achieve a higher frame rate, which inherently lowers total latency, but it can also often make spotting enemies easier without the distractions of shadows and other effects. So if you've already done a lot to optimize your system for latency, you're getting very high frame rates and are playing at 1080p, what can Reflex do for you?\n\nThe answer to that is... practically nothing. We're not even using a high-end GPU for this testing. This is a system with a Core i9-10900K to give us the least amount of CPU bottlenecking and an RTX 2060 GPU. We've hooked it up to the Asus PG259QNR as well, to get that sweet 360Hz goodness.\n\nIn Fortnite, using the lowest settings, no ray tracing, the DLSS Performance mode and epic draw distance, we were able to achieve around 400 FPS in the test area. At this sort of super high frame rate, latency was already very low without Reflex, at just 14ms of total system latency. Reflex did not improve this result, as we are fully CPU bound.\n\nSame story in Valorant. we were achieving between 600 and 1000 FPS using the game's lowest settings, and latency was consistently around the 13ms mark whether Reflex was enabled or disabled. The \"Boost\" mode hasn't done much so far, even though it's supposed to help a bit with latency in more CPU bound situations.\n\nAnd then we also have Warzone, where there was a small latency improvement of around 4ms when using Reflex in combination with the lowest settings. However in this title with the lowest settings, we did appear to be GPU bound rather than CPU bound, so we'd expect results to fall more in line with the other titles if we tested with a higher end GPU like an RTX 3090 using the lowest possible settings.\n\nWhat's also important to note is that the gains you see from Reflex are independent of your monitor's refresh rate when gaming with Vsync disabled, as you should be for the lowest latency possible. For example, in Fortnite with a 1080p display, Reflex consistently gave a 9ms improvement in our testing across the board with the RTX 2060 using epic settings, at the same frame rate, regardless if the monitor was set to 360Hz or 60Hz. The main difference is that you'll see additional latency added at lower refresh rates, so it's always better to be gaming at the highest possible refresh rate\nA lot of these latency results fall in line with what we've seen previously from latency-reduction modes. When GPU bound, especially when heavily GPU bound, there is often scope to reduce system latency. The extent of the reduction will depend on the game and how it works, but when CPU bound, your system is basically flat out and you won't see much, if any, of a latency improvement. The closer to being CPU bound you are, which generally correlates with higher frame rates, the less useful Reflex is.\nReflex Latency Analyzer\nBefore giving our final thoughts on Nvidia's Reflex, it's worth going through the tools Nvidia are providing through their Reflex Latency Analyzer. While the LDAT tool we used for our Reflex analysis isn't available to end users or buyers, every aspect of the Reflex Latency Analyzer will be available, though some elements have a cost.\nSome of the Reflex tools are available to use without any specific latency hardware. In some Reflex-enabled games like Fortnite and Valorant, you can enable a latency overlay in the game which shows various metrics. In both cases we see what's known as \"game to render\" latency \u2013 in other words, the time it takes from when the game receives an input, to when the frame is output to the display. This is not total system latency - which also includes the latencies from your display and input peripherals - but for a lot of people this game to render latency will be a good enough metric for optimizing latency.\n\nYou can also use GeForce Experience's new latency performance overlay, however this only shows GPU-side latencies such as render latency, not the full game to render latency, so its usefulness without additional Reflex Latency Analyzer hardware is limited.\nIn games like Fortnite though, you can use the built in tool, mess around with your settings, and see how that impacts the total latency number presented.\n\n\nFor hardcore enthusiasts, Nvidia is offering a hardware ecosystem in conjunction with various partners that allows for further, more in-depth latency analysis.\nThis comes in the form of two components: the Reflex Latency Analyzer built into some displays, and Reflex Latency Analyzer Compatible mice. We could spend a ton of time detailing how all of this stuff works, but to be honest that would take a while and wouldn't be that interesting, so if you're interested in the nitty gritty details you can read Nvidia's documentation on it.\n\nIt basically boils down to this: when you have both a Reflex Latency Analyzer equipped monitor like the Asus ROG Swift PG259QNR and a Reflex Latency Analyzer Compatible mouse, like the Asus ROG Chakram Core, you can measure total system latency. This includes not just the game to render latency (like Fortnite reports), but mouse latency and display latency as well. This gives us the most valuable and accurate latency information possible.\n\n\n\n\nIt takes a bit of time to set up and it's really only suitable for benchmark conditions - it won't give you good readouts in general gameplay as you have to position the capture area for the latency analyzer over a muzzle flash, for example, and that could change in dynamic gameplay.\nBut with this hardware in conjunction with the GeForce Experience Latency overlay, you can benchmark total system latency and optimize your configuration around that metric.\n\nGenerally speaking we found the Reflex Latency Analyzer to be within 1ms of LDAT, so it's a pretty accurate tool, although it pulls data from the G-Sync module's frame buffer as opposed to getting a reading directly from the display's pixels.\nIn that sense LDAT is the more complete tool. But for most people, the Reflex Latency Analyzer will be accurate enough and certainly much better than any other tool currently available that's this easy to use.\n\nThe Asus PG259QNR is also just a Reflex Latency Analyzer version of the PG259QN that we already reviewed recently, an excellent 1080p 360Hz display. We believe there are other monitors coming from Acer and Alienware that will support the tool.\n\nWhat We Learned\nNvidia's Reflex ecosystem is a tale of two separate, but related entities. On the one hand you have the Reflex mode integrated into games, and on the other you have the Reflex Latency Analyzer. You could argue these are designed for two different groups of people, with little crossover.\nThe Reflex mode found in supported games is most useful in GPU limited situations. In these competitive titles, most of the time you'll be GPU limited when you're either playing on ultra quality settings, using a lower-end GPU, or some combination of both. The more CPU limited your system becomes, and the higher the frame rate pushes, the less useful Reflex is for enhancing system latency.\n\nThis makes Reflex a useful feature primarily for casual competitive gamers; the people that want to play Fortnite but don't want to sacrifice visual quality, don't want to play at 1080p or just don't have the most powerful hardware. Turn on Reflex, your system latency will drop, and that improvement to responsiveness might make you a bit better at the game.\nOn the flip side, Reflex is next to useless for competitive gamers. If you're the sort of person that already has a latency optimized setup - so you're already playing at 1080p on powerful hardware with low settings to ensure you're getting the highest possible frame rate - Reflex will have no benefit whatsoever. That's because you're almost certainly CPU limited, and Reflex is ineffective in those situations. This holds true even in situations with mid-range GPUs like an RTX 2060 in titles like Fortnite and Valorant when gaming at low quality settings.\n\nThere's no downside to having Reflex enabled in those situations, but don't expect to see even lower latencies when you are already in a fully optimized environment. This is really for the casual gamers that don't want to sacrifice ray tracing, or 4K resolutions while gaming, but still want a nice and responsive experience. And that's fine.\nThen the Reflex Latency Analyzer is for serious competitive gamers that want to do everything possible to reduce system latency. Having the tools available to do that are neat and potentially useful for tweaking hardware setups and game configurations, but realistically this isn't something a casual gamer will be doing.\n\nWe can see the Reflex feature in games being widely used, but the Reflex Latency Analyzer and compatible mice seems like a really niche feature that probably won't get much traction outside a very small user base. With that in mind, we do have question marks over how long Nvidia will support something like this, which in turn may throw up question marks over whether it's worth investing in Latency Analyzer hardware. It's certainly neat and works well, but without that broad user base, we can see it getting the chop after just a few years.\nThe other question we're sure some of you will be asking is: is it worth buying an Nvidia GPU over the competition specifically for Reflex? After all, this is being pushed heavily as the next best thing, similar to how Nvidia was positioning DLSS and ray tracing with Turing GPUs.\nWe guess that's part of the good news. If you're already in the Nvidia ecosystem, Reflex works with GTX 900 series GPUs and newer, so don't go out and feel that you have to upgrade to Ampere to get Reflex.\n\nAt this point, we don't think it's worth considering Reflex into your buying decision. Clearly, this isn't a DLSS 1.0 situation where the feature is kind of useless. Reflex works properly and can give you a latency improvement, but it's restricted to a small handful of settings right now. You have to be playing one of the few supported titles, and be playing in a GPU limited situation to see the benefit. Also, not all games benefit in the same way, with some titles giving large gains and others less noticeable ones.\nIf the only thing you do is play Fortnite, or Valorant, or Apex Legends, then by all means, buying a GeForce GPU might be the best way to go. But if you're one of the many gamers that plays a variety of titles, or other competitive games for that matter, then like DLSS or ray tracing we think it's better to view this as a neat bonus feature for now. If the ecosystem continues to grow and Reflex becomes a key feature in most competitive titles, then maybe that will change, but for now that ecosystem is too small to be a must have feature.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090 on Amazon\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 on Amazon\n\nIntel Core i9-10900K on Amazon\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 3950X on Amazon\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 3900X on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 11\n\n\n Got something to say?

Unity ArtEngine, an AI-assisted solution for artists, uses NVIDIA GPUs to do the hard, time-consuming and repetitive work that helps creatives save time in their design process.\nArtEngine is developed by Artomatix, a company that won the $100,000 Early Stage Challenge at NVIDIA\u2019s Emerging Companies Summit in 2015. Now part of Unity, Artomatix is bringing AI-assisted artistry to content creation workflows.\nWith NVIDIA GPU-powered AI supporting Unity ArtEngine, artists can reduce model texture time and quickly produce unique variations of textured models.\nAI Drives New Processing of Textures\nOne of the greater challenges when creating textures for virtual materials is to make them tile seamlessly, so that the texture can cover large surface areas. Previously, this work had to be done manually \u2014 artists would take great care to tile surfaces and make sure there weren\u2019t too many noticeable seams or patterns when the texture is repeated.\nUsing GPU-powered AI, ArtEngine\u2019s material synthesis delivers a fast, flexible way to speed up the creative 3D artist toolkit without taking control away from the artist. ArtEngine introduces the Example-Based Workflow to help automate and accelerate photoconversion to physically based rendered materials, including up-resing, deblur, seam removal, unwarping, color matching and more.\nThis allows designers to create textures in a fraction of the time, so they can focus more on developing multiple variations of a texture and quickly delivering the best quality.\n\u201cIf you could automate even 5 percent of the 3D content creation pipeline, you\u2019d be onto something huge,\u201d said Mike Oliver, technical art director at Crystal Dynamics. \u201cAs it stands, I feel the Artomatix Suite will go well beyond this potential. This is a game-changer.\u201d\nAI-powered seam removal for incredible tiling power.\n\u201cSpeaking as a texture creator, ArtEngine truly is a godsend,\u201d said Eduard Caliman, a 3D visualization artist. \u201cThe texture synthesis features allow me to speed up the processing of my raw scans by at least 50 percent.\u201d\nWith ArtEngine, removing seams in tileable textures is just the start. Users can balance the inputs, create variations, turn a single input image into several output maps for physically based rendering, and even remove shadows from images.\nNew vMaterials Release Adds More Content for Creators\nArtEngine isn\u2019t the only tool that\u2019s helping users create materials in design and graphics.\nThe latest release of vMaterials, NVIDIA\u2019s materials catalog, offers over 2,000 real-world materials \u2014 including metallic chameleon car paint, weathered concrete, clinker brick, roughly woven cotton and more. NVIDIA used ArtEngine in the creation of the vMaterial libraries and believe it can be an indispensable tool to further enhance professional artist texturing pipelines.\n\nUnity ArtEngine is the first tool of a full suite of tools from the Artomatix organization at Unity, set to release next year.\nGet a free 14-day trial of ArtEngine and learn more about the latest version of vMaterials.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Creators \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

To help your calls look and sound better, NVIDIA has unveiled an AI-powered suite of tools that video call app developers can tap into.NVIDIA Maxine powers a range of features including resolution upscaling and background noise removal. It can adjust your camera\u2019s focus to place you in the center of the frame, reorientate your face and add virtual backgrounds. You can also have an AI avatar replace your face on calls, while Maxine offers real-time closed captioning and translation through NVIDIA Jarvis.The company says Maxine\u2019s video compression can reduce the bandwidth needed for calls by 90 percent versus H.264 compression. As such, video calls could vacuum up much less of your data in the near future.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementMaxine uses NVIDIA Tensor Core GPU acceleration and it runs in the cloud. So, you won\u2019t exactly need one of NVIDIA\u2019s latest graphics cards to harness these features if your video calling app of choice enables them. They should work on any device.Zoom, Skype, Microsoft Teams and Google Meet have some of these features already, but tapping into the Maxine platform could help them improve those functions. AI developers, startups, its software partners and makes of video calling apps can now apply for early access to Maxine.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

AP-HP, which partners with seven universities, already had the ability to analyze large amounts of medical data. It had previously created dashboards that combined cancer cases and geodata. So, it was logical to pursue and extend its role during the pandemic.\nThe expected volume of COVID-19 data and geodata would probably have tested AP-HP\u2019s data crunching capacity. To mitigate this critical challenge, the hospital\u2019s information systems administrators turned to Kinetica, a provider of streaming data warehouses and real-time analytics and a member of the NVIDIA Inception program for AI startups.\nKinetica\u2019s offering harnesses the power of NVIDIA GPUs to quickly convert case location data into usable intelligence. And in the fight against COVID-19, speed is everything.\nThe project team also used NVIDIA RAPIDS to speed up the machine learning algorithms integrated into the platform. RAPIDS accelerates analytics and data science pipelines on NVIDIA GPUs by taking advantage of GPU parallelism and high memory bandwidth.\n\u201cHaving the ability to perform this type of analysis in real time is really important during a pandemic,\u201d said Hector Countouris, the project lead at AP-HP. \u201cAnd more data is coming.\u201d\nAnalyzing COVID Contact Data\nWhat Countouris and his colleagues are most focused on is using COVID-related geodata to understand where virus \u201chot spots\u201d are and the dynamic of the outbreak. Looking for cluster locations can help decision-making at the district or region level.\nIn addition, they\u2019re looking at new signals to improve early detection of COVID patients. This includes working with data from other regional agencies.\nIf patients are diagnosed with COVID, they\u2019ll be asked by the relevant agencies via a phone call about their recent whereabouts and contacts to help with contact tracing. This is the first time that a wide range of data from different partners in the Paris area will be integrated to allow for contact tracing and timely alerts about a potential exposure. The result will be a newfound ability to see how clusters of COVID-19 cases evolve.\n\u201cWe hope that in the near future we will be able to follow how a cluster evolves in real time,\u201d said Countouris.\nThe goal is to enable public health decision-makers to implement prevention and control measures and assess their effectiveness. The data can also be integrated with other demographic data to study the viral spread and its possible dependency on socio-economics and other factors.\nAttacking Bottlenecks with GPUs\nPrior to engaging with Kinetica, such data-intensive projects involved so much time for loading the data that they couldn\u2019t be analyzed quickly enough to deliver real-time benefits.\n\u201cNow, I don\u2019t feel like I have a bottleneck,\u201d said Countouris. \u201cWe are continuously integrating data and delivering dashboards to decision makers within hours. And with robust real-time pipelines allowing for continuous data ingestion, we can now focus on building better dashboards.\u201d\nIn the past, to get data in a specific and usable format, they would need to do a lot of pre-processing. With Kinetica\u2019s Streaming Data Warehouse powered by NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs, that\u2019s no longer the case. Users can access the much richer datasets they demand.\nKinetica\u2019s platform is available on NVIDIA NGC, a catalog of GPU-optimized AI containers that let enterprises quickly operationalize extreme analytics, machine learning and data visualization. This eliminates complexity and lets organizations deploy cloud, on-premises or hybrid models for optimal business operations.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we could meet user expectations for geodata without GPU power,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is just too much data and geodata to provide for too many users at the same time.\u201d\nAP-HP\u2019s COVID-related work has already built a foundation upon which to do follow-up work related to emergency responses in general. The hospital information system\u2019s interest for that kind of data is far from over.\n\u201cThe fact that we helped the decision-making process and that officials are using our data is the measure of success,\u201d said Countouris. \u201cWe have a lot to do. This is only the beginning.\u201d\nCountouris presented the team\u2019s work last week at the GPU Technology Conference. Registered GTC attendees can view the talk on demand. It will be available for replay to the general public early next month.\nKinetica will also be part of the NVIDIA Startup Village Booth at the HLTH conference, presenting on Oct. 16 at 2 p.m. Pacific time.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | COVID-19 | GTC 2020 | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | RAPIDS \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The company confirmed to STH that indeed future products would streamline branding with the \u201cQuadro\u201d brand phased out as we saw the \u201cTesla\u201d brand phased out on the data center side in 2019.\nNVIDIA Quadro Branding Phased Out\nFor those that are unfamiliar with the Quadro brand, it was NVIDIA\u2019s professional graphics brand that we seen on a wide range of systems. \u201cProfessional\u201d does not mean just the highest-end GPUs. We even see Quadro GPUs in systems such as our Project TinyMiniMicro workstations like the\u00a0Lenovo ThinkStation P320 Tiny.\nLenovo ThinkStation P320 Tiny Internal NVIDIA Quadro P600\nAlthough those lower power ~35W GPUs exist, they are perhaps best known on STH for higher-end GPUs over the years. Examples on STH recently include our NVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000 Review and our NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 GPU Review.\nLenovo ThinkStation P920 Installed NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 NVLINK\nThe Quadro line was able to use features such as NVLink to span multiple high-end GPUs as we showed in our\u00a0Dual NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 Review with NVLink. We have lots of content spanning Quadro cards between the Quadro P600 to the dual Quadro RTX 8000 NVLink setups.\nNow, NVIDIA confirmed to STH that it was streamlining its branding and removing Quadro from the mix. This follows some other streamlining in the GPU branding. For example, in the data center, NVIDIA used to have a \u201cGRID\u201d series of cards such as the NVIDIA GRID M40. That was streamlined away years ago.\n8x NVIDIA GRID M40 Installed\nIn a more recent move, the NVIDIA \u201cTesla\u201d brand was dropped to avoid confusion with the Tesla cars. The Quadro change is being handled differently. On the Tesla side, the NVIDIA Tesla T4 as an example was rebranded the NVIDIA T4 dropping the \u201cTesla\u201d designation on an existing product. In the e-mail confirmation from NVIDIA, STH was told that \u201cThere is no need to update branding in the past this is just how we are going to move forward with our Quadro brand.\u201d (Source: NVIDIA PR to STH on 4 October 2020) It seems like we will continue to call legacy products Quadro which seems to be dissimilar to what we saw on the Tesla branding change.\nVideo Discussion\nWe discussed this as part of our GTC 2020 (#2) Hardware video:\n\nYou can check that out to hear more thoughts about the change as well.\nFinal Words\nFor many, the Quadro brand has been a big part of their computing experience. Losing a brand with this much history is a bummer. Generally, we like the generic model number and letter designations. It certainly streamlines the number of characters we need to type. At the same time, it feels like we are losing a bit of history by dropping the brand.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSNVIDIANVIDIA Quadro RTXQuadro \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleNVIDIA Shows DPU Roadmap Combining Arm Cores GPU and NetworkingNext articleMarvell NativeRAID NVMe RAID for M.2 Solutions Comes to HPE Patrick Kennedyhttps://www.servethehome.comPatrick has been running STH since 2009 and covers a wide variety of SME, SMB, and SOHO IT topics.

The report comes from PC Watch who has received word from various retailers in the Akihabara tech market-based in Tokyo, Japan.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Graphics Card To Launch With Considerably Larger Supply Than The RTX 3080 & RTX 3090\nDospara, one of the main retail outlets at Akihabara, has announced that it will initiate sales for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 graphics cards at around 20:00 (JST) when the first tickets will be handed out. The store expects payments to initiate by 21:00 (JST) following product delivery by 22:00 which should last just 10 minutes. The graphics card will be sold on a first-come & first serve basis which is similar to lots of North American stores and how they process orders for new launches.\nRelated Story Watch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For UnveilingAccording to PC Watch, they didn't just visit Dospara but also talked to several other retailers based in the Akihabara market. All of them have guaranteed that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 will have a considerably larger stock than the GeForce RTX 3090 and GeForce RTX 3080. It remains to be seen if they are referring to the launch stock or the overall stock since the launch stock could've gotten a bit better due to the delayed launch from 15th October to 29th October but if the launch stock runs out quick, will there be enough of a supply coming through the backchannel to meet demand even after the launch.\n\nThis report is also based on just words from Asian Pacific retailers. We don't know what the stock & supply would look like in other market regions, especially North America. Danish retailer ProShop has released its own demand versus supply statistics for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 and their total numbers don't look that great. NVIDIA and its partners are only able to meet 7.4% of the demand for the upcoming card so it remains to be seen how things are going to unfold on 29th October.\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 is definitely positioned in a very interesting spot. The reviews for the card arrive a day before AMD's Radeon RX 6000 series unveiling and the card launches in the retail PC segment a day after the unveiling. Many consumers will definitely wait to see what AMD has been cooking with its RDNA 2 GPU architecture for the gaming segment but from what we know, even at this close to launch, the RTX 3070 demand is at an unprecedented scale simply based on the fact that it offers 2080 Ti equivalent performance at $499 US. It remains to be seen if AMD can top the card in terms of performance/$ on 28th October.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Graphics Card Specifications - GA104 GPU & 8 GB GDDR6 Memory\nAt the heart of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 graphics card lies the GA104 GPU. The GA104 is one of the many Ampere GPUs that we will be getting on the gaming segment. The GA104 GPU is the second-fastest Ampere chip in the stack. The GPU is based on Samsung's 8nm (N8) process node. The GPU measures at 392.5mm2 and features 17.4 Billion transistors which are almost 93% of the transistors featured on the TU102 GPU. At the same time, the GA104 GPU is almost half the size of the TU102 GPU which is an insane amount of density.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nFor the GeForce RTX 3070, NVIDIA has enabled a total of 46 SM units on its flagship which results in a total of 5888 CUDA cores. In addition to the CUDA cores, NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3070 also comes packed with next-generation RT (Ray-Tracing) cores, Tensor cores, and brand new SM or streaming multi-processor units.\n\nIn terms of memory, the RTX 3070 features 8 GB of GDDR6 memory. The GeForce RTX 3070 comes with memory at speeds of 14 Gbps. That along with a full uncut bus interface of 256-bit will deliver a cumulative bandwidth of 448 Gbps.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere' Graphics Card Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA106-300Ampere GA104-200Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie SizeTBC395.2mm2395.2mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBC17.4 Billion17.4 Billion28 Billion28 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores358448645888870410496\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs112 / 64152 / 80184 / 96272 / 96328 / 112\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores112 / 28152 / 38184 / 46272 / 68328 / 82\n\n\nBase Clock1320 MHz1410 MHz1500 MHz1440 MHz1400 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock1780 MHz1665 MHz1730 MHz1710 MHz1700 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute13 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs30 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPs25 TFLOPs32 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs58 TFLOPs69 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPs101 TOPs192 TOPs163 TOPs238 TOPs285 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity12 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR610 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus192-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed16 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth384 Gbps448 Gbps448 Gbps760 Gbps936 Gbps\n\n\nTGP170W175W220W320W350W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$329 US$399 US$499 US$699 US$1499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)25th February 20212nd December 202029th October 202017th September 202024th September 2020\n\n\n\nFor now, it looks like the GeForce RTX 3070 would be a great option for anyone who doesn't own either the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti or the GeForce RTX 1080 Ti. You would get lower temperatures, a lower power consumption rating, and an upgrade to a faster graphics card for a much lower price point. (This isn't our final conclusion or recommendation for the RTX 3070 graphics card).\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n106\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n47\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n40\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n35\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

But if you can, wait until the GPU rollout dust settles in case there are better buys to come.\n        Lori Grunin Senior Editor / Advice I've been reviewing hardware and software, devising testing methodology and handed out buying advice for what seems like forever; I'm currently absorbed by computers and gaming hardware, but previously spent many years concentrating on cameras.

The GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition of the $499 (\u00a3469, AU$809) graphics card I tested is geared toward high-frame rate/quality 1440p \n  gaming\n, and delivers similar performance to the RTX 2080 Ti for most uses (but not all), which debuted at $999. The boost over its predecessor, the more expensive RTX 2070 Super, depends upon what you need it to do.\u00a0Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition  $499 at Best Buy  The release of the 3070 follows the\u00a0bumpy launch of the\u00a0$699 RTX 3080 and its $1,500 sibling, the RTX 3090, both experiencing\u00a0price gouging due to shortages. But rumors have also surfaced about a\u00a0slightly cheaper RTX 3060 Ti coming soon as well as\u00a0a new card slotted between the 3070 and 3080. Plus, it's likely we'll get an entry-level 30 series card early next year to feed the mid-$300 buyers. And that doesn't take into account \n  AMD's\n launch of its ambitious Radeon RX 6000-series \"Big Navi\" gaming cards that use the same architecture as the upcoming Xbox Series X and S and PS5 \n  consoles\n.Like the RTX 3080-based graphics cards, the Ampere-generation of the company's GPU architecture achieves playable frame rates in \n  games\n that use RTX-specific features\u00a0like ray-tracing and global illumination. Its AI-based upscaling feature, DLSS, lets you finally game at better-than-bare-minimum frame rates without visible degradation in quality. The GPU also lifts performance over predecessors in games that don't take advantage of the whizzy features by about 10% to 20% on average, which is really most games.\u00a0 \u00a0    Watch this: Full breakdown of Nvidia's new RTX 3000 series (3070, 3080, 3090)\n        03:56  Unlike its higher-end siblings, the 3070 uses older GDDR6 memory and has the same memory bandwidth as the 2070 Super. It still gets some performance boosts thanks to the second-gen ray tracing and third-gen Tensor cores, such as new algorithms and instruction sets that make them a lot more efficient and a switch to an 8nm process size from 12nm. And as is typical, it has increased core counts -- it has a lower ray-tracing core count but the Ampere RT cores are doubled-up over the Turing cores, so technically the 3070 has more. But you won't see the same uplift that the 3080 and 3090 received over earlier models.\u00a0Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition specs    GeForce RTX 3070Memory 8GB GDDR6Memory bandwidth 448GB/secMemory clock (GHz) 1.75GPU clock (GHz, base/boost) 1.5/1.73Memory data rate/Interface 14Gbps/256 bitTexture fill rate (gigatexels per second) 317.4RT cores 46CUDA Cores 5,888Texture mapping units 184Streaming multiprocessors 68Tensor Cores 184Process 8nmTGP/min PSU 220w/550wMax thermal (degrees C) 199F/93CGPU name GA104Bus PCIe 4.0 x 16Size 2 slots; 9.5 x 4.4 in (242 x 112 mm)Price Around $499    It's also significantly less power-hungry than the higher-end cards, roughly the same as before, plus it's the same size as the 2080 Ti. While the 3070 has a similar 12-pin power connector design to the 3080 -- including an adapter in the box -- it still only connects to a single 8-pin block from the power supply. All of that means it's a much simpler upgrade, especially in tight systems. The Founders Edition, at least, ran cool and quiet during my testing, in a system where I swapped it for the 2070 Super. \u00a0      Lori Grunin/CNETI have no complaints about the RTX 3070's performance, and it's definitely worth its $499 price tag. But it may not be your best choice for the money. The Ti models generally have more memory and slightly wider data paths than the non-Ti models, which is why you'll find the 11GB 2080 Ti occasionally outperforming the 8GB 3070. It makes sense to wait and see if an RTX 3060 Ti or intermediate option between the 3070 and 3080 become reality and what AMD rolls out later this week.Geekbench 5 (Vulkan)  Origin PC Big O (PS4 Edition)  64522MSI MEG Trident X  70806MSI Aegis RS (MS-7C75)  72526Origin PC Chronos  87234Maingear Turbo  91575Corsair One Pro i200  91594  Note: Longer bars indicate better performance\n     Geekbench 5 (CUDA)  MSI MEG Trident X  113155MSI Aegis RS  148007Maingear Turbo   154234Origin PC Chronos  211130  Note: Longer bars indicate better performance\n     Shadow of the Tomb Raider gaming test (1080p, highest quality)  Origin PC Big O (PS4 Edition)  91MSI MEG Trident X  130Corsair One Pro i200  138Maingear Turbo  143MSI Aegis RS (MS-7C75)  143Origin PC Chronos  164  Note: Longer bars indicate better performance (FPS)\n     Shadow of the Tomb Raider gaming test (4K, highest quality)  MSI Aegis RS (MS-7C75)  62Maingear Turbo  65MSI Aegis RS (MS-7C75) with DLSS  76Origin PC Chronos  89  Note: Longer bars indicate better performance (FPS)\n     3DMark Port Royal (RTX)  Origin PC Big O (PS4 Edition)  5921MSI MEG Trident X  5982MSI Aegis RS (MS-7C75)  8065Corsair One Pro i200  8723Maingear Turbo  9085Origin PC Chronos  10966  Note: Longer bars indicate better performance\n     Configurations   Corsair One Pro Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (1909); 3.3GHz Intel Core i9-10940X; 64GB DDR4 SDRAM 2,667MHz; 11GB Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti; 2TB SSDMaingear Turbo Microsoft Windows 10 Home (2004); 3.8GHz Ryzen 9 3900XT; 32GB DDR4 SDRAM 3,600; 11GB Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti; 1TB SSD + 4TB HDDMSI Aegis RS Microsoft Windows 10 Home (1909); 3.8GHz Intel Core i7-10700K; 16GB DDR4 SDRAM 3,000; 8GB Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition; 1TB SSDMSI Trident X Microsoft Windows 10 Home (1909); (oc) 3.8GHz Intel Core i7-10700K; 32GB DDR4 SDRAM 2,932; 8GB Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super; 1TB SSDOrigin PC Big O (PS4 Edition) Microsoft Windows 10 Home (1909); 3.8GHz AMD Ryzen 9 3900X; 16GB DDR4 SDRAM; 8GB Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super; 1.5TB SSD (2TB SSD for console)Origin PC Chronos Microsoft Windows 10 Home (2004); Intel Core i9-10900K; 16GB DDR4 SDRAM 3,200; 10GB Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 (EVGA); 1TB SSD + 500GB SSD        \n    Computing Guides\n   \n      Laptops\n     \n  \n          Best Laptop\n        \n          Best Chromebook\n        \n          Best Budget Laptop\n        \n          Best Cheap Gaming Laptop\n        \n          Best 2-in-1 Laptop\n        \n          Best Windows Laptop\n        \n          Best Macbook\n        \n          Best Gaming Laptop\n        \n          Best Macbook Deals\n        \n      Desktops & Monitors\n     \n  \n          Best Desktop PC\n        \n          Best Gaming PC\n        \n          Best Monitor Under 200\n        \n          Best Desktop Deals\n        \n          Best Monitors\n        \n          M2 Mac Mini Review\n        \n      Computer Accessories\n     \n  \n          Best PC Speakers\n        \n          Best Printer\n        \n          Best External Hard Drive SSD\n        \n          Best USB C Hub Docking Station\n        \n          Best Keyboard\n        \n          Best Webcams\n        \n          Best Mouse\n        \n          Best Laptop Backpack\n        \n      Photography\n     \n  \n          Best Camera to Buy\n        \n          Best Vlogging Camera\n        \n          Best Tripod\n        \n          Best Waterproof Camera\n        \n          Best Action Camera\n        \n          Best Camera Bag and Backpack\n        \n          Best Drone\n        \n      Tablets & E-Readers\n     \n  \n          Best E-Ink Tablets\n        \n          Best iPad Deals\n        \n          Best iPad\n        \n          Best E-Reader\n        \n          Best Tablet\n        \n          Best Android Tablet\n        \n      3D Printers\n     \n  \n          Best 3D Printer\n        \n          Best Budget 3D Printer\n        \n          Best 3D Printing Filament\n        \n          Best 3D Printer Deals\n                          Your guideto a better future DealsReviewsBest ProductsGift GuideCouponsVideosSoftware Downloads About CNET Press Room Newsletters Licensing Sitemap Careers Accessibility Cookie Settings Privacy Policy  Terms of Use Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information instagram youtube tiktok facebook x flipboard  US France Germany Japan Korea \n  \u00a9 2025 CNET, a Ziff Davis company.\n  All rights reserved.\n   \n\n\n"

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I cover emerging technologies with a focus on infrastructure and AIFollow AuthorOct 11, 2020, 09:24pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.At the GPU Technology Conference 2020, Jensen Huang, NVIDIA\u2019s CEO, unveiled a new family of processors branded as the BlueField-2 Data Processing Unit (DPU). The DPU is accessible to the developers via the software platform, the DOCA SDK. The DPU and DOCA SDK are comparable to NVIDIA\u2019s powerful combination of GPU hardware and CUDA software.\u00a0\u00a0\nJenson Huang, CEONVIDIA\n\nHaving dominated the AI accelerator market, NVIDIA is now aiming to expand it to the data center infrastructure acceleration and optimization.\u00a0\n\nWhy is Jensen Huang bullish about the DPU market and how it matters to the enterprise data center? Here is an attempt to explain the evolution of DPU in simple terms.\n\nThe Aggregation and Disaggregation of Enterprise Infrastructure\nDuring the 90s, the combination of Intel x86 CPU and OS software offered unmatched power to enterprises. The rise of client/server computing, followed by n-tier computing, paved the way for distributed computing. Enterprises ran databases, application servers and custom line of business software on a fleet of x86 servers.\u00a0\n\n\nDuring the early 2000s, VMware introduced ESX, a hypervisor that brought the ability to virtualize the x86 CPU. Enterprises could run multiple virtual machines on a single powerful server. CPU virtualization was the first step towards the aggregation of enterprise infrastructure.\u00a0\nThe hypervisor made the hardware programmable. Developers could write code to define and provision a virtual machine without manual intervention. This programmability aspect of infrastructure became the foundation of the modern cloud computing paradigm.\u00a0\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nBased on the success of ESX, VMware moved towards network and storage virtualization. Traditional infrastructure players such as Cisco and EMC have started to build virtualized network and storage services to compete with VMware. In 2012, VMware acquired Nicira, the software-defined networking startup, for $1.26 billion, which was branded as NSX. In March 2014, VMware announced vSAN, its virtualized software storage platform tightly integrated with vSphere, the management platform for the ESX hypervisor. With vSphere, NSX and vSAN, VMware had the complete infrastructure virtualization stack for enterprises.\u00a0\n\nThe integration of virtualized compute, storage and networking led to a new breed of converged infrastructure offered as a software-defined data center (SDDC). Microsoft, Nutanix, VCE and, of course, VMware were in the race to win the SDDC market.\u00a0\n\n\nThe SDDC became a significant milestone in the aggregation of the enterprise data centers. Instead of running hundreds of mid-sized servers, customers could consolidate their infrastructure to fewer hyper-converged appliances.\u00a0\nThe exciting aspect of SDDC is that a powerful x86 processor is exploited to emulate multiple CPUs, network cards, and storage interfaces. The core building blocks of SDDC are available to developers as APIs bringing the highest level of automation.\u00a0\nThe rise of software-defined infrastructure put the x86 processor under tremendous pressure. The CPU has to deal with everything from running the operating system, applications, network traffic, storage I/O, security and more. Since every component of the SDDC is just a piece of software running on top of the processor, the role of CPU has changed dramatically. In a SDDC scenario, the infrastructure services that run the control plane of the system aggressively compete with the applications that run in the data plane for CPU resources.\u00a0\nAlongside the SDDC, two more trends started to take place. The first one is the rise of specialized artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and the second is the evolution of programmable hardware.\u00a0\nAI demands extreme parallelism, which cannot be delivered by a general-purpose CPU. GPUs, that were originally developed for accelerating graphics started to become the co-processors for running complex mathematical operations in parallel. NVIDIA was quick to address this opportunity by shipping GPUs targeting the training and inference use cases of AI workloads.\u00a0\nLike how GPUs complement CPUs by offloading the mathematical operations, a new breed of programmable chips started to become available in the market. These chips are known as Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which can be programmed for a specific purpose such as network traffic optimization or storage I/O acceleration.\u00a0\nCompanies such as Broadcom, Ethernity Networks, Intel, Marvell, Mellanox (acquired by NVIDIA in 2019), Napatech, Netronome, Pensando, and Xilinx started to add the FPGA to the network interface cards to accelerate network traffic. Sold as SmartNICs, they offload CPUs from performing network functions, thus freeing up the processing power.\u00a0\nSimilar to SmartNIC, the NVMe storage controller also benefits from the addition of FPGA. It brings massive parallelism and customization to the data path by making the controller programmable.\u00a0\nThe rise of GPU, SmartNIC and the programmable storage controller bring disaggregation to SDDC. They free up the CPU by intelligently delegating the network and storage functions to specialized hardware. This enables the applications and workloads to get the best performance from the underlying CPU and hardware resources.\u00a0\nWith containers and Kubernetes, each SDDC appliance runs tens of thousands of microservices generating a heavy load of network and storage I/O that impacts the CPU performance. With dedicated hardware for network and storage acceleration, CPU can focus on the application while delegating routine tasks to these specialized controllers.\u00a0\nFrom the hypervisor to SDDC to FPGA-based network and storage controllers, the industry has come full-circle. Apart from these, there is an opportunity to push network security, firewall functionality, encryption, and even infrastructure management to specialized hardware.\u00a0\nThrough the acquisition of Mellanox, NVIDIA is eyeing the next big opportunity in the enterprise data center driven by purpose-built, specialized hardware for the network, security, storage and infrastructure management.\u00a0\nWhat are DPU and DOCA?\nNVIDIA\u2019s DPU is the new avatar of Mellanox\u2019s SmartNIC. According to NVIDIA, The BlueField-2 DPU is the world\u2019s first data center infrastructure on a chip architecture optimized for modern enterprise data centers.\u00a0BlueField-2 DPUNVIDIA\nThe BlueField-2 DPU has programmable network and storage interfaces that offload the CPU from processing these functions. The applications and workloads get the major share of the processor, which is now free of tackling the mundane network and storage functions.\u00a0DPU AccelerationNVIDIA\nThe DPUs are accessible through the DOCA SDK, which exposes programmable API for the underlying hardware platform.\u00a0\nJust as CUDA enables developers to program accelerated computing applications, DOCA enables them to program the acceleration of data processing for moving data into and out of servers, VMs, and containers. DOCA sits alongside CUDA to leverage the entire range of NVIDIA AI applications in a secure, accelerated data center.\nDOCA is fully integrated into NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC), a software catalog offering a containerized software environment for developers to build advanced DPU data-center-accelerated services.\nWhen it comes to networking, the DPU accelerates the most advanced data center SDN and network function virtualization (NFV). It handles the east-west traffic associated with the virtual machines and containers and the north-south traffic flowing in and out of the software-defined data center. It effectively accelerates the network path for both the control plane and the data plane.\u00a0\nThe DPU is designed to optimize software-defined elastic storage, NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF), RoCE, data-at-rest encryption, and data deduplication, distributed error correction, and data compression. Enterprises and cloud service providers can connect remote NVMe storage pools to Bluefield DPU without compromising throughput and performance. The NVMe SNAP technology delivers elastic block storage functionality and presents to the host remote block storage as if it were local NVMe block storage or a VirtIO blk device with low-latency, high throughput, and high IOPS.\nAccording to NVIDIA, the DPU also offloads, accelerates, and isolates all essential data center security services. This includes support for next-generation firewalls, micro-segmentation, data-in-motion inline encryption with transparent IPSec and TLS, and intrusion protection. The DPU has a set of dedicated security engines that includes all the building blocks of any security solution. Traditionally, this functionality was embedded into the software-defined networking stack running on top of x86 CPU. By moving this layer to the DPU, enterprises benefit from an efficient, responsive, zero-trust security functionality running at the lowest level of the stack, which frees up the CPU.\u00a0\nDPUs come with management agents that provide unmatched visibility into the network layer and host. Based on DOCA, the DPU-based agents can perform in-band or out-of-band management without burdening the server CPU. If the server needs a reset, or even if the tenant or business application requires a bare metal server with no agents, a DOCA-programmed DPU can still send telemetry, perform a remote reset, or allow the secure boot of the server, all without running an agent on the server CPU. Essentially, the DPU takes over the monitoring and network observability function without explicitly running an agent at the operating system level.\u00a0\nJensen has already announced the roadmap for the BlueField family. The BlueField-4 DPU scheduled to be launched in 2023 will have an embedded GPU bringing the DPU and GPU into the same hardware interface.DPU RoadmapNVIDIA\nBut for customers willing to try this functionality today, the BlueField2-X DPU already has an Ampere GPU, which brings AI capabilities that can be applied to data center security, networking and storage tasks.\nNVIDIA is partnering with VMware, Red Hat, Canonical and Check Point software to integrate BlueField DPU with their platforms.\u00a0\nWith DPU, NVIDIA aims to bring efficiency and optimization to the enterprise data center that was once available only to cloud service providers. By adding a DPU to the servers, customers will be able to maximize the CPU usage towards applications rather than burdening them with mundane network and storage access.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has a vested interest in improving the gaming experience. Upselling people on the best graphics cards is merely part of the equation. Pushing other hardware and technology to new heights is the second aspect, and periodically we'll see new advances in the state of the art gaming PC. Today marks the launch of Nvidia's Reflex Latency Analyzer \u2014 not just the Reflex software aspect, but actual hardware. Nvidia sent us a kit consisting of a Reflex enabled display and mouse, and we put it to the test.What is Nvidia Reflex Latency Analyzer? It's both a hardware and software solution for measuring input latency, from the time you click a mouse button to the time the monitor shows the results of that action. Games can add support for Nvidia Reflex via an SDK, while the mouse and monitor have to support some specific features to enable capturing of timing data. The goal is to help users \u2014 especially eSports professionals \u2014 to tune for optimal performance. In theory, sometimes higher framerates in a game might not have minimum latency, and Nvidia Reflex Latency Analyzer provides a quick way to measure the results of any settings changes.The best parallel to Nvidia Reflex Latency Analyzer that comes to mind is the launch of G-Sync way back in 2013. It was a bit raw out of the gate, with the first display to support G-Sync actually requiring some hardware modding. The earliest G-Sync monitors were also pretty tame, with 60Hz maximum refresh rates. Today, G-Sync has grown to support G-Sync Compatible displays that don't even use Nvidia's G-Sync scaler module, along with higher resolutions and refresh rates of up to 360Hz. Like G-Sync, Reflex Latency Analyzer has new hardware as part of the package, so let's quickly look at the requirements.Nvidia Reflex Latency Analyzer System RequirementsReflex compatible GPU (GeForce GTX 16 series or GeForce RTX series)Reflex compatible monitor (Acer Predator X25, Alienware AW2521H, Asus PG259QNR)Reflex compatible mouse (Logitech G Pro, ROG Chakram Core, Razer DeathAdder V2 Pro, SteelSeries Rival 3)Bonus points: Reflex enabled game (e.g., Fortnite, Valorant, Call of Duty)Any Turing or later generation Nvidia GeForce graphics card should suffice, which means a GTX 16-series or RTX 20-series or better. If you have such a GPU, you can enable Reflex in GeForce Experience (the public release with Reflex support should go live on 10/21/2020), and there should at least get some benefit from the low latency mode. This is somewhat akin to AMD's low-latency Anti-Lag driver feature, and basically looks to cut down on how many frames are queued up between display updates.To get the full Reflex Latency Analyzer experience, however, you'll also need a Reflex compatible mouse and monitor. The mouse shouldn't be too big of a problem, but the Reflex monitors, though ... you might feel a bit like they're mugging your wallet. Especially if you've recently forked over the money for a high-end monitor. Currently, the only Reflex enabled monitors are 360Hz IPS displays, which are basically the fastest and highest quality eSports gaming monitors on the market.One thing to note on the mice is that some of these are updated versions of existing mice. If you already own one of these mice (like the Logitech G Pro Wireless), we're actually using a pre-release version that supports Reflex. Logitech will have a future mouse that supports Reflex, but existing mice won't be firmware upgradable as far as we're aware.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Games can also add improved support for Reflex. While all titles potentially benefit just by flipping the Reflex switch in GFE, for built-in latency polling and optimizations, another tier of support exists. Fortnite is the first game with full Reflex support, and Valorant, Call of Duty (including Modern Warfare (2019), Warzone, and the Black Ops Cold War variants) also support Reflex. Other games are planning on supporting Reflex as well, and you can still use it in other titles \u2014 the latency reduction just might not be quite as large. One thing we like about Fortnite is that it has an option to show a \"Reflex Latency Indicator\" \u2014 a white rectangle that makes it very easy for the monitor sensor to detect the button click.Let's be clear that Nvidia Reflex Latency Analyzer isn't something that everyone needs to run out and buy. Competitive gamers are probably going to be the most eager to upgrade, as reducing latency and just having good tools to measure latency, provides a clear advantage in fast paced games. Casual gamers will likely notice and benefit from Reflex as well, but they're less likely to pony up for the new top-tier mouse and monitor.(Image credit: Logitech)How Nvidia Reflex Latency Analyzer WorksCapturing latency data is normally a complex process. One solution consists of a high-speed camera (1000 fps or more), recording both the mouse and monitor. Click the button and then look for the on-screen result (e.g., weapons fire), and count the frames in between the two. This is a time consuming and arduous process, with some expensive hardware requirements.Reflex Latency Analyzer gets around that requirement by building a configurable sensor into the monitor firmware, along with a supported USB port for the mouse. When the mouse button gets clicked, the monitor can detect the button press and mark the start time. Then, when the frame with the resulting reaction to the button press appears, the monitor marks that time and calculates the difference.That's a bit more complex than it sounds, as the reaction to a button press isn't always clear. Some guns may show a bright muzzle flash, others might show your character swinging a pickaxe, etc. Fortnite has extra support for Reflex where it shows a white rectangle, which makes capturing the latency data far easier. Other games will likely add support for this in the future, but the important thing is that the \u00a0monitor can be configured on where to look for a screen update.Take a game other than Fortnite, like Call of Duty. The easiest way to have the game detect the reaction to a button press is with a gun that has a bright weapon flash. Go to a darker area, use the monitor OSD to set the 'sensing' rectangle to where the muzzle flash first appears, and then proceed to click the mouse button.This isn't how you'd normally play a game, of course, but if you're trying to determine how much latency is present, which is our goal, it suffices. Nvidia's GeForce Experience overlay is the final part of the equation, with hooks that allow you to display latency data on the screen.(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia Reflex Tested HardwareIntel Core i9-10900K\nGeForce RTX 3080 FE\nGeForce RTX 2070 Super FE\nEVGA GeForce GTX 1660 Super\nMSI MEG Z490 Ace\nNZXT X63\n2x16GB HyperX DDR4-3600\n2TB XPG 8200 Pro\nBe Quiet! 850W Platinum\nCorsair 275R Airflow\nAlienware AW2521H\nLogitech G Pro (pre-release Reflex variant)For this initial look at Nvidia Reflex Latency Analyzer, we're going to use Fortnite, running Creative mode so that we can use the same test area and not worry about getting shot. We've selected three Nvidia GPUs, representing the extreme, high, and midrange categories, and we're testing at multiple resolutions, with and without ray tracing and DLSS where applicable.One thing that's important to note is that framerates have a direct impact on latency. If a game runs at 200 fps, that's basically 5ms per frame, whereas at 40 fps you're looking at 25ms per frame. While you will benefit in general from the improved latency Reflex offers, for testing we're using the same area and repeatedly clicking the mouse to measure latency.Best-case, Reflex seems to eliminate one or two frames' worth of latency, and in some cases it can cut latency in half. \u00a0It's worth noting that Reflex shuts off at low (<30 fps) frame rates, but in general, gamers would want higher performance as a starting point, so sub-30 fps results aren't really a concern.Because we're running on a 1080p 360Hz display, we're a bit limited in what we can test. We used DSR (dynamic super resolution) to enable 1440p and 4K, but Fortnite (and Unreal Engine games in general) don't always behave properly with DSR. In this case, Fortnite wouldn't let us use the higher resolutions in fullscreen mode. Borderless windowed mode worked, but Reflex and games in general tend to have best latencies in fullscreen mode. In other words, take the DSR results as a potential preview, but know that there are situations where Reflex may not work well if you're trying to use DSR.In general, it seems Reflex works best when you're at high but not extreme framerates. Games in the 30-60 fps range seem to get the largest reduction in latency, though we did see a modest drop in latency even at 200 fps in Fortnite. Let's check the results.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)At 1080p, the RTX 3080 gets latency all the way down to the sub-20ms range. Averaging results over 20 clicks, we measured 16.8ms, which is extremely fast. Even without Reflex, the RTX 3080 still puts up an impressive score of 22.6ms, though Reflex reduced latency by 25%. That's with performance of around 200 fps, at Epic settings but without any ray tracing or DLSS. Turning all of the ray tracing options on, with DLSS Performance mode, framerates are cut in half (96 fps). Without Reflex, total system latency more than doubles to 45.3ms, while Reflex knocks that back down to 42.3ms, a nearly 40% reduction in latency.The RTX 2070 Super shows even better percentage gains at 1080p, with Reflex reducing latency by 46% at Epic settings (135 fps), and 48% with RT and DLSS enabled (51 fps). The GTX 1660 Super also shows a big reduction in latency of 46% (86 fps \u2014 we didn't test it with RT enabled for obvious reasons). Of course, even though the reduction in latency is larger with these slower cards, total latency isn't as good as the RTX 3080. It's also interesting that even though the RTX 2070 Super was quite a bit faster than the GTX 1660 Super, the latency results were basically tied.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Moving up to 1440p, we had to simulate this resolution via DSR 1.78X scaling, in Borderless Windowed mode. Most of the results are just as impressive as at 1080p. The exception is the RTX 3080, which again only shows a 25% reduction in latency, at least when running without RT and DLSS (at around 146 fps). Turning on RT+DLSS (59 fps) did allow Reflex to generate a 46% reduction in latency again with the RTX 3080, however.The RTX 2070 Super non-RT result (at 85 fps) shows a 48% reduction in latency, while the RT+DLSS latency (32 fps) is a 53% reduction. The GTX 1660 Super (52 fps) also shows latency being cut by more than half, with a 53% reduction.As before, raw latency will favor the faster GPUs, like the RTX 3080 in this case. But if you're looking purely at latency improvements, the closer a GPU is to 30 fps, the larger the gains.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)At 4K, again simulated via DSR in Borderless Windowed mode, this time via a 4.0X scaling factor, we eliminated the few cases where Reflex shuts off (i.e., GTX 1660 Super at 25 fps, and RTX 2070 Super in RT+DLSS mode at 16 fps).The RTX 3080 still posts some great results. Without ray tracing (70 fps), latency is cut by 46%, from 71ms to 38ms. With RT+DLSS enabled (31fps), we also see latency reduced by more than half, from 146ms to 67ms. The RTX 2070 Super without RT (42 fps) sees latency drop by 56%, the biggest dip in our testing, from 107ms to just 47ms.Of course, native 4K would normally have at best a 144Hz refresh rate, or often only 60Hz, which would likely reduce the gains. Then again, competitive esports athletes likely wouldn't be playing at 4K in the first place, and right now there aren't any Reflex enabled 4K or even 1440p monitors.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Epic Games)(Image credit: Epic Games)Nvidia Reflex: Great Latency Improvements, High PriceWe've provided some initial numbers using the Nvidia Latency Analyzer hardware, from a single game, but the bigger changes are experiential. Reflex running on a 360 Hz G-Sync display isn't going to turn me into the next Ninja, but there's definitely an improvement in feel and responsiveness when running with the Reflex mouse and monitor. I could easily feel the difference, and I'm not at all a competitive gamer.That's the good news. The bad news, of course, is the cost of entry is quite steep. The Alienware AW2521H has a price tag of $899.99, which is $380 more than the previous 240Hz Alienware AW2521HF, (which doesn't have Reflex support, of course). That's a hefty premium to pay for a 1080p monitor, and we still feel the best gaming monitors tend to be 1440p 144Hz displays. That's not to say Nvidia Reflex Analyzer support won't be worth it for certain people, but much like G-Sync, it's Nvidia-only tech that serves to make expensive products even more costly.AMD has some features that compete with Reflex, like its Anti-Lag toggle in the Radeon Adrenalin 2020 drivers, but that's pretty much only the software component of what Nvidia has put together. Ideally, we'd have an open standard that all hardware vendors could get behind, sort of like FreeSync, but that's not generally how Nvidia approaches new hardware features. Most gamers probably don't even care about measuring latency so much as just having it reduced as much as possible. If you pair a Reflex certified mouse with an Nvidia GPU and a high refresh rate monitor, and then enable Reflex in GeForce Experience, that's probably sufficient for most gamers.We'll have to see how such a solution compares in real-world metrics, however, which requires separate hardware to test latency, like Nvidia's LDAT. LDAT will also work with non-Nvidia GPUs, so we can capture latency data for AMD GPUs, with and without Anti-Lag \u2014 something Reflex Latency Analyzer can't do, as it requires Nvidia's GeForce Experience overlay.There's plenty to like with the Reflex Latency Analyzer experience, but until and unless pricing comes down \u2014 and we see broader support among hardware vendors \u2014 it's more of an eSports niche product than something created for the general gaming audience. ESports is, of course, big money these days, with lots of hardware companies sponsoring teams and events. But just because a popular athlete wears a pair of $400 shoes, or games on a $900 Reflex monitor, doesn't mean the rest of us can afford to do so. If you're an eSports hopeful, though, we can certainly see how the significant reduction in latency \u2014 and the ability to measure that latency \u2014 would boost your skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more Gaming Monitors News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nHardware\nGaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (8)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

It is comprised of the NR SDK (which includes a Low Latency Boost feature) which game devs can use, and an Ultra Low Latency Mode in the driver. It does not require a special mouse or monitor. You need a 900 series or newer GPU to take advantage of NR SDK (Boost feature works on any GPU though).\n\nNRLA does not reduce latency, it merely measures latency.

That's a pretty big thing, but not getting any media coverage.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimeMania\n\n\nI understand nothing about this so here are some questions I have:\nDoesn't the speed/quality of your Internet connection have a lot to do with your latency.\nWon't it be better if this software was able to control your latency so that even though you could have a faster latency, you could tell the software to always give you a latency of 40ms so that no matter the conditions, your game play will always seem the same and your timing will always be the same and consistent. Gamers can get used to playing at any latency as long as it is consistent.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNestea_Zen\n\n\nthanks to battle(non)sense from youtube to make nvidia et al aware of various latency issues\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7QY6L5pvmm0-stL-pNFrw/videos\nhe's the reason LDAT was made\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndymio\n\n\nAfter reading the first couple of paragraphs of this article, I strongly suggest the author learn the meaning of the phrase \"bury the lede\".\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJarredWaltonGPU\n\n\nTJ Hooker said:I found this article (and the other related one) a bit confusing because they seem to conflate Nvidia Reflex (NR) and Nvidia Reflex Latency Analzyer (NRLA) and use the terms interchangeably.\n\nNR reduces latency. It is comprised of the NR SDK (which includes a Low Latency Boost feature) which game devs can use, and an Ultra Low Latency Mode in the driver. It does not require a special mouse or monitor. You need a 900 series or newer GPU to take advantage of NR SDK (Boost feature works on any GPU though).\n\nNRLA does not reduce latency, it merely measures latency. It requires a special mouse + monitor. Not seeing anything about GPU requirements.I tried to make it clear that the Reflex driver changes and Reflex Latency Analyzer are separate entities. However, there is definitely overlap. Nvidia is pushing these new Reflex enabled monitors and mice as being the top performance (in terms of latency) hardware right now. Buying a Reflex mouse and monitor just happens to also get you Reflex Latency Analyzer.\n\nNvidia mentioned esports people potentially wanting a way to verify performance (latency) was as low as expected -- eg, for events. The Reflex Latency Analyzer equipped mice and monitors will also have improvements that make the better for latency in general. As an example, Nvidia listed its latency testing results for multiple mice. Where the Logitech G Pro Reflex mouse I used for testing has latency of around 1-2ms, some mice can be as bad as 10+ ms. Many 'good' mice are still in the 5-10ms range. The Asus Chakram Core meanwhile apparently has just 0.5ms of latency.\n\nOne of the biggest problems is that, short of using LDAT or a high speed camera, there's no way to actually say how Nvidia Reflex performed before now. With Reflex Latency Analyzer hardware, you can do that ... but only for the display you're testing. I don't currently have LDAT, so that's why I didn't do additional testing to try and compare latency performance with different monitors or mice. Well, that and time.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJarredWaltonGPU\n\n\nEndymio said:After reading the first couple of paragraphs of this article, I strongly suggest the author learn the meaning of the phrase \"bury the lede\".In this case, it's a complex topic, and simply posting the charts at the start would be a disservice. It would imply that all of this newfangled hardware is awesome and you should buy it. Without the context, Reflex Latency Analyzer looks better than it probably is. There's a reason Nvidia is using 360Hz displays, for example. But without additional hardware and testing, we can't say how it compares to 'normal' displays and mice. So, yes, the intro is front-loaded with a lot of extra detail. What is it you wanted to know exactly? Does it reduce latency. Yup. Does it do so better than a 240Hz or 144Hz non-Reflex display? Probably, but with diminishing returns.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndymio\n\n\nJarredWaltonGPU said:In this case, it's a complex topic...So, yes, the intro is front-loaded with a lot of extra detail. What is it you wanted to know exactly? ...First of all -- good article. My quibble was with the structuring; there isn't even a passing reference to what NRLA actually is or does until the ninth paragraph. For those already familiar with NR/NRLA, that structure may work, but in my case it was rather confusing.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 8 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Jensen Huang\u2019s Nvidia GTC 2025 keynote here \u2014 Blackwell 300 AI GPUs expected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU meets PCIe-based hard drives: Seagate and Nvidia demo NVMe HDDs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD's beastly Ryzen AI Max+ 395 comes to a new GMKTec mini-PC, and AMD's Lisa Su appears to approve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel finally releases the XeSS 2.0 SDK for developers \u2014 Technology still gated by closed-source barriers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070-series GPU supply to stabilize after April claims AIB partner Yeston\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew undersea cable tech listens for sabotage \u2014 can be retrofitted to existing fiber optic lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm debuts new Snapdragon G handheld gaming PC chips to compete with Intel and AMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina to spend $55 billion on R&D in 2025 \u2014 Semiconductor, AI and quantum computing fields to benefit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBambu Lab Announces New Printer: H2D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotherboard dies after marathon 100-hour BIOS update process, vigil attended by thousands online\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

You\u2019ll love this.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Bing search engine has turned to Turing-NLG and NVIDIA GPUs to suggest full sentences for you as you type.\nTuring-NLG is a cutting-edge, large-scale unsupervised language model that has achieved strong performance on language modeling benchmarks.\nIt\u2019s just the latest example of an AI technique called unsupervised learning, which makes sense of vast quantities of data by extracting features and patterns without the need for humans to provide any pre-labeled data.\nMicrosoft calls this Next Phrase Prediction, and it can feel like magic, making full-phrase suggestions in real time for long search queries.\nTuring-NLG is among several innovations \u2014 from model compression to state caching and hardware acceleration \u2014 that Bing has harnessed with Next Phrase Prediction.\nOver the summer, Microsoft worked with engineers at NVIDIA to optimize Turing-NLG to their needs, accelerating the model on NVIDIA GPUs to power the feature for users worldwide.\nA key part of this optimization was to run this massive AI model extremely fast to power real-time search experience. With a combination of hardware and model optimization Microsoft and NVIDIA achieved an average latency below 10 milliseconds.\nBy contrast, it takes more than 100 milliseconds to blink your eye.\nLearn more about the next wave of AI innovations at Bing.\nBefore the introduction of Next Phrase Prediction, the approach for handling query suggestions for longer queries was limited to completing the current word being typed by the user.\nNow type in \u201cThe best way to replace,\u201d and you\u2019ll immediately see three suggestions for completing the phrase: wood, plastic and metal. Type in \u201chow can I replace a battery for,\u201d and you\u2019ll see \u201ciphone, samsung, ipad and kindle\u201d all suggested.\n\nWith Next Phrase Prediction, Bing can now present users with full-phrase suggestions.\nThe more characters you type, the closer Bing gets to what you probably want to ask.\nAnd because these suggestions are generated instantly, they\u2019re not limited to previously seen data or just the current word being typed.\nSo, for some queries, Bing won\u2019t just save you a few keystrokes \u2014 but multiple words.\nAs a result of this work, the coverage of autosuggestion completions increases considerably, Microsoft reports, improving the overall user experience \u201csignificantly.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: CorporateTags: Artificial Intelligence | GPU | Turing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In this review, we are going to show you around the NVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000, which is a low power single slot GPU. We are then going to subject the Quadro RTX 4000 to our battery of compute-focused GPU tasks. Let us take a look at what the Quadro RTX 4000 has to offer.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000 Overview\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000 is a single-slot GPU with a length of 9.5\u2033 long. The outer case is very stylish with a shiny chrome covering and a bright green band across the middle. It is an impressive looking graphics card, be warned, it will attract fingerprints on the chrome surfaces.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000 Front\nWhile several of the Quadro RTX GPUs include a backplate, which we like, the Quadro RTX 4000 does not. This would add some structural rigidity and help protect the components mount on the backside of this $900 GPU.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000 Back\nAt the end of the Quadro RTX 4000, we find the video outputs, 3x DisplayPort 1.4, and 1x VirtualLink port for VR head-mounted displays.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000 Ports\nThe power connection is located at the end of the Quadro RTX 4000, which should be more comfortable for server mountings, 1x 8-Pin connection.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000 Fan GPU Support And Power\nThe top of the single-slot cooler card has stereo and sync ports for professional workstations, but there are no NVLink/ SLI connectors.\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000 Top and Fan\nWe wanted to take a moment and focus on why this single-slot configuration is going to be interesting to our readers. Aside from the typical professional workstations where a single-slot cooler can mean a smaller workstation, there is also an opportunity to maximize density. An example uses a Gigabyte C621 AORUS Xtreme motherboard designed for Xeon CPUs. Here, a total of seven Quadro RTX 4000 GPUs can be installed. For AI workloads that can scale to multiple GPUs better than scaling up in a single GPU, this is a great example of what can be accomplished using an off-the-shelf motherboard.\nGigabyte 7x RTX 4000 AI Deep Learning Platform\nNVIDIA offers much larger GPUs but the combination of the single-slot form factor and the blower-style cooler makes scaling to multiple GPUs more feasible.\nNext, let us take a look at the Quadro RTX 4000 key specifications and continue with our performance testing.\n\n\n\n \n\n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 REVIEW OVERVIEWDesign & Aesthetics9.0Performance9.1Feature Set9.0Value9.1SUMMARYIn our NVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000 review, we see why some consider this GPU an awesome choice for compute and tasks such as AI inferencing9.1OVERALL SCORE\n\n TAGSNVIDIANVIDIA Quadro RTXQuadro \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleMLPerf 0.7 Inference Released Others Join to Promote NVIDIA and IntelNext articleTyan Thunder SX GT90-B7113 1U 12x HDD 4x NVMe SSD Server William Harmonhttp://www.servethehome.com nvidia-quadro-rtx-4000-review-a-versatile-ai-and-professional-gpuIn our NVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000 review, we see why some consider this GPU an awesome choice for compute and tasks such as AI inferencing \n \nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAcemagic F3A an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 Mini PC with up to 128GB of RAM \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASUS ESC8000A-E13P Review an 8x PCIe GPU Server \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASRock Rack 4U8G-TURIN2 A Fresh Take on a Classic AI Server Design \n\n  \n\n\n\n3 COMMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin G\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            October 23, 2020\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            12:05 am                                            \n\n\n\nThe Quadro RTX 4000 has served me well at work in an external Thunderbolt GPU chassis as a portable production GPU.  It is an interesting use case as the raw GPU performance was not as critical as getting several check boxes marked on the feature set which precluded many of the lower end Quadros and made anything higher end pure overkill.  \nOne of the requisite features was support for the Quadro Sync II board so that it can be gen-locked with various video production equipment.  Since the Quadro RTX 4000 is a single slot board, the Quadro Sync II card fit in with the external GPU chassis. Note that the gen lock board can mount into a PCIe slot, all communication with the GPU card is done via ribbon cables.  In a small tower system, I\u2019ve rigged up the same genlock board inside a front panel bay to save on slot spacing.\nOne of the more interesting things I\u2019ve recently tested has been with nVidia voice where this graphics card get pulled in to do some audio processing in recent months.\nThe one thing on my wish list for any future nVidia A4000 replacement card would be include Thunderbolt 4 ports on the GPU itself instead of Virtual-Link.  It\u2019d be far more useful and there are a handful of video production boxes with Thunderbolt 3 interfaces that could hypothetically communicate directly with the A4000\u2019s hardware video encoders, reducing latency for real time encoding by a few critical hairs.  Similarly, an HDMI 2.1 port would be valuable for the video production area that I\u2019ve been involved in lately as a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter would not be necessary for display.  Though for a multidisplay system where timing is critical, having all the ports leveraging the same adapters does equalize time vs. one native HDMI port and multiple DP ports with active adapters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurt Barile\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            February 9, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            5:09 pm                                            \n\n\n\nI have installed the NVIDIA RTX 4000 on my Intel s2600stbr motherboard with 256GB ram and two 10 core intel Xeon silver 4210 CPUs with windows 10 pro for workstations, and got the message after compatibility check that due to programs running in the background or OS incompatible, can anyone help with this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiles\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            September 16, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            12:47 pm                                            \n\n\n\nI have an RTX 4000 in my Dell Precision T7610 with two 10 core Xeons and 128gb RAM. Very strangely the machine totally refused to boot up with the RTX card in the PCI-E 16x slot that in intended for the GPU card, so I removed it and put it in the lower PCI-E 16x slot and it\u2019s fine. Bit weird but there we go.\nIt runs hot. Even with the case fans running fairly energetically it was in the 80\u2019s on full load. I\u2019ve put a slot-fan both above and below the card forcing more air to blow all over it and it\u2019s shaved about 10 degrees off, much better. But now I\u2019m using three slots for a single slot card, which defeats the object somewhat! \nLovely card though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEAVE A REPLY\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\n\n\nPlease enter your name here\n\n\n\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\n\n\n\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign me up for the STH newsletter! \n\n\u0394 \nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Photo: Nvidia\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nUS computer graphics giant Nvidia will be directly employing more than 100 Palestinian engineers from the West Bank who have been working as external contractors with Mellanox Technologies, the Israeli company Nvidia acquired officially acquired this year for $7 billion.\nThe Palestinian engineers will work as salaried employees of Nvidia with benefits and perks, in a move hailed by Mellanox co-founder Eyal Waldman on social media as an \u201chistoric moment and an unprecedented achievement.\u201d The workers, from Hebron, Rawabi, and Nablus, were previously employed by the Palestinian software and IT services outsourcing company ASAL Technologies and subcontracted to Mellanox.\nSEE ALSO: How Israeli Tech Expertise Can Help Grow The Palestinian Startup Scene\nNow, they will be employees of Nvidia, a global, US-based company where they \u201cwill be the same as all other Nvidia employees in terms of compensation, in terms of opportunities to move between organizations, between locations. So it\u2019s a completely different status to be in, in terms of compensation, flexibility, responsibilities and opportunities for all of the Palestinian employees,\u201d Waldman says.\nWaldman tells NoCamels that Mellanox has been working with Palestinian engineers for a decade and the plan to employ them directly has been in the works for two years, before the Nvidia acquisition. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen but we set it as our goal,\u201d he says in a phone interview.\nIn terms of compensation, he adds, \u201cthey are now one of the highest compensated team in the Palestinian territories.\u201d\nMellanox\u2019s Eyal Waldman, left, with Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang in March 2019. Photo via Nvidia\nIn his Facebook post on Thursday, in Hebrew, English, and Arabic, Waldman praised the engineers for \u201ctheir commitment, their professionalism and their excellence that has led to the completion of this historic moment in which a leading international high-tech company directly employs personnel in the Palestinian Authority.\u201d\nHe also described working through outside criticisms, amid military conflicts and geopolitical tensions and putting the joint professional work first.\n\u201cThe daily positive interactions between the Palestinian and Israeli teams have repeatedly demonstrated the immense potential inherent in a respectful discourse between people and the ability to put aside opinions and perceptions and unite together in one common goal. I am proud of the teams for creating a winning connection, one that supports, creates and plays an integral part in the company\u2019s success story,\u201d wrote Waldman.\nHe tells NoCamels that he believes the teams from Palestinian areas will grow and that Nvidia is now looking for ways to directly employ about 20 Palestinian engineers from the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip. This will require working with the ruling authority in the Palestinian enclave. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to explore this opportunity,\u201d he explains.\nMellanox is one of just several companies with Palestinian workers in the West Bank and Gaza, and it has been a source of pride for the firm and Waldman. \nNvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang, right, shakes hands with Mellanox staff. Photo via Nvidia\nWhen the Nvidia acquisition deal was first announced in 2019, Waldman told Israeli media: \u201cI think a lot of employees became millionaires overnight, and I\u2019m very proud of that. In Israel and in the [Palestinian] territories, we have employees in Gaza, Rawabi, Nablus, Hebron who also have Mellanox shares, and I think we will all benefit from this sale.\u201d Sign up for our free weekly newsletterSubscribe\nMellanox\u2019s Palestinian workers had stock options even as contractors, and were reportedly offered to share a $3.5 million payout with the completion of the acquisition\nOther Israeli companies including Wix and Freightos, and multinationals like Microsoft Israel and Apple also work with Palestinian contractors in the West Bank and Gaza, and Waldman says should companies should go this route. \nIsrael\u2019s tech industry suffers from a shortage of workers and companies have slowly been outsourcing their development teams in countries like Ukraine, the US, Russia, and India.\nBut increasingly in recent years, Israeli and Palestinian entrepreneurs have touted a \u201cwin-win\u201d solution: hiring Palestinian talent.\nWaldman estimated that it requires about three to four months to bring Palestinian engineers up to speed with the training and says \u201cthey have great potential, they\u2019re very good employees, and they\u2019re very fast learners.\u201d \nMore companies, he tells NoCamels, should utilize this \u201cgreat talent pool.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for both sides\u2026It\u2019s a good opportunity for many companies and the more people do it, it\u2019s better for them. On the financial side, and I think it\u2019s also important for a geopolitical situation,\u201d he says.\nSEE ALSO: Hire The Neighbors: Could Israeli-Palestinian Tech Initiatives Prove To Be A Win-Win Arrangement?\nThe hope is that \u201csuccessful collaborations like this one will become more and more common in our region. And I call on more Israeli and international companies to make this day happen, to be exposed to the benefits of employing our neighbors and to discover the contribution that this connection can bring to our region,\u201d he wrote in the Facebook post.\n\u201cIn these days when polarization, hatred, nationalism and violence are taking up more and more space in our country, in our regions and our world \u2013 let us find the power to see the good, the right, the humane, the innovative, the conciliatory and the tolerant which exist on both sides and in every one of us,\u201d Waldman concluded.\n \n\nSubscribe to NoCamels weekly newsletter and get our top stories\n\nRelated posts\n\n\n\nEditors\u2019 & Readers\u2019 Choice: 10 Favorite NoCamels Articles\n\nOctober 31, 2024\n\n\n\n\nForward Facing: What Does The Future Hold For Israeli High-Tech?\n\nOctober 28, 2024\n\n\n\n\nImpact Innovation: Israeli Startups That Could Shape Our Future\n\nOctober 16, 2024\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli GreenTech Making Our World A Happier, Healthier Place\u00a0\n\nOctober 14, 2024\n \n\n\nFacebook comments\n\n\n\n\n\nlike usNoCamels - Israeli Innovation NewsRAW Podcast\n\n\nTop Stories\n\n\n\nEditors\u2019 & Readers\u2019 Choice: 10 Favorite NoCamels Articles\n\nOctober 31, 2024\n\n\n\n\nForward Facing: What Does The Future Hold For Israeli High-Tech?\n\nOctober 28, 2024\n\n\n\n\nImpact Innovation: Israeli Startups That Could Shape Our Future\n\nOctober 16, 2024\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli GreenTech Making Our World A Happier, Healthier Place\u00a0\n\nOctober 14, 2024\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoCamels.com is the leading news website covering breakthrough innovation from Israel for a global audience.\n\n\n\nWhy NoCamels?\nAbout Us\nPrivacy Policy & Terms\nTerms Of Service\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a9 2025 NoCamels\nDesigned and built by Studio DAY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to content\n\n\n\nOpen toolbar\n\nAccessibility Tools\n \n\n\n\n\nAccessibility Tools\n\n\n\nIncrease TextIncrease Text \n\n\n\nDecrease TextDecrease Text \n\n\n\nHigh ContrastHigh Contrast \n\n\n\nNegative ContrastNegative Contrast \n\n\n\nLight BackgroundLight Background \n\n\n\nLinks UnderlineLinks Underline \n\n\n\nReset\nReset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank You for 14 Wonderful Years!\n\n\nWe\u2019re pausing new activities but invite you to explore our archive of articles on Israeli innovation.

Become an Insider\n                    and start reading now.\nHave an account? Log in.\n\n\n\n\nYou can download Nvidia drivers right from the Nvidia website, or using an app called Nvidia GeForce Experience.\nIf you have an Nvidia GeForce card, you can install the GeForce Experience app to automatically install the right Nvidia drivers.\u00a0\nIf you have a different kind of Nvidia card or don't want to use the Experience app, you can manually download drivers from the Nvidia website.\u00a0\nBefore you download new Nvidia drivers, use the Windows Device Manager to find out what graphics card you have installed.\n\n\n\nFor years, Nvidia has been a leader in the field of computer graphics. Many of the most powerful computers on the market use Nvidia graphics cards.\nAnd like any part of your computer, the software on your Nvidia cards \u2014 also known as their \"drivers\" \u2014 occasionally need to be upgraded. Keeping your graphics card updated is vital, as outdated drivers can cause all sorts of glitches and bugs.\nLuckily, you don't need to pull the card out of your computer to update its drivers. You can just download new drivers, much like you would update a regular app.\nThere are two ways to download Nvidia drivers and keep your system up to date, but before you get started, you need to know what kind of Nvidia card is installed on your computer.\u00a0\n\n\nHow to find what kind of Nvidia graphics card you have\n1. Right-click the Windows icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen, and select \"Device Manager\" in the pop-up that appears.\n2. In the Device Manager, find the \"Display Adapters\" line and click the arrow next to it. This will show you all the graphics cards currently active on your computer.\n3. You should see the name of your graphics card. Write it down for reference. If it doesn't say \"Nvidia\" \u2014 it might say \"Intel\" or \"AMD\" instead \u2014 then you don't have an Nvidia card, and will need to download your drivers in a different way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Find out what kind of video card you have in the Device Manager.\n                                \n                        \n                        \n                        Dave Johnson/Business Insider\n                        \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nHow to download Nvidia drivers\nIn all cases, note that when you download and install Nvidia drivers, your screen may turn black or flash erratically. This is normal \u2014 the graphics card is testing out the new drivers, which can sometimes cause temporary visual glitches.\nIf you have an Nvidia Ge Force card\nWhen you looked at your graphics card, was it called an Nvidia \"GeForce\"? If so, Nvidia offers a free app that will download all the drivers you need automatically, similar to the way Windows keeps your other computer files up to date.\u00a0\nHere's how to use GeForce Experience:\n1. Open the Nvidia website in a browser.\n2. In the navigation menu across the top of the webpage, click \"Drivers\" and then click \"GeForce Drivers.\"\n3. In the \"Automatic Driver Updates\" section, click \"Download Now\" to download the GeForce Experience app.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                If you have a GeForce graphics card, you can use the GeForce Experience app to install drivers automatically.\n                                \n                        \n                        \n                        Dave Johnson/Business Insider\n                        \n                        \n\n\n\n4. Install the program, and then open it and let it identify what kind of graphics card you have. It should now download new drivers whenever they're available, and let you know how to install them \u2014 usually, this is as simple as clicking one button.\nIn some cases, the GeForce Experience app might have come pre-installed on your computer. If this is the case, find the app by searching for it, and then see if it has any drivers ready to download or install.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Open the app's \"Drivers\" tab to see what updates are available.\n                                \n                        \n                        \n                        Dave Johnson/Business Insider\n                        \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have another Nvidia card\nIf you don't have an Nvidia GeForce graphics card, or simply don't want to install the GeForce Experience app, you can check for and download drivers manually.\u00a0\n1. Open the Nvidia website in a browser.\n2. In the navigation menu across the top of the webpage, click \"Drivers\" and then click \"All Nvidia Drivers.\"\n3. In the Nvidia Driver Download form, search for your video card. Enter the product type (such as GeForce, Titan, or Quattro), product series, and specific product name. You should be able to get all this information from the Windows Device Manager.\u00a0\n4. When you're done, click \"Search.\"\n5.

Pair that with image detection to help geolocate balls, and you\u2019ve got a potent umpire tool that\u2019s hard to argue with.\nBut computer vision doesn\u2019t stop at baseball.\n\nWhat Is Computer Vision?\nComputer vision is a broad term for the work done with deep neural networks to develop human-like vision capabilities for applications, most often run on NVIDIA GPUs. It can include specific training of neural nets for segmentation, classification and detection using images and videos for data.\nMajor League Baseball is testing AI-assisted calls at the plate using computer vision. Judging balls and strikes on baseballs that can take just .4 seconds to reach the plate isn\u2019t easy for human eyes. It could be better handled by a camera feed run on image nets and NVIDIA GPUs that can process split-second decisions at a rate of more than 60 frames per second.\nHawk-Eye, based in London, is making this a reality in sports. Hawk-Eye\u2019s NVIDIA GPU-powered ball tracking and SMART software is deployed in more than 20 sports, including baseball, basketball, tennis, soccer, cricket, hockey and NASCAR.\nYet computer vision can do much more than just make sports calls.\nWhat Is Computer Vision Beyond Sports?\nComputer vision can handle many more tasks. Developed with convolutional neural networks, computer vision can perform segmentation, classification and detection for a myriad of applications.\nComputer vision has infinite applications. With industry changes from computer vision spanning sports, automotive, agriculture, retail, banking, construction, insurance and beyond, much is at stake.\n3 Things to Know About Computer Vision\n\nSegmentation: Image segmentation is about classifying pixels to belong to a certain category, such as a car, road or pedestrian. It\u2019s widely used in self-driving vehicle applications, including the NVIDIA DRIVE software stack, to show roads, cars and people.\u00a0 Think of it as a sort of visualization technique that makes what computers do easier to understand for humans.\n\n\nClassification: Image classification is used to determine what\u2019s in an image. Neural networks can be trained to identify dogs or cats, for example, or many other things with a high degree of precision given sufficient data.\n\n\nDetection: Image detection allows computers to localize where objects exist. It puts rectangular bounding boxes \u2014 like in the lower half of the image below \u2014 that fully contain the object. A detector might be trained to see where cars or people are within an image, for instance, as in the numbered boxes below.\n\nWhat You Need to Know: Segmentation, Classification and Detection\n\n\n\nSegmentationClassificationDetection\n\n\n\n\nGood at delineating objectsIs it a cat or a dog?Where does it exist in space?\n\n\nUsed in self-driving vehiclesClassifies with precisionRecognizes things for safety\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nNVIDIA\u2019s Deep Learning Institute offers courses such as Getting Started with Image Segmentation and Fundamentals of Deep Learning for Computer Vision.\u00a0\nLearn more about computer vision on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | ExplainerTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | GPU | NVIDIA DRIVE \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The review embargo for NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition is up today, and when the dust settles from reviews around the web (and the \u2018Tube) we will know how close to an RTX 2080 Ti this $499 graphic card can get. (Spoiler: this will vary depending on the game and use of RTX features.)\nIntroduction\nThe second entry in the consumer Ampere GPU lineup after the GeForce RTX 3080, the new GeForce RTX 3070 was originally planned for an October 15 launch, but NVIDIA pushed this back a couple of weeks to October 29.\nIt could be speculated that this intentionally precedes AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 6000 event by one day, but it could also allow for significantly better availability for the new GPU (we don\u2019t really have to mention RTX 3080 availability woes, do we?).\nSo what is the RTX 3070, anyhow? Is it a cut-down version of the 3080? No, it is new silicon. Based on the new GA104 GPU, the chip at the heart of the RTX 3070 is about 38% smaller than the RTX 3080\u2019s GA102 GPU (392 mm^2 vs. 628 mm^2), and it should consume significantly less power with a TGP rating of 220W \u2013 a full 100W below the RTX 3080\u2019s 320W rating.\nAs a smaller GPU manufactured on the same custom 8nm Samsung process, there will naturally be fewer Streaming Multiprocessors (SM), and therefore fewer CUDA Cores. The RTX 3080 has an SM count of 68, while the RTX 3070 is equipped with 46.\n \n\n\n\n\nRTX 3080\nRTX 3070\nRTX 2080 Ti\nRTX 2080 SUPER\nRTX 2080\n\n\nGPU\nGA102\nGA104\nTU102\nTU104\nTU104\n\n\nArchitecture\nAmpere\nAmpere\nTuring\nTuring\nTuring\n\n\nSMs\n68\n46\n68\n48\n46\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n8704\n5888\n4352\n3072\n2944\n\n\nTensor Cores\n272 (2nd Gen)\n184 (2nd Gen)\n544 (1st Gen)\n384 (1st Gen)\n368 (1st Gen)\n\n\nRT Cores\n68 (2nd Gen)\n46 (2nd Gen)\n68 (1st Gen)\n48 (1st Gen)\n46 (1st Gen)\n\n\nBase Clock\n1440 MHz\n1500 MHz\n1350 MHz\n1650 MHz\n1515 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1710 MHz\n1725 MHz\n1545 MHz\n1815 MHz\n1710 MHz\n\n\nTexture Units\n272\n184\n272\n192\n184\n\n\nROPs\n96\n96\n88\n64\n64\n\n\nMemory\n10GB GDDR6X\n8GB GDDR6\n11GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Data Rate\n19 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n15.5 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Interface\n320-bit\n256-bit\n352-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n760 GB/s\n448 GB/s\n616 GB/s\n496.1 GB/s\n448 GB/s\n\n\nTransistor Count\n28.0B\n17.4B\n18.6B\n13.6B\n13.6B\n\n\nDie Size\n628 mm^2\n392 mm^2\n754 mm^2\n545 mm^2\n545 mm^2\n\n\nProcess Tech\n8nm Samsung\n8nm Samsung\n12nm TSMC\n12nm TSMC\n12nm TSMC\n\n\nTGP\n320W\n220W\n250W\n250W\n215W\n\n\nLaunch Price\n$699\n$499\n$999/$1199\n$699\n$699\n\n\n\n \nFrom the table above you may notice a big difference in memory technology between RTX 3080 and this RTX 3070, as the latter employs 8GB of conventional GDDR6 on a 256-bit bus, while the former implements 10GB of much faster 19 Gbps GDDR6X on a 320-bit bus.\nThe effective speed of the RTX 3070\u2019s GDDR6 is 7000 MHz, providing a data rate of 14 Gbps, making the RTX 3070\u2019s memory configuration identical to the previous generation\u2019s RTX 2070 (8GB 256-bit GDDR6 @ 14Gbps).\nIn addition to the ~32% decrease in CUDA Core count (RTX 3080: 8704, RTX 3070: 5888) it seems reasonable to conclude that memory bandwidth will be a major point of differentiation between these RTX 30 Series GPUs, as the RTX 3080 offers 760 GB/s, while the RTX 3070 is limited to 448 GB/s.\n \n \n \n\n\nThe RTX 3070 Founders Edition Card\nA smaller, lighter card compared the RTX 3080 Founders Edition, this new 3070 FE design is a beautiful piece of industrial design (in this editor\u2019s opinion). I mean, just look at it!\n \n\n\nIt is also a more conventional design compared to the RTX 3080 Founders Edition, as both fans are positioned on the same side this time \u2013 though there is still a passthrough heatsink to the right of the PCB.\n \n\n\nThe RTX 3070 Founders Edition card is down to 9.5 inches (242 mm) in length, which is a reduction of 15% (1.7 inches / 43 mm) compared to the 11.2 inch (285 mm) length of the RTX 3080 FE. Both cards are 4.4 inches (112 mm) tall, with dual-slot width.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition Side\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition Display Outputs\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition Rear Angle\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition Side Angle\nThe RTX 3070 Founders Edition makes use of the same compact 12-pin power connection that we saw with the 3080 FE, but this time the power requirements are much lower as the GPU can be powered with a single 8-pin PCIe connector (more on power draw later).\nOn the well-ventilated bracket we see display outputs that mirror those of the RTX 3080 FE, with a trio of DisplayPort 1.4a and one HDMI 2.1 output, and the card supports a maximum resolution of 7680\u00d74320 (\u201c8K\u201d).\n \n \n \n\n\nPerformance\nThe following benchmarks will look familiar if you read the previous RTX 3080 Founders Edition review, wherein I freely admitted that the selection of games leaves quite a bit to be desired. However, the game benchmark suite being in need of an overhaul is not the topic today, as ultimately we want to present a picture of how the RTX 3070 FE stacks up against the RTX 2080 Ti.\nWhy the 2080 Ti, you ask? Simple. This was the performance level that NVIDIA had showcased during the announcement event back on September 1st, and if this card comes close, that will be quite an achievement given the price delta between those two cards.\n \n\n\n\nPC Perspective GPU Test Platform\n\n\nProcessor\nAMD Ryzen 9 3900X\n\n\nMotherboard\nASUS ROG Crosshair VIII HERO WIFI\n\n\nMemory\nHyperX Predator DDR4-3600 CL16 32GB (16GBx2)\n\n\nStorage\nSamsung 850 EVO 1TB SSD\n\n\nPower Supply\nCORSAIR RM1000x 1000W\n\n\nOperating System\nWindows 10 64-bit (1909)\n\n\nDrivers\nGeForce GRD 452.06 (1080 Ti/2080 FE/2080 Ti)GeForce GRD 456.16 (Press Driver, RTX 3080)GeForce GRD 456.96 (Press Driver, RTX 3070)Radeon Software Adrenalin 2020 Edition 20.8.3\n\n\n\n \n3DMark Time Spy\nWhile 3DMark doesn\u2019t always mirror real-world gaming results, it remains a handy way to measure the relative performance between graphics cards.\nFirst we see results from Time Spy, which is a 2560\u00d71440 resolution test:\n \n\n\n\n\nOur first benchmark result places the RTX 3070 FE about 11% below the RTX 2080 Ti, and about 22% above the RTX 2080 FE.\nNext we check out results from the 3840\u00d72160 resolution Time Spy Extreme test:\n \n\n\n\n\nUnder the more demanding 4K load of Time Spy Extreme the performance gap between the RTX 2080 Ti and this RTX 3070 FE narrows considerably, as they are just ~5.6% apart here. The RTX 3070\u2019s lead over the RTX 2080 FE grows to nearly 30% with this 4K version of the test.\n \nMetro Exodus\nOur first actual game benchmark is quite challenging even at its \u201chigh\u201d preset setting (with ultra and extreme lurking above, just waiting to destroy frame rates). Here Metro Exodus was run using the DirectX 12 API at both 2560\u00d71440 and 3840\u00d72160 resolutions.\nResults at 1440 are first:\n \n\n\nWith an average frame rate of 93.79 FPS the RTX 3070 FE sits about 6% below the 2080 Ti Strix OC\u2019s 100.03 FPS average at these settings (all benchmark results are averaged from three identical runs). For its part, the RTX 2080 FE managed 78.42 FPS, which gives the RTX 3070 FE an advantage of nearly 20% over that card in this test.\nNext we have results at 4K:\n \n\n\nAt \u201c4K\u201d (really it\u2019s UHD, but I don\u2019t have to bring that up EVERY time I suppose) the RTX 3070 FE averaged 56.71 FPS, a 7% decrease from the 61.04 FPS result with the RTX 2080 Ti. When comparing the RTX 3070 FE to the older RTX 2080 FE we see an increase of just over 20%.\nOf course this is just one DX12 benchmark, and we must move on.\n \nThe Division 2\nAs with Metro Exodus, Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division 2 was run using its \u201chigh\u201d preset and the DirectX 12 API option, at both 2560\u00d71440 and 3840\u00d72160 resolutions.\nWe begin with the 1440 results:\n \n\n\nHere the RTX 2080 Ti averaged 136.87 FPS, with the RTX 3070 FE close behind at 129.38 FPS. This result is ~5.5% lower than the 2080 Ti, and ~20% higher than the RTX 2080 FE.\nNext we look at the 4K result, again using the \u201chigh\u201d preset:\n \n\n\nThis time the RTX 2080 Ti averaged 78.75 FPS, with the RTX 3070 FE 8.5% lower at 72.08 FPS. At this resolution the RTX 3070 FE is again ~20% faster than the RTX 2080 FE.\n \nFar Cry 5\nFar Cry 5 is a DX11 game that is getting a little long in the tooth at this point, but when run at the \u201cultra\u201d preset with HD textures enabled it is a fairly challenging test \u2013 at 4K, anyhow.\n \n\n\nThis game benchmark represents the worst showing for the RTX 3070 FE in this small sample of results, with 68.8 FPS coming in well below the 78.8 FPS with the RTX 2080 Ti \u2013 a decrease of roughly 13%. The RTX 3070 FE was 14% faster than the 2080 FE at these settings.\n \nBright Memory Infinite\nThis RTX-infused test showcases Bright Memory Infinite, an in-development follow up (still listed as \u201cTBD\u201d) to Bright Memory that currently exists only as a benchmark. It is quite beautiful, and remains the most challenging 2560\u00d71440 test I\u2019ve found to date when set to its highest preset.\nHere we will look first at non-DLSS and then DLSS \u201cQuality\u201d preset results, each run at the highest \u201cvery high\u201d RTX setting at 2560\u00d71440 resolution:\n \n\n\n\n\nHere we see that, when ray tracing is added to the mix, the RTX 3070 FE can in fact top the RTX 2080 Ti, with the Bright Memory Infinite Benchmark showcasing a ~10% advantage with or without DLSS. When comparing the 3070 FE to the 2080 FE this lead grows to ~43% without DLSS and ~37% with DLSS enabled.\n \nBoundary RTX Benchmark\nJust like Bright Memory Infinite, Boundary RTX is a standalone benchmark from a game still in development. Still, it\u2019s a good test of DLSS-enabled RTX eye candy, and it was run at 2560\u00d71440 with the \u201cQuality\u201d preset toggled:\n \n\n\nHere the RTX 2080 Ti maintained a slim 3% advantage over the RTX 3070 FE (53.98 vs. 52.34 FPS), which is just outside of the normal margin of error. The RTX 3070 FE was ~29% faster than the RTX 2080 FE at these settings (52.34 vs. 40.43 FPS).\n \nPower Consumption\nPower draw was a big point of discussion around the RTX 3080 launch (other than availability, of course), with that card\u2019s 320W TGP causing quite a stir. Have no fear, the RTX 3070 has a much lower TGP of 220W \u2013 a reduction of 100W.\n \n\n\nThe RTX 3070 Founders Edition includes a single PCIe 8-Pin to 12-Pin adapter\nHere\u2019s a look at total board power draw from these two 30 Series Founders Edition cards under identical loads:\n \n\n\nTotal board power as reported by GPUZ topped out at 331.3W with the RTX 3080 FE, and 226.3W with our RTX 3070 FE.\nTotal system power from our GPU test platform is next, measured at the wall using a Watts Up Pro power meter:\n \n\n\nThese results speak for themselves. The RTX 3070 Founders Edition consumes less power under load than our RTX 2080 FE, and offers performance closer to our aftermarket RTX 2080 Ti. A total system draw of 343 W with a 10-core CPU in a gaming load is very impressive, to say the least. Part of this low draw is the Ryzen effect, but still.\nThe RTX 3070 will be much, much easier to deploy than the RTX 3080 given its smaller size and significantly lower power draw (~100W below the 3080 FE), which should make this the go-to high performance small form-factor GPU in the current NVIDIA lineup.\n \nTemps and Noise\nThe load temperatures from our RTX 3070 Founders Edition sample were very close to the RTX 3080 FE (77 \u00b0C), topping out at 74 \u00b0C during testing in a ~19.5 \u00b0C room (it\u2019s getting colder here in Michigan).\n \n\n\nAt idle the fans do not spin, and under load the fans never exceeded 50%, with 49% max speed recorded on both fans (1760 RPM) during the thermal tests. Naturally the load temps could drop with higher fan speeds, but the default fan curve produces a nice mix of cooling and very low noise.\nDoing some quick noise level testing using an SPL meter positioned just 12 inches from the leading edge of the GPU in an open case, the card was barely audible with a reading of only 31.4 dBA with the fans at 25%, moving up to 35.1 dBA with the fans at 50%. And while the fans did not exceed 50% by default, I did push them to 75% in my testing, which resulted in a reading of 46.7 dBA in this (unrealistic) test.\nBoth the thermals and (especially) the noise characteristics of the RTX 3070 Founders Edition card are impressive. It\u2019s a solid cooler design.\n \n \n \n\n\nConclusion\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition is a fantastic performer for $499. In the conventional raster-based graphics benchmarks we ran the 3070 FE averaged an ~8% decrease compared to the performance level of the RTX 2080 Ti, moving to within 4% of the 2080 Ti when factoring in RTX benchmarks as well.\nPerformance will naturally vary depending on the workload. When ray tracing was added to the mix the RTX 3070 FE can, in fact, top the RTX 2080 Ti, with the Bright Memory Infinite Benchmark showcasing a ~10% advantage with or without DLSS.\n \n\n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder how much faster this GA104 GPU might be if given more memory bandwidth, and NVIDIA has given themselves some room for a Ti/Super level GPU between the RTX 3070 and 3080 down the road. Certainly there will be something made of the 8GB framebuffer, particularly if AMD offers more VRAM at/near the same cost.\nWhat we know right now, and by right now I mean October 27, 2020, is that NVIDIA has the GPU to buy at $499 with the RTX 3070 Founders Edition \u2013 if you can buy one. Availability \u2013 of course \u2013 will be a big part of this launch. But what AMD announces on October 28 will be another part of the story, and we only have leaks and rumors on the AMD front at this point.\nNo matter what AMD announces, the RTX 3070 Founders Edition we reviewed today is a fantastic product. Beautifully designed, quiet under load, reasonable power draw, and nearly as powerful as the RTX 2080 Ti at less than half the cost. If only every GPU launch was like this.\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nReview Disclosures\n\n\n\n\nThis disclosure statement covers the way the product being reviewed was obtained and the relationship between the product's manufacturer and PC Perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Product Was Obtained\nThe GPU is on loan from NVIDIA for the purpose of this review.\n\n\nWhat Happens To Product After Review\nThe GPU remains the property of NVIDIA but will be on extended loan to PC Perspective for the purpose of future testing and product comparisons.\n\n\nCompany Involvement\nNVIDIA provided the product sample and technical brief to PC Perspective but had no control over the content of the review and was not consulted prior to publication.\n\n\nPC Perspective Compensation\nNeither PC Perspective nor any of its staff were paid or compensated in any way by NVIDIA for this review.\n\n\nAdvertising Disclosure\nNVIDIA has not purchased advertising at PC Perspective during the past twelve months.\n\n\nAffiliate Links\nThis article contains affiliate links to online retailers.

Now it\u2019s playing similar roles for architects, product designers and more.\t\t\t\n\n\nOctober 5, 2020 by Rick Merritt \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  It was the kind of career moment developers dream of but rarely experience. To whoops and cheers from the crowd at SIGGRAPH 2016, Dirk Van Gelder of Pixar Animation Studios presented Universal Scene Description.\nUSD would become the open-source glue filmmakers used to bind their favorite tools together so they could collaborate with colleagues around the world, radically simplifying the job of creating animated movies. At its birth, it had backing from three seminal partners\u2014Autodesk, Foundry and SideFX.\nToday, more than a dozen companies from Apple to Unity support USD. The standard is on the cusp of becoming the solder that fuses all sorts of virtual and physical worlds into environments where everything from skyscrapers to sports cars and smart cities will be designed and tested in simulation.\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s helping spawn machinima, an emerging form of digital storytelling based on game content.\nHow USD Found an Audience\nThe 2016 debut \u201cwas pretty exciting\u201d for Van Gelder, who spent more than 20 years developing Pixar\u2019s tools.\n\u201cWe had talked to people about USD, but we weren\u2019t sure they\u2019d embrace it,\u201d he said. \u201cI did a live demo on a laptop of a scene from Finding Dory so they could see USD\u2019s scalability and performance and what we at Pixar could do with it, and they really got the message.\u201d\nOne of those in the crowd was Rev Lebaredian, vice president of simulation technology at NVIDIA.\n\u201cDirk\u2019s presentation of USD live and in real time inspired us. It triggered a series of ideas and events that led to what is NVIDIA Omniverse today, with USD as its soul. So, it was fate that Dirk would end up on the Omniverse team,\u201d said Lebaredian of the 3D graphics platform, now in open beta, that aims to collaborate with Pixar and the 3D graphics community to carry the USD vision forward.\nDevelopers Layer Effects on 3D Graphics\nAdobe\u2019s developers were among many others who welcomed USD and now support it in their products.\n\u201cUSD has a whole world of features that are incredibly powerful,\u201d said Davide Pesare, who worked on USD at Pixar and is now a senior R&D manager at Adobe.\n\u201cFor example, with USD layering, artists can work in the same scene without stepping on each other\u2019s toes. Each artist has his or her own layer, so you can let the modeler work while someone else is building the shading,\u201d he said.\n\u201cToday USD has spread beyond the film industry where it is pervasive in animation and special effects. Game developers are looking at it, Apple\u2019s products can read it, we have partners in architecture using it and the number of products compatible with USD is only going to grow,\u201d Pesare said.\nThinking on a grand scale: NVIDIA and partner Esri, a specialist in mapping software, are both building virtual worlds using USD.\nBuilding a Virtual 3D Home for Architects\nAlthough it got its start in the movies, USD can play many roles.\nMillions of architects, engineers and designers need a way to quickly review progress on construction projects with owners and real-estate developers. Each stakeholder wants different programs often running on different computers, tablets or even handsets. It\u2019s a script for an IT horror film where USD can write a happy ending.\nCompanies such as Autodesk, Bentley Systems, McNeel & Associates and Trimble Inc. are already exploring what USD can do for this community. NVIDIA used Omniverse to create a video showing some of the possibilities, such as previewing how the sun will play on the glassy interior of a skyscraper through the day.\nProduct Design Comes Alive with USD\nIt\u2019s a similar story with a change of scene in the manufacturing industry. Here, companies have a cast of thousands of complex products they want to quickly design and test, ranging from voice-controlled gadgets to autonomous trucks.\nThe process requires iterations using programs in the hands of many kinds of specialists who demand photorealistic 3D models. Beyond de rigueur design reviews, they dream of the possibilities like putting visualizations in the hands of online customers.\nShowing the shape of things to come, the Omniverse team produced a video for the debut of the NVIDIA DGX A100 system with exploding views of how its 30,000 components snap into a million drill holes. More recently, it generated a video of NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics card, (below) complete with a virtual tour of its new cooling subsystem, thanks to USD in Omniverse.\n\n\u201cThese days my team spends a lot of time working on real-time physics and other extensions of USD for autonomous vehicles and robotics for the NVIDIA Isaac and DRIVE platforms,\u201d Van Gelder said.\nTo show what\u2019s possible today, engineers used USD to import into Omniverse an accurately modelled luxury car and details of a 17-mile stretch of highway around NVIDIA\u2019s Silicon valley headquarters. The simulation, to be shown this week at GTC, shows the potential for environments detailed enough to test both vehicles and their automated driving capabilities.\nAnother team imported Kaya, a robotic car for consumers, so users could program the digital model and test its behavior in an Omniverse simulation before building or buying a physical robot.\nThe simulation was accurate despite the fact \u201cthe wheels are insanely complex because they can drive forward, backward or sideways,\u201d said Mike Skolones, manager of the team behind NVIDIA Isaac Sim.\nLights! Camera! USD!\nIn gaming, Epic\u2019s Unreal Engine supports USD and Unity and Blender are working to support it as well. Their work is accelerating the rise of machinima, a movie-like spinoff from gaming demonstrated in a video for NVIDIA Omniverse Machinima.\nMeanwhile, back in Hollywood, studios are well along in adopting USD.\nPixar produced Finding Dory using USD. Dreamworks Animation described its process adopting USD to create the 2019 feature How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World. Disney Animation Studios blended USD into its pipeline for animated features, too.\nSteering USD into the Omniverse\nNVIDIA and partners hope to take USD into all these fields and more with Omniverse, an environment one team member describes as \u201clike Google Docs for 3D graphics.\u201d\nOmniverse plugs the power of NVIDIA RTX real-time ray-tracing graphics into USD\u2019s collaborative, layered editing. The recent \u201cMarbles at Night\u201d video (below) showcased that blend, created by a dozen artists scattered across the U.S., Australia, Poland, Russia and the U.K.\nThat\u2019s getting developers like Pesare of Adobe excited.\n\u201cAll industries are going to want to author everything with real time texturing, modeling, shading and animation,\u201d said Pesare.\nThat will pave the way for a revolution in people consuming real-time media with AR and VR glasses linked on 5G networks for immersive, interactive experience anywhere, he added.\nHe\u2019s one of more than 400 developers who\u2019ve had a hands-on with Omniverse so far. Others come from companies like Ericsson, Foster & Partners and Industrial Light & Magic.\n\nUSD Gives Lunar Explorers a Hand\nThe Frontier Development Lab (FDL), a NASA partner, recently approached NVIDIA for help simulating light on the surface of the moon.\nUsing data from a lunar satellite, the Omniverse team generated images FDL used to create a video for a public talk, explaining its search for water ice on the moon and a landing site for a lunar rover.\nBack on Earth, challenges ahead include using USD\u2019s Hydra renderer to deliver content at 30 frames per second that might blend images from a dozen sources for a filmmaker, an architect or a product designer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Herculean effort to get this in the hands of the first customers for production work,\u201d said Richard Kerris, general manager of NVIDIA\u2019s media and entertainment group and former chief technologist at Lucasfilm. \u201cWe\u2019re effectively building an operating system for creatives across multiple markets, so support for USD is incredibly important,\u201d he said.\nKerris called on anyone with an RTX-enabled system to get their hands on the open beta of Omniverse and drive the promise of USD forward.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait to see what you will build,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s not too late to get access to hundreds of live and on-demand talks at GTC.

It allows users to make modifications and navigate to the most pertinent parts of the data, all in real-time, to gather better insights faster.\nIn this post, you will learn about key IndeX features and its detailed deployment architecture and solution on AWS\nAWS and NVIDIA have collaborated for over 10 years to deliver powerful, cost-effective, and flexible GPU-based solutions for customers. NVIDIA is an AWS Advanced Technology Partner, and customers around the world are using AWS and NVIDIA solutions for machine learning (ML), virtual workstations, HPC, and Internet of Things (IoT) services.\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances powered by NVIDIA GPUs deliver the scalable performance needed for fast ML training, cost-effective ML inference, flexible remote virtual workstations, and powerful HPC computations.\nSolution Overview\nNVIDIA IndeX on AWS leverages GPU clusters for scalable, real-time visualization, and computing of multi-valued volumetric data together with embedded geometry data.\nUsers have two main options to use IndeX: the standalone IndeX Software Developer Kit (SDK), or as a plugin in ParaView, which is one of the most popular visualization tools in the scientific HPC community.\nIndeX has a direct plugin to load the compute data sets from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). This allows users to store massive datasets in S3 object storage and load them directly from the Amazon EC2 compute instances without copying them to the local storage.\nUsers can run IndeX on AWS using a custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from AWS Marketplace. Sample datasets from different scientific domains including astronomy, healthcare, and oil and gas are available in an S3 bucket which can be readily loaded to get a feel for the visualization experience provided by IndeX on Amazon EC2 instances.\nIn addition, users can bring their existing custom datasets used in their volume visualization workflows and render them by specifying the dataset parameters in a scene file.\nBenefits of Using NVIDIA IndeX on AWS\nStandard visualization workflows are characterized by sequential, time intensive steps that include:\n\nRunning simulation for days, weeks, or months.\nPreparing a subset of output data for visualization.\nTransferring and loading the data into visualization software for analysis.\nShare findings and repeating the process with another subset of data, and/or running additional simulations with new inputs.\n\nSuch a workflow is not practical in an on-premises environment, however, due to compute and storage resource constraints, collaboration challenges, and the time wasted if the visualization data demonstrates the simulation data was invalid.\nAWS provides an accelerated workflow that allows users to set up a configuration where simulation and visualization run on separate clusters. In this case, the simulation data running on a cluster is written to Amazon S3 object storage, can be visualized in another cluster by NVIDIA IndeX (directly loading from S3), and can be shared with any device on which a web browser is installed.\nThis workflow enables users to interactively explore and collaborate in real-time after the simulation has started, and can interrupt or restart simulations as needed.\nAWS also supports running simulation and visualization in-situ (i.e. on the same cluster). Here, the simulation data can be written to local storage (instance store) or network attached Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) and can be visualized, thus enabling users to interactively direct a simulation and test outcomes.\nAmazon EC2 GPU Instances\nAWS offers multiple GPU-accelerated instances for high performance compute, machine learning, and graphics intensive workloads (for volume visualization and rendering). For example, the Amazon EC2 P3 instance provides up to eight NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs with up to 32GB of memory each, up to 100 Gbps of networking throughput, and supports NVLink for GPU peer-to-peer communication.\nThe Amazon EC2 G4 instance offers a cost-effective solution and supports up to four NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs with 16GB of memory each, up to 50 Gbps of networking throughput. The EC2 G4 metal instance supports eight NVIDIA T4 GPUs and 100 Gbps of networking throughput.\nAWS also plans to offer NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs in the future. To learn more, sign up for our email list to receive updates.\nDepending on the size of the data sets, users have the flexibility to use either a single instance or cluster of instances and scale as needed. The instance can have a single GPU or multiple GPUs, IndeX automatically makes use of all available GPUs in an instance for optimal performance.\nThe goal is to provide visualization performance that scales with data so users can analyze the entire dataset in its original resolution aiding in faster scientific discoveries.\nUsing IndeX on AWS, users can take advantage of both the performance features that IndeX SDK offers and the elasticity and compute capability of AWS.\nDatasets for computational scientists continue to grow from terabytes to petabytes. AWS allows users to store such massive datasets in the cloud using storage services like Amazon S3, and enables multiple users to access the same datasets instead of making several local copies.\nNVIDIA IndeX Architecture on AWS\nUsers have multiple options for 3D volume rendering on AWS using IndeX. Here, I will share an example architecture diagram for single instance rendering and cluster rendering.\nSingle Instance Rendering\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Architecture for single instance rendering on AWS.\nIn the case of single instance rendering, the user will deploy an Amazon EC2 GPU-based instance in an AWS region using the IndeX AMI from AWS Marketplace.\nThe custom datasets required for volume rendering should be uploaded to S3. Optionally, the Amazon EC2 instance can be backed by an EBS volume if needed.\nWhen the Amazon EC2 GPU instance is running, the user can start a terminal and enable port forwarding via SSH tunneling to that instance. Once the connection is established, the user will launch another terminal and log in to the Amazon EC2 GPU instance and execute the IndeX SDK viewer script along with the sample or custom dataset for visualization.\nIn this case, we use IndeX\u2019s HTML5-based client viewer that receives a video stream from the IndeX server running on Amazon EC2, and allows for socket-based transfer of user interactions or commands back to the server to steer visualization.\nUsers can use a browser on their client system to render and visualize their output. Note that a user can use a single instance with single or multi-GPUs. IndeX will automatically scale to the maximum number of GPUs on a given instance.\nDetailed instructions are provided in the GitHub repository.\nCluster Rendering\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Architecture for cluster rendering on AWS.\nIn the case of cluster rendering, users can launch a cluster of Amazon EC2 GPU instances using AWS ParallelCluster. This is an AWS-supported open source cluster management tool that makes it easy to deploy and manage HPC clusters on AWS.\nWith AWS ParallelCluster, the user just needs to create a simple text file (config file) to model and provision the resources needed in terms of compute, storage, and networking in an automated secure manner. It also supports multiple batch schedulers like AWS Batch and Slurm for easy job submissions.\nFor cluster rendering on AWS using IndeX, the users will launch a cluster using the IndeX AMI from AWS Marketplace and required compute (GPU instances), storage (EBS, S3), networking and scheduler (Slurm) resources as specified in the ParallelCluster config file. In addition, users can load their custom datasets for visualization to S3.\nUsers can either use SSH tunneling (as shown in the single instance rendering section above) to launch the IndeX HTML5 client viewer on their local browser. They can also use a remote desktop using NICE DCV and launch a browser and IndeX client viewer there.\nHere, we show the remote desktop method, as it\u2019s quick and easy to deploy. Users can easily enable remote visualization using NICE DCV via AWS ParallelCluster configuration file.\nOnce the cluster is running, users can login to the Head node using the NICE DCV Client and launch the IndeX SDK viewer Slurm batch script, along with the sample or custom dataset for visualization.\nThe Slurm script is a wrapper that adds required parameters for network configuration based on environment variables set by Slurm Workload Manager for your cluster.\nOnce the job is running and server IP is printed on the terminal, user can open a browser (preferably Chrome) in the NICE DCV session and start visualizing their data.\nDetailed instructions are provided in the GitHub repository.\nExamples of Visualization Using NVIDIA IndeX on AWS\nParihaka \u2013 Seismic Data \u2013 Slices\nTaranaki Basin is an onshore-offshore rift basin on the West Coast of New Zealand approximate 400 km west of the Pacific-Australian plate boundary.\nThe seismic data of the Parihaka survey is located towards the northern part of the Basin and was acquired on 2004 by New Zealand Petroleum and Minerals. The survey covers an area of 1,7 sq.km and the seismic data volume consists of 1132 inlines and 2904 crosslines.\nNVIDIA IndeX is commonly used in the seismic interpretation systems for scalable, high-fidelity, and real-time visualization of seismic data. The visualization of the entire Parihaka seismic volume with embedded slices highlights that NVIDIA IndeX with its XAC technology can boost conventional seismic interpretations workflows.\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Parihaka Seismic Data Slices rendered using IndeX on AWS.\nSpecial thanks to Crown Minerals and the New Zealand Ministry of Economic Development for allowing us to display this Taranaki Basin dataset. Crown Minerals manages the New Zealand Government\u2019s oil, gas, mineral and coal resources.\nBig Brain \u2013 A Human Brain Dataset\nThe brain dataset is an ultra-high resolution scan of a human brain at nearly cellular resolution of 20 micrometers, based on the reconstruction of 7,404 histological sections.\nThis dataset contains the reconstituted sections in the coronal dimension. It shows aligned sections in the axial and sagittal dimension, and histological volumes in histological space.\nThe NVIDIA IndeX Accelerated Computing technology (XAC API) is the powerful tool that enables researchers to carve out and identify different features of particular interest inside the visualizations.\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Human brain dataset rendered using IndeX on AWS.\nSpecial thanks to Prof. Dr. med. Katrin Amunts and the Structural and Functional Organization of the Brain Lab at the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine, Research Centre J\u00fclich.\nSummary\nScientific visualization impacts all research disciplines, from microscopy over archaeology to astronomy. It\u2019s hard to use traditional scientific visualization solutions to visualize massive data sets gathered by complex simulations.\nNVIDIA IndeX on AWS addresses these challenges by providing a scalable, distributed, GPU-based architecture for highly parallelized, high performance computation and visualization. Running IndeX on AWS provides the ability to interactively explore and analyze huge visualizations and provides a collaborative workflow solution for multi-disciplinary teams.\nThe interactive scientific visualization on AWS comes with a per-user based EULA. Each user will be charged by $5 per hour per session. The price is independent of the number of instances, number of GPUs per session, or size of the dataset being visualized.\nIf you are interested in running IndeX on AWS subscribe to the IndeX AMI in AWS Marketplace.\n.  .\n\nNVIDIA \u2013 AWS Partner Spotlight\nNVIDIA is an AWS Advanced Technology Partner\u00a0that has collaborated with AWS for over 10 years to deliver powerful, cost-effective, and flexible GPU-based solutions for customers.\nContact NVIDIA | Practice Overview | AWS Marketplace\n*Already worked with NVIDIA?

In short, NVIDIA has confirmed that the Quadro brand is going away for sure, and as we suspected, it\u2019s largely due to the overlap between graphics and compute.\nAs a quick refresher, last week NVIDIA launched their new professional visualization-focused video card, the RTX A6000. Based on the new GA102 GPU, the card ticks all the boxes for a high-end, pro-grade video card; and under normal circumstances, it would be part of NVIDIA\u2019s Quadro family of products. However the card was notably excluded from the Quadro family in something of a last-minute change. At the time it wasn\u2019t clear just what this meant for the Quadro brand as a whole, but now that GTC has wrapped we\u2019ve been given some better insights into what\u2019s going on.\nFirst and foremost, NVIDIA has confirmed that the Quadro brand is being retired, or \u201cstreamlined\u201d as the company calls it. Similar to the Tesla brand a couple of years back, the brand is set to be slowly retired from the market, as new professional visualization cards are released without the Quadro branding. Going forward, all of these cards will be given brand-less names, such as the \u201cNVIDIA RTX A6000\u201d and \u201cNVIDIA A40\u201d.\n\nThe more interesting aspect to this change is why: why would NVIDIA retire one of its oldest video card brands after so long? After all, the market for pro cards isn\u2019t going away, and it remains a tidy, profitable business for NVIDIA. At the time we suspected that this has to do with the increasing overlap in NVIDIA\u2019s product lines between professional visualization cards and compute cards, and the company has since confirmed that our hunch was correct.\nAs NVIDIA has continued to expand into the compute market, their professional visualization (ProViz) and compute products have increasingly overlapped in terms of features and pricing. As NVIDIA already charges \u201cfull\u201d price for both their compute and ProViz cards, there are little-if-any feature differences between the two: desktop ProViz cards have the same access to compute features as compute cards. And compute cards, though almost exclusively server-mounted, can be provisioned as a virtual ProViz card as well.\nOne of the consequences of which has been that NVIDIA\u2019s own messaging on what cards can do what tasks has become unfocused, never mind potentially confusing customers. If you need an actively-cooled desktop card for running neural network prototyping, for example, what card do you buy? Previously it was the Quadro card, despite the fact that it was a ProViz part. Similarly, the ex-Tesla V100 makes a great part for provisioning a virtual Quadro instance, even though it\u2019s not a Quadro part.\nAs a result, NVIDIA has opted to go the route of essentially merging their compute and ProViz hardware lineups in an effort to simplify their offerings. NVIDIA wants for there to be a single brand \u2013 NVIDIA \u2013 which covers both markets, reflecting the flexibility of their cards and (largely) eliminating questions over which cards can be used for graphics or compute. At the same time, this also allows NVIDIA to reduce the number of hardware SKUs offered, as they no longer need overlapping products at the fringes of these markets.\nUltimately, the market for ProViz and for computing has quickly become one and the same. Though the two differ in their specific needs, they still use the same NVIDIA hardware and pay the same NVIDIA \u201cpremium\u201d. So both are set to become a single product line to cover the needs of all of NVIDIA\u2019s professional and commercial customers, whatever their graphics and compute needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n34 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\noRAirwolf - Tuesday, October 13, 2020 - link\n:|\n\n\n\nSmell This - Tuesday, October 13, 2020 - link\n'Quadro' comes from the initial collaboration/litigation between SGI and nVidia 20+ years ago ___ may have had some Elsa in there, too.3Dlabs Oxygen GVX1 PCIby Anand Lal Shimpi on December 1, 1999 3:26 AM ESThttps://www.anandtech.com/show/418\n\n\n\nSamus - Wednesday, October 14, 2020 - link\nI remember when a Quadro was nothing more than soldering some via's on the videocard, tricking the drivers into thinking you had a Quadro ;)\n\n\n\nValantar - Thursday, October 15, 2020 - link\nYou've got to love a site that keeps hosting their reviews, images and all, in a perfectly readable format and without major errors 21 years after publication.\n\n\n\ndomboy - Thursday, October 15, 2020 - link\nAgreed!

If anything quadros will be delayed until they have enough volume to meet demand while 3080/3090 will continue to drip in dozens at a time.\n\n\n\nCiccioB - Wednesday, October 14, 2020 - link\nA6000 cards use full featured GA102, while 3080 and 3090 do not.So the number of ex-Quadro card that can be build depends only on the capacity of Samsung to bake perfect chips.Seen that it seems it has problem doing any kind of big chip (full, less good and even-less-than-good) shortage is not determined by the existence of this ex-Quadro cards that are usually sold in small percentages with respect to the gaming ones.\n\n\n\nGigaplex - Tuesday, October 13, 2020 - link\nWhat does this mean for the \"gaming vs business\" driver validation segmentation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Based on the Ampere architecture first launched back in September for the GeForce RTX 3080, the RTX 3070 is NVIDIA\u2019s $500 take on a next-gen video card, incorporating a leaner Ampere GPU and otherwise shrinking Ampere down to something that\u2019s a bit lighter on the wallet. Fittingly, whereas the RTX 3080 was positioned for 4K gaming, the RTX 3070 is being aimed at the 1440p crowd, a lower resolution that the Ampere card is very capable of handling. Reviews of NVIDIA\u2019s Founders Edition (reference) card are going out today, with retail sales of NVIDIA and partner cards set to kick off on October 29th.\nThe latest in a long-line of xx70 video cards from NVIDIA\u2019s well-calibrated product stack, the RTX 3070 is designed to fill a familiar and important role for NVIDIA, rounding out NVIDIA\u2019s high-end product stack with a more value-orientated enthusiast offering. 70 cards are seldom as flashy as 80 cards \u2013 flashy costs money \u2013 but they\u2019re typically the strongest value proposition among NVIDIA\u2019s enthusiast cards. Though the price tag of $499 (and higher) is still a significant one overall.\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 was originally set to launch on October 15th. However following the rougher-than-expected launch for the RTX 3080, where the launch shipment of cards sold out quickly even by video card standards, NVIDIA held back the RTX 3070 launch by two weeks to have \u201cmore cards available on launch day\u201d by building up an extra two weeks of stock. We\u2019ll see how things go on Thursday, but as is virtually always the case, I\u2019m still expecting these cards to sell out. This year more than any other, gaming is in \u2013 especially since you can\u2019t go out.\nDiving into the nuts and nuts and bolts of the RTX 3070, this card marks the debut of NVIDIA\u2019s second Ampere GPU, GA104. Cut from the same cloth as the GA102 chip found in RTX 3080/3090, GA104 offers all of Ampere\u2019s functionality and architecture changes, from the use of second-generation ray tracing cores and significantly revised SMs out to HDMI 2.1 output support, just at a smaller scale. Overall GA104 weighs in at 17.4 billion transistors, with a die size of 393mm2. And, like GA102 before it, the chip is being made on Samsung\u2019s 8nm process.\nThis marks the second time in a row that NVIDIA has minted a separate GPU design for an xx70 card, instead of reusing the GPU used in xx80. For consumers the difference isn\u2019t material to performance, but from a big-picture point of view is means that the 3070 isn\u2019t made from salvaged GA102 dies. Given NVIDIA\u2019s supply constraints with RTX 3080 (GA102) this should mean that they have an easier time keeping up with demand, since smaller dies yield better and NVIDIA gets more of them per wafer.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nRTX 3070\nRTX 3080\nRTX 2070\nGTX 1070\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n5888\n8704\n2304\n1920\n\n\nROPs\n96\n96\n64\n64\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1.725GHz\n1.71GHz\n1.62GHz\n1683MHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n14Gbps GDDR6\n19Gbps GDDR6X\n14Gbps GDDR6\n8Gbps GDDR5\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n256-bit\n320-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n\n\nVRAM\n8GB\n10GB\n8GB\n8GB\n\n\nSingle Precision Perf.\n20.3 TFLOPs\n29.8 TFLOPs\n7.5 TFLOPs\n6.5 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor Perf.

The card also comes with 96 ROPs, thanks once again to NVIDIA decoupling the ROPs from the memory controllers, which is another significant improvement from past cards and actually puts the RTX 3070 at parity with the RTX 3080. Speaking of parity, rated clockspeeds are also virtually identical to the RTX 3070, with an official boost clock of 1.725GHz.\nBy the numbers then, on paper the RTX 3070 offers 68% of RTX 3080\u2019s shading/texturing/compute performance, but 101% of its pixel throughput performance. This is a fairly big spread, and unsurprisingly net result is something that meets in the middle of those figures \u2013 and to the RTX 3070\u2019s favor. Otherwise, like the RTX 3080 before it, the RTX 3070 is a significant step up over the RTX 2070/2070S it replaces, offering a bigger generation-over-generation leap than the RTX 2070, though as far as upgrades go, NVIDIA\u2019s target market for the card remains GTX 1070 and other Pascal card owners.\n\nAlong with the smaller GPU, another area where RTX 3070 dials things down relative to the RTX 3080 is with memory. Whereas NVIDIA\u2019s Ampere gaming launch card shipped with 10GB of the new GDDR6X memory, RTX 3070 only comes with 8GB of GDDR6. The end result is that RTX 3070 gets 448GB/sec of memory bandwidth thanks to its 256-bit memory bus, which is around 58%. So it\u2019s a not-insignificant drop there, and a big part of why RTX 3070 is focused on 1440p gaming even though it has 96 ROPs. NVIDIA isn\u2019t feeding the beast nearly as heartily.\nIn fact I\u2019m a bit surprised here that NVIDIA only went with 14Gbps GDDR6 for the card, given that 16Gbps GDDR6 is (theoretically) readily available. This is the same memory clockspeed that high-end GDDR6 RTX 20-series cards used, so the RTX 3070 doesn\u2019t offer any more memory bandwidth than the RTX 2070(S). Ultimately memory bandwidth is just one factor driving a GPU\u2019s performance, but I would have expected NVIDIA to at least use 16Gbps memory here to squeeze out a bit more performance from the card.\nOtherwise, the use of GDDR6 instead of GDDR6X is unsurprising. GDDR6X is still new and only comes from a single manufacturer, so even if Micron can supply it in the volumes NVIDIA would want, GDDR6 is still going to be cheaper by virtue of a larger pool of suppliers. With that said, NVIDIA has confirmed that GA104 is capable of using GDDR6X as well, so while it\u2019s not used today for the RTX 3070, you can easily envision NVIDIA offering an RTX 3070 Super down the line with 8 or 16 gigabytes of the faster memory; NVIDIA has left themselves a clear mid-generation upgrade path.\nMoving on, let\u2019s talk about power consumption. With a smaller GPU and slower memory, NVIDIA has been able to significantly dial down the TDP of the RTX 3070 compared to the joule-bingeing RTX 3080. The RTX 3070 has a TDP of 220W, 100W under the RTX 3080 and comparable to the likes of the last-generation RTX 2080. To be sure, NVIDIA is still paying for a good chunk of the card\u2019s overall performance gains with increased power consumption \u2013 the RTX 2070 Founders Edition was a 185W card \u2013 but it\u2019s more in line with historical norms for high-end NVIDIA cards.\nThis is notable not only because it opens the door to the RTX 3070 being more energy efficient than the RTX 3080, but because it means the RTX 3070 just flat-out plays more nicely in more systems. The card doesn\u2019t need quite as powerful of a PSU to drive it, or a case that can dissipate 300W+ of video card heat on top of the CPU and other heat sources. So for prospective gamers who might have been worried about feeding (or cooling) that beast, the RTX 3070 is a better experience in both regards. In that respect, it\u2019s a successor of sorts to the RTX 2080, occupying a virtually identical thermal design point.\n\nAnd speaking of cooling, the RTX 3070 gets a variant on NVIDIA\u2019s new \u201cflow through\u201d cooler. As with the RTX 3080, this means that NVIDIA has used a short PCB in order to leave the far side of the card open to directly push air through the unencumbered heatsink in order to improve cooling and reduce noise. However the lower-power, lower-heat RTX 3070 is a bit simpler overall, and more typical looking as well. Instead of a rear-mounted fan, RTX 3070\u2019s flow through cooler puts both fans on the front, with the right fan pushing air through instead of pulling. The difference is not too significant on the mechanics of the cooler, but it underscores how RTX 3070 is a more conventionally-designed card than RTX 3080. Coupled with its 9.5-inch length, and it doesn\u2019t look too far out of place from the RTX 2070.\nDo note, however, that you\u2019ll still need a 12-pin power connector to feed the card. As with the RTX 3080, NVIDIA is sticking with their new power connector standard here, and including a new 8-pin to 12-pin adapter to handle backwards compatibly. Curiously, this is not the same adapter that NVIDIA includes with the RTX 3080/3090 \u2013 that card gets a 2x8-pin to 12-pin adapter \u2013 and instead, owing to the fact that the RTX 3070 only needs 145W from an external power cable, this is a 1x8-pin to 12-pin adapter.\n\nConsequently, we now have multiple types of 12-pin adapters floating around. And while I haven\u2019t yet tried the new adapter with the RTX 3080, since this adapter only populates half of the pins on the 12-pin connector, I imagine that 1x8-to-12 adapters won\u2019t lead to any real problems beyond finding out you have the wrong adapter in a drawer in 5 years\u2019 time. In the meantime, needing to distribute adapters now is the price NVIDIA is willing to pay to ensure that at least their high-end RTX 30-series cards use a single, consistent power connector.\nPower connector excitement aside, the rest of the I/O and ports remain unchanged from the RTX 3080. This means 3x DisplayPort 1.4 outputs, and 1x HDMI 2.1 port. Similarly, this means that the card can drive 4 displays overall.\nProduct Positioning & The Competition\nAs mentioned previously, NVIDIA is aiming the RTX 3070 at 1440p gaming. The card does have enough power to play with 4K in some games, especially as games have yet to catch up with the performance gains from NVIDIA\u2019s new cards, but going forward that\u2019s not expected to be the case. And anyhow, with only 8GB of VRAM, the RTX 3070 doesn\u2019t have much to spare for even larger buffers.\nFor this week\u2019s launch NVIDIA is once again selling its reference (Founders Edition) cards at retail. From a specifications standpoint these cards are identical to the baseline RTX 3070 specifications; NVIDIA previously stopped factory overclocking FE cards, and it hasn\u2019t returned. So flow through cooler aside, the performance of the RTX 3070 FE should be representative of other RTX 3070 cards as well.\nHow you can go about buying NVIDIA\u2019s reference card has changed, however. Following the 3080 launch, NVIDIA is not directly selling the RTX 3070 themselves. Rather they\u2019ve now farmed that task out to Best Buy and Microcenter stores, leveraging the two retailers\u2019 more battle tested ordering systems. NVIIDA\u2019s cards will still undoubtedly sell out, but after doubts about NVIDIA\u2019s own ordering systems, this will hopefully help with the matter.\nAnd though we can\u2019t talk about them today, NVIDIA\u2019s AIB partners will also be rolling out their own custom RTX 3070 card designs as well. For a 220 Watt card we\u2019re in well-tread territory here, so expect to see the tried and true triple fan designs that have come to dominate 200W+ video cards.\nOn a side note, it\u2019s worth mentioning that both NVIDIA\u2019s first-party cards and the AIB cards will come with a bundle (of sorts). NVIDIA is extending their GeForce NOW offer from the RTX 3080/3090 to cover the new RTX 3070 cards as well. So all RTX 3070 cards will come with a free year\u2019s Founders subscription for NVIDIA\u2019s game streaming service. NVIDIA\u2019s paid tier doesn\u2019t come with any games, so it\u2019s not really a game bundle, but the tier does offer priority access as well as using NVIDIA\u2019s DX12 Ultimate (RTX)-capable VM instances.\nMeanwhile, for the launch of the RTX 3070 NVIDIA is once again following their usual generation + 2 strategy for pitching the RTX 3070 as an upgrade buy. That is to say that NVIDIA is not positioning the card as an upgrade for RTX 2070 (Turing) owners, but rather as an upgrade for GTX 1070 (Pascal) owners. This is because the performance uplift from the RTX 3070, though significant, is generally not enough to justify throwing down $500 for another video card after two years. But also, with this generation\u2019s launch in particular, there aren\u2019t a ton of end-user feature differences between Ampere and Turing cards, whereas the difference between Ampere and Pascal is substantial in every way. So you should expect to see NVIDIA talking up the performance and DirectX 12 Ultimate feature set of the RTX 3070 cards as the company looks to woo Pascal and Maxwell owners who have yet to see the ray traced light.\nComplicating matters a bit for NVIDIA, however, will be pricing. The GTX 1070 was a (nominally) $379 card, while the RTX 3070 is a $500 card. NVIDIA raised prices almost across the board with the RTX 20-series, and those higher prices have stuck with the RTX 30-series. So to sell the RTX 3070 as a replacement for older Pascal and Maxwell cards, NVIDIA not only needs to sell current users on performance and/or features, but they also have to convince those customers to pay a decent amount more than their last video card. Since this pricing came into effect with the RTX 20-series two years ago, this certainly isn\u2019t a new challenge for NVIDIA, but it\u2019s one more thing for potential buyers to think about when looking at video cards.\nThen there\u2019s the other thing that buyers will be thinking about: AMD. Between today and the RTX 3070 retail launch on Thursday will be AMD\u2019s well-publicized Radeon RX 6000 keynote on Wednesday. We are not expecting AMD to immediately have cards for sale, but AMD will get to potentially play a spoiler role by announcing new cards right before the RTX 3070 goes on sale. We don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to even see an RTX 3070-class comparator announced by AMD tomorrow, but if they do announce something, they could undercut NVIDIA\u2019s momentum.\nRealistically, regardless of what AMD does I expect RTX 3070 cards to sell out on Thursday simply because it\u2019s a high-end video card launch and there\u2019s never enough supply to go around. But they could at least force NVIDIA to evaluate their long-term position once both vendors can ship cards in consistent, high volumes. So as of today, the RTX 3070\u2019s place in the world is not set in stone; the rest of the world will be taking shape tomorrow with AMD\u2019s keynote.\nIn the meantime, anyone who is looking to buy an RTX 3070 on Thursday will want to move quickly. Between the various retailers both NVIDIA and AIB cards will be available on Thursday, but as the RTX 3080 has shown us, there\u2019s no shortage of demand for new video cards. So although things should be smoother than last month, one way or another the launch-day supply of RTX 3070 cards are almost certain to sell out.\nWrapping things up for now, we\u2019ll have more on the subject of video cards tomorrow with AMD\u2019s keynote. This will be followed by our long-awaited (and badly delayed) NVIDIA Ampere series review in about a week, going over the architecture in depth as well as our complete performance breakdown for the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070. So stay tuned, it\u2019s going to be a busy time for GPUs around here.\n\n\n\nQ4 2020 GPU Pricing Comparison\n\n\nAMD\nPrice\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\u00a0\n$1499\nGeForce RTX 3090\n\n\nTBD?\n$699\nGeForce RTX 3080\n\n\n\u00a0\n$499\nGeForce RTX 3070\n\n\nRadeon RX 5700 XT\n$399\nGeForce RTX 2060 Super\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n38 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nDanNeely - Tuesday, October 27, 2020 - link\nIs the price $449 (article title) or $499 (article body)?\n\n\n\nRyan Smith - Tuesday, October 27, 2020 - link\nThe problem with repeating digits is that sometimes the wrong digits repeat!The body is correct.

This will give many plenty of time in getting their RTX 2080ti sold at perhaps a decent price? That is of course before the (pricing) bottom falls out for all previous 10/20 series cards. Once the supply issues are solved and with especially the gamers snapping up readily available 'base 3080's' at around $500, I wonder what used 2080ti's will drop down to? For a man like me working at Walmart driving a forklift on the third shift probably quite affordable. Of course I still do not get where the people get all that money from to buy hardware luxury items like this?

At Roborace, they\u2019re removing humans from the field as well, without sacrificing any of the action.\nRoborace is envisioning autonomous racing for the future. Teams compete using standardized cars powered by their own AI algorithms in a series of races testing capabilities such as speed and object detection. Last month, the startup launched its Season Beta, running entirely autonomous races and streamed live online for a virtual audience.\nThis second season features Roborace\u2019s latest vehicle, the Devbot 2.0, a state-of-the-art race car capable of both human and autonomous operation and powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX platform. Devbot was designed by legendary movie designer Daniel Simon, who has envisioned worlds straight out of science fiction for films such as Tron, Oblivion and Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\n\nEach Season Beta event consists of two races. In the first, teams race their Devbots autonomously with no obstacles. Next, the challenge is to navigate the same track with virtual objects, some of which are time bonuses and others are time penalties. The team with the fastest overall time wins.\n\nThese competitions are intended to put self-driving technology to the test in the extreme conditions of performance racing, pushing innovation in both AI and the sport of racing itself. Teams from universities around the world have been able to leverage critical data from each race, developing smarter and faster algorithms for each new event.\nFrom the Starting Line\nSeason Beta\u2019s inaugural event provided the ideal launching point for iterative AI algorithm development.\nThe first two races took place on Sept. 24 and 25 at the world-renowned Anglesey National Circuit in Wales. Teams from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University, University Graz Austria, Technical University Pisa and commercial racing team Acronis all took to the track to put their AV algorithms through their paces.\n\nRacing stars such as Dario Franchitti and commentators Andy McEwan and Matt Roberts helped deliver the electrified atmosphere of high-speed competition to the virtual racing event.\n\nRadio interruptions and other issues kept the teams from completing the race. However, the learnings from Wales are set to make the second installment of Roborace Season Beta a can\u2019t-miss event.\nReady for Round Two\nThe autonomous racing season continues this week at Thruxton Circuit in Hampshire, U.K. The same set of teams will be joined by a guest team from Warwick Engineering Society and Warwick University for a second chance at AV racing glory.\nSergio Pininfarina, CEO of the legendary performance brand, will join the suite of television presenters to provide color commentary on the races.\nThe high-performance, energy-efficient NVIDIA DRIVE AGX platform makes it easy to enhance self-driving algorithms and add new deep neural networks for continuous improvement. By leveraging the NVIDIA AI compute platform, Roborace teams can quickly update their vehicles from last month\u2019s race for optimal performance.\nDespite one vehicle\u2019s crash due to an error in the code on the first day of the second event, one Devbot was able to successfully complete the course completely autonomously \u2014 a major milestone for the new sport.\nBe sure to tune in live\u00a0to witness the future of racing in action, catch up on highlights and mark your calendar for the rest of Roborace Season Beta.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And they\u2019re only truly possible on NVIDIA Xavier, our system-on-a-chip for autonomous vehicles.\nThe key to these cutting-edge vehicles is inference \u2014 the process of running AI models in real time to extract insights from enormous amounts of data. And when it comes to in-vehicle inference, NVIDIA Xavier has been proven the best \u2014 and the only \u2014 platform capable of real-world AI processing, yet again.\nNVIDIA GPUs smashed performance records across AI inference in data center and edge computing systems in the latest round of MLPerf benchmarks, the only consortium-based and peer-reviewed inference performance tests. NVIDIA Xavier extended its performance leadership demonstrated in the first AI inference tests, held last year, while supporting all new use cases added for energy-efficient, edge compute SoC.\nInferencing for intelligent vehicles is a full-stack problem. It requires the ability to process sensors and run the neural networks, operating system and applications all at once. This high level of complexity calls for a huge investment, which NVIDIA continues to make.\nThe new NVIDIA A100 GPU, based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, also rose above the competition, outperforming CPUs by up to 237x in data center inference. This level of performance in the data center is critical for training and validating the neural networks that will run in the car at the massive scale necessary for widespread deployment.\nAchieving this performance isn\u2019t easy. In fact, most of the companies that have proven the ability to run a full self-driving stack run it on NVIDIA.\nThe MLPerf tests demonstrate that AI processing capability lies beyond the pure number of trillions of operations per second (TOPS) a platform can achieve. It\u2019s the architecture, flexibility and accompanying tools that define a compute platform\u2019s AI proficiency.\nXavier Stands Alone\nThe inference tests represent a suite of benchmarks to assess the type of complex workload needed for software-defined vehicles. Many different benchmark tests across multiple scenarios, including edge computing, verify whether a solution can perform exceptionally at not just one task, but many, as would be required in a modern car.\nIn this year\u2019s tests, NVIDIA Xavier dominated results for energy-efficient, edge compute SoCs \u2014 processors necessary for edge computing in vehicles and robots \u2014 in both single-stream and multi-stream inference tasks.\nXavier is the current generation SoC powering the brain of the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX computer for both self-driving and cockpit applications. It\u2019s an AI supercomputer, incorporating six different types of processors, including CPU, GPU, deep learning accelerator, programmable vision accelerator, image signal processor and stereo/optical flow accelerator.\nNVIDIA DRIVE AGX Xavier\nThanks to its architecture, Xavier stands alone when it comes to AI inference. Its programmable deep neural network accelerators optimally support the operations for high-throughput and low-latency DNN processing. Because these algorithms are still in their infancy, we built the Xavier compute platform to be flexible so it could handle new iterations.\nSupporting new and diverse neural networks requires processing different types of data, through a wide range of neural nets. Xavier\u2019s tremendous processing performance handles this inference load to deliver a safe automated or autonomous vehicle with an intelligent user interface.\nProven Effective with Industry Adoption\nAs the industry compares TOPS of performance to determine autonomous capabilities, it\u2019s important to test how these platforms can handle actual AI workloads.\nXavier\u2019s back-to-back leadership in the industry\u2019s leading inference benchmarks demonstrates NVIDIA\u2019s architectural advantage for AI application development. Our SoC really is the only proven platform up to this unprecedented challenge.\nThe vast majority of automakers, tier 1 suppliers and startups are developing on the DRIVE platform. NVIDIA has gained much experience running real-world AI applications on its partners\u2019 platforms. All these learnings and improvements will further benefit the NVIDIA DRIVE ecosystem.\nRaising the Bar Further\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there. NVIDIA Orin, our next-generation SoC, is coming next year, delivering nearly 7x the performance of Xavier with incredible energy-efficiency.\nNVIDIA Orin\nXavier is compatible with software tools such as CUDA and TensorRT to support the optimization of DNNs to target hardware. These same tools will be available on Orin, which means developers can seamlessly transfer past software development onto the latest hardware.\nNVIDIA has shown time and again that it\u2019s the only solution for real-world AI and will continue to drive transformational technology such as self-driving cars for a safer, more advanced future.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Soon anyone who wants to dust off their old films may be able to use his neural networks.\nThe story began with a blog on Telegram by the Russian entrepreneur currently living in Gda\u0144sk, Poland.\n\u201cSome years ago I started to blog about machine learning and play with different algorithms to understand it better,\u201d said Shiryaev, who later founded the startup known by its web address, neural.love. \u201cI was generating music with neural nets and staging Turing tests of chatbots \u2014 silly, fun stuff.\u201d\nEight months ago, he tried an AI experiment with a short, grainy film he\u2019d found on YouTube of a train in 1896 arriving in a small French town. He used open-source software and AI models to upscale it to 4K resolution and smooth its jerky motion from 15 frames per second to 60 fps.\n\u201cI posted it one night, and when I woke up the next day, I had a million views and was on the front page of Reddit. My in-box was exploding with messages on Facebook, LinkedIn \u2014 everywhere,\u201d he said of responses to the video below\n\nNot wanting to be a one-hit wonder, he found other vintage videos to work with. He ran them through an expanding workflow of AI models, including DeOldify for adding color and other open-source algorithms for removing visual noise.\nHis inbox stayed full.\nHe got requests from a media company in the Netherlands to enhance an old film of Amsterdam. Displays in the Moscow subway played a vintage video he enhanced of the Russian capital. A Polish documentary maker knocked on his door, too.\nEven the USA was calling. PBS asked for help with footage for an interactive website for its documentary on women\u2019s suffrage.\n\u201cThey had a colorist for the still images, but even with advances in digital painting, colorizing film takes a ridiculous amount of time,\u201d said Elizabeth Peck, the business development manager for the five-person team at neural.love.\nNVIDIA RTX Speeds AI Work 60x+\nAlong the way, Shiryaev and team got an upgrade to the latest NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPU. It could process 60 minutes of video in less time than an earlier graphics card took to handle 90 seconds of footage.\nThe RTX card also trains the team\u2019s custom AI models in eight hours, a job that used to take a week.\n\u201cThis card shines, it\u2019s amazing how helpful the right hardware can be,\u201d he said.\nAI Film Editor in the Cloud\nThe bright lights the team sees these days are flashing images of a future consumer service in the public cloud. An online self-serve AI video editor could help anyone with a digital copy of an old VHS tape or Super8 reel in their closet.\n\u201cPeople were sending us really touching footage \u2014 the last video of their father, a snippet from a Michael Jackson concert they attended as a teenager. The amount of personal interest people had in what we were doing was striking,\u201d explained Peck.\nIt\u2019s still early days. Shiryaev expects it will take a few months to get a beta service ready for launch.\nMeanwhile, neural.love is steering clear of the VC world. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take money until we are sure there is a market and we have a working product,\u201d he said.\nYou can hear more of neural.love\u2019s story in a webinar hosted by PNY Technologies, an NVIDIA partner.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Machine Learning | NVIDIA in Europe | NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It\u2019s a very good card. But if you\u2019ve been following the RTX 30 series the last couple of months, you will know it\u2019s also been very difficult to get your hands on one, and it will likely remain difficult well into next year.I knew I wanted to upgrade my graphics card this year, and I was dead set on buying the RTX 3080, but it literally sold out as soon as preorders went up. (Damn bots.) So I decided I\u2019d be okay with a 3070; It\u2019s not like I have a 4K monitor yet anyway. This morning, I decided to shoot my shot.Wait for it...I fired up two monitors with 20 different tabs spread across four Google Chrome windows, plus an extension that would automatically refresh those tabs to make sure I wouldn\u2019t miss.Newegg went out of stock instantly. Micro Center, too. On my screens, they went straight from not having opened preorders to being completely sold out.I bet it all on Best Buy, focusing my attention on the one retailer that claimed I might still have a shot at the card. It didn\u2019t hurt that the Founder\u2019s Edition (exclusive to Best Buy and Micro Center) was my first choice anyhow, and my Best Buy credit card meant I wouldn\u2019t have to spend $499 all at once. And I decided to live blog my whole experience in The Verge\u2019s Slack so my colleagues could enjoy my suffering.Now you can, too. Here\u2019s how it went:9:00AM: OK, 9am and still not open yet for RTX preorders9:01AM: Out of stock already at NeweggBest Buy has not opened preorders yet, it seemsDoes not look like they ever opened at Amazon either9:02AM: Micro Center has run out of stockNot sure if they are open at B&H, just says \u201cComing Soon.\u201dI GOT ONE [at Best Buy]9:03AM: Shoot it\u2019s gone. It took it outBest Buy has not opened the Founder\u2019s Edition yet9:04AM: Best Buy is releasing more inventory every few minutesFrom what I experienced, Best Buy was the only US retailer doing this.9:05AM: Prebuilts with the GPU are sold out at Best BuyGPU inventory still going in and out of stock9:06AM: Lol, I have 3 RTX 3070s in my cart???9:07AM: LET ME BUIYYYYYYYY9:08AM: Gigabyte is sold outI have the Founder\u2019s Edition in the cart9:11AM: I am on pickup infoWaiting to get to paymentJUST LET ME BUY IT BEST BUY9:18AM: I do not think God wants me to buy this GPU today...9:12AM: I am in the checkout but waiting to get to payment now9:13AM: oh wtfNow it won\u2019t let me do curbsidebut I keep trying to get it shipped9:18AM: I do not think God wants me to buy this GPU today...9:19AM: I think I am about to give up9:28AM: NOOOO IT TOOK OUT OF MY CART9:20AM: All things considered, Best Buy had the only decent type of moderation of buying oneThey were releasing certain units in stock every few minutesI mean, it was still hell to get one in the cart, but it was a lot easier compared to Amazon and B&H, which sold out in a split secondBest Buy website crashed9:21AM: FE is restocked nowI have it in my cart on web and mobileWhat the heck9:25AM: Okay, so it will not let me ship or do curbside pickup, yet somehow I still have a unit??9:26AM: What gives Best Buy9:27AM: I think the bots broke Best Buy9:28AM: NOOOO IT TOOK OUT OF MY CARTThis does not spark joy.At this point, I was ready to give up, but Tom would not allow that. He flagged that Micro Center had one model in stock, and it was the Founder\u2019s Edition. So I quickly went back to my Micro Center tab and...10:13AM: Heading over there NOWA light of hope shines.It looks like I might be able to have a happy ending to my blogAhhh, the page will not loaddddd10:14AM: LET ME INNNNN10:14AM: I think we are getting somewhereLET ME INLET ME INNNNN10:15AM: Loaded on my phone10:16AM: Loaded on my desktopHOLY shit, I think I got one?10:17AM: Come on, let me finish the transactionMicro Center, don\u2019t fail me now.10:18AM: Come on Micro Center pleaseeee10:19AM: Ughhhh10:23AM: I am still stuckOH SHIT10:24AM: YES. I WANT TO PURCHASE NOW MICRO CENTER10:25AM: Come Micro Center mamma needs you to do your magic10:27AM: OK, I have five Micro Center pages open, and two of them show my cart10:31AM: HOLD UP. I AM AT ORDER SUMMARY10:38AM: OMG, I THINK IT WORK10:32AM: I am at the final stretch!!!10:34AM: AHHHHHHHH10:36AM: OMGDID IT JUST GO THROUGH10:36AM: I THINK IT WENT THROUGH???10:38AM: OMG, I THINK IT WORKI am checking my Micro Center account and my banking app10:49AM: It does not show up in my order history...

AI has been instrumental in helping to keep patients and clinicians safe, while also optimizing workflows and procedures.\nNVIDIA equips the world\u2019s leading healthcare institutions with advanced tools to tackle interoperable data and meet the increasing demand for personalized medicine and next-generation clinics. Many startups are using NVIDIA platforms to develop intelligent AI applications and accelerate areas such as drug discovery, medical imaging, genomics and smart hospital applications.\n\nFrom Oct. 12-16 at the HLTH Conference VRTL Startup and Innovation Forum, NVIDIA will showcase top startups from the NVIDIA Inception program, which provides startups with go-to-market support, AI expertise and technology.\n\nSmart Hospitals\u00a0\n\u201cDigital\u201d eyes and ears are needed more than ever to protect patients and staff during the pandemic. AI greatly improves hospital efficiency and patient satisfaction. Smart video sensors can determine if patients and staff are wearing a mask and monitor temperatures. Conversational AI can provide patients with immediate answers from an AI-powered virtual assistant, instead of waiting for a clinical staff member to become available.\n\nNVIDIA Clara Guardian is a smart hospital application framework and a partner ecosystem that brings smart sensors and multimodal AI together to improve patient care in healthcare facilities.\nHere are three smart hospital solution providers, and NVIDIA Inception members, presenting at HLTH:\n\nDarvis is an AI-powered data analytics company that translates computer vision into valuable data analytics to provide insights of objects and uses robotic process automation to enable hospitals and care facilities to build, manage and secure optimal flows of staff, hygiene, medical equipment and day-to-day services.\nOuva is a GPU-accelerated visual sensing platform for remote patient care and touch-free assistance.\nWhiteboard Coordinator is a suite of healthcare IoT AI solutions for operating room coordination, thermal sensing, telemonitoring and conversational AI.\n\nRead about many more Clara Guardian-powered AI solutions.\nLife Sciences\nPutting vast data sources to work to advance the discovery of new medicines and vaccines requires massively powerful computing resources to harness the capabilities of AI.\nComputational chemistry and drug discovery, which include structure-based drug design, molecular docking, generative AI models, virtual screening and high-throughput screening, are laborious and time-intensive processes that need AI to help with search, assimilation of data and efficiency.\n\nNVIDIA Clara Discovery is a collection of frameworks, applications and AI models enabling GPU-accelerated computational drug discovery.\nDrug development is a cross-disciplinary endeavor. Clara Discovery can be applied across the drug discovery process and combines accelerated computing, AI and machine learning in genomics, proteomics, microscopy, virtual screening, computational chemistry, visualization, clinical imaging and natural language processing.\nLife sciences and machine learning startups will be sharing their innovations:\n\nMacromoltek, an in-silico antibody drug design company, can design custom antibodies in one week using GPU-accelerated computational modeling.\nSynvivia builds protein switches to control the behavior of genetically engineered organisms using GPU-enabled high performance computing.\nVyasa Analytics, an innovative deep learning software and analytics company, enables secure and scalable solutions to disparate data across life science and healthcare organizations.\nH2O.ai, the open source leader in AI and GPU-accelerated automatic machine learning, is empowering healthcare companies to deliver AI solutions while addressing challenges from the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Kinetica Streaming Data Warehouse combines historical and streaming data analysis with powerful location intelligence and AI in a single platform to deliver immediate healthcare results, like speeding up drug trials, tracking disease spread, coordinating emergency response and managing supply chain logistics in real time.\n\nWe\u2019ll be presenting on Friday, Oct. 16, at 2 p.m. Pacific time.

To fight back, you\u2019ll need to recruit characters to your Dedsec Resistance. Each character has a different skill set, enabling you to tackle missions and the large open world in numerous ways.\nOn PC, beautiful ray-traced reflections will bring dynamic reflectivity to surfaces across London, and NVIDIA DLSS will boost frame rates giving gamers performance headroom to maximize game settings and increase output resolutions, for a superior, higher-fidelity experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, we\u2019re unveiling updated RTX ON and RTX OFF PC system requirements that ensure you\u2019re ready for the best Watch Dogs: Legion experiences:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt higher RTX presets, ray tracing quality increases, making the breathtaking real-time ray-traced reflections even better. And with regards to the general game preset, over a dozen options are cranked up, improving detail levels, effect quality, and your overall experience.\nOn our new GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards, each of these options can be taken to their limits, giving you the highest-quality visuals possible, as demonstrated in our new screenshot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Dogs: Legion \u2013 Also Playable On GeForce NOW\nWatch Dogs: Legion will also be playable on GeForce NOW, NVIDIA's cloud game streaming service. Using the GeForce NOW app on PC, Mac, SHIELD TV, Android devices and Chromebooks, gamers can play their favorite already-owned PC titles from popular digital stores like Steam, Epic Games Store and Uplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 30 Series Watch Dogs: Legion Bundle\nTo celebrate our Watch Dogs: Legion partnership with Ubisoft, and the integration of amazing RTX technology, we\u2019re giving buyers of select GeForce RTX 3090 and 3080 GPUs and PCs a digital download copy of the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, you\u2019ll also receive a 1-year GeForce NOW Founder\u2019s Membership, enabling you to play games via the cloud, with legendary GeForce performance, even when you\u2019re not sitting behind your GeForce RTX 30 Series PC.\nFor a full list of participating products and partners, head on over to our GeForce RTX 30 Series Bundle homepage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Based on NVIDIA vGPU technology, vCS enables AI and compute-intensive workloads to run in VMs.\nWith support for the NVIDIA A100, the latest NVIDIA vCS delivers significantly faster performance for AI and data analytics workloads.\nPowered by the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, the A100 GPU provides strong scaling for GPU compute and deep learning applications running in single- and multi-GPU workstations, servers, clusters, cloud data centers, systems at the edge and supercomputers.\nEnterprise data centers standardized on hypervisor-based virtualization can now deploy the A100 with vCS for all the operational benefits that virtualization brings with management and monitoring, without sacrificing performance. And with the workloads running in virtual machines, they can be managed, monitored and run remotely on any device, anywhere.\nGraph shows normalized performance of MIG 2g.10gb running inferencing workload in bare metal (dark green) is nearly the same when running a Virtual Compute Server VM on each MIG instance (light green).\nEngineers, researchers, students, data scientists and others can now tackle compute-intensive workloads in a virtual environment, accessing the most powerful GPU in the world through virtual machines that can be securely provisioned in minutes. As NVIDIA A100 GPUs become available in vGPU-certified servers from NVIDIA\u2019s partners, professionals across all industries can accelerate their workloads with powerful performance.\nAlso, IT professionals get the management, monitoring and multi-tenancy benefits from hypervisors like Red Hat RHV/RHEL.\n\u201cOur customers have an increasing need to manage multi-tenant workflows running on virtual machines while providing isolation and security benefits,\u201d said Chuck Dubuque, senior director of product marketing at Red Hat. \u201cThe new multi-instance GPU capabilities on NVIDIA A100 GPUs enable a new range of AI-accelerated workloads that run on Red Hat platforms from the cloud to the edge.\u201d\nAdditional new features of the NVIDIA vGPU September 2020 release include:\n\nMulti-Instance GPU (MIG) with VMs: MIG expands the performance and value of NVIDIA A100 by partitioning the GPUs in up to seven instances. Each MIG can be fully isolated with its own high-bandwidth memory, cache and compute cores. Combining MIG with vCS, enterprises can take advantage of management, monitoring and operational benefits of hypervisor-based server virtualization, running a VM on each MIG partition.\nHeterogeneous Profiles and OSes: With the ability to have different sized instances through MIG, heterogenous vCS profiles can be used on an A100 GPU. This allows VMs of various sizes to be run on a single A100 GPU. Additionally, with VMs running on the NVIDIA GPUs with vCS, heterogeneous operating systems can also be run on an A100 GPU, where different Linux distributions can be run simultaneously in different VMs.\nGPUDirect Remote Direct Memory Access: Now supported with NVIDIA vCS, GPUDirect RDMA enables network devices to directly access GPU memory, bypassing CPU host memory and decreasing GPU-GPU communication latency to completely offload the CPU in a virtualized environment.\n\nLearn more about NVIDIA Virtual Compute Server, including how the technology was recognized as Disruptive Technology of the Year at VMworld, and see the latest announcement of VMware and NVIDIA partnering to develop enterprise AI solutions.\nVMware vSphere support for vCS with A100 will be available next year. The NVIDIA virtual GPU portfolio also includes the Quadro Virtual Workstation for technical and creative professionals, and GRID vPC and vApps for knowledge workers.\nGTC Brings the Latest in vGPU\nHear more about how NVIDIA Virtual Compute Server is being used in industries at the GPU Technology Conference, taking place October 5-9.\nAdam Tetelman and Jeff Weiss from NVIDIA, joined by Timothy Dietrich from NetApp, will give an overview of NVIDIA Virtual Compute Server technology and discuss use cases and manageability.\nAs well, a panel of experts from NVIDIA, ManTech and Maxar will share how NVIDIA vGPU is used in their solutions to analyze large amounts of data, enable remote visualization and accelerate compute for video streams and images.\nRegister now for GTC and check out all the sessions available.\n\n\nCategories: Graphics Virtualization | Pro GraphicsTags: NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | Virtualization \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Fortunately for discerning readers everywhere, Microsoft is putting an AI-powered grammar editor at the fingertips of millions of people.\nLike any good editor, it\u2019s quick and knowledgeable. That\u2019s because Microsoft Editor\u2019s grammar refinements in Microsoft Word for the web can now tap into NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, ONNX Runtime and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, which is part of Azure AI, to deliver this smart experience.\nSpeaking at the digital GPU Technology Conference, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang announced the news during the keynote presentation on October 5.\nEveryday AI in Office\nMicrosoft is on a mission to wow users of Office productivity apps with the magic of AI. New, time-saving experiences will include real-time grammar suggestions, question-answering within documents \u2014 think Bing search for documents beyond \u201cexact match\u201d \u2014 and predictive text to help complete sentences.\nSuch productivity-boosting experiences are only possible with deep learning and neural networks. For example, unlike services built on traditional rules-based logic, when it comes to correcting grammar, Editor in Word for the web is able to understand the context of a sentence and suggest the appropriate word choices.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd these deep learning models, which can involve hundreds of millions of parameters, must be scalable and provide real-time inference for an optimal user experience. Microsoft Editor\u2019s AI model \u00a0for grammar checking in Word on the web alone is expected to handle more than 500 billion queries a year.\nDeployment at this scale could blow up deep learning budgets. Thankfully, NVIDIA Triton\u2019s dynamic batching and concurrent model execution features, accessible through Azure Machine Learning, slashed the cost by about 70 percent and achieved a throughput of 450 queries per second on a single NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPU, with less than 200-millisecond response time. Azure Machine Learning provided the required scale and capabilities to manage the model lifecycle such as versioning and monitoring.\nHigh Performance Inference with Triton on Azure Machine Learning \nMachine learning models have expanded in size, and GPUs have become necessary during model training and deployment. For AI deployment in production, organizations are looking for scalable inference serving solutions, support for multiple framework backends, optimal GPU and CPU utilization and machine learning lifecycle management.\nThe NVIDIA Triton and ONNX Runtime stack in Azure Machine Learning deliver scalable high-performance inferencing. Azure Machine Learning customers can take advantage of Triton\u2019s support for multiple frameworks, real time, batch and streaming inferencing, dynamic batching and concurrent execution.\nWriting with AI in Word\nAuthor and poet Robert Graves was quoted as saying, \u201cThere is no good writing, only good rewriting.\u201d\u00a0 In other words, write, and then edit and improve.\nEditor in Word for the web lets you do both simultaneously. And while Editor is the first feature in Word to gain the speed and breadth of advances enabled by Triton and ONNX Runtime, it is likely just the start of more to come.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not too late to get access to hundreds of live and on-demand talks at GTC. Register now through Oct. 9 using promo code CMB4KN to get 20 percent off.\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | GPU | GTC 2020 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The new graphics cards will be positioned against the Radeon RX 6800 series graphics cards and will feature much powerful specifications than the standard non-Ti variants that are already announced and in the market.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti & GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Allegedly Being Prepped To Tackle AMD Radeon RX 6800 Graphics Cards, Beefed-Up Specifications\nThe latest details come from none other than Kopite7kimi who has been spot on with the majority of his leaks in the past and has now tweeted out two brand new GA102 GPU based graphics cards that NVIDIA is working on to tackle AMD's Radeon RX 6800 series cards which most likely pose an imminent threat to NVIDIA's recently released GeForce RTX 3080 and the upcoming GeForce RTX 3070 based on the recent performance leaks.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and GeForce RTX 3070 Ti are the expected names for the new line of graphics cards and its also isn't the first time we have heard about these names. The RTX 3080 Ti and the RTX 3070 Ti have long been rumored and was actually in the plans at one point before the green team decided to move things up to the RTX 3090. The RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti were also going to feature much different specifications before but it looks like things have changed and both graphics cards will feature the GA102 GPU. Following are the specifications that we can expect from the new graphics cards (if they make it to market and not get cancelled like their previous entrants):\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (GA102-250-A1) Graphics Card To Tackle AMD's RX 6800 XT?\nFirst up, we have the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti which has been upgraded to the GA102-250-A1 GPU core. This graphics card should feature performance in between the GeForce RTX 3080 & RTX 3090, both of which are also GA102 based GPUs. In terms of specifications, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics card with its GA102 GPU will feature 9984 CUDA cores which is super close to the RTX 3090's 10496 CUDA Cores.\n\nJesus. A new spec of GA102, between 3080 and 3090.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) October 27, 2020\n\n\nGA102-250-A1, 9984FP32, 384bits GD6X\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) October 27, 2020\n\nThat's a 15% core count increase over the RTX 3080 and just 5% less cores than the RTX 3090. We have already seen that the GeForce RTX 3090 is only able to show greater than 10-15% gains in a handful of titles which are able to utilize its insane core architecture. If that's the case with the RTX 3080 Ti, then it should end up around 5-10% faster than the RTX 3080 which isn't a huge gain over the existing graphics card but should be enough to outperform the Radeon RX 6800 XT or Radeon RX 6900 XT.\n\nThe graphics card is also said to feature a 384-bit bus interface and will come with GDDR6X VRAM. Since there's a 384-bit bus, we are most likely looking at either 12 GB of 24 GB of capacity. The 24 GB VRAM should be slightly unlikely since NVIDIA would want to tune this card at more enthusiasts than the RTX 3090. One of the reasons that the RTX 3090 costs $1499 US is due to its VRAM since it makes use of 12 additional GDDR6X memory chips on the backside to make up the 24 GB VRAM. A 12 GB RTX 3080 Ti should cut down the costs a lot and should be available in better quantities than the RTX 3090 at around $899-$999 US.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti (GA102-150-A1) Graphics Card To Tackle AMD's RX 6800 XL?\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti on the other hand is expected to feature the GA102-150-A1 GPU. The graphics card is also going to feature the GA102 GPU which will be a huge upgrade from GA104 that the standard offering would feature. The GA102 GPU should also result in higher power input which should directly affect its TGP.\n\nI heard a new spec of GA102, between 3080 and 3070.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) October 22, 2020\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kopite7kimi/status/1320702114977304577\nAccording to Kopite7kimi, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti will utilize the PG132-SKU35 board which is different than the previous SKU that the graphics card was going to be based upon. The GPU will feature 7424 CUDA cores or 58 SMs. These are 26% more CUDA cores than the GeForce RTX 3070 and around 9% lower cores than the GeForce RTX 3080.\n\nPreviously, the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti was going to feature the full GA104 GPU with 6144 CUDA cores. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti was also supposed to feature a 256-bit bus with a 16 GB GDDR6 VRAM but that has changed too. As per the new specs, the card would most likely come with a 320-bit bus interface and as such, we can expect a 10 GB GDDR6X VRAM.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere' Graphics Card Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA107Ampere GA107Ampere GA106-300Ampere GA104-200Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA104-400Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA102-225Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie SizeTBATBATBA395.2mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBATBATBA17.4 Billion17.4 Billion17.4 Billion28 Billion28 Billion28 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores2048?2560?358448645888614487041024010496\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs64 / 4080 / 48112 / 64152 / 80184 / 96192/ 96272 / 96320 / 112328 / 112\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores64 / 1680 / 20112 / 28152 / 38184 / 46192/ 48272 / 68320 / 80328 / 82\n\n\nBase ClockTBATBA1320 MHz1410 MHz1500 MHz1575 MHz1440 MHz1365 MHz1400 MHz\n\n\nBoost ClockTBATBA1780 MHz1665 MHz1730 MHz1770 MHz1710 MHz1665 MHz1700 MHz\n\n\nFP32 ComputeTBATBA12.7 TFLOPs16.2 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs22 TFLOPs30 TFLOPs34 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPsTBATBA25.4 TFLOPs32.4 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs42 TFLOPs58 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs69 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPsTBATBA101 TOPs129.6 TOPs163 TOPs174 TOPs238 TOPs273 TOPs285 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity4 GB GDDR6?4 GB GDDR6?12 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6X10 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus128-bit128-bit192-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory SpeedTBATBA15 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidthTBATBA360 Gbps448 Gbps448 Gbps608 Gbps760 Gbps912 Gbps936 Gbps\n\n\nTGP~75W~100W170W200W220W290W320W350W350W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$149?$199?$329$399 US$499 US$599 US$699 US$1199$1499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)2021?2021?February 2021December 202029th October 202010th June 202117th September 20203rd June 202124th September 2020\n\n\n\n\nThe GPU is said to be rated at 320W and would be just slightly slower than the GeForce RTX 3080 which should be enough to tackle the Radeon RX 6800 (Navi 21 XL) graphics card while the GeForce RTX 3080 (or Ti) would compete against the Radeon RX 6800 XT (Navi 21 XT). In terms of pricing, we can expect the card at around $599 US which should slot in perfectly between the RTX 3070 and the RTX 3080.\n\nOnce again, these cards and the GPUs they are derived from are mostly in testing phase right now at NVIDIA. It all depends on the AMD Radeon RX 6000 series graphics cards, how well they perform and how well they are priced against the competition, for NVIDIA to give these a proper greenlight to be produced for the mass market. If the RDNA 2 lineup fails to meet NVIDIA's internal estimates, then there's a chance that these cards would also get cancelled in favor of something new for later.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n116\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n93\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n37\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nA Mac Studio Cluster Of Four Units, All Featuring Apple\u2019s Latest M3 Ultra, Consume Less Than Half The Power Of A Network Switch When Running At Idle\n\n\n\n22\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1480\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1157\nComments\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n1035\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The GeForce RTX 3070 launches next Thursday and will come with a $499 US price tag with NVIDIA claiming that it offers better performance than the RTX 2080 Ti.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Graphics Card Benchmarks Leak Out, An RTX 2080 Ti Replacement For $499 US But With 8 GB Memory\nFrom what we have seen officially, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 seems to be quite the performer at its $499 US price point however there are several factors that will determine how successful the card really is. NVIDIA has claimed that the GeForce RTX 3070 is faster than the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti however we don't know if that applies to a certain number of titles (with RTX specific features ON) or all games in general. There's also the matter of availability if NVIDIA can provide the RTX 3070 in enough quantities to meet the crazy high demand for its GeForce RTX 30 series cards or would we see a similar dilemma as the RTX 3090/3080 launch.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB MemoryThere's also the Radeon RX 6000 series which will be unveiled just a day before the retail launch for the RTX 3070 graphics cards. Now the reviews for the Founders Edition variant are planned for the 27th of October but if AMD can show that they are offering a better product with better specs and value, then consumers would obviously be more inclined to wait and see what the Radeon team is cooking rather than jumping on to buy the GeForce RTX 3070.\nNVIDIA Geforce RTX 3070 Graphics Card benchmarks in Ashes of The Singularity leak out. (Image Credits: Videocardz / Rogame)\nThis might in fact be a blessing in disguise for NVIDIA as there will be less demand for the card at launch, giving NVIDIA enough time to produce more chips to send out to AIBs by the time the RX 6000 series actually launches in the retail segment. All of this remains to be seen in the coming weeks but for now, we have this one interesting benchmark that has popped up in a game that initially favored AMD's GPUs but ever since Pascal, the tides have turned in NVIDIA's favor. This specific title is none other than Ashes of The Singularity.\n\n[AOTS Benchmark]\nRTX 3070 vs RTX 3080 > Same user/setup\nCrazy_4K DX12\nRTX 3080 => 89fps (120.27%)RTX 3070 => 74fps (100%)\nCustom 2560x1080 DX12\nRTX 3080 => 103fps (115.73%)RTX 3070 => 89fps (100%)\nCrazy_1080p DX12\nRTX 3080 => 106fps (112.76%)RTX 3070 => 94fps (100%) pic.twitter.com/RfeNjSeXVj\n\u2014 _rogame \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8 (@_rogame) October 21, 2020\n\nIn the benchmarks, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 scores formidable results. At 1080p and Ultra-Wide resolutions, the GeForce RTX 3070 seems to perform really well and is actually faster than the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, even if by a 1-2% difference. However, moving to 4K, the card nets poor GPU performance than the RTX 2080 Ti. The performance falls by 2.5% compared to the RTX 2080 Ti that could be due to the lower VRAM buffer of just 8 GB versus the 11 GB of the RTX 2080 Ti. However, as stated before, in titles that utilize RTX features and take advantage of Ampere's dual-path uarch design, we might see bigger gains but that remains to be evaluated in our own review for the card which should be available for you to read when the embargo lifts.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Graphics Card Specifications - GA104 GPU & 8 GB GDDR6 Memory\nAt the heart of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 graphics card lies the GA104 GPU. The GA104 is one of the many Ampere GPUs that we will be getting on the gaming segment. The GA104 GPU is the second-fastest Ampere chip in the stack. The GPU is based on Samsung's 8nm (N8) process node. The GPU measures at 392.5mm2 and features 17.4 Billion transistors which are almost 93% of the transistors featured on the TU102 GPU. At the same time, the GA104 GPU is almost half the size of the TU102 GPU which is an insane amount of density.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nFor the GeForce RTX 3070, NVIDIA has enabled a total of 46 SM units on its flagship which results in a total of 5888 CUDA cores. In addition to the CUDA cores, NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3070 also comes packed with next-generation RT (Ray-Tracing) cores, Tensor cores, and brand new SM or streaming multi-processor units.\n\nIn terms of memory, the RTX 3070 features 8 GB of GDDR6 memory. The GeForce RTX 3070 comes with memory at speeds of 14 Gbps. That along with a full uncut bus interface of 256-bit will deliver a cumulative bandwidth of 448 Gbps.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere' Graphics Card Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA106-300Ampere GA104-200Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie SizeTBC395.2mm2395.2mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBC17.4 Billion17.4 Billion28 Billion28 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores358448645888870410496\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs112 / 64152 / 80184 / 96272 / 96328 / 112\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores112 / 28152 / 38184 / 46272 / 68328 / 82\n\n\nBase Clock1320 MHz1410 MHz1500 MHz1440 MHz1400 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock1780 MHz1665 MHz1730 MHz1710 MHz1700 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute13 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs30 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPs25 TFLOPs32 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs58 TFLOPs69 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPs101 TOPs192 TOPs163 TOPs238 TOPs285 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity12 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR610 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus192-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed16 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth384 Gbps448 Gbps448 Gbps760 Gbps936 Gbps\n\n\nTGP170W175W220W320W350W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$329 US$399 US$499 US$699 US$1499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)25th February 20212nd December 202029th October 202017th September 202024th September 2020\n\n\n\n\nFor now, it looks like the GeForce RTX 3070 would be a great option for anyone who doesn't own either the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti or the GeForce RTX 1080 Ti. You would get lower temperatures, a lower power consumption rating, and an upgrade to a faster graphics card for a much lower price point.

Unfortunately, very few of you have been able to buy them six weeks after the release of the RTX 3080, and availability is expected to be low for some time to come. Whether this is deliberate action (unlikely), demand miscalculation, or manufacturing issues \u2013 as so often happens in the industry \u2013 time is running out for Nvidia to hit the holiday season.\nThis situation has put more pressure on the more affordable GeForce RTX 3070. The card's launch was pushed to October 29, allowing Nvidia to build up a larger stockpile for release day. Hopefully your chances of buying a new RTX 3070 in two days' time when they hit shelves are much higher. Moving on from availability woes, the GeForce RTX 30 series is bound to remain an attractive option for gamers for months and even years to come.\n\nNow let's talk about the RTX 3070 GPU.\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 is based on the GA104 die which is almost 40% smaller than what's used on the 3080 and 3090 (GA102). The GPU packs 32% fewer CUDA cores and TMUs, with the same 96 ROPs. The cores are clocked slightly higher, about 4% for the base clock and 1% for the boost clock.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce\nRTX 3090\nRTX 3080\nRTX 3070\nRTX 2080 Ti\n\n\nPrice MSRP\n$1500\n$700\n$500\n$1200\n\n\nRelease Date\nSeptember 2020\nSeptember 2020\nOctober 2020\nSeptember 2018\n\n\nProcess\nSamsung 8N\nTSMC12FFN\n\n\nTransistors (billion)\n28.3\n17.4\n18.6\n\n\nDie Size (mm2)\n628.4\n392.5\n754\n\n\nCore Config\n10496 / 328 / 112\n8704 / 272 / 96\n5888 / 184 / 96\n4352 / 272 / 88\n\n\nCore Clock Frequency\n1400 / 1700 MHz\n1440 / 1710 MHz\n1500 / 1730 MHz\n1350 / 1545 MHz\n\n\nMemory Capacity\n24 GB\n10 GB\n8GB\n11 GB\n\n\nMemory Speed\n19.5 Gbps\n19 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Type\nGDDR6X\nGDDR6\n\n\nBus Type / Bandwidth\n384-bit / 935.8 GB/s\n320-bit / 760 GB/s\n256-bit / 448 GB/s\n352-bit / 616 GB/s\n\n\nTGP\n320 watt\n320 watt\n220 watt\n250 watt\n\n\n\nThe memory subsystem has also been downgraded, moving away from 10GB of high speed GDDR6X memory to 8GB of standard 14 Gbps GDDR6 on a narrower 256-bit wide memory bus. This allows for a peak bandwidth of 448 GB/s. Despite those changes, Nvidia claims that the RTX 3070 is on par with the RTX 2080 Ti (with 3GB less VRAM), but at a $500 MSRP, seriously, who can complain.\n\n\nA natural advantage of the cut-down design is the much lower TDP rating of 220 watts, that's 100 watts lower than the 3080 and 30 watts lower than the outgoing 2080 Ti. This means RTX 3070-based graphics cards will be cool, quiet and easy on your power supply.\nBut enough about all that, it's time to get into the blue bar graphs. For testing we're using our Ryzen 9 3950X test system, featuring four sticks of low latency DDR4-3200 memory...\n\nBenchmarks\nKicking off the benchmarks with Death Stranding at 1440p we immediately find 2080 Ti-like performance from the new RTX 3070, pumping out 134 fps on average. When compared to the similarly-priced 2070 Super, we see a 30% performance boost and a 24% increase from the 5700 XT.\n\n\nEven at 4K, the RTX 3070 is seen matching the 2080 Ti with 83 fps on average, making it just shy of 30% slower than the 3080. A good overall result for a GPU expected to cost just $500.\n\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2020 has the RTX 3070 matching exactly the formerly super-high-end 2080 Ti at 1440p.\n\nThe 3070 does drop off a little at 4K, likely due to only having 8GB of VRAM. The performance hit isn't massive but Flight Simulator 2020 will be pushing beyond the 8GB capacity with the ultra quality settings at 4K and as a result the RTX 3070 pays a small performance penalty.\n\nWe're starting to sense a trend here. Very similar performance to the 2080 Ti at 1440p, this time in Shadow of the Tomb Raider. That means we're looking at a ~30% performance increase from Nvidia at the $500 price point when compared to the 2070 Super and 55% from the vanilla 2070.\n\nThe 3070 is at a disadvantage at 4K, here VRAM usage hits up around 7.5 - 8GB, so it's possible we're on the edge of VRAM capacity limitation, or the tiny performance hit could be due to memory bandwidth, either way the 3070 is only a few frames down on the 2080 Ti.\n\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege makes heavy use of compute and this hands the Ampere architecture an advantage. It's not a huge boost over Turing but it does help, as a result the RTX 3070 is 5% faster than the 2080 Ti at 1440p, and 44% faster than the 2070 Super.\n\nThe 3070 also remained strong at 4K, edging out the 2080 Ti by a few frames, making it 21% slower than the 3080 but 47% faster than the 2070 Super.\n\nMoving on to F1 2020, again we're looking at 2080 Ti-like performance from the 3070, making it 34% faster than the 2070 Super, or 19% faster than the Radeon 5700 XT.\n\nThe RTX 3070 slips a few frames behind the 2080 Ti at 4K, but we're talking a mere 2 fps margin, so let's just call it even. That means the new RTX 3070 is almost 40% faster than the 2070 Super, and 30% faster than the 5700 XT.\n\nIn Gears 5 the RTX 3070 matches and very slightly outdoes the 2080 Ti, though it's basically the same performance. A smaller 27% boost over the 2070 Super is seen, and even less over the 5700 XT.\n\nAt 4K the RTX 3070 is 33% faster than the 2070 Super and almost 40% faster than the 5700 XT.\n\nInterestingly, the RTX 3070 was 8% faster than the 2080 Ti at 1440p in Horizon Zero Dawn, delivering 96 fps on average and that made it 45% faster than the 2070 Super and 37% faster than the 5700 XT, so a solid result here.\n\nPerformance for the 3070 remained very strong at 4K as it was 10% faster than the 2080 Ti and a whopping 51% faster than the 2070 Super.\n\nMoving on to Assassin's Creed Odyssey, and you guessed it, 2080 Ti-like performance at 1440p.\nThe gains over the 2070 Super are weak in this title, at least when using a 3rd-gen Ryzen processor, about a 14% increase.\n\nThere's no CPU bottleneck at 4K and as a result the 3070 was 39% faster than the 2070 Super and even managed to beat the 2080 Ti by a 9% margin, quite an impressive result.\n\nWe're seeing a small performance boost over the 2080 Ti at 1440p with 4% more frames on average, though interestingly we did see an 8% increase to the 1% low result. Anyway, that meant the 3070 was 38% faster than the 2070 Super and 36% faster than the 5700 XT.\n\nJumping up to 4K sees the 3070 running just a single frame ahead of the 2080 Ti, so once again we're looking at 2080 Ti-like performance. This meant that while the 3070 was 25% slower than the 3080, it was almost 40% faster than the 2070 Super.\n\nNext up we have Metro Exodus and the results here are a little unexpected as the RTX 3070 trails the 2080 Ti by a 7% margin. We haven't seen a similar result so far, even if the margin is not huge, that means the 3070 is just 16% faster than the 2070 Super at 1440p.\n\nThe 4K data follows the same pattern where the RTX 3070 gets close to the average framerate of the 2080 Ti, but the 1% low performance only matches the 2080 Super.\n\nThe Resident Evil 3 results are more what we've come to expect, the RTX 3070 is seen delivering performance at the 2080 Ti level.\n\nThe RTX 3070 drops off a little further at 4K, here it was 6% slower than the 2080 Ti, but that's still far from a terrible result and it was 39% faster than the 2070 Super.\n\nThe Doom Eternal results sees the 3070 offering 7% slower performance than the 2080 Ti at 1440p, which is a little surprising to see. We're still talking about a ~40% performance boost over the 2070 Super and 35% over the Radeon 5700 XT.\n\nNow at 4K, using the ultra nightmare textures which call for 9GB of VRAM we find that the RTX 3070 falls further behind the 2080 Ti, trailing by a 14% margin. But other 8GB graphics cards like the RTX 2070 Super also suffer here and as a result the higher memory bandwidth of the RTX 3070 plays a more crucial role, allowing it to beat the 2070 Super by a 52% margin.\n\nWe also tested with lower texture quality (down to 'ultra') which requires 7GB of VRAM. The 3070 is able to match the 2080 Ti in this scenario, rendering 141 fps on average.\n\nIn Wolfenstein: Youngblood we're seeing the 3070 match the 2080 Ti to a T, making it 21% slower than the RTX 3080 and 38% faster than the 2070 Super.\n\nThen at 4K the RTX 3070 was 3% slower than the 2080 Ti and 26% slower than the 3080, but also 37% faster than the 2070 Super.\n\n\nLast up, we have Hitman 2 and you guessed it, 2080 Ti-like performance at 1440p. We do see the 3070 drop off slightly at 4K, but it was just 4% slower than the old 2080 Ti flagship and 55% faster than the 2070 Super.\n\nPerformance Summary\nAll those benchmark runs later, we think it's safe to say the RTX 3070 is very much a match for the RTX 2080 Ti as promised by Nvidia. Here's a look at the average data across our 14 game sample in both resolutions.\n\n\nPower Consumption, Performance per Watt\nHere's a look at total system consumption using our Ryzen 9 3950X test system. The RTX 3070 pushed total system usage to 371 watts. Under the same conditions the 2080 Ti reached 433 watts, which means the 3070 consumed 14% less power. It also used almost 30% less power than the RTX 3080. We're looking at a similar power draw to the RTX 2070 Super, so a very efficient GPU indeed.\n\n\nUsing PCAT to measure the power draw of just the graphics card we see that the 3070 consumes just 6 watts more or 3% more power than the RTX 2070 Super and 10% less than the 5700 XT.\nWe're also looking at a 31% reduction when compared to the RTX 3080, and 14% less than the 2080 Ti.\n\nIn terms of performance per watt, the GeForce RTX 3070 is the most efficient graphics card we've ever tested, delivering 9% more performance per watt than the 3080 and 17% more performance per watt than the 2080 Ti.\nIt's also 59% more efficient than the 7nm Radeon RX 5700 XT, so it will be interesting to see how AMD can improve on that shortly.\n\nTaking a look at how the GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition graphics card ran after an hour of Shadow of the Tomb Raider, the GPU peaked at just 72C with a fan speed of 1650 RPM, which is very reasonable and the card was very quiet. The average clock speed in this test was 1890 MHz, just shy of 1.9 GHz, with the memory operating at 14 Gbps.\n\nCost Per Frame\nBrace yourselves. Here's a look at cost per frame, starting with the 1440p data.\nAs you can see the RTX 3070 is now the best value graphics card in terms of cost per frame, coming out 7% cheaper compared to the standard RX 5700 and 25% more cost effective than the 2070 Super.\n\nOf course, you're now getting RTX 2080 Ti performance for well under half the price.\n\nThe cost per frame data is arguably a little more reliable at 4K where we remove any and all system bottlenecks.\nThe RTX 3070 remains on top, just beating the RTX 3080 which is still pretty sweet for such a powerful GPU. This means the new GeForce is 27% cheaper per frame than the 2070 Super, and a much improved value proposition at the $500 price point.\nWhat We Learned\nOverall, Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3070 is a great high-performance value product. Upcoming competition aside, in today's market the RTX 3070 is as good as it gets in terms of cost per frame and even performance per watt.\nThe RTX 3070 is the new and much more affordable 2080 Ti. In making that comparison, you get 3GB less VRAM, but make up for that with improved power consumption, shaving off about 60 watts. That means it'll be possible to make more compact graphics cards, or larger models that run cooler and quieter. Oh yea, did we mention this card will run you $500 instead of $1,200?\n\nCompared to the GPU it is replacing, the GeForce RTX 3070 is nearly 40% faster than the 2070 Super. Now, it's going to be extremely important that Nvidia addresses supply and makes sure those base models hit the MSRP.\nWhile we watch that happen (or not), AMD is set to show off 'Big Navi' this week, and no doubt we'll be able to provide reviews of Radeon RX 6000 series cards within a reasonable time frame. Nvidia will see direct competition for most of its GeForce 30 range, including the RTX 3070, which means it may no longer be the best value option at $500. We'll learn that soon enough, and of course, we are counting on AMD to bring some competition that will ultimately benefit gamers and consumers alike.\n\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090 on Amazon\nIntel Core i9-10900K on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 9 3950X on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 9 3900X on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 67\n\n\n Got something to say?

The leak comes from GiggleHD (via Harukaze5719) who have reported that the first specifications for the high-end mobility lineup are being sent out to partners and we can expect an announcement by CES 2021.\nNVIDIA Preps At Least Four GeForce RTX 30 Mobility Series GPUs - Include RTX 3080, RTX 3070 & RTX 3060 Max-Q / Max-P Series\nAs per the source, NVIDIA has sent out initial specifications and is shipping the first \"Priority\" orders for its GeForce RTX 30 series mobility GPUs. The GeForce RTX 30 series mobility lineup will replace the existing GeForce RTX 20 series mobility lineup based on the Turing GPU architecture and offer improved performance though we don't know if the TGPs will be kept similar to the existing parts or increased just like the desktop variants. We might see a bigger difference in TGPs between the Max-Q (efficiency optimized) and Max-P (performance optimized) SKUs this generation compared to all last gens.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series Mobility GPU lineup has allegedly leaked out. (Image Credits: GiiggleHD via @harukaze5719)\nAs for the lineup, it looks like NVIDIA will be offering at least four variants in its GeForce RTX 30 GPU lineup for notebooks and laptops. These include the GeForce RTX 3080, GeForce RTX 3070, GeForce RTX 3060, and their subsequent Max-Q/Max-P flavors. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Max-Q is said to only feature a Max-Q variant which might be due to the Max-P variant being too power-hungry for the mobility market. We can expect specifications close to the GeForce RTX 3080 desktop cards but with heavily reduced clock speeds. There's also a big possibility that NVIDIA utilizes GDDR6 dies rather than GDDR6X to power the RTX 3080 Max-Q graphics card.\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 will also come in the Max-Q flavor only. The graphics chip may also feature the same specs as the desktop variant but with heavily optimized clocks & TDP figures. With that said, the card is listed for enthusiasts and high-end notebooks featuring Intel's Core i7 H-series processors. The GeForce RTX 3070 mobility GPU already leaked out a while ago and featured SK Hynix's GDDR6 memory rated at 1.2V with speeds of 12 Gbps compared to 14 Gbps for desktop variants.\n\nLastly, there's also the GeForce RTX 3060 which would either feature a cut-down GA104 or a GA106 GPU. The GPU will also be available in Max-Q and Max-P variants. Once again, we will see the GPUs featured in a range of laptops and notebooks available next year. Intel is also expected to launch its Tiger Lake-H laptops with 8 cores and 16 threads next year which would also be integrated with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series graphics lineup and compete against AMD's RDNA 2 based Radeon RX 6000 series and Intel's DG2 \"Xe-HPG\" mobility offerings in 2021.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n164\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n77\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n69\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n39\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1463\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1142\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

And one of the best ways to get good at robotics is to get hands on.\nRoll up your sleeves, because this week at NVIDIA\u2019s GPU Technology Conference, the Duckietown Foundation announced that it\u2019s offering a free edX course on AI and robotics using the Duckiebot hardware platform powered by the new NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit.\nThe Duckietown project, which started as an MIT class in 2016, has evolved into an open-source platform for robotics and AI education, research and outreach. The project is coordinated by the Duckietown Foundation, whose mission is to reach and teach a wide audience of students about robotics and AI.\nIt does this through hands-on learning activities in which students put AI and robotics components together to address modern autonomy challenges for self-driving cars. Solutions are implemented in the Duckietown robotics ecosystem, where the interplay among theory, algorithms and deployment on real robots is witnessed firsthand in a model urban environment.\nThe Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit has the performance and capability to run a diverse set of AI models and frameworks. This makes it the ultimate AI starter computer for learning and creating AI applications.\nThe new devkit is the latest offering in the NVIDIA Jetson AI at the Edge platform, which ranges from entry-level AI devices to advanced platforms for fully autonomous machines. To help people get started with robotics, NVIDIA also announced the availability of free online training and AI-certification programs.\n\u201cThe Duckietown educational platform provides a hands-on, scaled down, accessible version of real world autonomous systems,\u201d said Emilio Frazzoli, professor of Dynamic Systems and Control at ETH Zurich and advisor for the Duckietown Foundation. \u201cIntegrating NVIDIA\u2019s Jetson Nano power in Duckietown enables unprecedented, affordable access to state-of-the-art compute solutions for learning autonomy.\u201d\nAnother highlight of the course is the Duckietown Autolab remote infrastructure, which enables remote evaluation of robotic agents elaborated by learners with Duckiebot robots at home, providing feedback on assignments. This lets the course provide a realistic development flow with real hardware evaluation.\nDuckiebot powered by Jetson Nano 2GB.\nEnrollment is now open for the free edX course, called \u201cSelf-Driving Cars with Duckietown,\u201d which starts in February. To find out more about the technical specifications of the new NVIDIA powered Duckiebot or to pre-order, check out Duckietown\u2019s Store.\nThe AI Driving Olympics\nFor more advanced students, or for people who just want to witness the fun, Duckietown has created the \u201cAI Driving Olympics\u201d (AI-DO) competition. It focuses on autonomous vehicles with the objective of evaluating the state of the art in embodied AI, by benchmarking novel machine learning approaches to autonomy in a set of fun challenges.\nAI-DO is made up of a series of increasingly complex tasks \u2014 from simple lane-following to fleet management. For each, competitors use various resources, such as simulation, logs, code templates, baseline implementations, and standardized physical autonomous Duckiebots operating in Duckietown, a formally defined urban environment.\nSubmissions are evaluated in simulation on the cloud, physically in remote Duckietown Autolabs, and running on actual Duckiebots at the live finals competition.\nParticipants can participate remotely at any stage of the competition. They just need to send their source code packaged as a Docker image. Team members will then be able to use Duckiebot\u2019s \u201cAutolabs,\u201d which are facilities that allow remote experimentation in reproducible settings.\nThe next AI-DO race will be at NeurIPS, Dec. 6-12.\nDuckietown classes and labs are offered at 80+ universities, including ETH Z\u00fcrich and Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. Curriculum materials for undergraduate and graduate courses are available open source. This includes weekly lecture plans, open source software, and a modular, do-it-yourself hardware smart city environment with autonomous driving car kits.\nWatch NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang recap all the autonomous machines news announced at GTC:\n\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Education | Embedded Computing | GTC 2020 | Jetson \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAccelerating AI Development With NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell Series GPUs and NVIDIA NIM Microservices for RTX\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"
