The video is called \"What's Jensen been cooking\" and this piece of tech whimsy is under 30 seconds long. I've embedded it below for your convenience.\n\nIf you were to watch the above video on the YouTube page you would be able to click and reveal the description, which reads as follows: \"The world\u2019s largest graphics card, fresh out of the oven.\" Mr Huang, says as much, though not very clearly, at the end of his video appearance.\nLooking carefully at what the Nvidia CEO took out of his oven, it looks very much like previous DGX-1 deep learning server systems based upon Pascal and Volta GPU architectures. One must presume, with this being 'fresh out of the oven', that it is an Ampere GPU based DGX-1 system.\n\nOf course, Huang has been very busy with his silicon cooker at home to get ready for the GTC Keynote on Thursday. In less than 48 hours time we hope to be able to pick through the announcements made via the Nvidia YouTube channel (Keynote video release is scheduled for 2pm UK time).\n\nChopping board not included\nIt is looking less likely that we will get any directly consumer-pleasing announcements on Thursday. In the purported leak we looked at earlier today, indications are that consumer Ampere graphics cards won't be unwrapped until September, to coincide with the delayed Cyberpunk 2077 release. You can read more about that here.\nThanks to the HEXUS tipster for the alert.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 10 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

Twitter tech spotter Komachi brought the listing to light. If you head on over to this link you can see that the DGX A100 trademark was applied for by Nvidia and refers to computer hardware used for AI supercomputing, Machine Learning, HPC and so on - covering a very wide range of possible uses.\nA week ago HEXUS reported on Nvidia's tease that we should 'Get Amped' for the GTC 2020 digital keynote. You will be able to plug yourself in at Nvidia's YouTube channel at 6am PT (2pm BST) on Thursday 14th May. With the above trademark emerging and the 'Get Amped' hint it looks pretty certain that at least one of the announcements will be of an Nvidia Tesla A100 processor, based on the GA100 GPU, which will power the upcoming DGX A100 system.\n\nNvidia DGX systems have been released as deep learning workstations with new GPU generations since the first Pascal GPU was unveiled. Currently Nvidia sells the DGX Station fully integrated 'office datacentre' system, the DGX-1 rackmount server, the DGX-2 2 petaFLOPS system, and the DGX POD for AI enterprise tasks. You can read about each of these specific products on the official DGX systems page.\nWe don't know what else might be under the bonnet in a Nvidia DGX A100 'Ampere' deep learning system other than a number of the Tesla A100 processor cards, based on the GA100 GPU. Looking at existing products - the DGX-2, for example, combines 16 interconnected GV100 GPUs (totalling 81920 CUDA cores) with 512GB of HBM2.\nIf you are really keen to know more, it is only 10 days until the official keynote. Hopefully we will find out some details on Nvidia's consumer graphics plans too.\nNvidia's low-cost, open-source ventilator design\nOn Friday Nvidia published a blog about an open-source design for a low-cost, easy-to-assemble mechanical ventilator, designed by Nvidia Chief Scientist Bill Dally. The ventilator uses approx $400 of off-the-shelf parts and is said to be quick to build.\n\nCurrently between 0.3 per cent and 0.6 per cent of Covid-19 patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome severe enough to need a mechanical ventilator, observes Nvidia.

(PHOTO: CIMB)   SINGAPORE \u2014 Small-and-medium enterprises (SMEs) are currently underserved by financial institutions and can become a key engine of growth for CIMB Bank in Singapore, said its chief executive Victor Lee. To tap the potential of the segment, the Singapore branch of the Malaysian financial services provider is stepping up various initiatives to help SMEs.  \u201cIn Singapore, with the emergence of all these P2P players, that is proof enough that there is a segment (of SMEs) out there that is not being served (by banks),\u201d said the 49-year-old Singaporean in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance Singapore. Lee was referring to the strong growth of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending services. Online services providing P2P lending help individuals and companies by matching their lending and borrowing requirements without the need for financial institutions. According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, P2P lending in Asia rose from US$108 billion in 2014 to US$330 billion in 2018. Many SMEs prefer to use P2P lending to finance their growth due to ease of access and what they perceive to be lower lending costs. But Lee said that P2P lending could still entail higher costs compared with bank financing. Helping SMEs through pandemic The SME segment is key to growing CIMB\u2019s corporate banking business. Corporate banking makes up two-thirds of its business in Singapore, with the remainder split between consumer and commercial banking, and the segment is poised for accelerated growth especially in the digital space, Lee said. \u201cI\u2019m bullish about CIMB in Singapore. Our last 10 years set in place the business lines that formed the foundation of our existence. Our next 10 years will be focused on acceleration,\u201d he added. In the meantime, the COVID-19 pandemic has magnified the need to help SMEs and other companies tide through the crisis, with these businesses needing at least six months of short-term financing assistance, according to Lee. Towards this end, CIMB has put in place measures to help businesses.  For instance, the bank has expanded its e-Supply Chain Financing programme with a limit of up to S$100 million to help suppliers via the platform of its e-procurement service provider partner. The bank has also introduced the CIMB C-19, a temporary bridging loan scheme, the CIMB BizAssist, which provides working capital loans, and the CIMB Biz Relief Scheme to allow the deferment of payments for secured and non-secured loans until end-December. On the emergence of digital banking, Lee said that CIMB did consider whether to apply for such a licence after the Monetary Authority of Singapore announced that it would start taking in applications in August last year.   Story continues \u201cWe didn\u2019t see the need to because we are already a bank. Today, we already acquire our customers digitally. In essence, we are already a digital bank,\u201d Lee said.While the competition will intensify with the introduction of digital banks, Lee stressed that CIMB executives \u201cspend half their time\u201d discussing and implementing strategies in the space. \u201cWe are not afraid of the competition. In fact I think we are ahead of the curve.\u201dDiscovering his callingA banking veteran with more than 20 years of experience in the retail and commercial banking sectors, Lee has worked in markets including Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan.His career reached another milestone in January when he was appointed the CEO of CIMB\u2019s Singapore branch, succeeding Mak Lye Mun, who retired after being at the helm for 10 years. Lee is also the CEO of CIMB Group\u2019s commercial banking, and spends two days a week at the parent company\u2019s headquarters in Kuala Lumpur.Lee\u2019s parents had wished for him to become a doctor but he did not find the profession to be his calling. He pursued a degree in engineering at the Nanyang Technological University but dropped out of his honours year programme. As fate would have it, he did not become an engineer as well.At a job fair, he secured two job offers and joined DBS Bank in 1994 as he admitted that it \u201cpromised S$50 more in monthly salary compared to the other offer on the table\u201d. It was to become a springboard for his illustrious banking career. In 2008, Lee was voted one of the Top 40 Asia Pacific Banking Leaders under 40 to look out for by The Asian Banker.On his choice of profession, Lee said, \u201cI thought then that it was a dignified and prestigious job, alongside lawyers, accountants and doctors, which our parents continue to hold in high regard.\u201dBanks were giving good training for newcomers to become bankers when Lee started his career. This gave him greater confidence later on that banking was the right choice for him.\u201cI couldn\u2019t have been so clear about my future and ambitions. Hence, I took the traineeship program at DBS.\u201dFast forward to 2020, when CIMB marks the 11th anniversary of its business in Singapore. The bank now employs around 1,300 people and has two branches locally.At the core of his goal to transform CIMB to become one of the top banks in Singapore are his staff, with whom he enjoys interacting with.\u201cPeople are at the top of my agenda. When we have the right team with the right mind-set, the team becomes invincible.\u201dRelated stories:More groups submit Singapore digital banking licence bidsSingapore bank OCBC's profit slides as it builds loan-loss defencesSingapore banks set to post first profit decline since 2016  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Because deep learning is a young field, there\u2019s still a lively debate about which types of math are needed, for both training and inferencing.\nIn November, we explained the differences among popular formats such as single-, double-, half-, multi- and mixed-precision math used in AI and high performance computing. Today, the NVIDIA Ampere architecture introduces a new approach for improving training performance on the single-precision models widely used for AI.\nTensorFloat-32 is the new math mode in NVIDIA A100 GPUs for handling the matrix math also called tensor operations used at the heart of AI and certain HPC applications. TF32 running on Tensor Cores in A100 GPUs can provide up to 10x speedups compared to single-precision floating-point math (FP32) on Volta GPUs. Combining TF32 with structured sparsity on the A100 enables performance gains over Volta of up to 20x.\nUnderstanding the New Math\nIt helps to step back for a second to see how TF32 works and where it fits.\nMath formats are like rulers. The number of bits in a format\u2019s exponent determines its range, how large an object it can measure. Its precision \u2014 how fine the lines are on the ruler \u2014 comes from the number of bits used for its mantissa, the part of a floating point number after the radix or decimal point.\nA good format strikes a balance. It should use enough bits to deliver precision without using so many it slows processing and bloats memory.\nThe chart below shows how TF32 is a hybrid that strikes this balance for tensor operations.\nTF32 strikes a balance that delivers performance with range and accuracy.\nTF32 uses the same 10-bit mantissa as the half-precision (FP16) math, shown to have more than sufficient margin for the precision requirements of AI workloads. And TF32 adopts the same 8-bit exponent as FP32 so it can support the same numeric range.\nThe combination makes TF32 a great alternative to FP32 for crunching through single-precision math, specifically the massive multiply-accumulate functions at the heart of deep learning and many HPC apps.\nApplications using NVIDIA libraries enable users to harness the benefits of TF32 with no code change required. TF32 Tensor Cores operate on FP32 inputs and produce results in FP32. Non-matrix operations continue to use FP32.\nFor maximum performance, the A100 also has enhanced 16-bit math capabilities.\u00a0 It supports both FP16 and Bfloat16 (BF16) at double the rate of TF32. Employing Automatic Mixed Precision, users can get a further 2x higher performance with just a few lines of code.\nTF32 Is Demonstrating Great Results Today\nCompared to FP32, TF32 shows a 6x speedup training BERT, one of the most demanding conversational AI models. Applications-level results on other AI training and HPC apps that rely on matrix math will vary by workload.\n\nTo validate the accuracy of TF32, we used it to train a broad set of AI networks across a wide variety of applications from computer vision to natural language processing to recommender systems. All of them have the same convergence-to-accuracy behavior as FP32.\nThat\u2019s why NVIDIA is making TF32 the default on its cuDNN library which accelerates key math operations for neural networks. At the same time, NVIDIA is working with the open-source communities that develop AI frameworks to enable TF32 as their default training mode on A100 GPUs, too.\nIn June, developers will be able to access a version of the TensorFlow framework and a version of the PyTorch framework with support for TF32 on NGC, NVIDIA\u2019s catalog of GPU-accelerated software.\n\u201cTensorFloat-32 provides a huge out-of-the-box performance increase for AI applications for training and inference while preserving FP32 levels of accuracy,\u201d said Kemal El Moujahid,\u00a0 director of Product Management for TensorFlow.\n\u201cWe plan to make TensorFloat-32 supported natively in TensorFlow to enable data scientists to benefit from dramatically higher speedups in NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs without any code changes,\u201d he added.\n\u201cMachine learning researchers, data scientists and engineers want to accelerate time to solution,\u201d said a spokesperson for the PyTorch team. \u201cWhen TF32 is natively integrated into PyTorch, it will enable out-of-the-box acceleration with zero code changes while maintaining accuracy of FP32 when using the NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based GPUs.\u201d\nTF32 Accelerates Linear Solvers in HPC\nHPC apps called linear solvers \u2014 algorithms with repetitive matrix-math calculations \u2014 also will benefit from TF32. They\u2019re used in a wide range of fields such as earth science, fluid dynamics, healthcare, material science and nuclear energy as well as oil and gas exploration.\nLinear solvers using FP32 to achieve FP64 precision have been in use for more than 30 years. Last year, a fusion reaction study for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor demonstrated that mixed-precision techniques delivered a speedup of 3.5x for such solvers using NVIDIA FP16 Tensor Cores. The same technology used in that study tripled the Summit supercomputer\u2019s performance on the HPL-AI benchmark.\nTo demonstrate the power and robustness of TF32 for linear system solvers, we ran a variety of tests in the SuiteSparse matrix collection using cuSOLVER in CUDA 11.0 on the A100. In these tests, TF32 delivered the fastest and most robust results compared to other Tensor Core modes, including FP16 and BF16.\nBeyond linear solvers, other domains in high performance computing make use of FP32 matrix operations. NVIDIA plans to work with the industry to study the application of TF32 to more use cases that rely on FP32 today.\nWhere to Go for More Information\nTo get the big picture on the role of TF32 in our latest GPUs, watch the keynote with NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang. To learn even more, register for webinars on mixed-precision training or CUDA math libraries or read a detailed article that takes a deep dive into the NVIDIA Ampere architecture.\nTF32 is among a cluster of new capabilities in the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, driving AI and HPC performance to new heights.

It might have been a dark time for non-mining consumers, but AMD and Nvidia were enjoying the profits. In the case of the latter, however, it's been alleged in a lawsuit that the company reported $1billion in crypto revenue as gaming revenue. \nAs per The Register, the suit dates back to 2017, but an amended complaint was filed this week in California. It comes from a group of angry investors, who say Nvidia misled them with its financial reporting.\n2017 was the year when cryptocurrency exploded, with Bitcoin coming close to $20,000 in December and other coins reaching record highs. The profit from mining led to graphics cards being bought in bulk for mining rigs, which resulted in shortages and hugely inflated prices. Despite Nvidia's promise that it remained focused on gamers, few members of its core market could afford or were willing to buy its products.\n\nIt's for playing Crysis, honest\n\"In early 2017, Nvidia faced an unusual problem: its flagship product was flying off the shelves. Under normal circumstances, such a trend would be cheered,\" the suit reads.\n\"But the enormous sales growth owed not to an increase in demand from gamers (Nvidia's traditional consumer), but rather to bands of online prospectors who were buying up the processors by the thousands and deploying them in massive datacenters to solve complex mathematical problems in pursuit of digital tokens.\" \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Asus raises RTX 5090 and RX 9070 prices, making graphics cards even more expensive \n\n\n\n FTC asks judge to postpone Amazon trial as Musk's layoffs have left the agency short-staffed \n\n\n\nWhile everything seemed rosy for Nvidia, the suit claims it knew the cryptocurrency craze would come to a sharp end, so it decided to conceal much of the cryptomining sales. It's alleged that the company insisted its dedicated mining cards were being sold to miners, and the booming gaming graphics card sales were coming from gamers. In reality, both miners and some gaming fans were buying up gaming GPUs.\nInvestors say that by reporting mining revenue as gaming sales, it appeared that Nvidia's GeForce products were doing well and wouldn't be affected by a crypto crash.\n\"Launching the crypto SKU and reporting its sales in the OEM segment thus allowed defendants to claim that any mining-related revenues were cordoned off in OEM, creating the impression that Nvidia's crown jewel gaming business was insulated from crypto-related volatility (and the crash in demand that would follow the cryptocurrency markets' inevitable bust),\" the suit claims.\nWhen the inevitable happened and crypto prices crashed, Nvidia's shares fell 19 percent in November 2018, losing almost half their value a month later. It's claimed that the company under-reported its cryptocurrency-mining revenues by around $1.13 billion.\nThe suit seeks damages for what it claims was a violation of US securities laws, but it would be surprising if the complaint succeeded. Why would Nvidia report gaming card sales in a segment other than 'gaming,' even if they weren't being used for that purpose? And it's not as if buying multiple GeForce cards for cryptomining was a secret.\n\n\n\n\n 18 comments\n \n210 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Defender misidentifies key driver, disrupting popular PC monitoring tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

The latest estimates by Jon Peddie Research showed Nvidia dominating with roughly 69% share in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AMD) 31% in a duopolistic market.  Nvidia's Early Bet On Gaming Growth Nvidia was founded in April 1993 by the trio of\u00a0Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem\u00a0on the premise that PCs would one day become consumer devices for enjoying games and multimedia. The first product rolled out of Nvidia's stable in 1995 in the form of a PCI card named NV1, which incidentally did not sell well. The company forged an important alliance in 1998 when it struck a manufacturing partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM). The real breakthrough came in 1991 when Nvidia invented the GPU. In 2001, the company unveiled its nForce Platform, signaling its entry into the integrated GPU market. It introduced the first programmable GPU, the GeForce3. On the financial front, Nvidia achieved the milestone of $1 billion in annual revenue\u00a0in 2001. The stock was added to the S&P 500 Index that year. In 2005, Nvidia developed a processor for Sony Corp's (NYSE: SNE) PlayStation 3. The $1-billion number become Nvidia's run rate for quarterly revenue\u00a0in 2007.  Nvidia's Wall Street Journey In 1991, the company went public, offering 3.5 million shares at $12 per share, raising $42 million in the process. The stock closed the debut session Jan. 22, 1999 at $19.7, giving it a market-cap of $626.1 million. Nvidia's Journey to $100B Market Cap The  shares  touched a $1-billion market cap milestone in Nov. 1999, the same year of its debut. In another six years, the market cap increased to $10 billion. The market cap doubled to $20 billion in September\u00a02007. With the stock losing ground, the market cap slipped\u00a0and it took nearly a decade for the stock to reclaim the $20-billion market cap level. The stock's market cap increased to $20 billion after the gap in April 2016. It was then a northward bound journey for the stock as well as its market cap. The market cap hit $100 billion for the first time in July 2017. It took 18 years from Nvidia's IPO for the stock to attain the $100-billion market cap mark and 24 years from the company's\u00a0inception.  Nvidia achieved a $200-billion market cap last week.

'The economics, the value proposition is really off the charts.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia said its newly revealed data center GPU, the A100, will \"revolutionize\" artificial intelligence by unifying training and inference into one architecture that can outperform the chipmaker\u2019s V100 and T4 several times over.\nBased on the company\u2019s new 7-nanometer Ampere GPU architecture, the A100 provides \"massive flexibility\" unlike any GPU the company has released before, thanks to its ability to partition into as many as seven distinct GPU inferences, Nvidia revealed during its virtual GPU Technology Conference Thursday. Alternatively, the A100 can link with seven other units to act as one giant GPU.\n[Related: Nvidia's 5 Biggest GTC 2020 Announcements: From A100 To SmartNICs]\n\n\nid\nunit-1659132512259\n\n\ntype\nSponsored post\n\n\nIn a pre-briefing with journalists, Nvidia CEO and founder Jensen Huang said the A100 will create a tectonic shift in the economics of spinning up new data centers for AI inference and training because of the GPU\u2019s ability to scale up and scale out at any given time.\n\"The Ampere server could either be eight GPUs working together for training, or it could be 56 GPUs made for inference. And so all of the overhead of additional memory and CPUs and power supplies and all that stuff of 56 servers basically collapsed into one, the economics, the value proposition is really off the charts,\" he said. \"And that's the thing that's really exciting.\"\nIn an example given by the company, Nvidia said five DGX A100 systems \u2013 a new AI server appliance that comes with eight A100 GPUs \u2013 could provide the same amount of training and inference work as 50 V100-based DGX-1 systems and 600 CPU systems at a tenth of the cost and a twentieth of the power.\nOne major reason Nvidia said it can pull this off is the A100 can perform single-precision floating point math (FP32) for training workloads and eight-bit integer math (INT8) for inference 20 times faster than the V100 GPU that came out in 2017. The company said the A100 is 2.5 times faster for double-precision floating point math (FP64) for high-performance computing workloads.\nNvidia said it has made five technological breakthroughs to achieve what it said is the largest generational leap in performance across all eight generations of its GPU.\nFor one, the A100 contains more than 54 billion transistors on a 826 mm2 die, making what it said is the largest 7nm processor. This is made possible by to the Ampere architecture\u2019s use of the TSMC\u2019s 7nm manufacturing process that is also used by AMD\u2019s Zen 2 processors.\nThe A100 also uses Nvidia\u2019s new third-generation Tensor Cores that comes with a new TF32 For AI format, which enables single-precision floating point acceleration thanks to its ability to compress the number of bits needed to complete math equations. The Tensor Cores also support double-precision floating point for the first time, enabling such math problems to be solved faster.\nIn addition, the new Tensor Cores use a new efficiency technique called structural sparsity that takes advantage of the spark nature of AI math to speed up the execution of calculations by two times. The technique supports TF32, FP16, BFLOAT16, INT8 and INT4 formats.\nAnother breakthrough is the A100\u2019s multi-instance GPU capability, allowing the GPU to be partitioned in as many as seven separate GPU instances that can perform work in parallel. This is similar to the capabilities offered by Nvidia\u2019s vComputeServer software, except no virtualization is required.\nTo enable faster GPU-to-GPU communication within servers, Nvidia\u2019s new third-generation NVLink interconnect enables 4.8 TB per second in bi-direction bandwidth and 600 GB per second in GPU-to-GPU bandwidth. This, combined with 200 Gbps Mellanox interconnects, gives servers improved throughput so that they can act more effectively as one large GPU for training massive AI models.\nWith the A100\u2019s ability to perform inference and training workloads faster than Nvidia's T4 and V100 GPUs and within the same package, the idea is that organizations can be much more flexible and increase utilization with their data centers, buying up A100s to initially perform training and then direct the GPUs to do inference once the models have been trained.\n\"It's going to unify that infrastructure into something much more flexible, much more fungible and increase the utility makes it a lot easier to predict how much capacity you need,\" Huang said.\nThe A100 comes with 3,456 FP64 CUDA Cores, 6,912 FP32 CUDA Cores, 432 Tensor Cores, 108 streaming multiprocessors and 40 GB of GPU memory within a 400-watt power envelope.\nWith the A100 already in full production, Nvidia is taking the GPU to market in multiple ways: with the eight-GPU DGX A100 deep learning system that will cost $200,000, with the HGX A100 server building block meant to help OEMs and system builders make their own A100 systems and with the EGX A100 that combines an A100 with a Mellanox SmartNIC for edge computing, among other things.\nOEM partners expected to release A100-based servers include Atos, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, Gigabyte, H3C, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Inspur, Lenovo, Quanta and Supermicro. Several cloud service providers are also expected to spin up A100-based instances, including Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Google Cloud and Tencent Cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

If you want to digest the whole caboodle, the 'Kitchen Keynote' has been split into eight bite sized chunks on the Nvidia YouTube channel, and here is the playlist. Before we go on, I'll state now that there were no great reveals for consumers - i.e specific news on the GeForce line - but it wasn't really expected and there were still some juicy titbits including, or course, the Ampere architecture reveal.\n\nAfter an introductory video which began thanking all the essential workers who are keeping the world running during the widespread lockdown (sometimes with help from Nvidia tech), the next video is pretty interesting for PC gamers and enthusiasts. Embedded directly below you will see a video which addresses RTX graphics technology, and while it isn't really news, it is good to see DLSS 2.0 discussed and demonstrated by the Nvidia CEO.\n\nLater in the video embedded above, there is a demo of a fully playable physics-based game which uses both raytracing and AI technology. The Nvidia Omniverse platform, 9mins 45sec in, enables interactive real-time photorealistic environments on a single Quadro RTX 8000 GPU.\n\nNvidia Ampere A100 GPU\nThe new A100 GPU is built on the Ampere architecture, claimed to offer the largest generational leap in GPU performance to date. It is the power behind the new DGX A100 AI system which can deliver 5 Petaflops of performance (the system features eight A100 GPUs . Nvidia has built the A100 is also built for data analytics, scientific computing and cloud graphics.\n\"Nvidia A100 GPU is a 20x AI performance leap and an end-to-end machine learning accelerator \u2014 from data analytics to training to inference,\" claimed Jensen Huang. \"For the first time, scale-up and scale-out workloads can be accelerated on one platform. Nvidia A100 will simultaneously boost throughput and drive down the cost of data centres.\"\n\nTech specs of the A100 GPU include the following:\n\nBuilt on TSMC 7nm with 3D stacking\nContains 54bn transistors (12nm GV100 GPUs contained 21bn transistors)\n3rd Gen Tensor cores\nMIG\n3rd gen NVLink and NVSwitch\nHBM2 1.6TB/s memory\n\n\nNvidia DGX A100\nThe $199,000 DGX A100 packs in eight of the new Nvidia A100 Tensor Core GPUs, providing 320GB of memory for training the largest AI datasets, and the latest high-speed Nvidia Mellanox HDR 200Gbps interconnects. This 5 Petaflop system can be partitioned to act as 56 instances (MIG - multi instance GPU). Alternatively it can work as a combined, single, fully integrated, software-defined platform - \"the world's largest GPU\".\n\nWith dual 64-core AMD Rome CPUs\nOther announcements from Nvidia today\nIn other green team news, Nvidia took the wraps off its two EGX Edge AI platform products: EGX A100, the first edge AI product based on NVIDIA Ampere architecture, for larger commercial off-the-shelf servers; and the tiny EGX Jetson Xavier NX for micro-edge servers. It highlighted the Nvidia Mellanox ConnectX-6 Lx SmartNIC, a highly secure and efficient 25/50 gigabit per second (Gb/s) Ethernet smart network interface controller. And it talked about application frameworks for AI computing, its collaboration with BMW in robotics, and partnerships with bio-tech companies looking into problems like Covid-19.\nRumours point to GeForce RTX 3000 graphics cards, based upon Ampere GPU technology, being launched in time for the release of Cyberpunk 2077 in September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 1 Comment\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

While physical testing is temporarily paused, the cloud-based NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation platform makes it possible to dispatch virtual vehicles in virtual environments to continue making great progress in self-driving technology.\n\nIn the video demonstration, a virtual NVIDIA BB8 test vehicle drives near NVIDIA headquarters in Silicon Valley, traveling through highways and urban streets \u2014 all in simulation. The 17-mile loop shows the NVIDIA DRIVE AV Software navigating the roadways, pedestrians and traffic in a highly accurate replica environment.\nData Center Proving Ground\nNVIDIA DRIVE Constellation is a cloud-based simulation platform, designed from the ground up to support the development and validation of autonomous vehicles. The data center-based platform consists of two side-by-side servers.\nThe first server uses NVIDIA GPUs running DRIVE Sim software and generates the sensor output from the virtual car driving in a virtual world. The second server contains the actual vehicle computer, processing the simulated sensor data running the exact same DRIVE AV and DRIVE IX software that\u2019s being deployed in the real car.\nThe driving decisions from the second server are fed back into the first, enabling real-time, bit-accurate, hardware-in-the-loop development and testing.\nDRIVE Constellation is composed of two side-by-side servers enabling bit-accurate, hardware-in-the-loop testing.\nThe system is designed to be deployed in a data center as a scalable virtual fleet. This provides development engineers with a vehicle on demand, and gives them the ability to conduct testing at scale. It also makes it possible to consistently test rare and dangerous scenarios that are difficult or impossible to encounter in the real world.\nDevelopment and Testing from End to End\nBuilding an autonomous vehicle requires testing at every level \u2014 starting at subsystems and continuing all the way to full vehicle integration tests. DRIVE Constellation enables this type of end-to-end development and testing for autonomous vehicles in simulation, similar to developing a physical car.\nEnd-to-end tests ensure timing and performance accuracy as well as accurate modeling of the complex interdependency of different systems in autonomous vehicle software.\nDRIVE Sim creates a digital twin of the real world to provide a realistic driving environment.\nAchieving this level of fidelity at scale is a major undertaking. The environment, traffic behavior, sensor inputs and vehicle dynamics must appear, act and feed into the car computer just as they would in the real world.\nThis requires multiple GPUs to generate synthetic data in sync with precise timing. The vehicle software and hardware signals and interfaces must be replicated in simulation \u2014 and everything has to run in real time.\nSimulating Silicon Valley\nComprehensive simulation starts with the environment. To accurately recreate the Silicon Valley driving loop, 3D Mapping, a member of the NVIDIA DRIVE ecosystem, scanned the roadways to within 5 centimeters of accuracy. The raw scanned data was then processed into a dataset format known as OpenDRIVE.\nFrom there, NVIDIA developed a content creation pipeline to generate a highly accurate 3D environment using the NVIDIA Omniverse collaboration platform. The environment includes accurate road networks and roadmarks. Material properties are also applied to ensure it interacts with light rays, radio waves and lidar rays in the same way real sensors interact with the physical world.\nDRIVE Sim allows end-to-end testing, including in-car visualization.\nDRIVE Sim provides a wide range of light and weather conditions for testing AV software.\nRecreating Sensor Data\nWith an accurate environment in place, high-fidelity development and testing next requires accurately generated sensor data. The sensor models include those typically found on an autonomous test vehicle, such as camera, lidar, radar and inertial measurement unit. DRIVE Sim provides a flexible sensor pipeline and APIs that allow configuring sensors to match real-world vehicle architectures.\nFor camera data, the image pipeline starts by rendering an HDR image that is warped according to the lens properties of the camera used on the vehicle. Exposure control, black and white level balancing, and color grading are applied to the image to match the sensor profile. Finally, the pixel data is converted to its native output format using a sensor-specific encoder.\nIn addition to camera models, DRIVE Sim provides physically based lidar and radar sensors using ray tracing. NVIDIA RTX GPUs enable DRIVE Sim to run highly computationally intensive radar and lidar models in real time.\nDRIVE Constellation provides powerful RTX GPUs that allow real-time rendering of sensors using ray tracing. The scene above shows the combined returns of eight radars being rendered in real time for the AV stack.\nModeling Vehicle Behavior\nFinally, vehicle models are critical for accurate simulation. As control signals \u2014 steering, acceleration and braking \u2014 are sent to the in-vehicle computer, the car must respond just as it would in the physical world.\nTo do so, the simulation platform must recreate motion properly, including details such as interaction with the road surface. Vehicle models in DRIVE Sim are handled using a plugin system with the included PhysX models or third-party vehicle dynamics models from NVIDIA DRIVE ecosystem partners such as Mechanical Simulation or IPG.\nVehicle dynamics also play a key role in accurate sensor data generation. As the vehicle operates, the position and pose of the vehicle changes significantly, affecting a sensor\u2019s viewpoint. For example, the forward-facing cameras will pitch downward when a car is braking. Modeling vehicle dynamics correctly is important to generating sensor data properly.\nBy accurately simulating each of these components \u2014 environment, sensors, vehicle dynamics \u2014 on a single, end-to-end platform, NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation and DRIVE Sim are critical pieces to a comprehensive development and testing pipeline. They enable NVIDIA and its partners to work toward safer and more efficient autonomous vehicles as physical fleets remain in the garage.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC | NVIDIA DRIVE | NVIDIA DRIVE Sim | Omniverse | Synthetic Data Generation | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

To that end, at today\u2019s now digital GPU Technology Conference 2020 keynote, the company and its CEO Jensen Huang are taking to the virtual stage to announce NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation GPU architecture, Ampere, and the first products that will be using it.\nLike the Volta reveal 3 years ago \u2013 and is now traditional for NVIDIA GTC reveals \u2013 today\u2019s focus is on the very high end of the market. In 2017 NVIDIA launched the Volta-based GV100 GPU, and with it the V100 accelerator. V100 was a massive success for the company, greatly expanding their datacenter business on the back of the Volta architecture\u2019s novel tensor cores and sheer brute force that can only be provided by a 800mm2+ GPU. Now in 2020, the company is looking to continue that growth with Volta\u2019s successor, the Ampere architecture.\nNow a much more secretive company than they once were, NVIDIA has been holding its future GPU roadmap close to its chest. While the Ampere codename (among others) has been floating around for quite some time now, it\u2019s only this morning that we\u2019re finally getting confirmation that Ampere is in, as well as our first details on the architecture. Due to the nature of NVIDIA\u2019s digital presentation \u2013 as well as the limited information given in NVIDIA\u2019s press pre-briefings \u2013 we don\u2019t have all of the details on Ampere quite yet. However for this morning at least, NVIDIA is touching upon the highlights of the architecture for its datacenter compute and AI customers, and what major innovations Ampere is bringing to help with their workloads.\nKicking things off for the Ampere family is the A100. Officially, this is the name of both the GPU and the accelerator incorporating it; and at least for the moment they\u2019re both one in the same, since there is only the single accelerator using the GPU.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Accelerator Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nA100\nV100\nP100\n\n\nFP32 CUDA Cores\n6912\n5120\n3584\n\n\nBoost Clock\n~1.41GHz\n1530MHz\n1480MHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n2.4Gbps HBM2\n1.75Gbps HBM2\n1.4Gbps HBM2\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n5120-bit\n4096-bit\n4096-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n1.6TB/sec\n900GB/sec\n720GB/sec\n\n\nVRAM\n40GB\n16GB/32GB\n16GB\n\n\nSingle Precision\n19.5 TFLOPs\n15.7 TFLOPs\n10.6 TFLOPs\n\n\nDouble Precision\n9.7 TFLOPs\n\t\t\t(1/2 FP32 rate)\n7.8 TFLOPs\n\t\t\t(1/2 FP32 rate)\n5.3 TFLOPs\n\t\t\t(1/2 FP32 rate)\n\n\nINT8 Tensor\n624 TOPs\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nFP16 Tensor\n312 TFLOPs\n125 TFLOPs\nN/A\n\n\nTF32 Tensor\n156 TFLOPs\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nInterconnect\nNVLink 3\n\t\t\t12 Links (600GB/sec)\nNVLink 2\n\t\t\t6 Links (300GB/sec)\nNVLink 1\n\t\t\t4 Links (160GB/sec)\n\n\nGPU\nGA100\n\t\t\t(826mm2)\nGV100\n\t\t\t(815mm2)\nGP100\n\t\t\t(610mm2)\n\n\nTransistor Count\n54.2B\n21.1B\n15.3B\n\n\nTDP\n400W\n300W/350W\n300W\n\n\nManufacturing Process\nTSMC 7N\nTSMC 12nm FFN\nTSMC 16nm FinFET\n\n\nInterface\nSXM4\nSXM2/SXM3\nSXM\n\n\nArchitecture\nAmpere\nVolta\nPascal\n\n\n\nDesigned to be the successor to the V100 accelerator, the A100 aims just as high, just as we\u2019d expect from NVIDIA\u2019s new flagship accelerator for compute. \u00a0The leading Ampere part is built on TSMC\u2019s 7nm process and incorporates a whopping 54 billion transistors, 2.5x as many as the V100 before it. NVIDIA has put the full density improvements offered by the 7nm process in use, and then some, as the resulting GPU die is 826mm2 in size, even larger than the GV100. NVIDIA went big on the last generation, and in order to top themselves they\u2019ve gone even bigger this generation.\nWe\u2019ll touch more on the individual specifications a bit later, but at a high level it\u2019s clear that NVIDIA has invested more in some areas than others. FP32 performance is, on paper, only modestly improved from the V100. Meanwhile tensor performance is greatly improved \u2013 almost 2.5x for FP16 tensors \u2013 and NVIDIA has greatly expanded the formats that can be used with INT8/4 support, as well as a new FP32-ish format called TF32. Memory bandwidth is also significantly expanded, with multiple stacks of HBM2 memory delivering a total of 1.6TB/second of bandwidth to feed the beast that is Ampere.\nNVIDIA will be delivering the initial version of this accelerator in their now-common SXM form factor, which is a mezzanine-style card well-suited for installation in servers. On a generation-over-generation basis, power consumption has once again gone up, which is probably fitting for a generation called Ampere. Altogether the A100 is rated for 400W, as opposed to 300W and 350W for various versions of the V100. This makes the SXM form factor all the more important for NVIDIA\u2019s efforts, as PCIe cards would not be suitable for that kind of power consumption.\nAs for the Ampere architecture itself, NVIDIA is releasing limited details about it today. Expect we\u2019ll hear more over the coming weeks, but for now NVIDIA is confirming that they are keeping their various product lines architecturally compatible, albeit in potentially vastly different configurations. So while the company is not talking about Ampere (or derivatives) for video cards today, they are making it clear that what they\u2019ve been working on is not a pure compute architecture, and that Ampere\u2019s technologies will be coming to graphics parts as well, presumably with some new features for them as well. Ultimately this is part of NVIDIA\u2019s ongoing strategy to ensure that they have a single ecosystem, where, to quote Jensen, \u201cEvery single workload runs on every single GPU.\u201d\n\nAmpere Tensor Processing: More Throughput, More Formats\nUnsurprisingly, the big innovations in Ampere as far as compute are concerned \u2013 or, at least, what NVIDIA wants to focus on today \u2013 is based around tensor processing. The bread and butter of their success in the Volta/Turing generation on AI training and inference, NVIDIA is back with their third generation of tensor cores, and with them significant improvements to both overall performance and the number of formats supported.\nIt\u2019s the latter that\u2019s arguably the biggest shift. NVIDIA\u2019s Volta products only supported FP16 tensors, which was very useful for training, but in practice overkill for many types of inference. NVIDIA later introduced INT8 and INT4 support for their Turing products, used In the T4 accelerator, but the result was bifurcated product line where the V100 was primarily for training, and the T4 was primarily for inference.\nFor A100, however, NVIDIA wants to have it all in a single server accelerator. So A100 supports multiple high precision training formats, as well as the lower precision formats commonly used for inference. As a result, A100 offers high performance for both training and inference, well in excess of what any of the earlier Volta or Turing products could deliver. Consequently, A100 is designed to be well-suited for the entire spectrum of AI workloads, capable of scaling-up by teaming up accelerators via NVLink, or scaling-out by using NVIDIA\u2019s new Multi-Instance GPU technology to split up a single A100 for several workloads.\nOn the training side of matters, NVIDIA has added support for 3 more formats: bfloat16, the new FP32-like TF32, and FP64. TF32 \u2013 short for Tensor Float 32 \u2013 is a reduced precision format that NVIDIA is introducing in order to offer fast FP32-ish tensor operations. The 20 bit format uses an 8 bit exponent, just like FP32, but shortens the mantissa to 10 bits, just like FP16. The end result is a format with the range of FP32, but the precision of FP16, which NVIDIA thinks will be useful for AI needs that need a greater range than FP16, but not necessary more precision.\n\nThe implementation of TF32 allows NVIDIA to transparently support tensor operations on FP32 data. CUDA developers can feed the tensor cores FP32 data, where it\u2019s internally operated on as TF32, and then accumulated and returned as FP32. The effective rate of this format is one-half the rate for pure FP16, or in the case of the A100 in particular, 156 TFLOPs. As the first part with TF32 support there\u2019s no true analog in earlier NVIDIA accelerators, but by using the tensor cores it\u2019s 20 times faster than doing the same math on V100\u2019s CUDA cores. Which is one of the reasons that NVIDIA is touting the A100 as being \u201c20x\u201d faster than Volta.\nAlternatively, developers can use bfloat16, a format popularized by Intel. The alternative 16bit format is fully supported by Ampere\u2019s tensor cores (as well as its CUDA cores), at the same throughput as FP16. Or to take things to the extreme, NVIDIA even offers FP64 support on Ampere\u2019s tensor cores. The throughput rate is vastly lower than FP16/TF32 \u2013 a strong hint that NVIDIA is running it over several rounds \u2013 but they can still deliver 19.5 TFLOPs of FP64 tensor throughput, which is 2x the natural FP64 rate of A100\u2019s CUDA cores, and 2.5x the rate that the V100 could do similar matrix math.\nAs for inference, INT8, INT4, and INT1 tensor operations are all supported, just as they were on Turing. This means that A100 is equally capable in formats, and far faster given just how much hardware NVIDIA is throwing at tensor operations altogether.\nAnd a lot of hardware it is. While NVIDIA\u2019s specifications don\u2019t easily capture this, Ampere\u2019s updated tensor cores offer even higher throughput per core than Volta/Turing\u2019s did. A single Ampere tensor core has 4x the FMA throughput as a Volta tensor core, which has allowed NVIDIA to halve the total number of tensor cores per SM \u2013 going from 8 cores to 4 \u2013 and still deliver a functional 2x increase in FMA throughput. In essence, a single Ampere tensor core has become an even larger massive matrix multiplication machine, and I\u2019ll be curious to see what NVIDIA\u2019s deep dives have to say about what that means for efficiency and keeping the tensor cores fed.\nSparsity Acceleration: Go Faster By Doing Less Work\nBut NVIDIA didn\u2019t stop by just making faster tensor cores with a larger number of supported formats. New to the Ampere architecture, NVIDIA is introducing support for sparsity acceleration. And while I can\u2019t do the subject of neural network sparsity justice in an article this short, at a high level the concept involves pruning the less useful weights out of a network, leaving behind just the most important weights. Conceptually this results in a sparse matrix of weights (and hence the term sparsity acceleration), where only half of the cells are a non-zero value. And with half of the cells pruned, the resulting neural network can be processed by A100 at effectively twice the rate. The net result then is that usiing sparsity acceleration doubles the performance of NVIDIA\u2019s tensor cores.\n\nOf course, any time you talk about throwing out half of a neural network or other dataset, it raises some eyebrows, and for good reason. According to NVIDIA, the method they\u2019ve developed using a 2:4 structured sparsity pattern results in \u201cvirtually no loss in inferencing accuracy\u201d, with the company basing it on a multitude of different networks. None the less, sparsity is an optional feature that developers will need to specifically invoke. But when it can be safely used, it pushes the theoretical throughput of the A100 to over 1200 TOPs in the case of an INT8 inference task.\nMulti-Instance GPU: Dedicated GPU Partitioning\nContinuing down this tensor and AI-focused path, Ampere\u2019s third major architectural feature is designed to help NVIDIA\u2019s customers put the massive GPU to good use, especially in the case of inference. And that feature is Multi-Instance GPU (MIG). A mechanism for GPU partitioning, MIG allows for a single A100 to be partitioned into up to 7 virtual GPUs, each of which gets its own dedicated allocation of SMs, L2 cache, and memory controllers. The idea behind this system, as with CPU partitioning and virtualization, is to give the user/task running in each partition dedicated resources and a predictable level of performance.\n\nMIG follows earlier NVIDIA efforts in this field, which have offered similar partitioning for virtual graphics needs (e.g. GRID), however Volta did not have a partitioning mechanism for compute. As a result, while Volta can run jobs from multiple users on separate SMs, it cannot guarantee resource access or prevent a job from consuming the majority of the L2 cache or memory bandwidth. MIG, by comparison, gives each partition dedicated L2 cache and memory, making each slice of the GPU fully complete, and yet completely isolated.\nOverall, NVIDIA says that they envision several different use cases for MIG. At a fundamental level, it\u2019s a virtualization technology, allowing cloud operators and others to better allocate compute time on an A100. MIG instances provide hard isolation between each other \u2013 including fault tolerance \u2013 as well as the aforementioned performance predictability. From a business standpoint this will help cloud providers raise their GPU utilization rates \u2013 they no longer need to overprovision as a safety margin \u2013 packing more users on to a single GPU.\n\nAt the same time, MIG is also the answer to how one incredibly beefy A100 can be a proper replacement for several T4-type accelerators. Because many inference jobs do not require the massive amount of resources available across a complete A100, MIG is the means to subdividing an A100 into smaller chunks that are more appropriately sized for inference tasks. And thus cloud providers, hyperscalers, and others can replace boxes of T4 accelerators with a smaller number of A100 boxes, saving space and power while still being able to run numerous different compute jobs. Overall, NVIDIA is touting a minimum size A100 instance (MIG 1g) as being able to offer the performance of a single V100 accelerator; though it goes without saying that the actual performance difference will depend on the nature of the workload and how much it benefits from Ampere\u2019s other architectural changes.\nNVLink: Faster Links, Thinner Links\nThe final Ampere architectural feature that NVIDIA is focusing on today \u2013 and finally getting away from tensor workloads in particular \u2013 is the third generation of NVIDIA\u2019s NVLink interconnect technology. First introduced in 2016 with the Pascal P100 GPU, NVLink is NVIDIA\u2019s proprietary high bandwidth interconnect, which is designed to allow up to 16 GPUs to be connected to each other to operate as a single cluster, for larger workloads that need more performance than a single GPU can offer.\u00a0 For Volta, NVIDIA gave NVLink a minor revision, adding some additional links to V100 and bumping up the data rate by 25%. Meanwhile, for A100 and NVLink 3, this time around NVIDIA is undertaking a much bigger upgrade, doubling the amount of aggregate bandwidth available via NVLinks.\nAll told, there are two big changes to NVLink 3 compared to NVLink 2, which serve both to offer more bandwidth as well as to offer additional topology and link options. First and foremost, NVIDIA has effectively doubled the signaling rate for NVLink, going from 25.78Gbps on NVLink 2 to 50Gbps on NVLink 3. This keeps NVLink in lockstep with other interconnect technologies, many of which are similarly upgrading to faster signaling.\nThe other big change is that, in light of doubling the signaling rate, NVIDIA is also halving the number of signal pairs/lanes within a single NVLink, dropping from 8 pairs to 4. The net result is that the amount of bandwidth available within a single NVLink is unchanged, at 25GB/sec up and 25GB/sec down (or 50GB/sec aggregate, as is often thrown around), but it can be accomplished with half as many lanes.\n\n\n\nNVLink Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nNVLink 3\nNVLink 2\nNVLink (1)\n\n\nSignaling Rate\n50 Gbps\n25 Gbps\n20 Gbps\n\n\nLanes/Link\n4\n8\n8\n\n\nBandwidth/Direction/Link\n25 GB/sec\n25 GB/sec\n20 GB/sec\n\n\nTotal Bandwidth/Link\n50 GB/sec\n50 GB/sec\n40 GB/sec\n\n\nLinks/Chip\n12\n\t\t\t(A100)\n6\n\t\t\t(V100)\n4\n\t\t\t(P100)\n\n\nBandwidth/Chip\n600 GB/sec\n300 GB/sec\n160 GB/sec\n\n\n\nFor A100 in particular, NVIDIA has used the gains from these smaller NVLinks to double the number of NVLinks available on the GPU. So while V100 offered 6 NVLinks for a total bandwidth of 300GB/sec, A100 offers 12 NVLinks for a total bandwidth of 600GB/sec. Which at a high level sounds misleading \u2013 that NVIDIA simply added more NVLinks \u2013 but in reality the number of high speed signaling pairs hasn\u2019t changed, only their allocation has. The real improvement in NVLink that\u2019s driving more bandwidth is the fundamental improvement in the signaling rate.\nThese narrower NVLinks in turn will open up new options for NVIDIA and its customers with regards to NVLink topologies. Previously, the 6 link layout of V100 meant that an 8 GPU configuration required using a hybrid mesh cube design, where only some of the GPUs were directly connected to others. But with 12 links, it becomes possible to have an 8 GPU configuration where each and every GPU is directly connected to each other. It also offers new topology options when using NVIDIA\u2019s NVSwitches \u2013 there NVLink data switch chips \u2013 as a single GPU can now connect to more switches. On which note, NVIDIA is also rolling out a new generation of NVSwitches to support NVLink 3\u2019s faster signaling rate.\n\nA100 Accelerator: Shipping Now in the DGX A100\nLast but not least, let\u2019s talk about when the A100 will be available. According to NVIDIA, the GPU and accelerator is already in full production, and in fact the company is already shipping their first GPUs as part of their new DGX A100 system. The latest in NVIDIA\u2019s line of DGX servers, the DGX 100 is a complete system that incorporates 8 A100 accelerators, as well as 15 TB of storage, dual AMD Rome 7742 CPUs (64C/each), 1 TB of RAM, and HDR InfiniBand powered by Mellanox controllers. As with the Volta launch, NVIDIA is shipping A100 accelerators here first, so for the moment this is the quickest way to get an A100 accelerator.\n\nBeing among the first to get an A100 does come with a hefty price tag, however: the DGX A100 will set you back a cool $199K. Which, refrains of \u201cthe more you buy, the more you save\u201d aside, is $50K more than what the DGX-1V was priced at back in 2017. So the price tag to be an early adopter has gone up.\nIn the meantime, according to NVIDIA the honor of receiving the first DGX systems has gone to Argonne National Laboratory, where the lab has already begun installing DGX A100 servers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n124 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nUnashamed_unoriginal_username_x86 - Thursday, May 14, 2020 - link\nHype!

That was a response to someone talking about having a woodshop and wanting to build things.  I have several businesses - the wood shop is a hobby.  My machine shop is over 40K sq ft and has close to $35M in machines from DMG Mori, Mazak, Haas, etc.  The machine shop is part of an engineering company I own.  16 Engineers, 5 production supervisors and about 5 other people doing whatever needs to be done.  We work for large companies - most recently a major after market parts supplier and more specifically parts for the new Supras.  We have worked for numerous national racing teams to  develop parts and to build and deliver every thing from simple components to full chassis assemblies.  Our process starts virtually and any new parts or assemblies are tested using our current 2 x 16xV100 DGX-2s. That was detailed in the paragraph above the one you highlighted.I have been working with wood even before I took industrial arts in school.  I can make anything from cabinets to furniture.  It something I enjoy doing.  My dad was a union machinist, and he had a small hobby wood shop that I learned in.  I had my own set of hand tools by the time I was 8 - and knew how to use them - all the machinery in the world is useless if you don't know how to put something together. You need to get your facts straight.  And BTW - never once got a business loan in my life - never needed it.Its more than a little creepy you are stalking me and taking screenshots - you think you have some sort of \"gotcha\" moment?  Kid, I also own 2 other companies, one with well over 1000 employees and over $320M in gross revenues - we have production facilities in 10 states. 100% of my workforce is idled at the moment and all still drawing their full 40hr paycheck - most are installers making $22.50 per hour - so they are getting paid $900 to sit on their butts. No cuts to benefits.The 3rd company is a private equity company I am 50% partner in.  Business partner and the Godfather to my kids was a major VC in Cali even before the internet - invested in little companies such as Netscape, Silicon Graphics, Sun and quite a few others.  Was a major investor in Cisco and later Juniper Networks and was an early angel to several companies who have gone public in the last few years.While you were not even born I was building and in some cases selling businesses.  in 1994 started the first ISP in the Houston TX area - in 1995 we had over 25K dial up customers, sold my interest and started another ISP focusing on mostly big bandwidth.  OC3 and OC12 as well as various Sonet/SDH services.  We had 50K dial up, 8K DSL (1st DSL testbed in Texas) as well as hundreds of lines to clients ranging from a single TI upto an OC12.  We sold to a company that would become Level 3 Communications - I walked out with close to $43M in the bank - that was invested over the course of 20 years and is worth many many multiples of that, I was 28 when I sold the 2nd ISP - I retired from doing anything I didn't want to do to make a living.  To me retiring is not sitting on a beach somewhere drinking margaritas.I don't know what your infatuation with me is, but it's creepy as hell.  I am sorry you come from a disadvantaged background where even hand tools were out of reach, but that is not my problem.  I feel bad for you that you had no examples of successful people for you to emulate and become successful yourself - instead you are a warrior who thinks he pulled off some kind of Gotcha!!Well kid, I am off - the Silver Salmon are starting to run on the Copper River in Alaska - so have fun, I am sure you have tons of my posts screen shotted - so GL with that\n\n\n\nKorguz - Friday, May 15, 2020 - link\nyea right you do, YOU said you RETIRED 20 years ago when YOU were 28, YOU said YOU started that woodshop 40 YEARS ago, YOU werent  talking about them, YOU were talking about you \" I started 40 years ago with a next to nothing \" \" The engineering is the same whether it's in my metal / composites shop or the wood shop. \" that is YOU talking about YOU starting the business not the person YOU are replying to. whats  the matter Deicidium369, got caught in a LIE and now have to lie even more to try to get out of it ?  most of your posts are pure BS and you know it. you rarely, IF EVER post and links of proof to your BS, when confronted or called out on your BS, you seem to do two things, run away with your tail between your legs, or reply with insults, name calling or condescending comments, just like your replies to me, and ANY one else that calls you out on your made up BS, even those that write about computer related stuff, like Jarred W, Ian and Ryan on here.  that seems to be why you were banned on toms.blah blah blah blah is all i read in this BS post, all fiction.going by this BS post, you are either around 45 years old, or 60+ but cause you cant get your own facts straight, who knows which is the truth, and which is fiction, like your posts.\n\n\n\nPeterCollier - Friday, May 15, 2020 - link\nYour obsession with a successful person is not aiding your success in life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n13\n\n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

From gaming, to data centre, to cloud and AI, the Ampere architecture will power every graphics card Nvidia ships over the next year or two.\"Ampere will eventually replace Nvidia\u2019s Turing and Volta chips with a single platform that streamlines Nvidia's GPU lineup,\" Huang is reported to have said in a recent Ampere pre-briefing. \"Unquestionably, it\u2019s the first time that we\u2019ve unified the acceleration workload of the entire data center into one single platform.\"Turing is the graphics architecture that's used on Nvidia's current gaming graphics cards, from the GTX 1650 all the way up to the RTX 2080 Ti, and while there had been speculation that Ampere might just be a replacement for the old professional Volta design, it's now confirmed that the GPU architecture being unveiled today will find its home in our gaming PCs.There's still no hint as to when that might happen, but we're pegging our hopes on an August/September announcement/release cadence.The only other actual nod to the gaming cards expected to arrive later this year was after a question about what the potential difference might be between the consumer and professional GPU designs.\"There's great overlap in the architecture,\" Huang is reported to have said, \"but not in configuration.\"That's not a surprise considering the MarketWatch report suggests that the Ampere architecture, presumably the GA100 GPU going into the DGX A100 servers, is a 7nm design housing over 54 billion transistors. For reference, there are 18.6 billion transistors in the top 12nm Turing GPU, and 21.1 billion in the V100 Volta GPU.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Holy hell, that's a lot of transistors.I mean, 7nm may allow for greater density of transistors in a GPU, but that's going to be one mammoth chunk of silicon, and surely way too pricey to drop some 48 billion transistors into a graphics card going into our PCs.The first DGX A100 systems have already gone out to researchers, notably the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago, where Ampere is being put to use trying to explore potential vaccines for COVID-19.\u201cThe compute power of the new DGX A100 systems coming to Argonne will help researchers explore treatments and vaccines,\" said Rick Stevens, associate laboratory director at Argonne, \"and study the spread of the virus, enabling scientists to do years\u2019 worth of AI-accelerated work in months or days.\u201dThat's probably a little more worthwhile than getting real-time ray tracing working above 60fps at 4K.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDave JamesSocial Links NavigationEditor-in-Chief, HardwareDave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the Colecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!).

And with NVIDIA Quadro Experience \u2014 a new application for Quadro GPUs \u2014 professionals across industries can boost their creativity and increase their productivity like never before.\nQuadro Experience, available now, helps professionals simplify time-consuming tasks, streamline workflows and ensure your favorite applications always have the latest updates.\n\nContent Share From Anywhere\nNVIDIA Quadro Experience makes sharing content easier by providing screen capture and desktop recording in 4K, so teams can easily upload content and even broadcast their work directly from their desktop or laptop.\nUsers can quickly access the screenshot and desktop video recording features from within any application or workflow, and conveniently retrieve assets from a user-defined repository.\nThe Instant Replay feature automatically records up to the last 20 minutes of desktop activity, so professionals can capture spontaneous moments or rewind to review previous activities.\nCompatibility with the NVIDIA SHIELD device makes live streaming directly from a desktop to multiple viewers simple. Leverage your existing SHIELD device for an easy sharing experience for presentations, trainings and meetings.\nGet Updates on the Latest Drivers\nRegularly get increased performance, improved driver stability and new features for your system with Quadro Experience. The application automatically notifies users on new driver releases, so they can implement the latest capabilities as soon as they\u2019re available.\nDriver highlights are delivered directly to Quadro Experience whenever new drivers are available to help users determine whether they\u2019re ready to make an immediate update.\nWith simple one-click downloads and installations directly from Quadro Experience, it\u2019s easier to ensure that your Quadro driver is updated and optimized, as well as certified by all your favorite applications.\nWork by Day, Game by Night \n\nWith Quadro Experience, it doesn\u2019t have to be all work and no play. Users can switch their Quadro GPU to Game Mode to unleash optimal gaming performance.\nThe application delivers features similarly offered through GeForce Experience, such as Ansel, Freestyle and Highlights. Users can take advantage of Optimal Playable Settings \u2014 which are in-game settings that aim to enhance image quality and framerates \u2014 and stream gameplay to NVIDIA SHIELD devices.\nDesigners Switch Tracks Fast with Quadro Experience\nImage courtesy of Alstom.\nNVIDIA Quadro Experience is already helping companies enhance their collaborative efforts. One of the beta users of the application is Alstom, builder of the TGV, the fastest train in the world.\nProject review and customization are important parts of Alstom\u2019s workflows \u2014 they often use Autodesk VRED for design review and rendering and Dassault Syst\u00e8mes CATIA for technical review. With Quadro RTX GPUs and Quadro Experience application, Alstom was able to accelerate its design workflow and use GPU power for its graphic needs.\n\u201cSharing professional graphics created with Quadro GPUs requires video capture capabilities that maintain pristine visual fidelity,\u201d said Fabien Normand, virtual reality expert at Alstom. \u201cNVIDIA Quadro Experience makes it simple to accurately capture professional graphics applications, allowing us to continually improve our customers\u2019 VR experiences as well as our internal design workflows.\u201d\nProfessional workflows are becoming more interactive and collaborative. With Quadro Experience, engineers, designers, artists, architects and other professionals can optimize the power of their Quadro GPUs.\nDownload NVIDIA Quadro Experience today.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | Quadro | RTX Mobile Workstations | Visual Computing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Nvidia\u2019s GPUs will be needed for AI training and inference.The FCAI is a community of experts in the field of neural networks and is coordinated by researchers at Aalto University, the University of Helsinki, and the VTT Technical Research Center of Finland.This is not the first such centre: previous NVAITCs have been established in Luxembourg and Italy as well as in several Asian countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 CSC\n\n\n\nSupercomputer backingThe Finnish IT Center for Science (CSC) is also collaborating, supplying AI researchers access to its HPCs at the Kajaani data center.This data center has been reported on in the past by DCD. Recently, the CSC announced it was to install a district heating system at the facility to make use of its waste heat.The Kajaani data center is home to several supercomputers and will be hosting LUMI, a pre-exascale HPC. LUMI will be online in 2021 and is one of a number of systems across Europe serving as a stepping stone before an eventual exascale supercomputer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CSC's Kajaani data center\n\u2013 CSC\n\n\n\nGPU for AI solutionsProfessor Keijo Heljanko from FCAI, said: \u201cArtificial intelligence can be applied to almost any industry or area of research.\u201cHowever, achieving scientific breakthroughs may require the processing of such large datasets that, without the support offered by the NVAITC, researchers would be unable to complete their work. As a hardware provider, NVIDIA has in-depth expertise in GPU-based systems, which all AI researchers have not yet access to.\u201dSimon See, senior director of NVAITC at NVIDIA, said: \u201cScientists, researchers, and businesses worldwide rely on NVIDIA\u2019s AI computing platform to harness the power of artificial intelligence.\u201cThrough this cooperation with FCAI, we are able to boost AI research in Finland and better support local scientists already doing great work in the field.\u201d\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14 May 2020\n\n\n\n\nNvidia announces performance leap with new A100 GPU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n08 Nov 2019\n\n\n\n\nSwedish wind energy project lifts off, will power Finnish Google data center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14 May 2020\n\n\n\n\nNvidia launches 5 petaflops DGX A100, and cloud-centric HGX A100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nFCAI\n\n\nNVAITC\n\n\nVTT Technical Research Center of Finland\n\n\nAalto University\n\n\nKeijo Heljanko\n\n\nUniversity of Helsinki\n\n\nSimon See\n\n\nLUMI\n\n\nFinland\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

Customers like Airbnb and Pinterest use AWS to optimize their search recommendations, Lyft and Toyota Research Institute to develop their autonomous vehicle programs, and Capital One and Intuit to build and deploy AI-powered customer assistants.\nAWS offers the broadest and deepest portfolio of ML and AI services suitable for every type of customer, ranging from startups to large enterprises, from beginners to expert ML practitioners. Fundamental components of this portfolio are the AWS compute, networking, and storage services that provide powerful and cost-effective infrastructure for ML applications of any scale.\nHigh-performance, low-cost, and highly scalable compute infrastructure for deep learning powered by NVIDIA GPUs\nModel training time directly impacts your ability to iterate and improve on the accuracy of your models quickly. AWS leads the industry in providing you access to high-performance and cost-effective Amazon EC2 instances based on NVIDIA\u00ae GPUs.\nAWS was first in the cloud to offer NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs via Amazon EC2 P3 instances. AWS also offers the industry\u2019s highest performance model training GPU platform in the cloud via Amazon EC2 P3dn.24xlarge instances. These instances feature eight NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs with 32 GB of memory each, 96 custom Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Scalable (Skylake) vCPUs, the industry\u2019s first 100 Gbps per-instance networking bandwidth, and high-performance, low-latency network fabric via Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA).\nThese innovations in the underlying infrastructure, coupled with high-performance storage services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon FSx for Lustre, and optimizations in ML frameworks, help you drastically reduce the time it takes to iterate on your models to increase accuracy and introduce new features. We recently demonstrated the record-setting performance of these NVIDIA GPU instances by training BERT\u2014a model for natural language processing (NLP), across 256 P3dn.24xlarge instances with a total of 2,048 GPUs. By distributing the training job across a large cluster of GPU instances, we cut down the training time from multiple days to just over 60 minutes.\nNot all ML models are the same, and different models benefit from different levels of hardware acceleration. Amazon EC2 G4dn instances with up to eight NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs are the industry\u2019s most cost-effective GPU instances for ML inference and provide optimal performance for training less complex ML models and for graphics-intensive applications.\nNVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs coming to Amazon EC2 instances\nAs AI model complexity continues to rise, the number of model parameters has gone from 26 million with ResNet-50 just a few years ago to 17 billion today. With newer models, AWS customers are continually looking for higher-performance instances to support faster model training. To increase performance and lower cost-to-train for models, AWS is pleased to announce our plans to offer EC2 instances based on the new NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. For large-scale distributed training, you can expect EC2 instances based on NVIDIA A100 GPUs to build on the capabilities of EC2 P3dn.24xlarge instances and set new performance benchmarks. For more information about EC2 instances based on NVIDIA A100 GPUs and potentially participate in early access, see here.\n\nAbout the Author\nGeoff Murase is a Senior Product Marketing Manager for AWS EC2 accelerated computing instances, helping customers meet their compute needs by providing access to hardware-based compute accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).

Alongside the module itself, which can also be purchased in bulk by industrial customers wanting to deploy the platform more widely, Nvidia today is releasing the corresponding SBC-formfactor motherboard.\nThe motherboard looks night identical to the Jetson Nano Developer Kit, although it seems to have undergone some smaller component revisions. Connectivity wise it still sports HDMI and DisplayPort ports, 4x USB 3.1 gen 2 ports, one microUSB port, as well as the usual GPIO, I\u00b2C, I\u00b2S, SPI and UART connectivity options. For connecting cameras to the system, it also features two MIPI CSI-2 port connectors.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Jetson Family Specifications\n\n\n\u00a0\nXavier NX\r\n\t\t\t(15W)\nXavier NX\r\n\t\t\t(10W)\nAGX Xavier\nJetson Nano\n\n\nCPU\n4x/6x Carmel\r\n\t\t\t@ 1.4GHz\r\n\t\t\tor\r\n\t\t\t2x Carmel\r\n\t\t\t@ 1.9GHz\n4x/ Carmel\r\n\t\t\t@ 1.2GHz\r\n\t\t\tor\r\n\t\t\t2x Carmel\r\n\t\t\t@ 1.5GHz\n8x Carmel\r\n\t\t\t@ 2.26GHz\n4x Cortex-A57\r\n\t\t\t@ 1.43GHz\n\n\nGPU\nVolta, 384 Cores\r\n\t\t\t@ 1100MHz\nVolta, 384 Cores @ 800MHz\nVolta, 512 Cores\r\n\t\t\t@ 1377MHz\nMaxwell, 128 Cores\r\n\t\t\t@ 920MHz\n\n\nAccelerators\n2x NVDLA\n2x NVDLA\nN/A\n\n\nMemory\n8GB LPDDR4X, 128-bit bus\r\n\t\t\t(51.2 GB/sec)\n16GB LPDDR4X, 256-bit bus\r\n\t\t\t(137 GB/sec)\n4GB LPDDR4, 64-bit bus\r\n\t\t\t(25.6 GB/sec)\n\n\nStorage\n16GB eMMC\n32GB eMMC\n16GB eMMC\n\n\nAI Perf.\n21 TOPS\n14 TOPS\n32 TOPS\nN/A\n\n\nDimensions\n45mm x 70mm\n100mm x 87mm\n45mm x 70mm\n\n\nTDP\n15W\n10W\n30W\n10W\n\n\nPrice\n$399\n$999\n$129\n\n\n\nNvidia will be offering the Jetson Xavier NX Developer Kit Xavier NX module which is able to be run at either 15W or 10W operating modes, differing by the chip\u2019s enables enabled CPU core count and CPU and GPU frequencies. The new dev kit does now sport an active cooling fan versus the passive solution of the Jetson Nano.\n\nNvidia will be selling the new Developer Kit starting today starting today for $399 \u2013 essentially the same price as the Xavier NX modules themselves. The platform comes with \u201ccloud-native\u201d support from Nvidia, which means that they offer solutions to deploy the platform as an AI-at-the-edge system, including offering AI model examples to get started on applications.\nRelated News:\n\nNVIDIA Gives Jetson AGX Xavier a Trim, Announces Nano-Sized Jetson Xavier NX\nNvidia Announces Jetson Nano Dev Kit & Board: X1 for $99\nInvestigating NVIDIA's Jetson AGX: A Look at Xavier and Its Carmel Cores\nNVIDIA Announces Jetson TX2: Parker Comes To NVIDIA\u2019s Embedded System Kit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n6 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nSarahKerrigan - Thursday, May 14, 2020 - link\nYou may want to update the AGX Xavier specs in the table; these days it's US$699 and 32GB standard.\n\n\n\nnandnandnand - Thursday, May 14, 2020 - link\nI bet ETA PRIME will do a review of this thing.Core/clocks in the table are confusing.\n\n\n\nksec - Thursday, May 14, 2020 - link\nThis is very expensive but Nvidia is earning some very nice margins with these products. \n\n\n\nriklaunim - Thursday, May 14, 2020 - link\nThis isn't a product for makers like Raspberry Pi. It's a dev-kit for prototyping quite advanced devices that need such high compute power on the edge - autonomous robots, complex sensor analyzers (image/video sensing/processing) and alike. \n\n\n\nnandnandnand - Thursday, May 14, 2020 - link\nJetson Nano was priced at $129 (and has dropped to $99 and below) and could fill some of the roles that RasPi does. That probably won't be the case for a $399 Xavier NX, but that GPU will attract some interest.\n\n\n\nedzieba - Friday, May 15, 2020 - link\nIt would make for an expensive but nicely featured core of a gaming portable. 384 Cores@ 1100MHz is roughly a GT 1030 (likely faster due to the Maxwell->Volta arch shift), which is enough power to run a whole lot of modern games on a handheld device. 15W is in the same class as the X1 in the first gen Switch, so proper power management could make it viable, though such a device would not be close to as cheap as the Switch. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Unless you specifically need a low profile card like this Gigabyte GT 1030 or Asus GT 1030, we recommend moving up to at least a Radeon RX 560 for $20 more. But if you're serious about playing games, check our GPU Hierarchy and try to get at least something like a GTX 1650 Super or better.]Once upon a time, Nvidia\u2019s GeForce GT 730 was the lead-off hitter for our list of Best Graphics Cards. It sold for right around $70 and offered 384 CUDA cores. As AMD\u2019s Radeon R7 300s started dropping below $100, though, their superior performance made a slightly higher price tag worth paying. For a while there, our least expensive recommendation started somewhere between $90 and $100.Now, after more than a year of dominance at the high end with its Pascal-based 10-series cards, Nvidia is ready to challenge AMD\u2019s entry-level position with GeForce GT 1030.Gigabyte sent over its GeForce GT 1030 Low Profile 2G to represent Nvidia\u2019s latest addition. The card ships with a full-sized slot bracket in place, but it includes a half-height bracket for slim enclosures as well. Although our sample is actively cooled, Gigabyte also sells a passive model sporting the same clock rates. Low-profile and passively-cooled? Yup.Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 2GB at Amazon for $119.99GeForce GT 1030\u2019s TDP is a mere 30W, so we can already guess that power consumption, thermals, and acoustics will be some of this board\u2019s advantages over the competition. But can it keep up in our benchmark suite? After all, that\u2019s what determines whether the GT 1030 succeeds GT 730 in our list of gaming graphics cards.Meet GP108GeForce GT 1030 utilizes an all-new graphics processor called GP108, composed of 1.8 billion transistors. It\u2019s a teeny thing at just 70mm\u00b2, thanks to the same 14nm FinFET process used to manufacture GP107. Compare that to GeForce GT 730\u2019s GK208 chip with 1.02 billion transistors in an 84mm\u00b2 die. Or how about the GeForce GTX 750 Ti, which we\u2019re making the GT 1030 battle in today\u2019s benchmarks? That card\u2019s GM107 GPU has a similar transistor count as GP108, but in a 148mm\u00b2 die, owing to its 28nm manufacturing process.Here\u2019s the thing, though: whereas GeForce GTX 750 Ti employs five Streaming Multiprocessors, GT 1030 comes equipped with three. Given 128 CUDA cores per SM/SMM in the Pascal and Maxwell architectures, that\u2019s 384 cores for GT 1030 and 640 for GTX 750 Ti. Both designs also expose eight texture units per SM, totaling 24 on GeForce GT 1030, while GTX 750 Ti gets 40. The two GPUs feature a pair of ROP partitions, giving you up to 16 32-bit integer pixels per clock. However, those partitions are aligned with 256KB slices of L2 cache on GP108 and 1MB slices of L2 on GM107. That means GeForce GT 1030 includes 512KB L2 total\u2014a big reduction from GTX 750 Ti\u2019s 2MB. And whereas GeForce GTX 750 Ti utilizes two 64-bit memory controllers, GT 1030\u2019s specs break the memory bus down into a pair of 32-bit controllers, adding up to a 64-bit interface. That\u2019s a lot of lost resources for a ~4% difference in complexity.Nvidia goes a long way to overcoming those deficits in GT 1030 with higher clock rates. Our sample employs a 1227 MHz base frequency and a typical GPU Boost rating of 1468 MHz. In contrast, GeForce GTX 750 Ti starts at 1020 MHz and boosts just slightly to 1085 MHz. Of course, a 64-bit aggregate memory bus cripples GT 1030\u2019s peak bandwidth to 48 GB/s using 6 Gb/s GDDR5; GTX 750 Ti\u2019s wider interface facilitates up to 86.4 GB/s.GeForce GT 730: The Real CompetitionBut remember that GTX 750 Ti launched as a $150 card, and even now sells for $100 and up. We\u2019re only fascinated by the comparison to GT 1030 because of their similar transistor counts. In reality, GeForce GT 1030 is the spiritual successor of GT 730 since Nvidia never created a 900-series product below the $160 GTX 950. Spec-wise, the Kepler-class GeForce GT 730 is a much closer match with 384 CUDA and 16 texture units across two SMXes, eight ROPs, 512KB of L2 cache, and a 64-bit interface. Also, GT 730\u2019s 38W lands a lot closer to GT 1030\u2019s 30W specification. GeForce GTX 750 Ti is a 60W card, and we haven\u2019t seen evidence that it can be passively cooled in a low-profile form factor.So why is GP108 so much more complex of a GPU than GK208? The two GPUs do span a couple of different architectures, so they\u2019re organized differently, for starters.GP108 utilizes a single Graphics Processing Cluster with three Streaming Multiprocessors. Again, each SM includes 128 CUDA cores, eight texture units, 24KB of L1/texture cache, and 64KB of shared address space. Meanwhile, GK208 employs two larger SMXes, each with 192 CUDA cores, eight functional texture units, 64KB of shared memory and L1 cache, and a separate texture cache. GP108 also sports 16 ROP units to GK208\u2019s eight.In the end, GP108 offers a much higher pixel fill rate than GK208 (19.8 GP/s vs. 7.2 GP/s). Its texture rate is much greater, too (29.8 GT/s vs. 14.4 GT/s). Further, Nvidia says that the work it did to enable Pascal\u2019s aggressive clock rates and proper asynchronous compute support via dynamic load balancing added to the transistor budget. GeForce GT 1030 uses a complete GP108 processor\u2014there are no disabled resources waiting to be switched on. It\u2019s just a much denser GPU than GK208.The competition from AMD lands somewhere between GM107 and GK208. Its Radeon RX 550 is a little more expensive (~$85) and slightly more power-hungry (50W). We\u2019ve seen low-profile and \u201csingle-slot\u201d versions, but not both. Nothing with passive cooling, either. On the other hand, you get 512 Stream processors, 32 texture units, and 16 ROPs in a 2.2 billion-transistor Polaris 12 GPU. That translates to a pixel fill rate of 17.6 GP/s and a texturing rate of 35.2 GT/s. Faster 7 Gb/s GDDR5 modules on a wider 128-bit memory bus give AMD a 233% theoretical bandwidth advantage, too.And yet, Nvidia tells us its GeForce GT 1030 should trade blows with AMD\u2019s pricier solution. If that turns out to be true, it\u2019d be quite an achievement for a smaller and simpler graphics card able to fit into PCs that might not accommodate a Radeon RX 550.MORE: Best Graphics CardsMORE: Desktop GPU Performance Hierarchy TableMORE: All Graphics ContentGigabyte GeForce GT 1030 2GB: Price Comparison808 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $119.99View $140.99ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n7\n\n\n8\n\n\n9\n\n\n10\n\n\n11\n\n\n\nCurrent page:\n\nMeet GeForce GT 1030 2GB\n\n\n\nNext Page Meet Gigabyte's Low-Profile GeForce GT 1030 Cards\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nCUDA\nBenchmark\nDirectX\nGeForce\nVulkan\nRadeon\nRadeon RX \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (28)\n\n\n\nChris AngeliniSocial Links NavigationChris Angelini is an Editor Emeritus at Tom's Hardware US.

From what I've read Nvidia requires 3GB VRAM for it which seems stupid and arbitrary. 2GB is enough to buffer several seconds of 4K movie frames.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKing_V\n\n\nDefinitely interesting. Going through the initial tests, I actually started wondering why the RX550 was lower in the hierarchy charts than the 750Ti.\n\nThen, when they switched positions in some other tests, it became more clear. And, I concluded that even putting certain cards in tiers relative to each other is not that easy.\n\nI was very glad to see this test, though, as I'd previously considered getting the GT1030. My need for it is no longer there.\n\nOverall, I think the 750Ti, RX 550, and RX 460 are closer to each other than I anticipated. It does seem the 1030 is behind them all, but not too far behind.\n\nThanks for this review. I can't wait to see where it ultimately falls in the hierarchy chart(which, oddly, is missing the RX 560 but I suspect that is in the same tier as the RX 460)\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoom_4\n\n\nTAKESHI7\nyes it's enough, IDK where you heard that you need 3gb or VRAM.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhendriksnyder\n\n\nWill this work with a core I7 7700k?

Generally, this shouldn\u2019t come as too much of a surprise given the timeline of the SoC.\n\r\nNvidia still doesn\u2019t disclose exact configurations of the GPU, but if the mock-up die-shot of the chip is anything to go by, we\u2019ll be seeing a 32SM configuration \u2013 which fits nicely with the claimed peak 200 INT8 DL TOPs that Nvidia claims for the chip.\n\nManufacturing wise, we again don\u2019t have exact details, but we\u2019re assuming a 7nm-class process node. One interesting disclosure today however was the fact that Orin is supposed to scale from 5W to up to 45W platforms, which is a very wide range.\n\nThe 5W platforms claims up to TOPs inference performance, and it\u2019s meant for ADAS solutions as depicted above, designed to fit behind a windshield. Nvidia being able to scale Orin down to a 5W TDP is extremely interesting, but undoubtedly will have the chip disable much of its capabilities, or clock down to very low frequencies to achieve this power envelope.\n\nThe chip is also offered in an L2+ automotive solution, enabling the full power of Orin at up to 45W. Here we see the full 200TOPs of inference performance that Nvidia had disclosed back in November. We're seeing 8 DRAM chips on the depicted board, likely pointing out to a 128-bit memory controller setup.\n\nFinally, Nvidia is bringing out the biggest guns in its DRIVE line-up for the robotaxi solution, an L5 automotive solution is meant to power fully autonomous robotaxi vehicles.\nThe platform here has two Orin SoCs paired with two Ampere GPUs for total power envelope of 800W and up to 2000 TOPs of performance. The GPU here, judging by its size and form-factor with HBM memory is seemingly the newest GA100 Ampere GPU. Nvidia disclosed that this GPU alone scales up to 400W in the SXM form-factor. Clocking two of these slightly lower and adding two 45W Orin SoCs gets us to the massive 800W power envelope.\nRelated Reading:\n\nNVIDIA Details DRIVE AGX Orin: A Herculean Arm Automotive SoC For 2022\nNVIDIA ARM SoC Roadmap Updated: After Xavier Comes Orin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n32 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nAlistair - Thursday, May 14, 2020 - link\nI hope this forms the basis for the next Nintendo home console. I'll take that 45W version for the home, and the 15W form for a portable version. :)\n\n\n\nSttm - Thursday, May 14, 2020 - link\nWould be very interesting if Nvidia could turn out a high performance ARM/Ampere console chip for Nintendo. RTX Mario Kart! \n\n\n\nnandnandnand - Thursday, May 14, 2020 - link\nThe next Nintendo Switch could use Samsung + AMD graphics.https://hothardware.com/news/nintendo-samsung-exyn...\n\n\n\nAlistair - Thursday, May 14, 2020 - link\nThat would be cool also. I def. Nintendo was the first to move to modern hardware. nVidia, ARM, solid state storage.\n\n\n\nFaaR - Thursday, May 14, 2020 - link\nThe Switch was anything but modern though, even when it launched; it's based on an outdated SoC (which they further nerfed/disabled IIRC).Why would having flash and ARM CPU cores and an old NV GPU arch make it \"modern\" anyway? ARM architecture dates back to the mid-1980s, and phones have used ARM chips and flash since the 1990s. Other consoles also had onboard flash games storage before the Switch launched including models from Sony, MS and...Nintendo themselves. :P Also, NV maxwell GPU was old hat by the time Switch launched.Strange reasoning! :)\n\n\n\nBenSkywalker - Friday, May 15, 2020 - link\nYou realize x86 came out in the 70s, right?Also, what SoC made the x1 outdated in 2016? It throttled the A10 and it wasn't until the 845 in '18 that Qualcomm was competitive. For a portable system the Switch was quite powerful for when it came out.\n\n\n\nTams80 - Friday, May 15, 2020 - link\nI mean, if you're going to be really picky, the Game Boy Advance used an ARM SoC.\n\n\n\nAlistair - Thursday, July 30, 2020 - link\nARM enables higher performance at low power. nVidia's GPUs are top. Flash storage is a must and Nintendo was first to switch to it. And Nintendo was first to release a NO CD DRIVE NO SPINING RUST HARD DRIVE system. All places that Microsoft and Sony are heading to. Hence, MODERN.\n\n\n\nTams80 - Friday, May 15, 2020 - link\nWell considering what was available and how prices of many components had fallen at the time of the Switch's development, of course it was going to have modern hardware.  It wouldn't have made sense not to.And of course the fact that the body of the Switch is pretty much an Nvidia Shield tablet...  I think it's pretty likely Nvidia were eager to clear some inventory and make something back from their investment into the X1.\n\n\n\nYojimbo - Thursday, May 14, 2020 - link\nIt could, but would Nintendo really want to give up all the nice NVIDIA support they've included that has brought in 3rd party developers to the system? The support and optimizations from Qualcomm for a scaled down RDNA architecture are just not likely to have anywhere near the same maturity. Besides, the initial plan was for a long-term partnership between NVIDIA and Nintendo. I also doubt that Qualcomm will achieve the same energy efficiency at a similar power threshold by using the RDNA architecture, not to mention that AMD is still behind in memory bandwidth efficiency as well. It's just not easy to replace NVIDIA in that space at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

But it\u2019s a practice that faces numerous obstacles.\nSymptoms of diabetic retinopathy, as it\u2019s known, are often hard to diagnose, even from high-resolution images of the eye\u2019s interior. And spotty internet connectivity at many hospitals and clinics can make analyzing images via the cloud either impossible or too time consuming for primary caregivers to provide thorough diagnoses.\nThis raises the chances that early treatment opportunities are missed, said Julie Chen, vice president of sales for Medimaging Integrated Solution, Inc. (MiiS).\nThe Taiwan-based medical device-maker has tackled this problem by marrying fundus cameras, AI algorithms, NVIDIA GPUs and an edge computing architecture to put lightning-quick diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy in the hands of doctors.\nBy embedding an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 GPU supercomputer in MiiS\u2019s Horus Digital Fundus Camera, as well as AI software trained to detect diabetic retinopathy, MiiS has essentially given doctors a highly portable, GPU-powered AI device that generates a diagnosis in seconds.\n\u201cThis could save people from waiting a long time to get a diagnosis when they cannot\u00a0 see an ophthalmologist,\u201d said Chen.\nNo Surprise: Early Diagnosis Critical\nSpotting diabetic retinopathy at an earlier stage can delay or even prevent the onset of diabetes-related blindness. However, primary caregivers typically aren\u2019t able to catch obscure indicators that an ophthalmologist \u2014 or MiiS\u2019s AI model \u2014 would.\nTo train its model, MiiS turned to three partner hospitals to obtain a dataset of 120,000 images. Those images were labeled by a team of 50 doctors, and training occurred on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud.\nMiiS\u2019s solution\u00a0 generates the needed fundus images, immediately applies its AI model to these images and runs the inference computations on the embedded Jetson TX2. Doctors receive the result of that analysis within 5 seconds.\nAt about 90 percent, the accuracy of MiiS\u2019s AI model is comparable to that of the typical ophthalmologist\u2019s. But the real benefit of the solution is the speed: The edge-computing approach performs 10x faster than a competing cloud-based offering, which only operates when a facility\u2019s internet connection is stable.\n\u201cThe general practice physician is able to know the diagnosis result right away instead of waiting for feedback from the cloud server,\u201d said Chen.\nOnly the Beginning\nWhile MiiS, which was founded in 2010, has developed a number of diagnostic devices that make use of its Horus line of digital scopes, its diabetic retinopathy solution is its first attempt at combining fundus imagery, AI and edge computing. It\u2019s currently under FDA review.\nChen said the approach could be applied to other fields that touch diabetes, such as otology (study of the ear), stomatology (mouth) and dermatology (skin).\nWhat\u2019s more, she said the company wants its use of edge computing to catch on throughout the AI world, whether medical or industrial.\nMiiS is a member of NVIDIA\u2019s Inception program, a virtual accelerator that equips startups in AI and data science with fundamental tools to support product development, prototyping and deployment.

Then each player takes a turn carefully removing one block, without tipping the column.\nIt starts off easy but gets increasingly hairy until the losing player pulls out a block that sends the tower crashing down.\nWhat Is Sparsity in AI?\nIn AI inference and machine learning, sparsity refers to a matrix of numbers that includes many zeros or values that will not significantly impact a calculation.\nFor years, researchers in machine learning have been playing a kind of Jenga with numbers in their efforts to accelerate AI using sparsity. They try to pull out of a neural network as many unneeded parameters as possible \u2014 without unraveling AI\u2019s uncanny accuracy.\nThe goal is to reduce the mounds of matrix multiplication deep learning requires, shortening the time to good results. So far, there have been no big winners.\nTo date, researchers have tried a variety of techniques to pull out as many as 95 percent of the weights in a neural network. But then, spending more time than they\u2019d saved, they\u2019re forced to craft heroic steps to claw back the accuracy of the streamlined model. And the steps that have worked for one model haven\u2019t worked on others.\nUntil today.\nSparsity by the Numbers\nThe NVIDIA Ampere architecture introduces third-generation Tensor Cores in NVIDIA A100 GPUs that take advantage of the fine-grained sparsity in network weights. They offer up to 2x the maximum throughput of dense math without sacrificing accuracy of the matrix multiply-accumulate jobs at the heart of deep learning.\nTests show this approach to sparsity maintains the accuracy of approaches using dense math on a wide variety of AI tasks including image classification, object detection and language translation. It\u2019s also been tested across convolutional and recurrent neural networks as well as attention-based transformers.\nThe A100 packs sparse matrices to accelerate AI inference tasks.\nThe internal math speed ups have significant impacts at the application level. Using sparsity, an A100 GPU can run BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), the state-of-the-art model for natural-language processing, 50% faster than with dense math.\nThe NVIDIA Ampere architecture takes advantage of the prevalence of small values in neural networks in a way that benefits the widest possible swath of AI applications. Specifically, it defines a method for training a neural network with half its weights removed, or what\u2019s known as 50 percent sparsity.\nLess Is More, When You Do It Right\nSome researchers use coarse-grained pruning techniques that can cut whole channels from a neural network layer, often lowering the network\u2019s accuracy. The approach in the NVIDIA Ampere architecture employs structured sparsity with a fine-grained pruning technique that won\u2019t noticeably reduce accuracy, something users can validate when they retrain their models.\nOnce a network is suitably pruned, an A100 GPU automates the rest of the work.\nTensor Cores in the A100 GPU efficiently compress sparse matrices to enable the appropriate dense math. Skipping what are effectively zero-value locations in a matrix reduces computing, saving power as well as time. Compressing sparse matrices also reduces the use of precious memory and bandwidth.\nTo get the big picture on the role of sparsity in our latest GPUs, watch the keynote with NVIDIA CEO and founder Jensen Huang. To learn even more, register for the webinar on sparsity or read a detailed article that takes a deep dive into the NVIDIA Ampere architecture.\nOur support for sparsity is among a wide array of new capabilities in the NVIDIA Ampere architecture driving AI and HPC performance to new heights.

This year, NVIDIA\u2019s Dieter Fox will receive the RAS Pioneer Award, given by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society.\nFox is the company\u2019s senior director of robotics research and head of the NVIDIA Robotics Research Lab, in Seattle, as well as a professor at the University of Washington Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering and head of the UW Robotics and State Estimation Lab. At the NVIDIA lab, Fox leads over 20 researchers and interns, fostering collaboration with the neighboring UW.\nHe\u2019s receiving the RAS Pioneer Award \u201cfor pioneering contributions to probabilistic state estimation, RGB-D perception, machine learning in robotics, and bridging academic and industrial robotics research.\u201d\n\u201cBeing recognized with this award by my research colleagues and the IEEE society is an incredible honor,\u201d Fox said. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful for the amazing collaborators and students I had the chance to work with during my career. I also appreciate that IEEE sees the importance of connecting academic and industrial research \u2014 I believe that bridging these areas allows us to make faster progress on the problems we really care about.\u201d\nFox will also give a talk at the conference, where a total of 19 papers that investigate a variety of topics in robotics will be presented by researchers from NVIDIA Research.\nHere\u2019s a preview of some of the show-stopping NVIDIA research papers that were accepted at ICRA:\nRobotics Work a Finalist for Best Paper Awards\n\u201c6-DOF Grasping for Target-Driven Object Manipulation in Clutter\u201d is a finalist for both the Best Paper Award in Robot Manipulation and the Best Student Paper.\nThe paper delves into the challenging robotics problem of grasping in cluttered environments, which is a necessity in most real-world scenes, said Adithya Murali, one of the lead researchers and a graduate student at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Much current research considers only planar grasping, in which a robot grasps from the top down rather than moving in more dimensions.\nArsalan Mousavian, another lead researcher on the paper and a senior research scientist at the NVIDIA Robotics Research Lab, explained that they performed this research in simulation. \u201cWe weren\u2019t bound by any physical robot, which is time-consuming and very expensive,\u201d he said.\nMousavian and his colleagues trained their algorithms on NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs, and then tested on NVIDIA TITAN GPUs. For this particular paper, the training data consisted of simulating 750,000 robot object interactions in less than half a day, and the models were trained in a week. Once trained, the robot was able to robustly manipulate objects in the real world.\nReplanning for Success\nNVIDIA Research also considered how robots could plan to accomplish a wide variety of tasks in challenging environments, such as grasping an object that isn\u2019t visible, in a paper called \u201cOnline Replanning in Belief Space for Partially Observable Task and Motion Problems.\u201d\nThe approach makes a variety of tasks possible. Caelan Garrett, graduate student at MIT and a lead researcher on the paper, explained, \u201cOur work is quite general in that we deal with tasks that involve not only picking and placing things in the environment, but also pouring things, cooking, trying to open doors and drawers.\u201d\nGarrett and his colleagues created an open-source algorithm, SS-Replan, that allows the robot to incorporate observations when making decisions, which it can adjust based on new observations it makes while trying to accomplish its goal.\nThey tested their work in NVIDIA Isaac Sim, a simulation environment used to develop, test and evaluate virtual robots, and on a real robot.\nDexPilot: A Teleoperated Robotic Hand-Arm System\nIn another paper, NVIDIA researchers confronted the problem that current robotics algorithms don\u2019t yet allow for a robot to complete precise tasks such as pulling a tea bag out of a drawer, removing a dollar bill from a wallet or unscrewing the lid off a jar autonomously.\nIn \u201cDexPilot: Depth-Based Teleoperation of Dexterous Robotic Hand-Arm System,\u201d NVIDIA researchers present a system in which a human can remotely operate a robotic system. DexPilot observes the human hand using cameras, and then uses neural networks to relay the motion to the robotic hand.\nWhereas other systems require expensive equipment such as motion-capture systems, gloves and headsets, DexPilot archives teleoperation through a combination of deep learning and optimization.\nIt took 15 hours to train on a single GPU once we collected the data, according to NVIDIA researchers Ankur Handa and Karl Van Wyk, two of the authors of the paper. They and their colleagues used the NVIDIA TITAN GPU for their research.\nLearn all about these papers and more at ICRA 2020.\nThe NVIDIA research team has more than 200 scientists around the globe, focused on areas such as AI, computer vision, self-driving cars, robotics and graphics.

He showcased \u201cMarbles,\u201d a playable game environment displaying real-time physics with dynamic lighting and rich physically based materials, as well as the platform\u2019s latest \u201cAEC Experience\u201d feature set, which provides seamless connectivity between CAD applications with real-time visualization.\nReal-Time Collaboration for Real-Time Creativity\u00a0\nCreating visual effects, architectural visualizations and manufacturing designs typically requires multiple people collaborating across teams, remote work locations and various customer sites for reviews. 3D assets take shape using an assortment of software tools.\nBut seamless data transfers across applications have long been the challenge for millions of artists, designers, architects, engineers and developers globally. Using Pixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description and NVIDIA RTX technology, Omniverse allows people to easily work with applications and collaborate simultaneously with colleagues and customers, wherever they may be. \n\nFor years, collaborating in visual effects has been through exporting and importing large datasets and scene files. In 2010, Lucasfilm and Sony Pictures Imageworks joined together to create Alembic, an open computer graphics interchange framework that helped multiple studios ensure consistency and accuracy when working on the same project.\nPixar developed USD to provide the interchange of assets and enable collaboration on 3D scenes that may be intricately composed from many elemental assets. With a single scene graph and consistent API, USD delivers a rich toolset for reading, writing, editing and rapidly previewing 3D geometry and shading.\nOmniverse benefits from the flexibility and consistency of the USD interchange format and builds upon it with synchronized workflows. Entire studio teams around the world can collaborate in real time as they create, with version control support needed to ensure production stays on track.\nIn Omniverse, the Portals connection module unites top industry tools into a collaborative space for users to work seamlessly on real-time modeling, shading, animation, lighting, visual effects and rendering, introducing incredible new opportunities for creativity and production.\nLeeza SOHO, Beijing by Zaha Hadid Architects.\nOmniverse View with RTX: New Class of Renderer Blends Real-Time Speed and Offline Quality\u00a0\nUp until now, there have been two types of renderers. Real-time rendering is geared toward producing images at 30 or 60 frames per second and adheres to the lowest device targeted for use. Offline rendering focuses on delivering photorealistic final images or scenes that take hours per frame to render with a CPU. To achieve top speeds, many corners often get cut \u2014 from simplifying geometry to baking lighting and normal maps \u2014 and this can reduce image quality.\nTo overcome this, Omniverse introduces a new type of rendering with Omniverse View. This module is accelerated by multiple NVIDIA RTX GPUs and built for extreme scalability on arrays of GPUs to provide high-quality, real-time output, even on very large scenes.\nOmniverse View displays the 3D content aggregated from different applications inside Omniverse, or directly in the 3D application being used. It\u2019s also designed to support commercial game engines such as Unreal Engine and Unity as well as offline renderers.\nSoftware Partners Empower Real-Time, Collaborative Creativity\u00a0\nMany industry software leaders are integrating their applications into Omniverse so artists can work collaboratively through the 3D creative process.\nOmniverse\u2019s Portals is made possible by using Omniverse Kit, a software development kit that enables RTX View capability to be directly integrated into the software partner\u2019s application interface. This gives their product an ultra-high-quality, real-time, ray-traced application viewport.\nSince Omniverse is a software-defined platform, vendor applications can also benefit from NVIDIA RTX acceleration or other technologies, like PhysX, as soon as new features become available. NVIDIA has been working closely with companies like Epic Games, Autodesk, Pixar, Adobe, Trimble, McNeel & Associates, and Teradici, with other partner announcements coming soon.\n\u201cEpic Games has had a long-standing partnership with NVIDIA,\u201d said Miles Perkins, business development at Epic Games. \u201cUnreal Engine continues to set the standard for the world\u2019s most open and advanced real-time 3D tool for creators, and with NVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse platform we are seamlessly connected, enabling an even broader set of third-party products to work with our technology providing cutting-edge photorealistic content, new collaborative workflows, and immersive virtual worlds for games, enterprise, or any discipline dependent on visualization.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working with NVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse team and our mutual customers in AEC who have been testing and providing real-world feedback as this pioneering platform is being developed,\u201d said Amy Bunszel, senior vice president of Design and Creation Products at Autodesk. \u201cThis technology can give our customers access to immersive, interactive and collaborative experiences across industries. So we\u2019re thrilled that even more customers will have early access with the expansion of the program announced today at the GTC keynote.\u201d\n\u201cNVIDIA Omniverse is a new environment that integrates with Rhino and extends our customers\u2019 ability to distribute 3D content,\u201d said Scott Davidson, vice president of marketing at McNeel & Associates. \u201cWe look forward to partnering more with NVIDIA and continuing to support this technology as it develops.\u201d\n\u201cWe are thrilled to partner with the NVIDIA Omniverse team and leverage this technology to increase the pace of collaboration for our customers,\u201d said Prakash Iyer, senior vice president of Software Architecture and Strategy at Trimble Inc. \u201cThis tool is very promising for SketchUp customers and the AEC industry.\u201d\n\u201cTeradici is thrilled to enable Omniverse 3D creators across M&E, AEC and manufacturing industries to remotely access the NVIDIA RTX platform through Cloud Access Software, powered by PCoIP technology,\u201d said Ziad Lammam, vice president of product management at Teradici.\nReal-time collaboration: Revit, Sketchup, Rhino and Omniverse View.\nEarly Access Customers Provide Real-World Testing\u00a0\nDuring the GTC keynote, Huang shared how some of our customers across various industries are working with the early access version of Omniverse. Industrial Light & Magic is exploring Omniverse in its advanced visual effect productions.\n\u201cOmniverse has really shown its versatility by seamlessly integrating with the typical DCC applications used for visual effects, along with embracing open standards for truly portable assets by leveraging USD and integrating MaterialX with MDL for a collaborative experience that was never possible before,\u201d said Francois Chardavoine, vice president of Technology at Lucasfilm & Industrial Light & Magic. \u201cIt\u2019s now easier than ever to leverage Omniverse for high-end visual effects workflows.\u201d\nMillennium Falcon used with permission. Rendered with Omniverse View.\nNVIDIA has also been working with Lockheed Martin, Foster & Partners and Volvo Cars.\nVolvo Cars is testing Omniverse in its research and development workflows. \u201cWe immediately saw the opportunity for real-time collaboration for our design workflow using Omniverse,\u201d said Mattias Wikenmalm, senior visualization expert at Volvo Cars. \u201cIt\u2019s something we have been striving for throughout our efforts to optimize our design and development process.\u201d\nAdditional customers are putting Omniverse to the test in areas such as visual effects, AR/VR, manufacturing, architectural design and robotics. Each of these verticals has workflows that rely on collaboration, yet were stuck with the traditional process of exporting and importing data. As USD gains wider adoption across the applications, Omniverse will solve key challenges for creative companies worldwide.\nImage courtesy of Volvo Cars.\nA New Experience for AEC on RTX Server\u00a0\nThe Omniverse early access program is now available to customers that purchase the RTX Server configuration for AEC. They\u2019ll have the ability to be a part of the Omniverse AEC Experience program, which provides the full platform with Portal connections to Autodesk Revit, McNeel Rhino and Trimble SketchUp.\nNVIDIA RTX Server\nWhat\u2019s Next\nOmniverse development will continue with early access customers and ISVs.

While the new GPU and system capabilities were the main attraction, the DGX A100's choice of CPU marked a notable departure for the GPU powerhouse.\n[Related: Nvidia's 5 Biggest GTC 2020 Announcements: From A100 To SmartNICs]\n\n\nid\nunit-1659132512259\n\n\ntype\nSponsored post\n\n\nNvidia had previously relied on Intel's Xeon processors to provide the CPU compute horsepower for its first two DGX systems, but that changed with the DGX A100, which sports two 64-core AMD EPYC 7742 processors.\nCharlie Boyle, vice president and general manager of DGX Systems at Nvidia, told CRN that the decision to go with one of the top processors in AMD's second-generation EPYC Rome lineup came down to speed, core count and throughput.\n\"We always start our DGX designs around getting the most out of our GPUs. Our new Nvidia A100 GPUs that we use in the DGX A100 deliver a tremendous leap and performance and capabilities,\" he said in a statement. \"To keep the GPUs in our system supplied with data, we needed a fast CPU with as many cores and PCI lanes as possible. The AMD CPUs we use have 64 cores each, lots of PCI lanes, and support PCIe Gen4.\"\nBeyond the high performance and core counts offered by the AMD EPYC 7742, the other key was the CPU's support of PCIe 4.0, which is significantly faster than PCIe 3.0. Intel's second-generation Xeon Scalable processors, on the other hand, only support PCIe 3.0.\n\"The DGX A100 is the first accelerated system to be all PCIe Gen4, which doubles the bandwidth from PCIe Gen3. All of our IO in the system is Gen4: GPUs, Mellanox CX6 NICs, AMD CPUs, and the NVMe drives we use to stream AI data,\" Boyle said.\nHowever, despite the change in CPU vendor between the first two DGX systems and the new DGX A100, customers won't notice a difference, except for improved performance, according to Boyle.\n\"At the system level, we do the software engineering work to make the differences between CPU architectures invisible to customers,\" he said. \"Our customers can take applications that ran on our previous generation DGX systems and run them on the new DGX A100 without making any changes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the applications just run faster.\"\nEliot Eshelman, vice president of strategic accounts and HPC initiatives at Microway, a Plymouth, Mass.-based high-performance computing system builder that works with Intel, AMD and Nvidia, said he wasn't surprised by Nvidia's decision to go with AMD EPYC for the new DGX system because it's all about reducing the number of bottlenecks.\n\"Intel is still on PCIe Gen3, so it's half the bandwidth of AMD. I feel like it's kind of a no-brainer,\" he said.\nAn executive at a system builder that also works with Intel, AMD and Nvidia, said AMD EPYC's support for eight-channel memory also game the chipmaker a leg up over Intel, which only supports up to six memory channels in its socketable Xeon Scalable processors.\n\"The eight-channel memory and the PCIe 4.0 and the high core counts all gave AMD an advantage in the selection process. By default, it has to,\" he said. \"That's why AMD EPYC Rome has been very competitive in certain segments. It's not just that they're priced reasonable, which they are. But they give you significant advantages in core, IO and memory addressing.\"\nBut with Intel planning to launch its 10-nanometer Ice Lake server processors later this year, the system builder executive said he expects Intel to leapfrog AMD, at least for a while.\n\"It's a leapfrog game, and then they'll potentially be back in the league for a little bit,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

To get people even more excited about the reveal, the company has uploaded a video showing CEO Jensen Huang cooking \"the world's largest graphics card.\" \nThe 27-second video shows Huang pulling what looks like a very heavy board from the oven. It's likely to be an Ampere-based Tesla graphics card, featuring eight GPUs. With Nvidia recently filing a trademark for DGX A100, the product is likely to be an updated version of the company's DGX-1 deep learning system. The GPU's, meanwhile, are suspected to be Nvidia A100, which succeed the Pascal-based P100 and Volta-based V100.\n\nWhile the GTC 2020 keynote could focus on workstation products, we can expect to see the Ampere-based consumer products arrive later this year.\nIt seems almost certain that Nvidia will catch up with AMD by moving to 7nm with Ampere. Earlier this month, we heard that team green has put in a massive order with TSMC for its 7nm node technology. The same report claimed the firm is planning beyond Ampere and to its next-next-gen 5nm Hopper architecture, the manufacture of which could be split between TSMC and Samsung.\nThe second half of 2020 will be an exciting time for graphics card fans. In addition to the Ampere products, AMD will be launching its RDNA 2-based Big Navi GPUs, bringing Radeon cards that can compete with Nvidia's high-end offerings.\n\n\n\n\n 13 comments\n \n585 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\n Arm considers acquisition of data center chipmaker Ampere \n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Defender misidentifies key driver, disrupting popular PC monitoring tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

They also let designers create everything from sleek cars to jet engines.\nBut simulations are also among the most demanding computer applications on the planet because they require lots of the most advanced math.\nSimulations make numeric models visual with calculations that use a double-precision floating-point format called FP64. Each number in the format takes up 64 bits inside a computer, making it one the most computationally intensive of the many math formats today\u2019s GPUs support.\nAs the next big step in our efforts to accelerate high performance computing, the NVIDIA Ampere architecture defines third-generation Tensor Cores that accelerate FP64 math by 2.5x compared to last-generation GPUs.\nThat means simulations that kept researchers and designers waiting overnight can be viewed in a few hours when run on the latest A100 GPUs.\nScience Puts AI in the Loop\nThe speed gains open a door for combining AI with simulations and experiments, creating a positive-feedback loop that saves time.\nFirst, a simulation creates a dataset that trains an AI model. Then the AI and simulation models run together, feeding off each other\u2019s strengths until the AI model is ready to deliver real-time results through inference. The trained AI model also can take in data from an experiment or sensor, further refining its insights.\nUsing this technique, AI can define a few areas of interest for conducting high-resolution simulations. By narrowing the field, AI can slash by orders of magnitude the need for thousands of time-consuming simulations. And the simulations that need to be run will run 2.5x faster on an A100 GPU.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/A100_TensorCore_01_FP64.mp4\n\u00a0\nWith FP64 and other new features, the A100 GPUs based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture become a flexible platform for simulations, as well as AI inference and training \u2014 the entire workflow for modern HPC. That capability will drive developers to migrate simulation codes to the A100.\nUsers can call new CUDA-X libraries to access FP64 acceleration in the A100. Under the hood, these GPUs are packed with third-generation Tensor Cores that support DMMA, a new mode that accelerates double-precision matrix multiply-accumulate operations.\nAccelerating Matrix Math\nA single DMMA job uses one computer instruction to replace eight traditional FP64 instructions. As a result, the A100 crunches FP64 math faster than other chips with less work, saving not only time and power but precious memory and I/O bandwidth as well.\nWe refer to this new capability as Double-Precision Tensor Cores. It delivers the power of Tensor Cores to HPC applications, accelerating matrix math in full FP64 precision.\nBeyond simulations, HPC apps called iterative solvers \u2014 algorithms with repetitive matrix-math calculations \u2014 will benefit from this new capability. These apps include a wide range of jobs in earth science, fluid dynamics, healthcare, material science and nuclear energy as well as oil and gas exploration.\nTo serve the world\u2019s most demanding applications, Double-Precision Tensor Cores arrive inside the largest and most powerful GPU we\u2019ve ever made. The A100 also packs more memory and bandwidth than any GPU on the planet.\nThe third-generation Tensor Cores in the NVIDIA Ampere architecture are beefier than prior versions. They support a larger matrix size \u2014 8x8x4, compared to 4x4x4 for Volta \u2014 that lets users tackle tougher problems.\nThat\u2019s one reason why an A100 with a total of 432 Tensor Cores delivers up to 19.5 FP64 TFLOPS, more than double the performance of a Volta V100.\nWhere to Go to Learn More\nTo get the big picture on the role of FP64 in our latest GPUs, watch\u00a0the keynote\u00a0with NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang. To learn more, register for the webinar or read a detailed article that takes a deep dive into the NVIDIA Ampere architecture.\nDouble-Precision Tensor Cores are among a battery of new capabilities in the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, driving HPC performance as well as AI training and inference to new heights.

With a single architecture, manufacturers can deploy a high-performance AI system to make every vehicle in their lineup software-defined.\nThis newly expanded range starts at an NCAP 5-star ADAS system and runs all the way to a DRIVE AGX Pegasus robotaxi platform. The latter features two Orin SoCs and two NVIDIA Ampere GPUs to achieve an unprecedented 2,000 trillion operations per second, or TOPS \u2014 more than 6x the performance of the previous platform.\nThe current generation of DRIVE AGX delivers capabilities that scale from level 2+ automated driving to level 5 fully autonomous driving with different combinations of Xavier SoCs and Turing-based GPUs. DRIVE AGX Xavier delivers 30 TOPS of performance and the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Pegasus platform processes up to 320 TOPS to run multiple redundant and diverse deep neural networks for real-time perception, planning and control.\nWith the introduction of the NVIDIA Ampere GPU, and the upcoming Orin processor family featuring its integrated cores, we\u2019re able to deliver compute for everything that moves, raising the DRIVE platform even higher while adding an entry-level ADAS offering.\nSingle Scalable Architecture\u00a0\nBased on customer requests, the new DRIVE AGX family now begins with a single Orin SoC variant that sips just five watts of energy and delivers 10 TOPS of performance.\nAutomakers have generally developed one computer system for ADAS systems and a different one for higher levels of automated driving, however, the development of multiple systems has become cost prohibitive.\nWith a single platform, developers can leverage one architecture to more easily develop autonomous driving technology across all their market segments. And since the DRIVE platform is software-defined and based on the large CUDA developer community, it can easily and constantly benefit from over-the-air updates.\nDriving Performance Further\nWhile the DRIVE AGX family is extending to entry levels of autonomy, the NVIDIA Ampere architecture is pushing performance even higher with the next-generation Pegasus robotaxi platform.\nWith two Orin SoCs and two NVIDIA Ampere-based GPUs delivering 2,000 TOPS, the platform is capable of handling higher resolution sensor inputs and more advanced autonomous driving DNNs required for full self-driving robotaxi operation.\nThe architecture offers the largest leap in performance within the eight generations of NVIDIA GPUs \u2014 boosting performance by up to 6x.\nThe Orin family of SoCs will begin sampling next year and be available for automakers starting production in late 2022, laying the foundation for the next-generation of the programmable, software-defined NVIDIA DRIVE AGX lineup.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC 2020 | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Now imagine a multi-headed water fountain, flowing with cool goodness for all.\nThat\u2019s the essence of the Multi-Instance GPU, or MIG, enabled in the NVIDIA Ampere architecture.\nMIG partitions a single NVIDIA A100 GPU into as many as seven independent GPU instances. They run simultaneously, each with its own memory, cache and streaming multiprocessors. That enables the A100 GPU to deliver guaranteed quality-of-service (QoS) at up to 7x higher utilization compared to prior GPUs.\nThe A100 in MIG mode can run any mix of up to seven AI or HPC workloads of different sizes. The capability is especially useful for AI inference jobs that typically don\u2019t demand all the performance a modern GPU delivers.\nFor example, users can create two MIG instances with 20 gigabytes (GB) of memory each, three instances with 10 GB or seven with 5 GB. Users create the mix that\u2019s right for their workloads.\nSystem administrators can schedule a mix of inference, training and HPC workloads to run at the same time on a single A100 GPU.\nBecause MIG walls off GPU instances, it provides fault isolation \u2014 a problem in one instance won\u2019t affect others running on the same physical GPU. Each instance delivers guaranteed QoS, assuring users their workloads get the latency and throughput they expect.\nCloud service providers and other businesses can use MIG to raise utilization rates on their GPU servers, delivering users up to 7x more GPU instances.\n\u201cNVIDIA is a strategic partner for Google Cloud and we are excited for them to innovate on behalf of customers,\u201d said Tim Hockin, Principal Software Engineer at Google Cloud.\n\u201cMIG makes it possible to reach new levels of efficiency and utilization of GPUs in shared Kubernetes clusters. We\u2019re looking forward to working with NVIDIA and the Kubernetes community to enable these shared GPU use-cases, and make them available through the Google Kubernetes Engine,\u201d Hockin said.\nBusinesses Make Inference Fly on MIG\nFor enterprise users, MIG speeds both development and deployment of AI models.\nMIG gives up to seven data scientists simultaneous access to what feels like a dedicated GPU so they can work in parallel to fine-tune deep learning models for optimal accuracy and performance. It\u2019s time-consuming work, but it often doesn\u2019t require much compute capacity \u2014 a great use case for MIG.\nOnce models are ready to run, MIG lets a single GPU handle up to seven inference jobs at once. That\u2019s ideal for batch-1 inference workloads that involve small, low-latency models that don\u2019t need the muscle of a full GPU.\n\u201cNVIDIA technology is critical to Serve, our delivery robot platform,\u201d said Zhenyu Guo, director of artificial intelligence at Postmates.\n\u201cMIG will enable us to get the most out of every GPU we deploy because it lets us dynamically reconfigure our compute resources to meet changing workload demands, optimizing our cloud-based infrastructure for maximum efficiency and cost savings,\u201d he said.\nBuilt for IT/DevOps\nUsers won\u2019t have to change the CUDA programming model to get the benefits of MIG for AI and HPC. MIG works with existing Linux operating systems as well as Kubernetes and containers.\nNVIDIA enables MIG with software it provides for its A100. That includes GPU drivers, NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA 11 software (available soon), an updated NVIDIA container runtime and a new resource type in Kubernetes via the NVIDIA Device Plugin.\nUsing the NVIDIA Virtual Compute Server (vCS)\u00a0in tandem with MIG, will deliver the\u00a0 management and monitoring goodness of hypervisors such as Red Hat Virtualization and VMware vSphere. The combination will support popular functions such as live migration and multi-tenancy.\n\u201cOur customers have an increasing need to manage multi-tenant workflows running on virtual machines while providing isolation and security benefits,\u201d said Chuck Dubuque, Director of Marketing, Red Hat.\n\u201cThe new multi-instance GPU capabilities on NVIDIA A100 GPUs enable a new range of AI-accelerated workloads that run on Red Hat platforms from the cloud to the edge,\u201d he added.\nWith NVIDIA A100 and its software in place, users will be able to see and schedule jobs on their new GPU instances as if they were physical GPUs.\nWhere to Go to Learn More\nTo get the big picture on the role of MIG in A100 GPUs, watch the keynote with NVIDIA CEO and founder Jensen Huang. To learn even more, register for the MIG webinar or read a detailed article that takes a deep dive into the NVIDIA Ampere architecture.\nMIG is among a battery of new capabilities in the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, driving AI training, inference and HPC performance to new heights.

And customers don\u2019t have to pay until they drop off their shipments.\nHowever, even when customers create a booking to save a spot for their shipment, some cargo\u00a0 never shows up at the warehouse. This wreaks havoc with even the best-laid plans.\nAlong with its passenger business, American Airlines runs air cargo services worldwide for consumers and businesses. These shipments play an important role in keeping the world supplied with essentials, so the company works hard to make sure goods are transported as efficiently as possible.\nThat work requires the analysis of many variables, and the most challenging one is determining if a cargo shipment will even show up for takeoff.\nPredicting the future isn\u2019t easy, but data science can help. American Airlines uses machine learning and Quadro-powered Z by HP data science workstations to run models that assess how likely it is that a cargo shipment will arrive, which allows them to better plan shipments ahead of time.\nThe No-Show Package Problem \nAmerican Airlines receives thousands of shipments a day, and each needs to be quickly managed by its cargo team. But the logistics of cargo management are especially complex since some unknown number of bookings will never turn up.\n\u201cAmerican Airlines uses details from the bookings to plan the layout of cargo holds and see where freight can be placed,\u201d said Tassio Carvalho, head of the Center for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at American Airlines.\nIf a shipment doesn\u2019t show up on the day of departure, there\u2019s no time to replan the layout or resell the space. This means the configuration of the freight in the cargo hold is less optimal, which results in increased fuel burn for the trip.\n\u201cNo-shows cost us millions in lost revenue, and many times they can result in us needlessly turning away other critical shipments when we could have otherwise carried them,\u201d said Chris Isaac, managing director of American Airlines Cargo Revenue Management. \u201cBeing able to firm up a flight\u2019s bookings in advance allows us to recapture space that will go unused and provide it to others who need it.\u201d\nSigned, Sealed and Delivered with Machine Learning\nUsing Z by HP data science workstations powered by Quadro GPUs, Carvalho and his team created a machine learning model that takes data from the customer\u2019s booking and predicts the likelihood of whether the shipment will arrive or not.\nThe team built the predictive model using H2O4GPU, an open source, GPU-accelerated machine learning package, and loaded it with 500,000 booking records \u2014 a whole year of data. Each record had about 20 features, and those were segmented into about 100 derived features.\nAbout three days before its scheduled flights, American Airlines will run the details of each booking through the model. When the results show a high prediction of a shipment not arriving, the team reaches out to the customer and confirms whether or not they\u2019ll show up for the scheduled flight.\nUsing machine learning to flag at-risk shipments allows cargo agents to focus on the bookings that have the lowest chance of materializing, and spares them from having to call every customer.\n\u201cThe model is valuable because it shows which shipments are likely to become no-shows, and which bookings will have variations when they show up at the airport,\u201d said Carvalho. \u201cWith the data science workstations, we\u2019re able to get high accuracy with the models \u2014 at least 90 percent. This helps us plan our cargo freights better than we ever could before.\u201d\nWith the Quadro GPUs, Carvalho and his team were able to perform computations up to 10x faster than on CPUs. They get predictions and results much quicker, leading to increased cargo space utilization and reduced fuel burn.\nAmerican Airlines also announced they will be implementing a fair booking policy that allows customers to cancel bookings for free with at least 48 hours notice. The latest policy combined with the predictive model enables American Airlines to maximize space on the aircrafts.\n\u201cThe ability to use advanced analytics to solve one of our industry\u2019s biggest problems is a game changer for American Airlines,\u201d said Isaac. \u201cWe have the best data science team in the industry, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited to integrate the model into our business process.\u201d\nDive deeper into this work in the webinar with American Airlines.\n\nFeatured image courtesy of American Airlines.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: Aerospace | Artificial Intelligence | Data Science | Quadro \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Forty years to the day since PAC-MAN first hit arcades in Japan, and went on to munch a path to global stardom, the retro classic has been reborn, delivered courtesy of AI.\nTrained on 50,000 episodes of the game, a powerful new AI model created by NVIDIA Research, called NVIDIA GameGAN, can generate a fully functional version of PAC-MAN \u2014 without an underlying game engine. That means that even without understanding a game\u2019s fundamental rules, AI can recreate the game with convincing results.\nGameGAN is the first neural network model that mimics a computer game engine by harnessing generative adversarial networks, or GANs. Made up of two competing neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, GAN-based models learn to create new content that\u2019s convincing enough to pass for the original.\n\u201cThis is the first research to emulate a game engine using GAN-based neural networks,\u201d said Seung-Wook Kim, an NVIDIA researcher and lead author on the project. \u201cWe wanted to see whether the AI could learn the rules of an environment just by looking at the screenplay of an agent moving through the game. And it did.\u201d\nAs an artificial agent plays the GAN-generated game, GameGAN responds to the agent\u2019s actions, generating new frames of the game environment in real time. GameGAN can even generate game layouts it\u2019s never seen before, if trained on screenplays from games with multiple levels or versions.\nThis capability could be used by game developers to automatically generate layouts for new game levels, as well as by AI researchers to more easily develop simulator systems for training autonomous machines.\n\u201cWe were blown away when we saw the results, in disbelief that AI could recreate the iconic PAC-MAN experience without a game engine,\u201d said Koichiro Tsutsumi from BANDAI NAMCO Research Inc., the research development company of the game\u2019s publisher BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment Inc., which provided the PAC-MAN data to train GameGAN. \u201cThis research presents exciting possibilities to help game developers accelerate the creative process of developing new level layouts, characters and even games.\u201d\nWe\u2019ll be making our AI tribute to the game available later this year on AI Playground, where anyone can experience our research demos firsthand.\n\nAI Goes Old School\nPAC-MAN enthusiasts once had to take their coins to the nearest arcade to play the classic maze chase. Take a left at the pinball machine and continue straight past the air hockey, following the unmistakable soundtrack of PAC-MAN gobbling dots and avoiding ghosts Inky, Pinky, Blinky and Clyde.\nIn 1981 alone, Americans inserted billions of quarters to play 75,000 hours of coin-operated games like PAC-MAN. Over the decades since, the hit game has seen versions for PCs, gaming consoles and cell phones.\nGame Changer: NVIDIA Researcher Seung-Wook Kim and his collaborators trained GameGAN on 50,000 episodes of PAC-MAN.\nThe GameGAN edition relies on neural networks, instead of a traditional game engine, to generate PAC-MAN\u2019s environment. The AI keeps track of the virtual world, remembering what\u2019s already been generated to maintain visual consistency from frame to frame.\nNo matter the game, the GAN can learn its rules simply by ingesting screen recordings and agent keystrokes from past gameplay. Game developers could use such a tool to automatically design new level layouts for existing games, using screenplay from the original levels as training data.\nWith data from BANDAI NAMCO Research, Kim and his collaborators at the NVIDIA AI Research Lab in Toronto used NVIDIA DGX systems to train the neural networks on the PAC-MAN episodes (a few million frames, in total) paired with data on the keystrokes of an AI agent playing the game.\nThe trained GameGAN model then generates static elements of the environment, like a consistent maze shape, dots and Power Pellets \u2014 plus moving elements like the enemy ghosts and PAC-MAN itself.\nIt learns key rules of the game, both simple and complex. Just like in the original game, PAC-MAN can\u2019t walk through the maze walls. He eats up dots as he moves around, and when he consumes a Power Pellet, the ghosts turn blue and flee. When PAC-MAN exits the maze from one side, he\u2019s teleported to the opposite end. If he runs into a ghost, the screen flashes and the game ends.\nSince the model can disentangle the background from the moving characters, it\u2019s possible to recast the game to take place in an outdoor hedge maze, or swap out PAC-MAN for your favorite emoji. Developers could use this capability to experiment with new character ideas or game themes.\nIt\u2019s Not Just About Games\nAutonomous robots are typically trained in a simulator, where the AI can learn the rules of an environment before interacting with objects in the real world. Creating a simulator is a time-consuming process for developers, who must code rules about how objects interact with one another and how light works within the environment.\nSimulators are used to develop autonomous machines of all kinds, such as warehouse robots learning how to grasp and move objects around, or delivery robots that must navigate sidewalks to transport food or medicine.\nGameGAN introduces the possibility that the work of writing a simulator for tasks like these could one day be replaced by simply training a neural network.\nSuppose you install a camera on a car. It can record what the road environment looks like or what the driver is doing, like turning the steering wheel or hitting the accelerator. This data could be used to train a deep learning model that can predict what would happen in the real world if a human driver \u2014 or an autonomous car \u2014 took an action like slamming the brakes.\n\u201cWe could eventually have an AI that can learn to mimic the rules of driving, the laws of physics, just by watching videos and seeing agents take actions in an environment,\u201d said Sanja Fidler, director of NVIDIA\u2019s Toronto research lab. \u201cGameGAN is the first step toward that.\u201d\nNVIDIA Research has more than 200 scientists around the globe, focused on areas such as AI, computer vision, self-driving cars, robotics and graphics.\nGameGAN is authored by Fidler, Kim, NVIDIA researcher Jonah Philion, University of Toronto student Yuhao Zhou and MIT professor Antonio Torralba. The paper will be presented at the prestigious Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition in June.\nPAC-MANTM\u00a0& \u00a9BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment Inc. \n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ResearchTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA Research \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Today, we announced the new NVIDIA DGX A100 \u2014 the third generation of the world\u2019s most advanced, purpose-built AI system.\nBut there\u2019s more to AI than compute. Many enterprises need expert assistance to get up and running. That\u2019s why we have a network of partners to ease the deployment of large-scale AI infrastructure and streamline AI development workflows.\nToday, we\u2019re expanding that network with the NVIDIA DGX-Ready Software program, which helps customers increase their data science productivity.\nTo access the full potential of DGX systems, NVIDIA and its technology partners offer a portfolio of certified software that enhances deployments, whether customers are working on a single system or a multi-system NVIDIA DGX POD.\nThese applications enable data science teams to streamline their workflows and help IT teams integrate model development within an enterprise DevOps environment to make it easier to put AI projects into production.\nRemoving Complexity with Turnkey DGX POD\nNVIDIA powers its own work with DGX systems, including the SATURNV, the world\u2019s largest proving ground for AI, with more than 2,000 DGX nodes.\nThis massive AI infrastructure takes into account not only the compute node but also the network fabric \u2014 including storage \u2014 and the facilities engineering requirements for building a massive supercomputing infrastructure.\nNow powered by DGX A100, SATURNV fuels our critically important AI research and development.\nWe developed the DGX POD reference architecture based on what we learned from the thousands of DGX systems, including the SATURNV, deployed within NVIDIA as well as at customer sites. And we\u2019ve partnered with trusted companies to launch their own branded DGX POD offerings.\nCombining DGX systems with the highest performance storage from NetApp, Pure Storage, DDN Storage, IBM and Dell EMC, along with state-of-the-art networking from Cisco, Arista and Mellanox, these offerings provide prescriptive, defined approaches on how to build and scale AI infrastructure in an enterprise setting.\nFor organizations eager to accelerate their AI adoption, these DGX POD systems provide the stability, reliability, scalability and plug-and-play capabilities required.\nEasing Barriers to Entry with Flexible Deployment Options\nMany organizations are challenged by the large capital cost of AI infrastructure, or they simply don\u2019t have the resources to build and maintain a physical data center. And not everybody wants to build a hyperscale AI data center. With increasing cloud adoption, some organizations are even moving away from having their own on-prem infrastructure.\nTo make it easy to add AI, the partners in our NVIDIA DGX-Ready Data Center colocation program provide access to world-class data center facilities and services in more than 122 locations across 26 countries. This DGX infrastructure as a service provides cloud-like simplicity for AI workloads.\nThe program allows organizations to get a DGX system or even a DGX POD as an affordable monthly option, rather than having to spend their budget to build and stand up on-prem AI infrastructure. Customers can also take advantage of flexible leasing options and access to the latest NVIDIA technology.\nLearn more about NVIDIA DGX partners.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | HardwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA DGX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He\u2019s had teaching and research stints at Caltech, MIT and Stanford, where he chaired the computer science department.\nHe\u2019s led NVIDIA\u2019s research team since 2009. It includes more than 200 scientists from around the globe focused on areas such as AI, computer vision, self-driving cars, robotics and graphics.\nDally began exploring how to make a contribution after NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang called on company leaders to look for ways to help with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDally quickly connected on phone calls and in video conferences with leaders across the technology and medical fields.\nNVIDIA CEO: \u201cIt Works!\u201d\nThen, when kayaking on the cool, crystal-clear waters of Lake Tahoe in early April, where he was sheltering in place, inspiration struck.\nNVIDIA Chief Scientist Bill Dally built the first prototypes of his design in his home workshop.\nDally went online and ordered a solenoid valve, which uses an electromagnet to squeeze a valve open and shut.\nThen he pulled the microcontroller, a cheap, stripped-down computer, out of the home-brewed cooling system he\u2019d built for his wine cellar.\nAfter pulling a couple of late nighters in his home electronics workshop \u2014 and cranking out several thousand lines of code \u2014 Dally had a working prototype built from common pipe fittings and a few easily obtained valves.\nOn April 4 Dally shared a video, shot in his garage by his wife, of the device slowly inflating and deflating a rubber glove, with his NVIDIA colleagues.\nJensen\u2019s reaction: \u201cIt works!\u201d\nGathering Expert Advice\nTo continue moving the project forward, Dally dipped into the expertise of contacts across a wide range of disciplines.\nHe turned to Paul Karplus, a former student, noted for his work in autonomous vehicles and robotics, for the mechanical engineering of key parts.\nHe also relied on Emma Tran, a fourth-year medical student, to make a number of other connections in the medical field.\nDally quickly gathered input from Dr. Andrew Moore, a chief resident at the Stanford University School of Medicine, Dr. Bryant Lin, a prominent medical devices expert and founder of two companies, and anesthesiologist Dr. Ruth Fanning.\nDally turned to Dr. David Gaba a top expert in immersive and simulation-based learning, to test the device\u2019s capabilities.\nOn Friday, April 17, Dr. Gaba tested a prototype on a sophisticated lung simulator, modeling normal and two levels of COVID-19 lung disease with a wide variety of ventilator settings.\nIt worked as expected, Dally reports.\nRead NVIDIA Chief Scientist Bill Dally\u2019s paper detailing his open-source design for a low-cost, easy-to-assemble ventilator.\u00a0\nFrom Parts to Functional Ventilator in 5 Minutes\nYet the latest prototype of Dally\u2019s device, which he assembled in his home workshop, remains simple and reliable.\nDally reports he can bolt the device\u2019s pneumatic components together in 5 minutes. The entire ventilator can be attached to a simple display and slid into a compact Pelican carrying case.\nIt provides better care than \u201cbag squeezer\u201d emergency ventilators because it precisely regulates flow, pressure, and volume, Dally says. It also uses fewer parts and less power, and it\u2019s lower cost.\nIt includes sensors that accurately meter airflow, compensate for valve inaccuracy, control maximum pressure, enable patient-initiated breathing, and monitor for alarm conditions, among other features.\nDally\u2019s now in the process of navigating the paperwork needed for emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nAfter that, the next step will be to find a way to start building these.\n\nTo learn more about innovative projects like this, visit Research at NVIDIA.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | ResearchTags: COVID-19 | Industrial and Manufacturing | Open Source | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

BMW Group\u2019s objective is to enhance logistics factory flow to produce custom-configured cars more rapidly and efficiently. Once developed, the system will be deployed to BMW Group factories worldwide.\n\u201cBMW Group\u2019s use of NVIDIA\u2019s Isaac robotics platform to reimagine their factory is revolutionary,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cBMW Group is leading the way to the era of robotic factories, harnessing breakthroughs in AI and robotics technologies to create the next level of highly customizable, just-in-time, just-in-sequence manufacturing.\u201d\n\u201cBMW is committed to the Power of Choice for our customers \u2014 customization of diverse features across diverse vehicles for diverse customers,\u201d said J\u00fcrgen Maidl, senior vice president of Logistics for the BMW Group. \u201cManufacturing high-quality, highly customized cars, on multiple models, with higher volume, on one factory line requires advanced computing solutions from end-to-end. Our collaboration with NVIDIA allows us to develop the future of factory logistics today and to ultimately delight BMW Group customers worldwide.\u201d\nThe collaboration uses NVIDIA DGX\u2122 AI systems and Isaac simulation technology to train and test the robots; NVIDIA Quadro\u00ae ray-tracing GPUs to render synthetic machine parts to enhance the training; and a new lineup of multiple AI-enabled robots built on the Isaac software development kit, powered by high-performance NVIDIA Jetson\u2122 and EGX\u2122 edge computers.\nBMW Group\u2019s supply chain takes millions of parts flowing into a factory from more than 4,500 supplier sites, involving 230,000 unique part numbers, and in growing volumes as BMW Group\u2019s car sales have doubled over the past 10 years to 2.5 million vehicles. Moreover, BMW Group vehicles are offered to customers with an average of 100 different options, resulting in 99 percent of customer orders being uniquely different for each other. This creates an immense challenge for factory logistics.\nTo optimize the enormous complexity of this material flow, autonomous AI-powered logistics robots now assist the current production process in order to assemble highly customized vehicles on the same production line.\n\u201cUltimately, the sheer volume of possible configurations became a challenge to BMW Group production in three fundamental areas \u2013 computing, logistics planning, and data analysis,\u201d Maidl said.\nBMW Group\u2019s response is to use NVIDIA\u2019s Isaac robotics platform to develop five AI-enabled robots to improve their logistics workflow, powered by a variety of NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier\u2122 and EGX edge computers. These include both navigation robots to transport material autonomously, as well as manipulation robots to select and organize parts.\nDeveloped on the NVIDIA Isaac SDK, the robots utilize a number of powerful deep neural networks, addressing perception, segmentation, pose estimation and human pose estimation to perceive their environment, detect objects, navigate autonomously and move objects. These robots are trained both on real and synthetic data using NVIDIA GPUs to render ray-traced machine parts in a variety of lighting and occlusion conditions to augment real data.\nThe real and synthetic data are then used to train deep neural networks on NVIDIA DGX systems. The robots are then continuously tested in NVIDIA\u2019s Isaac Simulators for both navigation and manipulation, operating on NVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse platform, where multiple BMW Group personnel in different geographies can all work in one simulated environment.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2018s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined modern computer graphics and revolutionized parallel computing. More recently, GPU deep learning ignited modern AI \u2014 the next era of computing \u2014 with the GPU acting as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world.

To build these modern data centers, HPC and networking hardware and software must go hand in hand.\nNVIDIA provides the leading accelerated computing platform. Mellanox is the high-performance networking leader, now part of NVIDIA in a combination described in our founder and CEO\u2019s welcome letter.\nToday we announce our plan to acquire Cumulus Networks, bolstering our networking software capabilities. The combination enables the new era of the accelerated, software-defined data center.\nWith Cumulus, NVIDIA can innovate and optimize across the entire networking stack from chips and systems to software including analytics like Cumulus NetQ, delivering great performance and value to customers. This open networking platform is extensible and allows enterprise and cloud-scale data centers full control over their operations.\nCumulus, based in Mountain View, Calif., supports more than 100 hardware platforms with Cumulus Linux, its operating system for network switches. Our ultrafast NVIDIA Mellanox Spectrum switches already ship with Cumulus Linux and SONiC, the open source offering forged in Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud and managed by the Open Compute Project.\nThe courtship began in 2013, when Mellanox was forming its Open Ethernet strategy.\nMellanox heard the call for open networks from the world\u2019s largest cloud-service providers seeking greater simplicity. At the OCP Summit in March 2016, Mellanox announced a partnership with Cumulus and started shipping combined offerings.\nToday, the ONIE environment Cumulus created is a software foundation for Mellanox\u2019s bare-metal switches. Together, we built DENT, a distributed Linux software framework for retail and other enterprises at the edge of the network. And our Onyx operating system continues to expand, especially in Ethernet Storage Fabrics (ESF).\nNVIDIA\u2019s approach to creating both the hardware and software for accelerated computing expands deeper into networking software with Cumulus. The ability to innovate across the entire technology stack will help us deliver performance at scale for the accelerated, software-defined data center.\nWe\u2019re delighted to join forces with Cumulus and look forward to the innovations we\u2019ll deliver to customers together.\n\n\nCategories: NetworkingTags: Artificial Intelligence | High-Performance Computing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Many are using footage shot at home or getting creative with stock footage to meet the demands for fresh content.\nWith the latest release of Adobe Premiere Pro, available today, creators can get new NVIDIA GPU-enhanced features that help them deliver high-quality content faster than ever.\n\nElevate Editing Workflows with GPU Acceleration\nWith the new Premiere Pro 14.2, video creators gain massive time-savings with new GPU-accelerated encoding. Adobe and NVIDIA have optimized Premiere Pro for the built-in NVIDIA hardware encoder on NVIDIA Quadro and GeForce GPUs.\nThe results are staggering. Editors can now export high-resolution videos up to 5x faster than with CPU alone by using the popular H.264 or H.265 / HEVC codecs. Less time exporting means more time for editing content, and quicker turnarounds on projects.\n\u201cI\u2019m often required to export multiple versions of my videos. Sometimes to submit for approval, but mostly I just prefer to error check the final render instead of playing back the timeline,\u201d said YouTuber Gerald Undone. \u201cWith NVENC integration into Premiere Pro, I can do this step in a third of the time, which should equate to dozens of hours saved by the end of the year.\u201d\nAnd thanks to enhancements in the encoder on our latest NVIDIA GeForce and Quadro RTX GPUs, encoding quality and efficiency are second to none.\nFor example, the music video below is three minutes and nine seconds long. With traditional software encoding using a Core i9-9750H laptop CPU, it takes 3:48 to export. By using the NVIDIA hardware encoder on a GeForce RTX 2060 Max-Q GPU, the export completes in one-fifth the time \u2014 a mere 47 seconds.\n\nIn addition to Premiere Pro, the NVIDIA hardware encoder speeds up video exports in Adobe Media Encoder, After Effects and Audition.\n\u201cWith NVENC, our workflow has drastically improved,\u201d said cinematographer Armando Ferreira. \u201cWe are able to playback higher resolutions in real time in our timeline and export up to 40 percent faster.\u201d\n\nVideo encoding joins a growing list of Premiere Pro features enhanced by NVIDIA GPUs, including accelerated video effects using CUDA, and Auto Reframe with GPU-accelerated AI.\n\u201cThese improvements are the result of years of collaboration between NVIDIA and Adobe to deliver high-quality applications and tools to creators,\u201d said Manish Kulkarni, senior engineering manager at Adobe. \u201cWith new support for NVIDIA GPUs on Windows, exports are hardware accelerated leveraging the power of the GPU to make Premiere Pro more powerful and keep video creators productive and nimble.\u201d\nAlso included in today\u2019s release is support for Apple\u2019s ProRes RAW in both Premiere Pro and After Effects. For the first time, video editors and motion graphics artists can import and edit ProRes RAW files in Windows with no need to transcode. This is accelerated by CUDA, available exclusively on NVIDIA GPUs.\nDon\u2019t yet have access to Premiere Pro?

Flexible and responsive, for many years CPUs were the sole programmable element in most computers.\nMore recently the GPU, or graphics processing unit, has taken a central role. Originally used to deliver rich, real-time graphics, their parallel processing capabilities make them ideal for accelerated computing tasks of all kinds. Thanks to these capabilities, GPUs are essential to artificial intelligence, deep learning and big data analytics applications.\nOver the past decade, however, computing has broken out of the boxy confines of PCs and servers \u2014 with CPUs and GPUs powering sprawling new hyperscale data centers.\nThese data centers are knit together with a powerful new category of processors. The DPU has become the third member of the data-centric accelerated computing model.\n\u201cThis is going to represent one of the three major pillars of computing going forward,\u201d NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said during a talk earlier this month.\n\u201cThe CPU is for general-purpose computing, the GPU is for accelerated computing, and the DPU, which moves data around the data center, does data processing.\u201d\nWhat's a DPU?\n\n\n\nSystem on a chip that combines:\n\n\n\n\nIndustry-standard, high-performance, software-programmable multi-core CPU\n\n\n\nHigh-performance network interface\n\n\n\nFlexible and programmable acceleration engines\n\n\n\n\n\nCPU v GPU v DPU: What Makes a DPU Different?\u00a0\nA DPU is a new class of programmable processor that combines three key elements. A DPU is a system on a chip, or SoC, that combines:\n\nAn industry-standard, high-performance, software-programmable, multi-core CPU, typically based on the widely used Arm architecture, tightly coupled to the other SoC components.\nA high-performance network interface capable of parsing, processing and efficiently transferring data at line rate, or the speed of the rest of the network, to GPUs and CPUs.\nA rich set of flexible and programmable acceleration engines that offload and improve applications performance for AI and machine learning, zero-trust security, telecommunications and storage, among others.\n\nAll these DPU capabilities are critical to enable an isolated, bare-metal, cloud-native computing platform that will define the next generation of cloud-scale computing.\n\nDPUs Incorporated into SmartNICs\nThe DPU can be used as a stand-alone embedded processor. But it\u2019s more often incorporated into a SmartNIC, a network interface controller used as a critical component in a next-generation server.\nOther devices that claim to be DPUs miss significant elements of these three critical capabilities.\nDPUs can be used as a stand-alone embedded processor, but they\u2019re more often incorporated into a SmartNIC, a network interface controller used as a key component in a next-generation server.\nFor example, some vendors use proprietary processors that don\u2019t benefit from the broad Arm CPU ecosystem\u2019s rich development and application infrastructure.\nOthers claim to have DPUs but make the mistake of focusing solely on the embedded CPU to perform data path processing.\n\nA Focus on Data Processing\nThat approach isn\u2019t competitive and doesn\u2019t scale, because trying to beat the traditional x86 CPU with a brute force performance attack is a losing battle. If 100 Gigabit/sec packet processing brings an x86 to its knees, why would an embedded CPU perform better?\nInstead, the network interface needs to be powerful and flexible enough to handle all network data path processing. The embedded CPU should be used for control path initialization and exception processing, nothing more.\nAt a minimum, there 10 capabilities the network data path acceleration engines need to be able to deliver:\n\nData packet parsing, matching and manipulation to implement an open virtual switch (OVS)\nRDMA data transport acceleration for Zero Touch RoCE\nGPUDirect accelerators to bypass the CPU and feed networked data directly to GPUs (both from storage and from other GPUs)\nTCP acceleration including RSS, LRO, checksum, etc.\nNetwork virtualization for VXLAN and Geneve overlays and VTEP offload\nTraffic shaping \u201cpacket pacing\u201d accelerator to enable multimedia streaming, content distribution networks and the new 4K/8K Video over IP (RiverMax for ST 2110)\nPrecision timing accelerators for telco cloud RAN such as 5T for 5G capabilities\nCrypto acceleration for IPSEC and TLS performed inline, so all other accelerations are still operational\nVirtualization support for SR-IOV, VirtIO and para-virtualization\nSecure Isolation: root of trust, secure boot, secure firmware upgrades, and authenticated containers and application lifecycle management\n\nThese are just 10 of the acceleration and hardware capabilities that are critical to being able to answer yes to the question: \u201cWhat is a DPU?\u201d\nSo what is a DPU? This is a DPU:\n\nMany so-called DPUs focus on delivering just one or two of these functions.\nThe worst try to offload the datapath in proprietary processors.\nWhile good for prototyping, this is a fool\u2019s errand because of the scale, scope and breadth of data centers.\nAdditional DPU-Related Resources\n\nDefining the SmartNIC: What is a SmartNIC and How to Choose the Best One\nBest Smart NICs for Building the Smart Cloud: PART I\nWelcome to the DPU-Enabled Data Revolution Era\nAccelerating Bare Metal Kubernetes Workloads, the Right Way\nMellanox Introduces Revolutionary SmartNICs for Making Secure Cloud Possible\nAchieving a Cloud Scale Architecture with SmartNICs\nProvision Bare-Metal Kubernetes Like a Cloud Giant!\nKernel of Truth Podcast: Demystifying the DPU and DOCA\u00a0\n\nLearn more on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Explainer | NetworkingTags: Data Science | GPU \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Among those mentioned:\n\nOxford Nanopore Technologies has sequenced the virus genome in just seven hours.\nPlotly is doing real-time infection rate tracing.\nOak Ridge National Laboratory and the Scripps Research Institute have screened a billion potential drug combinations in a day.\nStructura Biotechnology, the University of Texas at Austin and the National Institutes of Health have reconstructed the 3D structure of the virus\u2019s spike protein.\n\nNVIDIA also announced updates to its NVIDIA Clara healthcare platform aimed at taking on COVID-19.\n\u201cResearchers and scientists applying NVIDIA accelerated computing to save lives is the perfect example of our company\u2019s purpose \u2014 we build computers to solve problems normal computers cannot,\u201d Huang said.\nAt the core of Huang\u2019s talk was a vision for how data centers, the engine rooms of the modern global information economy, are changing, and how NVIDIA and Mellonox, acquired in a deal that closed last month, are together driving those changes.\n\u201cThe data center is the new computing unit,\u201d Huang said, adding that NVIDIA is accelerating performance gains from silicon, to the ways CPUs and GPUs connect, to the full software stack, and, ultimately, across entire data centers.\nSystems Optimized for Data Center-Scale Computing\nThat starts with a new GPU architecture that\u2019s optimized for this new kind of data center-scale computing, unifying AI training and inference, and making possible flexible, elastic acceleration.\nNVIDIA A100, the first GPU based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, providing the greatest generational performance leap of NVIDIA\u2019s eight generations of GPUs, is also built for data analytics, scientific computing and cloud graphics, and is in full production and shipping to customers worldwide, Huang announced.\nEighteen of the world\u2019s leading service providers and systems builders are incorporating them, among them Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Google Cloud, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft Azure and Oracle.\nThe A100, and the NVIDIA Ampere architecture it\u2019s built on, boost performance by up to 20x over its predecessors, Huang said. He detailed five key features of A100, including:\n\nMore than 54 billion transistors, making it the world\u2019s largest 7-nanometer processor.\nThird-generation Tensor Cores with TF32, a new math format that accelerates single-precision AI training out of the box. NVIDIA\u2019s widely used Tensor Cores are now more flexible, faster and easier to use, Huang explained.\nStructural sparsity acceleration, a new efficiency technique harnessing the inherently sparse nature of AI math for higher performance.\nMulti-instance GPU, or MIG, allowing a single A100 to be partitioned into as many as seven independent GPUs, each with its own resources.\nThird-generation NVLink technology, doubling high-speed connectivity between GPUs, allowing A100 servers to act as one giant GPU.\n\nThe result of all this: 6x higher performance than NVIDIA\u2019s previous generation Volta architecture for training and 7x higher performance for inference.\nNVIDIA DGX A100 Packs 5 Petaflops of Performance\nNVIDIA is also shipping a third generation of its NVIDIA DGX AI system based on NVIDIA A100 \u2014 the NVIDIA DGX A100 \u2014 the world\u2019s first 5-petaflops server. And each DGX A100 can be divided into as many as 56 applications, all running independently.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Argonne National Laboratory will use DGX A100\u2019s AI and computing power to better understand and fight COVID-19.\nThis allows a single server to either \u201cscale up\u201d to race through computationally intensive tasks such as AI training, or \u201cscale out,\u201d for AI deployment, or inference, Huang said.\nAmong initial recipients of the system are the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Argonne National Laboratory, which will use the cluster\u2019s AI and computing power to better understand and fight COVID-19; the University of Florida; and the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence.\nA100 will also be available for cloud and partner server makers as HGX A100.\nA data center powered by five DGX A100 systems for AI training and inference running on just 28 kilowatts of power costing $1 million can do the work of a typical data center with 50 DGX-1 systems for AI training and 600 CPU systems consuming 630 kilowatts and costing over $11 million, Huang explained.\n\u201cThe more you buy, the more you save,\u201d Huang said, in his common keynote refrain.\nNeed more? Huang also announced the next-generation DGX SuperPOD. Powered by 140 DGX A100 systems and Mellanox networking technology, it offers 700 petaflops of AI performance, Huang said, the equivalent of one of the 20 fastest computers in the world.\nThe next-generation DGX SuperPOD delivers 700 petaflops of AI performance.\nNVIDIA is expanding its own data center with four DGX SuperPODs, adding 2.8 exaflops of AI computing power \u2014 for a total of 4.6 exaflops of total capacity \u2014 to its SATURNV internal supercomputer, making it the world\u2019s fastest AI supercomputer.\nHuang also announced the NVIDIA EGX A100, bringing powerful real-time cloud-computing capabilities to the edge. Its NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPU offers third-generation Tensor Cores and new security features. Thanks to its NVIDIA Mellanox ConnectX-6 SmartNIC, it also includes secure, lightning-fast networking capabilities.\nSoftware for the Most Important Applications in the World Today\nHuang also announced NVIDIA GPUs will power major software applications for accelerating three critical usages: managing big data, creating recommender systems and building real-time, conversational AI.\nThese new tools arrive as the effectiveness of machine learning has driven companies to collect more and more data. \u201cThat positive feedback is causing us to experience an exponential growth in the amount of data that is collected,\u201d Huang said.\nTo help organizations of all kinds keep up, Huang announced support for NVIDIA GPU acceleration on Spark 3.0, describing the big data analytics engine as \u201cone of the most important applications in the world today.\u201d\nBuilt on RAPIDS, Spark 3.0 shatters performance benchmarks for extracting, transforming and loading data, Huang said. It\u2019s already helped Adobe Intelligent Services achieve a 90 percent compute cost reduction.\nKey cloud analytics platforms \u2014 including Amazon SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning, Databricks, Google Cloud AI and Google Cloud Dataproc \u2014 will all accelerate with NVIDIA, Huang announced.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now prepared for a future where the amount of data will continue to grow exponentially from tens or hundreds of petabytes to exascale and beyond,\u201d Huang said.\nHuang also unveiled NVIDIA Merlin, an end-to-end framework for building next-generation recommender systems, which are fast becoming the engine of a more personalized internet. Merlin slashes the time needed to create a recommender system from a 100-terabyte dataset to 20 minutes from four days, Huang said.\nAnd he detailed NVIDIA Jarvis (since renamed NVIDIA Riva), a new end-to-end platform for creating real-time, multimodal conversational AI that can draw upon the capabilities unleashed by NVIDIA\u2019s AI platform.\nHuang highlighted its capabilities with a demo that showed him interacting with a friendly AI, Misty, that understood and responded to a sophisticated series of questions about the weather in real time.\nHuang also dug into NVIDIA\u2019s swift progress in real-time ray tracing since NVIDIA RTX was launched at SIGGRAPH in 2018, and he announced that NVIDIA Omniverse, which allows \u201cdifferent designers with different tools in different places doing different parts of the same design,\u201d to work together simultaneously is now available for early access customers.\nAutonomous Vehicles\nAutonomous vehicles are one of the greatest computing challenges of our time, Huang said, an area where NVIDIA continues to push forward with NVIDIA DRIVE.\nNVIDIA DRIVE will use the new Orin SoC with an embedded NVIDIA Ampere GPU to achieve the energy efficiency and performance to offer a 5-watt ADAS system for the front windshield as well as scale up to a 2,000 TOPS, level-5 robotaxi system.\nNow automakers have a single computing architecture and single software stack to build AI into every one of their vehicles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s now possible for a carmaker to develop an entire fleet of cars with one architecture, leveraging the software development across their whole fleet,\u201d Huang said.\nThe NVIDIA DRIVE ecosystem now encompasses cars, trucks, tier one automotive suppliers, next-generation mobility services, startups, mapping services, and simulation.\nAnd Huang announced NVIDIA is adding NVIDIA DRIVE RC for managing entire fleets of autonomous vehicles to its suite of NVIDIA DRIVE technologies.\nBMW has selected NVIDIA Isaac robotics to power its factories.\nRobotics\nNVIDIA also continues to push forward with its NVIDIA Isaac software-defined robotics platform, announcing that BMW has selected NVIDIA Isaac robotics to power its factories.\nBMW\u2019s 30 factories around the globe build one vehicle every 56 seconds: that\u2019s 40 different models, each with hundreds of different options, made from 30 million parts flowing in from nearly 2,000 suppliers around the world, Huang explained.\nBMW joins a sprawling NVIDIA robotics global ecosystem that spans delivery services, retail, autonomous mobile robots, agriculture, services, logistics, manufacturing and healthcare.\nIn the future, factories will, effectively, be enormous robots. \u201cAll of the moving parts inside will be driven by artificial intelligence,\u201d Huang said. \u201cEvery single mass-produced product in the future will be customized.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: Accelerated Analytics | Cloud | Corporate | Data Center | Deep Learning | Networking | Robotics | SoftwareTags: Conversational AI | COVID-19 | GPU | Merlin | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | NVIDIA Clara | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA DRIVE | Omniverse | Recommender Systems | Riva | Simulation and Design | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA -

In recent years, this leader in AI has looked to AI-driven tools to serve its own customers as well.\nThis includes NVIDIA\u2019s marketing organization, which turned to Adobe\u2019s Customer Experience Management (CXM) solutions that use AI to assess the effectiveness of campaigns and better anticipate customer behaviors. Driven by data analysis, the approach supports business resiliency through enhancing customer experiences, driving greater efficiencies online and aligning the impact of marketing on sales.\nWhen Adobe launched a beta program for AI-driven Intelligent Services to address these kinds of needs, NVIDIA\u2019s data-driven team was one of the first to sign up. In fact, we\u2019ve been working together on AI for a while, and separately have more to share on our work together today with NVIDIA\u2019s Spark 3.0 news. Here, we\u2019re sharing some early results of how AI is helping NVIDIA enhance the customer experience.\nAI-driven marketing attribution\nMost marketing teams have one underlying challenge in common: proving the effectiveness of marketing channels and campaigns. The issue has been exacerbated in the last couple of years, as brands began to invest in everything from email marketing and websites, to social media and emerging channels like voice-enabled AI.\nIn a recent example, NVIDIA wanted to understand how marketing impacted the sales of a new line of GPUs. With Attribution AI (part of Adobe\u2019s Intelligent Services), the system ran an in-depth analysis across all relevant data sets and identified channels (paid media vs email) and campaigns (bundled offers vs product refresh) that proved to be most effective. Incredibly, it helped them tie marketing closer to sales by pointing out incremental lift and quantifying the sales (or conversion) that would be missed without marketing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribution AI also enabled NVIDIA to move beyond existing forms of attribution, where oftentimes too much credit is given to the \u201clast-touch,\u201d\u2014the final engagement point before an actual purchase or conversion event happens. In traditional rules-based models, different touch points in the customer journey are often misrepresented and undervalued or overvalued as a result.\nRecently, the marketing team was tasked with driving event registrations. They wanted to ensure that funds were being spent wisely and had the biggest impact. With Attribution AI, they were able to see the effectiveness of investments across channels, while drilling down into specific campaigns. In this case, they optimized paid search around a set of keywords\u2014an effort that drove a 5X lift in paid registrations.\nPredicting customer behaviors with AI\nIn today\u2019s competitive business environment, reducing churn has become the new growth driver for many companies. Brands need an ability to anticipate customers that may jump ship and look for ways to re-engage and retain them. NVIDIA leveraged Customer AI in its consumer business to better identify those who were likely to stop using the service. With a remarkable 96% accuracy rate, the service analyzed everything from the number of days spent between sessions to usage frequency. AI was able to provide a segment of customers who would be best served through specially tailored content and campaigns.\nAccording to Derek Sun, digital marketing analyst at NVIDIA: \u201cAI and machine learning have a big role to play in the future of marketing, as businesses want to better understand their customers and make operations more efficient. Adobe\u2019s Intelligent Services provide mature data science models that are both flexible and fast to deploy, helping us be more in tune with our communities and deliver the right content to the right person at the right time, while improving the efficiency of our marketing investments.\u201d\nNVIDIA is a great example for brands and marketers in any industry that are exploring ways in which AI/ML can help their organization and drive leadership in CXM. Across all the communities NVIDIA serves, from gamers, artists/designers, researchers, data scientists, and innovators across all industries, the company is showing how data and AI can help ensure that every decision around customer engagement and marketing investment is the most impactful, most cost-effective choice possible.\nTo learn more about Adobe\u2019s Intelligent Services and how they can help your organization see quicker value from AI, visit here.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

and 5 petaflops of performance\n\n\n\nDean Takahashi@deantak \n\nMay 14, 2020 6:00 AM\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\nShare on X\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's A100 chip has 54 billion transistors.Image Credit: Nvidia \n\n\n\n\n\nJoin our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\n\n\nNvidia unwrapped its Nvidia A100 artificial intelligence chip today, and CEO Jensen Huang called it the ultimate instrument for advancing AI.\u00a0Huang said it can make supercomputing tasks \u2014 which are vital in the fight against COVID-19 \u2014 much more cost-efficient and powerful than today\u2019s more expensive systems.\nThe chip has a monstrous 54 billion transistors (the on-off switches that are the building blocks of all things electronic), and it can execute 5 petaflops of performance, or about 20 times more than the previous-generation chip Volta. Huang made the announcement during his keynote at the Nvidia GTC event, which was digital this year.\nThe launch was originally scheduled for March 24 but was delayed by the pandemic. Nvidia rescheduled the release for today, as the chips and the DGX A100 systems that used the chips are now available and shipping.\nThe Nvidia A100 chip uses the same Ampere architecture (named after French mathematician and physicist Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re) that could be used in consumer applications such as Nvidia\u2019s GeForce graphics chips. In contrast to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Nvidia is focused on creating a single microarchitecture for its GPUs for both commercial AI and consumer graphics use. But Huang said mixing and matching the different elements on the chip will determine whether it is used for AI or graphics.\nThe DGX A100 is the third generation of Nvidia\u2019s AI DGX platform, and Huang said it essentially puts the capabilities of an entire datacenter into a single rack. That is hyperbole, but Paresh Kharya, director of product management datacenter and cloud platforms, said in a press briefing that the 7-nanometer chip, codenamed Ampere, can take the place of a lot of AI systems being used today.\n\u201cYou get all of the overhead of additional memory, CPUs, and power supplies of 56 servers \u2026 collapsed into one,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThe economic value proposition is really off the charts, and that\u2019s the thing that is really exciting.\u201d\nAbove: Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang holds the world\u2019s largest graphics card.Image Credit: Nvidia\nFor instance, to handle AI training tasks today, one customer needs 600 central processing unit (CPU) systems to handle millions of queries for datacenter applications. That costs $11 million, and it would require 25 racks of servers and 630 kilowatts of power. With Ampere, Nvidia can do the same amount of processing for $1 million, a single server rack, and 28 kilowatts of power.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you hear Jensen say, \u2018The more you buy, the more you save,'\u201d Kharya said.\nHuang added, \u201cIt\u2019s going to replace a whole bunch of inference servers. The throughput of training and inference is off the charts \u2014 20 times is off the charts.\u201d\nThe first order\nAbove: DGX A100 servers in use at the Argonne National Lab.Image Credit: Argonne\nThe first order for the chips is going to the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory, which will use the cluster\u2019s AI and computing power to better understand and fight COVID-19.\u00a0DGX A100 systems use eight of the new Nvidia A100 Tensor Core GPUs, providing 320 gigabytes of memory for training the largest AI data sets, and the latest high-speed Nvidia Mellanox HDR 200Gbps interconnects.\nMultiple smaller workloads can be accelerated by partitioning the DGX A100 into as many as 56 instances per system, using the A100 multi-instance GPU feature. Combining these capabilities enables enterprises to optimize computing power and resources on demand to accelerate diverse workloads \u2014 including data analytics, training, and inference \u2014 on a single fully integrated, software-defined platform.\nImmediate DGX A100 adoption and support\nAbove: DGX A100 system at Argonne National Lab.Image Credit: Argonne\nNvidia said a number of the world\u2019s largest companies, service providers, and government agencies have placed initial orders for the DGX A100, with the first systems delivered to Argonne earlier this month.\nRick Stevens, associate laboratory director for Computing, Environment, and Life Sciences at Argonne National Lab, said in a statement that the center\u2019s supercomputers are being used to fight the coronavirus, with AI models and simulations running on the machines in hopes of finding treatments and a vaccine. The DGX A100 systems\u2019 power will enable scientists to do a year\u2019s worth of work in months or days.\nThe University of Florida will be the first U.S. institution of higher learning to receive DGX A100 systems, which it will deploy to infuse AI across its entire curriculum to foster an AI-enabled workforce.\nAmong other early adopters are the Center for Biomedical AI at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany, which will leverage DGX A100 to advance clinical decision support and process optimization.\nThousands of previous-generation DGX systems are currently being used around the globe by a wide range of public and private organizations. Among these users are some of the world\u2019s leading businesses, including automakers, health care providers, retailers, financial institutions, and logistics companies that are adopting AI across their industries.\nSuperPods\nAbove: A DGX SuperPodImage Credit: Nvidia\nNvidia also revealed its next-generation DGX SuperPod, a cluster of 140 DGX A100 systems capable of achieving 700 petaflops of AI computing power. Combining 140 DGX A100 systems with Nvidia Mellanox HDR 200Gbps InfiniBand interconnects, the company built its own next-generation DGX SuperPod AI supercomputer for internal research in areas such as conversational AI, genomics, and autonomous driving.\nIt took only three weeks to build that SuperPod, Kharya said, and the cluster is one of the world\u2019s fastest AI supercomputers \u2014 achieving a level of performance that previously required thousands of servers.\nTo help customers build their own A100-powered datacenters, Nvidia has released a new DGX SuperPod reference architecture. This gives customers a blueprint that follows the same design principles and best practices Nvidia used.\nDGXpert program, DGX-ready software\nAbove: Nvidia A100 chip on a circuit card.Image Credit: Nvidia\nNvidia also launched the Nvidia DGXpert program, which brings DGX customers together with the company\u2019s AI experts, and the Nvidia DGX-ready software program, which helps customers take advantage of certified, enterprise-grade software for AI workflows.\nThe company said that each DGX A100 system has eight Nvidia A100 Tensor Core graphics processing units (GPUs), delivering 5 petaflops of AI power, with 320GB in total GPU memory and 12.4TB per second in bandwidth.\nThe systems also have six Nvidia NVSwitch interconnect fabrics with third-generation Nvidia NVLink technology for 4.8 terabytes per second of bi-directional bandwidth. And they have nine Nvidia Mellanox ConnectX-6 HDR 200Gb per second network interfaces, offering a total of 3.6 terabits per second of bi-directional bandwidth.\nThe chips are made by TSMC in a 7-nanometer process. Nvidia DGX A100 systems start at $199,000 and are shipping now through Nvidia Partner Network resellers worldwide.\n\nHuang said the DGX A100 uses the HGX motherboard, which weighs about 50 pounds and is \u201cthe most complex motherboard in the world.\u201d (This is the board he pulled out of his home oven in a teaser video). It has 30,000 components and a kilometer of wire traces.\nAs for a consumer graphics chip, Nvidia would configure an Ampere-based chip in a very different way. The A100 uses high-bandwidth memory for datacenter applications, but that wouldn\u2019t be used in consumer graphics. The cores would also be heavily biased for graphics instead of the double-precision floating point calculations datacenters need, he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll bias it differently, but every single workload runs on every single GPU,\u201d Huang said.\n\n\n\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

The move would mark an escalation in the government's crisis response, which so far has focused on loans and subsidies to small firms, in a sign of its concern over the widening damage from the pandemic. Under the scheme, state-affiliated lenders will invest in ailing companies by offering subordinated loans or accepting preferred shares, four officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak publicly. Investment by the government will help companies strengthen their financial standing, which would allow them to borrow money from banks more easily and avoid downgrades to their credit ratings. The scheme will be included in a fresh package of measures the government will map out to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic, and funded partly by a second supplementary budget for the current fiscal year that began in April, the officials said, confirming a report in the Nikkei newspaper. A panel of ruling party lawmakers began a series of meetings on Wednesday to work out details of the scheme, as well as discuss other ideas to forestall bankruptcies.  Yoichi Miyazawa, chairman of the panel, told Reuters last month that the government and central bank may need to set up a special purpose vehicle to inject capital into companies hit by the pandemic. The world's third-largest economy is on the cusp of a deep recession, as the pandemic has forced households to stay home and businesses to shut down. Japan has reported close to 16,000 coronavirus infections and over 650 deaths. Big companies in key Japanese industries, including auto giants like Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, have suffered slumping profits, stoking fears of a wave of bankruptcies and job losses that could devastate an already weakening economy. \"If a big company goes under, it leads to several tens of thousands of job losses. It would also have a devastating impact on regional economies,\" Finance Minister Taro Aso told parliament on Thursday. \"We need to make sure that doesn't happen,\" he said. The government has said it will use all available tools to help Japan's car and autoparts makers hit by supply chain disruptions, slumping demand and factory shutdowns caused by the health crisis.   Story continues The Bank of Japan also plans to hold an emergency policy meeting as early as this month to set up a reward scheme for financial institutions that boost lending to small firms hurt by the coronavirus.(Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Leslie Adler and Richard Pullin)  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

  Meet the world's richest farmer who made billions from swine flu and the coronavirus pandemic      Lily Canter     Updated Sun, 31 May 2020, 6:12 pm 2 min read               Qin Yinglin, chairman of Muyuan Foodstuff seen on November 22, 2012 in Zhengzhou, Henan Province of China. Photo: Visual China Group via Getty Images/Visual China Group via Getty Images   Self-made billionaire Qin Yinglin is the world's richest farmer with a $22bn (\u00a317.82bn) personal fortune. His Chinese pork empire has rocketed in the past year due to shortages and higher prices during the 2019 African swine flu outbreak and the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic. Yinglin and his wife Qian Ying, started their first pig farm in 1992 with just 22 piglets. By 2019 they had more than 10 million pigs within their Shenzhen-listed company Muyuan Foods.   As the most popular protein in China, pork is in high demand and losses in supply from culling or restrictions can cause prices to rapidly accelerate. The outbreak of swine flu in 2019 wiped out half of China's pigs driving up prices by 160%. This sent Muyuan Foods share prices soaring 200% and by June last year Yinglin's wealth had doubled to $22bn. The strength of the company is due to it maintaining ownership of a high percentage of its own farms enabling it to better control hygiene and biosecurity thus warding off diseases. READ MORE: The common thread underlying the riots, COVID, China, Twitter and Trump When China went into lockdown in early February this year the supply of pork was restricted, further boosting Muyuan stock by 80% between February 3 and April 28. This added a quick $6bn to Yinglin's fortune. But analysts predict the restocking of China\u2019s pork supply could mean a decline in Yinglin's personal wealth which has been underpinned by overpricing in the industry.   Pork prices are now falling as the swine flu outbreak stabilises and coronavirus lockdown is lifted, and the market is expected to continue to normalise. \u201cThis is a limited story [for Muyuan] in terms of time,\u201d Wilhelm Uffelmann, head of consultancy Roland Berger\u2019s food and agribusiness practice, told the Financial Times. Earlier this year Yinglin told the media COVID-19 was a mixed blessing for farmers. \u201cThe epidemic will force the weaker companies and farmers to completely withdraw but it will be an opportunity for profit and development for the stronger enterprises,\u201d he said.

Before we get into the figures, the period includes a full month of 'lockdown' in many countries worldwide. Despite the lockdown challenge, which would be a significant setback in many industries, companies like Nvidia have prospered.\n\nIn its Q1 declaration Nvidia brought in revenue of $3.08bn, up 39 per cent compared to a year ago. Gross margins were 65.1 per cent. It isn't just the 'people staying at home needing laptops and playing more games' that drove the revenue North either, the company raked in record Data Centre revenue of $1.14 bn, up 80 per cent YoY.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a statement to accompany the results. To start with he thanked healthcare workers, and service workers for saving lives and keeping the world running, as well as the scientists engaged in the Covid-19 vaccine hunt. Huang happily admitted that Nvidia had had \"an excellent quarter,\" and mentioned some recent milestones like the launch and shipment of the first Ampere GPUs, the acquisition of Mellanox, and the record number of developers taking part in the GTC digital conference.\nWith respect to Nvidia's data centre business, it was highlighted that \"Our Data Center business achieved a record and its first $1 billion quarter\". Huang went on to claim that \"Nvidia is well positioned to advance the most powerful technology forces of our time \u2013 cloud computing and AI\". A Marketwatch blog post opined that passing this milestone means \"Nvidia is not just a gaming company anymore\".\n\nPondering over the Revenue by Market Platform figures, above, you can see that data centre still contributes just a third of the revenue that gaming musters. It is now the fastest growing segment though, and casts a long shadow over the performance of Nvidia's automotive division which was at one time equally hopeful of great things.\n\nNvidia shares its quarterly highlights in a blog post about the latest set of results. In gaming it reckons that some of its greatest achievements include; launching Minecraft with RTX, bringing its GeForce RTX Super GPUs to laptops, new RTX Studio devices, expanding GeForce Now, and releasing DLSS 2.0. In data centre its most important achievements are the very recent launches of Ampere GPUs and associated hardware like the DGX A100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nAMD sales up 54 per cent, beats analyst expectations\n\n                    Server and semi-custom chips are selling particularly well.

U.S. health regulators are telling five drugmakers to recall versions of the widely used diabetes medication after testing revealed elevated levels of a contaminant linked to cancer in several lots. (FDA via AP) \u00b7 Associated Press     MATTHEW PERRONE  Updated 30 May 2020 2 min read          WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 U.S. health regulators are telling five drugmakers to recall their versions of a widely used diabetes medication after laboratory tests found elevated levels of a contaminant linked to cancer. The Food and Drug Administration said late Thursday that several batches of the drug metformin tested positive for unsafe levels of a chemical called N-Nitrosodimethylamine. The agency has stepped up testing after the chemical was found in dozens of shipments of heartburn drugs last year, triggering recalls of Zantac and other popular over-the-counter and prescription medications.  Metformin tablets are a staple of diabetes care, reducing excess sugar in the blood. People with Type 2 diabetes use metformin alone or with other drugs to help control their blood sugar levels. More than 34 million people in the U.S. have this disease. Patients should continue taking metformin drugs until their doctor can prescribe a replacement, the FDA said in a statement, noting the risks of discontinuing. Regulators are still assessing whether the recalls will lead to shortages of metformin, but noted that a number of other companies make generic versions of the drugs that don't appear to be affected by the issue. Drugmaker Apotex Corp. recalled its extended-release metformin distributed in the U.S. earlier this week after the FDA found contamination in one lot. Apotex said in a statement it recalled all supplies of the drug \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d The company said it stopped selling the drug in the U.S. in February 2019 and that little remains on the market. The FDA announcement did not name the four other drugmakers who have been requested to recall their products. The agency noted that no contamination problems have been found in immediate-release metformin. The FDA is responsible for ensuring that medicines for the U.S. market are made in safe, sanitary conditions that meet federal quality standards. But government inspectors have repeatedly criticized the agency for falling short in reviewing overseas manufacturing plants as the pharmaceutical supply chain has increasingly spread to Asia. In March, the FDA suspended nearly all U.S. and foreign inspections due to safety concerns and travel restrictions caused by the coronavirus outbreak. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Many technology suppliers, video publishers, and E sports stocks have seen a good boost in their stock performances. As video games may continue to consume a major portion of consumers' time, their stocks are showing some bullish patterns and presenting trading opportunities.\nHere is a list of Gaming Stocks and their performances in the year 2020.\n\nV Chart Patterns\nAs the name implies, the \"V\" chart patterns have the letter \"V\" shape and prices shift their momentum from an aggressive sell-off to aggressive rally in its structure. It is relatively a rare pattern with extreme angles and maybe not easy to recognize until it is mostly formed. The V-Pattern is a powerful reversal pattern seen in all markets, all time-frames and in all instruments.\u00a0The \"V\" pattern consists of rapid price action and may not be suited for all casual investors. The \"V\" patterns are formed when its trend is sharply switched from bearish to bullish (in case of V-Bottom) or bullish (or sideways) to bearish (in case of V-Top patterns).\nTrading V-Patterns\nThe critical aspect of the V pattern is it must have a sharp downtrend followed by a quick and sharp uptrend reversal. Look for a one- to three-bar reversals at the bottom of the pattern to signify the sharp reversal process. The volume increases during both the phases of the breakdown (down-shift momentum) and breakout (up-shift momentum). There are a few ways to trade this pattern, but the most conservative way is to trade a long entry once the pattern is complete and retraced back to the neckline (as a pullback). Aggressive traders may enter on the trendline breakouts at the bottom, but the success rate with simple trendline breakouts is low (52%) compared to the neckline breakout (64%) reaching its first target at 62% of its size from breakout level.\nKey factors to identify the pattern:\n1. Sharp Downtrend 2. Sharp Uptrend 3. V shaped Pattern (usually 1-3 bars reversals) 4. Volume increase in both breakdown and breakout phases 5. Breakout over neckline 6. Pullback to the Neckline 7. Target\nHere is a diagram of the \"V\" bottom pattern\n\nV-Pattern Examples\nThe following charts show V-Bottom pattern formations.\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA) shows a V-pattern formation from the end of January 2020 to May 2020 as the price dropped from a high of $316.30 to a low of $180. The current breakout level is $316.30. Currently, the underlying bullish trend has confirmed the breakout and V-pattern targets are set at $400-423, $451.\nTake Two Interactive (TTWO) shows a V-pattern formation from the end of January 2020 to May 2020 and shows a similar breakout like NVDA as it trades above breakout level and confirmed by underlying bullish trend. V-pattern targets are set at $154-$160.\nElectronic Arts, Inc. (EA) shows a V-pattern formation from the end of January 2020 to May 2020 as the price dropped from a high of $114.10 to a low of $85.69. EA is trading above the breakout level ($114.10) with the support underlying bullish trend. V-pattern targets are set at $131-136, $142.\n\nThe following charts show Gaming Stocks V-pattern formations: Penn National Gaming (PENN), Caesars Entertainment Co. (CZR) and Sony Corp. (SNE). \u00a0These patterns need to close above Breakout levels to produce trades. This means there may not be a signal, but you will be able to exploit it when/if it occurs.\nEach chart shows its breakout levels and potential target levels.\n\nFind more of Suri\u2019s work at\u00a0surinotes.com.\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 4 - 6, 2025\nMoneyShow Masters Symposium Dallas\nOutlook 2025: Big Market Trends, Bold Investment Ideas\n\n\nLearn More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Carter\n\n\n\n\n\nKeith Fitz-Gerald\n\n\n\n\n\nErin Gibbs\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Mahaney\n\n\n\n\n\nStephen Moore\n\n\n\n\n\nLouis Navellier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Pros\u2019 Top Picks (Daily)\nSubscribe to MoneyShow\u2019s daily investment newsletter Top Pros' Top Picks and get actionable advice from our top experts, including the hottest stocks to buy and sell, ETFs and funds for short- and long-term capital appreciation, and a wide variety of dividend-paying stocks set to deliver a steady stream of safe, reliable income.\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nToday's Featured Experts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrading Insights (Weekly)\nGet an edge on the markets with our weekly trading newsletter, Trading Insights, and receive timely trade ideas covering stocks, options, futures, and more to keep you on the right side of the action.

This helps customers avoid unnecessary cost and latency, and empower customers with the ability to manage edge devices securely and efficiently.\nYou can use AWS IoT Greengrass to extend a wide range of AWS cloud technologies to your edge devices so they can act locally on the data they generate, while still using the cloud for real-time data analytics, data storage and visualization, and training and fine-tuning machine learning models. In addition to providing technology solutions from the edge to the cloud, AWS works with a variety of device providers across the globe to provide customers with the right hardware to choose from for their particular use case.\nNVIDIA DeepStream SDK is an accelerated framework to build managed intelligent video analytics apps and services. The NVIDIA Jetson product family enables customers to extend server-class compute performance to devices operating at the edge. By using DeepStream in combination with TensorRT and CUDA on the Jetson platform , customers can build and deploy high throughput, low latency solutions.\nIn this post, we will demonstrate how you can integrate NVIDIA DeepStream on Jetson Modules with AWS IoT Services, so that you can start building innovative solutions with the AWS technologies and infrastructures to best meet your unique business requirements.\nSolution Overview\nThe objective of this post is to provide an overview on how to enable NVIDIA DeepStream Applications to publish MQTT messages to AWS IoT Core and AWS IoT Greengrass. The following diagram presents the architecture of the solution demonstrated in this post.\n\nThe following sections will walk through the following procedures to install and set up the DeepStream SDK\u2019s message broker API to publish MQTT messages to AWS IoT Core. (If you want to use your Jetson module as an AWS IoT Greengrass Aware Device, you can further refer to the last section \u201cCompatible with AWS IoT Greengrass\u201d for more details.)\n\nProcedure 1: Download AWS DeepStream adaptor\n[Optional] Procedure 2: Manually build the shared library\nProcedure 3: Provision DeepStream App with AWS IoT credentials\nProcedure 4: Transfer certificates to Jetson modules\nProcedure 5: Run Deepstream App\n\nAfter the solution walkthrough, we explain how to process IoT messages with AWS IoT Rules, and how to connect the AWS DeepStream adaptor to AWS IoT Greengrass.\n Pre-requisites\n\nAWS account admin console access\nA Jetson module with DeepStream SDK installed and internet access\nGstreamer installation as described in the NVIDIA documentation.\n\nFor the convenience of this solution walkthrough, we demonstrate how to create an environment variable of the path where your DeepStream SDK is installed. Please replace\u00a0<DeepStream SDK PATH> to the path of your DeepStream SDK on your Jetson module:\n$ export\u00a0DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH=<DeepStream SDK PATH>\nTo verify your DeepStream installation, on your Jetson module, navigate to the\u00a0${DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH}/sources/apps/sample_apps/deepstream-app\u00a0directory on the development kit, and enter this command on your terminal to run the reference application:\n$ deepstream-app\u00a0-c\u00a0<path_to_config_file>\nWhere\u00a0<path_to_config_file>\u00a0is the pathname of one of the reference application\u2019s configuration files, we recommend using ${DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH}/samples/configs/deepstream-app/source4_1080p_dec_infer-resnet_tracker_sgie_tiled_display_int8.txt\nIf\u00a0the sample app has run successfully, then you can proceed to the deployment section in this article.\u00a0 If you have trouble running this sample app, please refer to the\u00a0DeepStream SDK Development Guide\u00a0for more details on how to troubleshoot this step.\nSolution Deployment\nProcedure 1: Download AWS DeepStream adaptor\nTo download the AWS DeepStream adaptor\n\nIn your Jetson module, navigate to Downloads folder\nDownload or clone the AWS-managed GitHub repo.\nCopy the aws_protocol_adaptor sub-folder to ${DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH}/sources/libs.\n\n$ cd ~/Downloads $ git clone\u00a0git@github.com:awslabs/aws-iot-core-integration-with-nvidia-deepstream.git $ cd\u00a0aws-iot-core-integration-with-nvidia-deepstream $ cp -r aws_protocol_adaptor\u00a0${DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH}/sources/libs\n[Optional] Procedure 2: Manually build the shared library\nThe shared library (.so file) is pre-compiled and committed in the GitHub repo you cloned in Step 1 in the aws_protocol_adaptor/device_client directory. If you want to build and customize your shared library, you can follow procedure 2 to re-compile this shared library file with customized features such as optimized buffer size for incoming or outgoing MQTT messages, or TLS connection timeout values.\nTo manually build the shared library\n\nFirst create an empty directory for\u00a0the AWS IoT device SDK\u00a0library within the aws_protocol_adaptor library we cloned in procedure 1.\nNext, clone the AWS IoT device SDK in Embedded-C version 3 into this empty directory we created.\n\n$ mkdir\u00a0${DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH}/sources/libs/aws_protocol_adaptor/aws-iot-sdk $ cd {DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH}/sources/libs/aws_protocol_adaptor/aws-iot-sdk $ git clone\u00a0https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C.git .\n\nThis\u00a0AWS IoT device SDK has an external dependency on\u00a0Mbed TLS, so navigate to\u00a0aws-iot-sdk/external_libs/. And clone the existing\u00a0Mbed TLS repo in this folder:\n\n$\u00a0cd\u00a0${DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH}/sources/libs/aws_protocol_adaptor/aws-iot-sdk/external_libs/mbedTLS $\u00a0git clone https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls.git\n\nNavigate to device_client folder, and compile the shared library:\n\n$ cd\u00a0${DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH}/sources/libs/aws_protocol_adaptor/device_client $ make clean $ make\n\nIf you inspect this current folder, you should see the libnvds_aws_proto.so\u00a0file just updated.\n\nProcedure 3: Provision DeepStream App with AWS IoT Core credentials\nTo provision DeepStream App with AWS IoT Core credentials\n\nNavigate to AWS web console, and select\u00a0AWS IoT Core\u00a0service.\nOn the left-side menu, choose\u00a0Secure\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Policies.\nOn the right upper corner, select\u00a0Create.\nA window will appear to help you create a policy. \n         \nWARNING: For this demonstration, we are going to explain how to create a policy to allow a thing to access every resource with any action in AWS IoT Core. In production, as a best practice, you should specify the resource and allowed actions to ensure you\u2019re granting least privilege permissions).\n \n\n\n\nFill in the required fields, and select Create.\nOn the left-side of the AWS IoT console choose Manage->Things.\u00a0On the right upper corner, select\u00a0Create to start the process of creating a thing on AWS IoT.\n\n\n\nSelect \u201cCreate a single thing\u201d in the next dialog box.\n\n\n\nIn the proceeding window, put ds_app as name, for the purposes of this demo. Leave the rest unchanged and select Next.\nSelect Create certificate.\n\n\n\nIn the page that appears, download all of the links for the certificates we just generated for this thing.\nFor root certificate, a link redirects you to a root certificate download page. You should download Amazon Root CA1, which can also be accessed here.\nSelect the\u00a0Activate\u00a0button on this page to activate the set of certificates that you just downloaded.\n\n\n\nFinally, select\u00a0Attach Policy, and choose the policy named ds_app_policy you just created.\n\nProcedure 4: Transfer certificates to a Jetson device\nTo transfer certificates to a Jetson device\n\nNavigate to the path of your downloaded certs.\nYou should see four files in the following naming format.\n\nXXX-certificate.pem.crt XXX-private.pem.key XXX-public.pem.key AmazonRootCA1.pem\n\nYou can rename them as follows.\n\ncertificatePem.cert.pem privateKey.private.key publicKey.public.key root.ca.pem\n\nNow, make a cert folder on your Jetson module, and transfer these downloaded certificates and keys to your Jetson module. In this case, we are on the same network as our Jetson module, so we can use scp command to transfer the certificates:\n\n$ scp certificatePem.cert.pem privateKey.private.key publicKey.public.key root.ca.pem <YOUR_JETSON_IP>:${DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH}/sources/libs/aws_protocol_adaptor/device_client/certs/\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can upload them to a secure storage in the cloud to be downloaded by your Jetson module.\nNote: Once you have successfully transferred these certificates onto your Jetson module. We are going to put these certificates in the following directory for this demonstration, but you can use custom directories as long as you specify them in your cfg_aws.txt file:\n \n\n$ mkdir\u00a0${DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH}/sources/libs/aws_protocol_adaptor/device_client/certs $ mv\u00a0<4\u00a0CERTS FILES> ${DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH}/sources/libs/aws_protocol_adaptor/device_client/certs\n\nOn your Jetson module, navigate to\n\n$ cd ${DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH}/sources/libs/aws_protocol_adaptor/device_client/\u00a0\n\nEdit\u00a0cfg_aws.txt\u00a0: \n         \nReplace\u00a0<YOUR IOT HOST ADDRESS> with your AWS IoT Endpoint URL, which is located in the AWS IoT console \u2192 Settings, in the box labeled Endpoint.\n \n\n\n\nReplace\u00a0<DEEPSTREAM SDK PATH> to the absolute path of your\u00a0DeepStream\u00a0SDK\u00a0PATH.\n\nWARNING: Using relative path rather than absolute path would cause certificate parsing failure error. If this happens, you can come back to this file and edit certificate paths and restart your DeepStream application.\n \nReplace the values of both ThingName and ClientID with ds_app (to match the name of the thing we created above).\n\nProcedure 5: Run DeepStream App\nFinally, we are going to use the test apps developed by NVIDIA to verify our adaptor setup. We are going to run tests with both test4 and test5 in the NVIDIA DeepStream SDK sample app folder (${DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH}/sources/apps/sample_apps). The deepstream-test4 can be used to demonstrate adding custom objects as NVDS_EVENT_MSG_META user metadata with buffers for generating a custom payload to be published to AWS IoT Core.\u00a0The deepstream-test5 can demonstrate how to use \u201cnvmsgconv\u201d and \u201cnvmsgbroker\u201d plugins in the pipeline, create NVDS_META_EVENT_MSG type of meta, and upload to\u00a0AWS IoT Core. Both apps can help verify the installation and functionalities of this message broker.\n To use Test App 4\n\nFirst, navigate to test4 in your DeepStream SDK at ${DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH}/sources/apps/sample_apps/deepstream-test4 on your Jetson module, and build DeepStream app test 4 using \u201cmake\u201d command.\n\n$ cd\u00a0${DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH}/sources/apps/sample_apps/deepstream-test4 $ make\n\nThen, use the following command to run test4\n\n$ ./deepstream-test4-app -i ../../../../samples/streams/sample_720p.h264\u00a0-p\u00a0../../../libs/aws_protocol_adaptor/device_client/libnvds_aws_proto.so\u00a0--conn-str=hello\u00a0-c\u00a0../../../libs/aws_protocol_adaptor/device_client/cfg_aws.txt\u00a0-t test --no-display\n\nNow navigate to the AWS IoT console, and on the menu bar on the left, select test\nInput\u00a0test\u00a0(or # to receive messages on all topics) in the subscription topic box, and select\u00a0Subscribe to topic. You should see MQTT messages start to show up on the console after the app successfully runs:\n\n\n To use Test App 5\nFirst, navigate to test5 in your DeepStream SDK at ${DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH}/sources/apps/sample_apps/deepstream-test5 on your Jetson module, and build DeepStream app test 5 using \u201cmake\u201d command.\n$cd\u00a0${DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH}/sources/apps/sample_apps/deepstream-test5 $ make\n\nIn order to run deepstream-test5, open your configuration file in an editor you prefer:\n\n$cp\u00a0configs/test5_config_file_src_infer.txt\u00a0configs/test5_config_file_src_infer_aws.txt $ vim\u00a0configs/test5_config_file_src_infer_aws.txt\n\nThen, modify\u00a0msg-broker-proto-lib under your message broker sink (sink1), to point to:\n\n${DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH}/sources/libs/aws_protocol_adaptor/device_client/libnvds_aws_proto.so\nAnd also modify\u00a0msg-broker-config\u00a0under the same sink to point to: ${DEEPSTREAM_SDK_PATH}/sources/libs/aws_protocol_adaptor/device_client/cfg_aws.txt\n\nNext, modify the topic to a topic name that you choose, and modify the first sink to a fake sink.\nThen, you can use the following command to run test5:\n\n$ ./deepstream-test5-app -c configs/test5_config_file_src_infer_aws.txt\u00a0\n\nNow, navigate to AWS IoT console, and on the menu bar on the left, select Test\nInput\u00a0test\u00a0(or # to receive messages on all topics) in the subscription topic box\nChoose Subscribe to topic. You should see MQTT messages start to show up on this console after the app successfully runs:\n\n\nThis concludes the procedure for installing and setting up the DeepStream SDK\u2019s message broker API to publish MQTT messages to AWS IoT Core or AWS IoT Greengrass. Next, we will explain how you can process IoT messages with AWS IoT Rules, and how to connect the AWS DeepStream adaptor to AWS IoT Greengrass.\nProcessing IoT messages with AWS IoT Rule\nOnce you see messages coming into AWS IoT Core, there are a lot of options to further process them or store them on the AWS Cloud. One simple example would be to use AWS IoT Rules to push these messages to a customized AWS Lambda function, which parses the messages and puts them in Amazon DynamoDB.\u00a0You may find the following documents helpful in setting up this IoT rule to storage pipeline: Creating a Rule with an AWS Lambda Action\u00a0 Reading and Writing A Single Item in DynamoDB\u00a0 Implementing a Serverless AWS IoT Backend with AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB\nThe following documents may further assist you to build a production-ready AWS Data Pipeline: AWS IoT Analytics Console Quick Start Guide Integrating IoT data with your data lake with new AWS IoT Analytics features Real-Time IoT Device Monitoring with Kinesis Data Analytics Writing to Kinesis Data Firehose Using AWS IoT\nCompatible with\u00a0AWS IoT Greengrass\nThis AWS DeepStream adaptor also supports connections to AWS IoT Greengrass. You can modify\u00a0<YOUR IOT HOST ADDRESS> in\u00a0cfg_aws.txt\u00a0to your Greengrass Endpoint/IP address.\nThere are several options to find out the Greengrass Endpoint/IP address. If you know the IP address of your Greengrass device or run \u201cifconfig\u201d on your Greengrass device to find it out, you can directly put that as\u00a0<YOUR IOT HOST ADDRESS>. AWS IoT Greengrass also provides a Discovery API, which enables devices to retrieve the information required to connect to the AWS IoT Greengrass core that is in the same Greengrass group as the device.\nFor further information on enabling your device to connect to AWS IoT Greengrass, please follow module 4 in AWS IoT Greengrass developer guide.\nConclusion\nIn this post, we explained how to leverage the DeepStream SDK\u2019s message broker API to publish MQTT messages to AWS IoT Core or AWS IoT Greengrass. We walked through the process of installing the libraries, setting up the configuration files, and running sample app4 and app5 in DeepStream SDK with the libraries installed. Finally, we talked about options to further process and store the published MQTT messages on AWS Cloud. We\u2019d love to hear how you\u2019re using this integration.

The largest die the world's ever made, the largest number of transistors in a compute engine the world's ever made.\"The chip supports Multi-instance GPU, which means a single A100 can be partitioned into up to seven independent, less powerful, GPUs. Conversely, with upgraded NVLink technology for GPU to GPU connectivity, the company claims A100 servers can \"act as one giant GPU.\"Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Google Cloud, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle were among the companies announced to begin incorporating A100 GPUs into their cloud services and server designs.The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic forced Nvidia's huge GTC event in Santa Clara to be canceled, with the keynote instead delivered today from Jensen Huang's kitchen. When asked how the novel coronavirus would impact the roll-out of a new GPU, the CEO called the pandemic \"terribly tragic,\" but countered that it would be good for cloud growth and Nvidia's business.\"People are staying at home and using cloud computing a lot more than before, so the hyperscalers' compute demand has gone up tremendously. And video conferencing has gone up tremendously. Companies are realizing the importance of ensuring the continuity of work are moving a lot of their workloads to the cloud, and so that they have a hybrid computing environment. And so, cloud computing is going to see a surge.\"That surge is really quite good for our data center business and Ampere A100 is designed for data centers. It's designed to increase the throughput as well as dramatically reduce the cost of cloud computing and AI in the cloud. And so my expectation is that Ampere is going to do remarkably well. And it's our best data center GPU ever made.\"Haven't I heard that name before?Nvidia's Ampere chip has nothing to do with chip-maker Ampere, which develops an Arm chip called Ampere Altra.Both companies' products are named after French mathematician and physicist Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re, one of the founders of the science of classical electromagnetism, and inventor of the solenoid and the electrical telegraph.\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28 Apr 2020\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's $6.9bn Mellanox acquisition closes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17 Feb 2020\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's data center revenue jumps 43 percent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05 May 2020\n\n\n\n\nNvidia to acquire Cumulus Networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nNvidia Ampere\n\n\nNvidia A100\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

The first GPU to use Ampere will be Nvidia\u2019s new A100, built for scientific computing, cloud graphics, and data analytics. While there have been plenty of rumors around Nvidia\u2019s Ampere plans for GeForce \u201cRTX 3080\u201d cards, the A100 will primarily be used in data centers.Nvidia\u2019s latest data center push comes amid a pandemic and a huge increase in demand for cloud computing. Describing the coronavirus situation as \u201cterribly tragic,\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted that \u201ccloud usage of services are going to see a surge,\u201d in a press briefing attended by The Verge. \u201cThose dynamics are really quite good for our data center business ... My expectation is that Ampere is going to do remarkably well. It\u2019s our best data center GPU ever made and it capitalizes on nearly a decade of our data center experience.\u201dThe A100 sports more than 54 billion transistors, making it the world\u2019s largest 7nm processor. \u201cThat is basically at nearly the theoretical limits of what\u2019s possible in semiconductor manufacturing today,\u201d explains Huang. \u201cThe largest die the world\u2019s ever made, and the largest number of transistors in a compute engine the world\u2019s ever made.\u201dNvidia is boosting its Tensor cores to make them easier to use for developers, and the A100 will also include 19.5 teraflops of FP32 performance, 6,912 CUDA cores, 40GB of memory, and 1.6TB/s of memory bandwidth. All of this performance isn\u2019t going into powering the latest version of Assassin\u2019s Creed, though.Instead, Nvidia is combining these GPUs into a stacked AI system that will power its supercomputers in data centers around the world. Much like how Nvidia used its previous Volta architecture to create the Tesla V100 and DGX systems, a new DGX A100 AI system combines eight of these A100 GPUs into a single giant GPU.The DGX A100 system promises 5 petaflops of performance, thanks to these eight A100s, and they\u2019re being combined using Nvidia\u2019s third-generation version of NVLink. Combining these eight GPUs means there\u2019s 320GB of GPU memory with 12.4TB/s of memory bandwidth. Nvidia is also including 15TB of Gen4 NVMe internal storage to power AI training tasks. Researchers and scientists using the DGX A100 systems will even be able to split workloads into up to 56 instances, spreading smaller tasks across the powerful GPUs.Nvidia\u2019s recent $6.9 billion acquisition of Mellanox, a server networking supplier, is also coming into play, as the DGX A100 includes nine 200Gb/s network interfaces for a total of 3.6Tb/s per second of bidirectional bandwidth. As modern data centers adapt to increasingly diverse workloads, Mellanox\u2019s technology will prove ever more important for Nvidia. Huang describes Mellanox as the all-important \u201cconnecting tissue\u201d in the next generation of data centers.\u201cIf you take a look at the way modern data centers are architected, the workloads they have to do are more diverse than ever,\u201d explains Huang. \u201cOur approach going forward is not to just focus on the server itself but to think about the entire data center as a computing unit. Going forward I believe the world is going to think about data centers as a computing unit and we\u2019re going to be thinking about data center-scale computing. No longer just personal computers or servers, but we\u2019re going to be operating on the data center scale.\u201dInside Nvidia\u2019s DGX A100 system. Image: NvidiaNvidia\u2019s DGX A100 systems have already begun shipping, with some of the first applications including research into COVID-19 conducted at the US Argonne National Laboratory.\u201cWe\u2019re using America\u2019s most powerful supercomputers in the fight against COVID-19, running AI models and simulations on the latest technology available, like the Nvidia DGX A100,\u201d says Rick Stevens, associate laboratory director for Computing, Environment and Life Sciences at Argonne. \u201cThe compute power of the new DGX A100 systems coming to Argonne will help researchers explore treatments and vaccines and study the spread of the virus, enabling scientists to do years\u2019 worth of AI-accelerated work in months or days.\u201dNvidia says that Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Dell, Alibaba, and many other big cloud service providers are also planning to incorporate the single A100 GPUs into their own offerings. \u201cThe adoption and the enthusiasm for Ampere from all of the hyperscalers and computer makers around the world is really unprecedented,\u201d says Huang. \u201cThis is the fastest launch of a new data center architecture we\u2019ve ever had, and it\u2019s understandable.\u201dMuch like the larger DGX A100 cluster system, Nvidia also allows each individual A100 GPU to be partitioned into up to seven independent instances for smaller compute tasks. These systems won\u2019t come cheap, though. Nvidia\u2019s DGX A100 comes with big performance promises, but systems start at $199,000 for a combination of eight of these A100 chips.Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card. Photo by Stefan Etienne / The VergeIt\u2019s not clear how Nvidia will now progress Ampere directly into consumer-grade GPUs just yet. Nvidia introduced its Volta architecture, with dedicated artificial intelligence processors (tensor cores) in much the same way as today\u2019s Ampere unveiling. But Volta didn\u2019t go on to power Nvidia\u2019s line of GeForce consumer products. Instead, Nvidia launched a Volta-powered $2,999 Titan V (which it called \u201cthe most powerful PC GPU ever created\u201d) focused on AI and scientific simulation processing, not gaming or creative tasks.Despite rumors of Volta powering future GeForce cards, Nvidia instead introduced its Turing architecture in 2018, which combined its dedicated tensor cores with new ray-tracing capabilities. Turing went on to power cards like the RTX 2080 instead of Volta, just weeks after Huang said the next line of graphics cards wouldn\u2019t be launching for \u201ca long time.\u201d Nvidia even stripped out the RT and Tensor cores for Turing-powered cards like the GTX 1660 Ti.New \u201cRTX 3080\u201d cards could be just months away then, but we still don\u2019t know for sure if they\u2019ll be using this new Ampere architecture. \u201cThere\u2019s great overlap in the architecture, that\u2019s without a doubt,\u201d hinted Huang. \u201cThe configuration, the sizing of the different elements of the chip is very different.\u201dNvidia uses HBM memory for its data center GPUs, and that\u2019s not something the company uses for consumer PC gaming GPUs. The data center GPUs are also focused much more heavily on AI tasks and compute, than graphics. \u201cWe\u2019ll be much more heavily biased towards graphics and less towards double-precision floating point,\u201d adds Huang.Speculation around Nvidia\u2019s Ampere plans has intensified recently, and with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X set to launch with AMD-powered GPU solutions later this year, Nvidia will surely need to have something new to offer PC gamers later this year.See More: AIAmazonEntertainmentGamingGoogleMicrosoftNvidiaPC GamingTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Ford was famously quoted at the time as saying, \u201cYou can have any color as long as it\u2019s black.\u201d\nMore than a century later, BMW Group offers 40 different models, each with an average of 100 different options. If each option has at least two choices, then the factory logistics team is dealing with 2100 possible configurations they need to organize parts for \u2014 so many it would take hundreds of thousands of years to list them all out loud.\nSimultaneously, demand has significantly increased, doubling over the last 10 years to 2.5 million cars a year. BMW Group customers submit close to 10,000 new car orders a day. More than 99 percent of those vehicle orders are different from each other.\nIn other words, almost every order is custom. This means the BMW Group Factory Logistics team must take in 30 million raw parts a day, from 1,800 suppliers, at 31 different factories around the world, and organize them into custom parts trays \u2014 for every customer order.\nAssembly is happening on a line that could have up to 10 different models going through at the same time. One vehicle could be an SUV, the next a sedan, the third, a sports car. The right parts to build each needs to be organized and delivered to the correct car, just in time, just in sequence. The line outputs a new car every 56 seconds, and the line can never stop.\nBring in the Robots\nAchieving this miracle of factory logistics requires a level of accuracy and synchronization beyond what has existed previously.\nIntelligent production begins with AI-powered logistics robots. BMW Group is developing five new types of robots on the NVIDIA Isaac robotics platform, powered by NVIDIA Jetson and EGX edge computers and running on a single NVIDIA Isaac SDK software architecture. These robots are trained and validated on Isaac Sim.\nThree of these robots \u2014 the SplitBot, PickBot and PlaceBot \u2014 are responsible for placing boxes of raw parts on the line and transporting them to shelves to await production.\nThe Smart Transport Robot is an autonomous delivery navigation robot, which picks up these trays of parts and moves them to an area to be taken by a \u201ctugger train\u201d to manufacturing. STR is powered by NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, which delivers up to 32 trillion operations per second of performance for perception, pose estimation, 3D human pose estimation, localization, path planning and actuation.\nThe BMW Group Smart Transport Robot in NVIDIA Isaac Sim.\nFinally, the SortBot manipulation arm, which also runs on Jetson AGX Xavier, takes the empty boxes and puts them on a palette to be sent back to the supplier area.\nOne Scalable Architecture\nThis entire family of logistics robots was developed using a single software architecture, running on the open NVIDIA Isaac robotics platform. The Isaac SDK provides a comprehensive set of tools, libraries, reference robot applications, pre-trained DNN algorithms and TAO Toolkit to adapt the deep neural networks to different robots.\nThe robots are then tested and validated using Isaac Sim for navigation and manipulation. This virtual proving ground significantly streamlines communication as well as widens the environments in which the robots are tested to a near-infinite range of scenarios.\nThe NVIDIA Isaac robotics platform allows BMW Group to easily manage new models, brands and configurations to anticipate and meet customer demand, using leading AI technology to innovate factory logistics for the century to come.\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Embedded Computing | GTC 2020 | Industrial and Manufacturing | Isaac | Jetson | NVIDIA DGX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Otherwise known as Ampere (unless NVIDIA announces a different name for the consumer variant), the bulk of information out there right now is all related to leaks and rumors, and here is another one for the growing pile.\n\n\nAccording to YouTube channel Moore's Law Is Dead, an engineering sample of a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti sports a cooling shroud that is similar to the Founders Edition models of the GeForce RTX 20 series, but with three cooling fans and less screws on the back of the card. Assuming the YouTuber is now blowing smoke up our rear ends (and we're not ruling that out by any stretch), an engineering sample may or may not be indicative of the final product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also claims the card features a pair of 8-pin PCI Express connectors, whereas engineering samples for Turing cards supposedly had three of them. The insinuation here is that Ampere cards will use less power than their Turing counterparts. The cards also feature five I/O ports, including three DisplayPort 2.0 connectors, an HDMI 2.0 port, and a USB-C port. It's also said to feature a PCIe 4.0 interface.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti \"Ampere\" Specifications Leaked\nNow here is where things get interesting. The YouTuber says NVIDIA keeps a tight lock on what kind of data its own employees can see when working with engineering samples, but even so, his source supposedly was able to dig up some details about the GA102 GPU inside the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the leak, the full-fat GA102 is armed with 84 streaming multiprocessors and 5,376 CUDA cores. On the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti engineering sample, this is said to be paired with 12GB of memory running at 18Gbps on a 384-bit bus, yielding 864GB/s of memory bandwidth. That is a massive 40.3 percent jump over the current generation GeForce RTX 2080 Ti.\n\n\nHe also claims the card boosts to 2.2GHz, and reckons that even a cut down version would deliver 21 TFLOPS of performance, while consuming 220-230W.\n\n\nWhat this all boils down to, according to the leak, is a card that offers at least a 40 percent increase in rasterization performance at 4K, compared to the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. In addition, the YouTuber supposes the GA103 and GA104 will essentially make the CPU a bottleneck at 1080p and even 1440p gaming, with 4K becoming a \"midrange standard.\" We'll see about that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe YouTuber also talked about some other details, including ray tracing hardware. According to his engineering source, the number of RT cores may not change with Ampere, but they will be \"substantially\" more powerful than the ones used in Turing.\n\n\nTo put it into perspective, he says if someone plucked the RT cores form Ampere and injected them into Turing, then the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti would theoretically offer four times faster ray tracing performance.\n\n\nHe also says NVIDIA will be doubling the number of Tensor cores, so that lower end Ampere cards will vastly outperform higher end Turing cards in ray-traced and DLSS workloads.\n\n\nThe last bit of supposed info he shared is that Ampere will deliver a \"solid\" increase in IPC performance over Turing with double the L2 cache and higher core clocks, DLSS 3.0 will be a big upgrade over DLSS 2.0 (but \"isn't a magic performance boost\"), and the use of Tensor memory compression will effectively make a 12GB Ampere card perform like it is a 16GB card.\n\n\nIt's quite a bit to take in, and quite frankly, it could all be nonsense. Likewise, there might be some truth to the rumor. All we can do is wait and see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, (nasdaq:nvda), ampere, geforce rtx 3080 ti, geforce-rtx-3080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

Greg Corke talked with Nvidia to find out more\n\n\n\nImage courtesy of Woods Bagot\n\nA few years ago, Nvidia wowed its AEC and manufacturing customers with Holodeck, an experiment in using virtual environments for collaborative workflows. The platform was designed to bring together architects, designers and stakeholders from anywhere in the world to build and explore projects in a highly realistic, collaborative, and physically simulated VR environment.\nThe visual quality of the demonstration cars and buildings was stunning, but the 3D models represented a snapshot of a project in time. With distributed teams using many different tools, designs are constantly evolving, and a linear stepped process of import and export wasn\u2019t going to solve the real workflow challenges faced by global AEC firms. What was needed was a dynamic way for data to be shared and Nvidia looked to the visual effects industry for inspiration.\nAround the same time, Pixar brought out USD (Universal Scene Description), an open framework for the interchange of 3D computer graphics data, specifically focused on collaboration. As Richard Kerris, Industry GM for M&E at Nvidia, told AEC Magazine, USD \u201cstandardises toolsets and environments and models and all of the things that go into creating an object or an environment.\u201d\nUSD was originally designed for visual effects and animation, but it immediately started to gain traction in other industries. It provided a means of transferring files without importing or exporting, but having it happen live between applications. \u201cThat was when the team looked at what was working and was not working with Holodeck and decided that, if they standardised around USD, they could take that same approach, but now have an environment of collaboration that comes through this open standard,\u201d explains Kerris.\nHolodeck was very focused on VR, but laid the foundations for a new, much broader, collaboration platform called Omniverse, which Kerris describes as \u201cGoogle Docs for your world.\u201d\n\n\nRhino (top left) and Revit (top right), both streaming data in real time into Omniverse (bottom). Image courtesy of Woods Bagot.\n\nOmniverse essentially allows teams to work together, interactively using their 3D design tools of choice. Data from multiple applications can be seamlessly streamed into the Omniverse and the resulting asset, be it a building, product or VFX scene, can be interacted with live in a real-time, ray-traced viewport accelerated by Nvidia Quadro RTX GPUs.\nThe AEC experience\nOmniverse can serve multiple industries, including Media and Entertainment and manufacturing, but it\u2019s the AEC market that\u2019s getting the most attention, as Kerris explains. \u201cAEC, in particular, really gravitated towards us because they\u2019ve always had this strong need to collaborate, because sometimes the architectural firm is in London and the building is in Beijing, and some of the landscapers are in Shanghai and you know there\u2019s all this stuff that goes back and forth.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd so we started talking with all of the major players from Foster + Partners to KPF to Woods Bagot and we\u2019ve made them into \u2018lighthouse\u2019 accounts, meaning that they\u2019re in, and we work with them on a fairly regular basis, about how our development is going, what is important to them, how customers would use things.\u201d\nAll of this has led to the development of the Omniverse AEC Experience, which provides firms with a collection of tools designed to improve the conceptual design process. \u201cMultiple designers can work on one design at the same time and reviewers can ask for changes in real time,\u201d explains Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. There are live links or \u2018Portal connections\u2019 to the major 3D design tools, including SketchUp, Revit, and Rhino, and viz tools 3ds Max and Unreal Engine. As one would expect, there\u2019s a big emphasis on high fidelity, ray traced models and the use of photorealistic visualisation much earlier on in the design process.\nKerris is keen to point out that Nvidia is not looking to make a product out of Omniverse. He explains that one of the guiding principles is for Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) to add, embellish and do whatever they want to do with it as a platform. In the AEC space, Nvidia has been working very closely with Autodesk, McNeel, Trimble and Epic Games but is also talking to others. An SDK called Omniverse Kit is available to help ISVs gives their products a real-time, ray-traced application viewport.\n\n\n\nAccording to Andrew Rink, who leads global marketing strategy for AEC and manufacturing at Nvidia, one of the key breakthroughs Omniverse achieves is the ability to move among Revit, Rhino or SketchUp with just one click, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for data preparation or decimation to view huge models with supported photorealistic rendering software. This eliminates costly delays in translation and errors between software tools, which results in substantial time savings,\u201d he says.\n\u201cFor instance, a team iterating on concepts might have an architect making changes to the building model using Revit, while a designer in another office simultaneously adds or modifies design elements using Rhino or Trimble SketchUp. All team members, and even their client, can view these changes in real time in Omniverse as they work together and exchange feedback.\u201d\nKerris describes an example workflow where a global team is using a range of tools including Revit, Rhino, SketchUp and 3ds Max to work collaboratively on a building in China designed by KPF. Participants make changes to materials, windows and lights and various configurations within the scene. All of this is being managed in real time, across the globe.\n\u201cFor the first time they\u2019re really able to collaboratively work on an environment, not just like \u2018OK you do this come back tomorrow when we\u2019ve got that,\u2019\u201d says Kerris. \u201cWhat\u2019s really amazing is that in that platform you will see the object to build and you will see the environment, sunshine, clouds, etc. You will see photorealistic finishing and materials on the building, you\u2019ll be able to come inside to the interiors and all of this will be taking place in real time.\u201d\nTo support collaboration, users can leave notes, annotations and highlight objects. These are persistent within Omniverse. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at what other ways are best,\u201d says Kerris. \u201cIf you highlight something can it pop open a video of somebody that may not be dynamically connected at that time, but left you a Post-it Note, if you will, to say, \u2018hey move this wall.\u2019\u201d\n\n\nReal-time Collaboration: Revit, Sketchup, Rhino and Omniverse View\n\nNvidia omniverse broken down\nNvidia Omniverse features several key modules. Omniverse \u2018nucleus\u2019 coordinates all of the USD elements across the various applications, feeding into the rest of the platform. Any changes made in Revit, Rhino or another authoring tool are continually fed into Omniverse via \u2018Connector plug-ins\u2019 which create a live link. The Nucleus can run on a standard server or a VM within an Nvidia RTX Server.\nNvidia Omniverse \u2018View\u2019 provides a real time view into the Omniverse world that is being worked on. It uses Quadro RTX GPUs to provide high-quality photorealistic output of the aggregated USD model and offers basic scene and material editing capabilities as well as industry-specific features like light studies. All team members, even clients, can view changes in real time \u2013 the idea being that everyone can work together and exchange feedback. By being able to pan, zoom and rotate a photorealistic model in the viewport anyone can quickly see how light might reflect off a surface or a physically based material, such as wood or concrete, might look under various lighting conditions. \u201cThis is a tremendous help in accelerating design decisions, which leads to more time for ideating on innovative concepts and faster bid preparation,\u201d says Rink.\nNvidia Omniverse View is not the only way to view photoreal content generated on the platform, as Kerris explains, \u201cIf you want to stay in Rhino, you can feed the viewport back into the application, so we\u2019ve really created it in a way that the ISVs can take it and extend it.\u201d\nViz asset generation isn\u2019t limited to the Omniverse rendering engine. The platform is also designed to support commercial game engines and offline renderers, as Kerris explains. \u201cWe\u2019re not changing workflows, we\u2019re enhancing it, so if they go out to Unreal\u2019s Twinmotion or they go to Chaos [Group], things like that, all of those things are built to be supported by Omniverse \u2013 they\u2019re all partners.\u201d\n\n\nLeeza SOHO, Beijing by Zaha Hadid Architects\n\nPowering the Omniverse\nOmniverse View can run on a Quadro RTX desktop or mobile workstation allowing users to get an interactive viewport into the shared scene. However, the real power of the platform comes into play when using Nvidia RTX Server, a reference design available for a range of OEMs with up to eight or ten Nvidia Quadro RTX 6000 or 8000 GPUs.\nRTX Server can perform multiple roles. It not only provides buckets of processing power for real time ray tracing, but with Nvidia Quadro Virtual Data Center Workstation (Quadro vDWS) software users can access the Omniverse platform using GPU-accelerated virtual machines. It means all collaborators, including clients, can view projects in full interactive ray traced quality on low powered hardware \u2013 laptop, tablet or phone. AEC firms can also run their 3D design tools directly off RTX Server.\nGetting immersive\nNvidia Omniverse is not just for static displays \u2013 XR has a massive role to play. For example, an iPad can be used to window into an AR-based view of the building that\u2019s sitting on a dining room table, \u201cWe not only support the streaming out of it, we support AR kit and things that allow you to have location based information so that you can use the viewer for more than just a portal, but actually something to interact with,\u201d says Kerris. \u201cThe things we\u2019re doing with AR are much higher fidelity than people have ever seen before and the feedback has been phenomenal.\u201d\nVR pixel streaming is on the roadmap and there will be support through its CloudXR platform, but Kerris believes AR has a more important role to play, \u201cFrom a collaborative standpoint, the feedback has been much more positive. If you and I are collaborating on something we don\u2019t need to have our headsets on, we\u2019re literally working on a window and we can interact with it.\u201d\nNvidia Omniverse and the cloud\nThe current focus for Nvidia Omniverse is for AEC firms to use on premise hardware but there are plans to add a cloud service. \u201cWe certainly have that capability, but we\u2019re still working on how to implement that so that it\u2019s in the best experience for the customers,\u201d says Kerris. \u201cOne of the biggest points of feedback we\u2019ve had from a lot of architectural firms is \u2018we\u2019re not big IT firms, we are architects, and so we want to use cloud services like we use Netflix.\u2019\u201d\nOpen access\nOmniverse is currently being trialled by about 35 \u2018lighthouse\u2019 accounts. About a third are major architectural firms, says Kerris, but Omniverse isn\u2019t just for the larger practices, \u201cWe\u2019ve got all sizes there actually, there\u2019s an architect working on [Nvidia CEO] Jensen\u2019s house, and he got him enlisted. And then we have architects that are working on 70 storey buildings that are going to be iconic,\u201d he says.\nNow with the launch of Ominiverse AEC Experience, Nvidia is opening things up to more firms through an Early Access program. Kerris expects the number of firms to rise significantly, and not just architects. Nvidia is also starting to talk to other disciplines including structural engineers and MEP engineers.\nConclusion\nAEC firms are well served by real-time viz applications \u2013 Enscape, Twinmotion and Lumion all offer live links to the major CAD and BIM tools and some also have support for RTX \u2018real-time\u2019 ray tracing. They do a great job of putting visualisation tools into the hands of architects but are very much personal tools for the creation of viz assets or for giving real time feedback on design decisions.\nWith Omniverse, Nvidia has much bigger ambitions \u2013 to bring together design teams in a visually rich collaborative environment where industry-standard 3D tools can be used concurrently to drive the design and all stakeholders, including clients get to see the impact of those decisions, instantly. And all of this is done in a photorealistic environment where the impact of light and materials can be explored from a very early stage.\nNvidia says the initial focus is on enhancing conceptual design, which implies that in the future the platform could be used further downstream. How this would work in practice remains to be seen, as when AEC projects evolve and details become more important, clashes and constructability issues need to be resolved. This looks a step too far for Omniverse itself but something that could be handled by tight integration with a third-party product like Revizto, Navisworks or Unity Reflect, which can handle BIM metadata.\nIt\u2019s still very early days for Omniverse and there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t yet know, but we\u2019re excited to see where this technology goes and, more importantly, how the AEC firms who are helping shape its direction are getting on.\n\nKohn Pedersen Fox explores the Omniverse\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe to our email newsletter or print / PDF magazine for FREE\n\n\n\nRelated articles:Workstation reviewsLaser Scanning for verificationXinaps extends reach of AEC software throughout North AmericaAutodesk Tandem: digital twin updateWorkstation reviewsNottingham extends visualisation for city planningUnity Reflect gets Navisworks support for BIM coordinationCollaboration for Revit\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n1Share \n\n\n\nPrevious Post \n\nNext Post \n\n\n\nLeave a comment Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStay informed\nJoin the AEC community\nNewsletter \u2022 FREE digital magazine \u2022 print magazine\nGo\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLatest content \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAI and the future of arch viz\n\nFebruary 21, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWorkstation Special Report \u2013 Winter 2025\n\nFebruary 9, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMotif to take on Revit: exclusive interview\n\nFebruary 7, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAllplan acquires Manufacton to boost offsite\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nD5 Render 2.10 introduces real-time path tracing\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \u00a9 2008 - 2024 X3DMedia\r\n19 Leyden Street, London, E1 7LE, UK\r\nTel: +44(0)20 3355 7310                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Cookie Consent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.

Here\u2019s a look at the DGX A100 system, and what it may mean for the data center.\nRich MillerA powerful new NVIDIA DGX A100 system being installed in a rack at Argonne National Laboratory. (Image: NVIDIA)      Technical computing heavyweight NVIDIA has played a pivotal role in accelerating the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), providing powerful data-crunching hardware to bring AI\u2019s potential into a practical reality. This week NVIDIA unveiled a new generation of its GPU (graphics processing unit) technology designed to further shake up the world of AI computing.NVIDIA\u2019s announcements at Thursday\u2019s Virtual GTC event heralds the coming arrival of lots of power-hungry GPU hardware in data centers, offering new ways to harness AI in business and research. The new hardware announced at GTC \u2013That includes 14 data center operators who are part of NVIDIA\u2019s \u201cDGX-Ready\u201d program to host customers using the latest version of the GPU-powered \u201csupercomputer in a box.\u201d They will be on the leading edge of a movement that will bring more high-density AI hardware into the data centers, including the latest offerings from NVIDIA and Intel as well as new chips from a group of ambitious semiconductor startups.This AI arms race is one of DCF\u2019s Eight Trends That Will Shape the Data Center in 2020.\u201cAI is a hardware-intensive computing technology that will analyze data both near and far,\u201d we noted in our 2020 forecast. \u201cThat includes everything from algorithm training at cloud campuses to inference engines running on smartphones. AI can make products and services smarter. Every business yearns for that, which is why AI is emerging as a strategic priority.\u201dPower, Versatility and Lots of DensityNVIDIA says its DGX A100 system consolidates the power and capabilities of an entire data center into a single flexible platform. DGX A100 systems integrate eight of the new NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, providing 320GB of memory for training AI datasets, as well as high-speed 200Gbps interconnects from Mellanox.DGX A100 systems are available now and have begun shipping worldwide, with the first order going to the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory, which will use the cluster\u2019s AI and computing power to better understand and fight COVID-19.\u201cNVIDIA DGX A100 is the ultimate instrument for advancing AI,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA DGX is the first AI system built for the end-to-end machine learning workflow \u2013 from data analytics to training to inference. And with the giant performance leap of the new DGX, machine learning engineers can stay ahead of the exponentially growing size of AI models and data.\u201dThe NVIDIA A100 is a new GPU based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, and can unify AI training and inference on a single device. (Photo: NVIDIA)A key feature is the ability to partition the DGX A100 into as many as 56 instances per system, allowing multiple workloads to run in parallel on the system \u2013 including AI training and inference workloads that previously used dedicated hardware. Combining these capabilities enables enterprises to optimize computing power and applications on a single, fully integrated, software-defined platform.NVIDIA DGX A100 systems start at $199,000. That\u2019s not cheap, but the company argues that these powerful systems offer better economics when it comes to the bang for the buck, and the value of AI.The DGX A100 system takes up 6 rack units, allowing users to put up to 5 in a single data center rack. Huang says that $1 million rack can do the work of a typical data center with 600 CPU systems costing over $11 million.Each DGX A100 unit can require as much as 6.5 kilowatts (kW) of power, meaning that five-unit rack would need to support between 28 kW and 32.5 kW of power density.The Data Center ImplicationsThese eye-popping specs and capabilities have implications for the data center, especially since AI-driven higher rack densities can prompt a shift to liquid cooling. Not every data center can support these densities, especially on-premises facilities which were likely designed and built in an era of much lower rack power densities.\u201cWe routinely hear from executives who want to get away from physical IT infrastructure management and the associated capital expenditures, but they have concerns about the ability to securely leverage next-gen technologies,\u201d said Avner Papouchado, CEO of ServerFarm.Papouchado said that as part of NVIDIA\u2019s DGX Ready program, \u201cwe\u2019re staying ahead of the curve and investing in the technologies needed to manage today and tomorrow\u2019s workloads.\u201dThe DGX-Ready Data Center partners program offers colocation services in more than 122 locations across 26 countries for customers seeking facilities to host their DGX A100 infrastructure in \u201cvalidated, world-class data center facilities,\u201d the company says.\u201cOur customers use AI to drive their business transformation, but don\u2019t always have facilities designed to meet the unique demands of AI workloads in their data center,\u201d said Tony Paikeday, director of product marketing for DGX systems at NVIDIA.Data center participants include many of largest service providers, as well as operators that specialize in supporting high-density workloads.Here\u2019s a look at the U.S. DGX-Ready roster:Digital Realty provides an example of how data center operators are leveraging their partnerships with NVIDIA. Digital Realty created a DataHub design optimized for AI hardware and machine learning workloads as part of its recent PlatformDIGITAL rollout.\u00a0 The Data Hub footprint is based on typical customer deployment scenarios on NVIDIA DGX configurations,\u00a0 and designed to integrate seamlessly with enterprise storage solutions from class-leading providers.\u201cCustomers today need AI infrastructure that can break through data barriers and power the digital enterprise,\u201d said Chris Sharp, CTO, Digital Realty. \u201cAs an NVIDIA DGX-Ready Data Center Program partner, Digital Realty provides customers with globally focused, unified data center services, coupled with extensive design and construction expertise, giving them the launch pad needed to achieve their AI and digital transformation goals.\u201dCyrusOne is also seeking to optimize the process of deploying DGX A100 gear in their data centers, saying it \u201cfinds itself sitting at the epicenter of this data gravity.\u201d\u201cAs AI systems continue to grow in complexity, size and power, a new generation of power-efficient computing hardware and underlying data center cooling capabilities are required to handle this level of density and scale,\u201d said John Gould, Chief Commercial Officer at CyrusOne. \u201cAs we move into this new decade, data centers will continue to be an essential infrastructure to enable AI, machine learning, and help companies unleash the full potential of this technology.\u201dThe Next Chapter in NVIDIA\u2019s JourneyNVIDIA\u2019s GPU technology has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the rise of specialized computing, gaining traction with workloads in supercomputing, artificial intelligence (AI) and connected cars. NVIDIA has been investing heavily in innovation in AI, which it sees as a pervasive technology trend that will bring its GPU technology into every area of the economy and society.NVIDIA was founded in 1993, and its graphics processing units (GPUs) quickly became an essential tool for gamers yearning for more horsepower. The company\u2019s GPUs worked with CPUs, but took a slightly different approach to processing data. A CPU consists of a few cores optimized for sequential serial processing, while a GPU has a parallel architecture consisting of hundreds or even thousands of smaller cores designed for handling multiple tasks simultaneously.Underscoring the growing importance of data center networking, NVIDIA recently acquired networking specialist Mellanox in a $6.9 billion deal.NVIDIA today announced new offerings for its EGX Edge AI platform, designed to offer distributed computing horsepower for hospitals, stores, farms and factories that must manage growing amounts of data streaming from edge sensors. The platform makes it possible to securely deploy, manage and update fleets of servers remotely. New products include the EGX A100\u00a0for larger commercial off-the-shelf servers and the tiny\u00a0EGX Jetson Xavier NX for micro-edge servers.The flagship early customer for the DGX A100 line is the Argonne National Laboratory with a timely project illustrating the value of accelerating AI workloads.\u201cWe\u2019re using America\u2019s most powerful supercomputers in the fight against COVID-19, running AI models and simulations on the latest technology available, like the NVIDIA DGX A100,\u201d said Rick Stevens, associate laboratory director for Computing, Environment and Life Sciences at Argonne. \u201cThe compute power of the new DGX A100 systems coming to Argonne will help researchers explore treatments and vaccines and study the spread of the virus, enabling scientists to do years\u2019 worth of AI-accelerated work in months or days.\u201d About the Author Rich MillerI write about the places where the Internet lives, telling the story of data centers and the people who build them.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Straight talk from Moor Insights & Strategy tech industry analystsFollow AuthorMay 14, 2020, 09:00am EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.Figure 1: NVIDIA shared performance comparisons across a range of precisions. Note the huge ... [+] performance increase for sparse matrix operations.  Note the banks of 6 HBM chips.NVIDIA\nWhile many of us missed watching Jensen Huang on stage in his trademark leather jacket, he did not disappoint his on-line audience at the virtual GTC Keynote this week. In a session lasting over two and a half hours, the CEO and founder of NVIDIA announced new hardware to fend off a slew of potential competitors and new software to open up lucrative markets for GPU acceleration. The cornerstone of the announcement was the new Ampere GPU architecture, with the flagship A100 platform available through practically all hardware and cloud channels. Let\u2019s take a deeper dive into the announcement and consider the implications for AI and NVIDIA, and even AMD.\n\n\nStar of the show: the Ampere A100 GPU\n\nAlmost exactly three years ago, NVIDIA launched its Volta architecture and the V100 GPU with Tensor Cores, which dramatically accelerated performance for FP32 and FP16 tensor operations used in training AI deep neural networks (DNNs). Rarely does a new technology maintain market leadership for that long, but the V100 remained the industry\u2019s flagship AI chip, until now.\n\nNVIDIA released surprisingly few details about the A100. However, the 7nm chip, with over 54 billion transistors, appears to break the mold in performance, as measured in TOPS. Furthermore, it is already in \u201cfull production,\u201d and is available now in a new 5 Petaflop NVIDIA DGX A100 server. The A100 GPU will soon be available from practically every server OEM and cloud service provider, according to NVIDIA. Here are a few highlights:\n\nFigure 1: NVIDIA shared performance comparisons across a range of precisions. Note the huge ... [+] performance increase for sparse matrix operations.  Note the banks of 6 HBM chips.NVIDIA\n\n\nThe new 3rd generation Tensor Cores can process data in a variety of floating point and integer precisions, an important feature in the mixed-precision work that is beginning to dominate AI processing. The new \u201cFT32\u201d precision can increase performance by a factor of ten over the V100, and up to twenty-fold when processing sparse matrices exploiting what NVIDIA calls structural sparcity (common in many AI applications). NVIDIA\u2019s performance comparisons can be seen in the figure below, though I would note that these are based on TOPS (trillions of operations per second), not real-world applications or benchmarks such as mlperf (which I suspect will be forthcoming later this year).\nThe new DGX A100 features the 3rd generation NVLink, which doubles inter-chip network bandwidth, and 6 NVSwitch modules. NVIDIA didn\u2019t mention this, but the slide Jensen shared clearly states that DGX sports dual AMD Rome EPYC CPUs. That would mark the first time NVIDIA has collaborated with its primary GPU competitor, to get access to the great I/O, memory and computational bandwidth of the 2nd gen AMD EPYC CPU.\n\u00a0Finally, the new A100 has something called \u201cmulti-instance GPU,\u201d or MIG. This allows the chip to act like up to seven distinct GPUs. This could be great for Cloud Service Providers, as they can price the A100 as a single GPU and scale up for big training jobs. They could also employ a smaller farm of MIGs for inference processing, reducing the need for a lot of smaller GPUs, and simplifying their infrastructure.\n\n\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\nFigure 2: The new DGX A100 has a little surprise in addition to the 8 GPUs and 6 NVSitches: it comes ... [+] with dual AMD ROME EPYC CPUs, not Intel Xeons.NVIDIA\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more\nOf course, NVIDIA is also updating its venerated CUDA-X software stack with new versions of over 50 CUDA-X libraries for graphics, simulation and AI. That is just table stakes. However, NVIDIA went beyond that with a few other announcements. First and foremost, it announced support for accelerating Apache SPARK, the industry\u2019s largest open-source data analytics platform. This move opens up a huge market for NVIDIA GPUs, extending the company\u2019s role in the data center from exclusively AI, HPC and graphics workloads, to the broad market for data analytics.\n\n\nJensen also announced two new AI services frameworks to address growing market opportunities. The first is \u201cJarvis,\u201d named after the gregarious \u201cJust A Rather Very Intelligent System\u201d from Marvel\u2019s Iron Man and Avenger movie series. Conversational AI is the next big frontier in AI, allowing computers to better understand and communicate with their human counterparts. Led in part by Microsoft and Baidu, the performance and memory capacity of the A100 could be an ideal platform for natural language interfaces. Jarvis simplifies the development and deployment of conversational AI on the A100.\nThe second framework is called Merlin, and it eases development of recommender systems on NVIDIA GPUs. Recommendation engines are potentially another big market for NVIDIA, as every e-commerce and social networking site has huge farms of CPUs to recommend products and services from massive data lakes. This vast quantity of user data has made the internet and online shopping a personalized service\u2014now GPUs can be used to accelerate the process.\nConclusions\nAs usual, Jensen Huang\u2019s GTC keynote was a tour de force of hardware and software innovations that likely left most of the audience breathless. Like the V100 from 2017, the A100 appears to surpass even the most optimistic expectations of many industry observers. In fact, this is NVIDIA\u2019s first launch that featured commitments from practically every OEM and cloud vendor to support the chip right out of the gate. We await real-world benchmarks to properly assess NVIDIA\u2019s claims, and the volume shipments necessary to provide the yields needed to meet demand for such a huge chip. However, the early commitments from the industry\u2019s major players, including Google, AWS, Microsoft, Alibaba, Dell, Lenovo, HPE and many others, are an excellent indicator that this architecture will be a boon to the AI, HPC and Analytics markets. Furthermore, it also stands to form a powerful platform for robotics, autonomous vehicles and graphics. These topics will be covered further by my Moor Insights & Strategy colleagues Patrick Moorhead and Anshel Sag\u2014stay tuned.\nDisclosure:\u00a0Moor Insights & Strategy, like all research and analyst firms, provides or has provided research, analysis, advising and/or consulting to many high-tech companies in the industry, including Intel\u00a0and NVIDIA.

Featuring 20 times the performance of its predecessor, the Volta GPU, Ampere ushers in a new era of high-performance computing, being the first GPU in the world to deliver a peak compute power of greater than 1 Peta-Ops per second for AI/DNN.\nNVIDIA Unveils The Worlds Largest 7nm GPU, The Ampere GA100 GPU - Powering The Tesla A100 With 54 Billion Transistors and Up To 96 GB Undisputed & Fastest HBM2 Memory\nPowered by the next-generation Ampere GPU architecture, the Tesla A100 is an impressive board for the HPC market. The first thing that we have to talk about any HPC GPU is its specs & Ampere is a monster of a chip. NVIDIA went all out with\u00a0 7nm process node, making GA100 the largest 7nm chip in production but that's not all, it's also the most advanced and feature-pack chip in the industry as of right now.\nRelated Story Ampere Intros AmpereOne Aurora SOC, Up To 512 Cores, 3x Performance Increase & Compatible With Air-CoolingThe Ampere GA100 GPU is once again based on a bleeding-edge 7nm process node and has a gargantuan count of 54 Billion transistors packed within it. The chip is expected to pack 128 SM units, equalling a total of 8192 CUDA cores. That alone is a 50% increase in the total number of cores. For memory, we are looking at six HBM stacks that point out a 6144-bit bus interface. The memory dies are definitely from Samsung who has been NVIDIA's strategic memory partner for HPC-centric GPUs.\nNVIDIA's Ampere GA100 GPU is a massive chip featuring 54 billion transistors. (Image Credits: EETimes via Videocardz)\nSamsung has recently announced its HBM2E DRAM which features 16 Gb dies. Depending on the height of the stacks, NVIDIA could offer anywhere from 48 GB (4-hi) to all the way up to 96 GB (8-Hi) which is just insane amounts of VRAM compared to the existing Tesla V100 which maxes out at 32 GB. The HBM2E stacks also deliver increased speeds of up to 3.2 Gbps, allowing for up to 410 GB/s bandwidth or 2.5 TB/s bandwidth or even faster if NVIDIA decides to go for the 4.2 Gbps dies that will result in 3.2 TB/s bandwidth for the entire chip which is an amazing technical feat.\nIn terms of performance, the Ampere GA100 GPU delivers 1 Peta-OPs which is a 20x increase over the Volta GV100 GPU. The double-precision performance is rated at 2.5x higher over NVIDIA's Volta GV100 GPU which should end up somewhere around 20 TFLOPs FP64 since Volta features around 8 TFLOPs FP64 compute power. This would mean that the single-precision performance is rated at over 40 TFLOPs (FP32) which would be mind-blowing for the HPC segment.\nNVIDIA HPC / AI GPUs\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Tesla Graphics CardNVIDIA B200NVIDIA H200 (SXM5)NVIDIA H100 (SMX5)NVIDIA H100 (PCIe)NVIDIA A100 (SXM4)NVIDIA A100 (PCIe4)Tesla V100S (PCIe)Tesla V100 (SXM2)Tesla P100 (SXM2)Tesla P100\n(PCI-Express)Tesla M40\n(PCI-Express)Tesla K40\n(PCI-Express)\n\n\n\n\nGPUB200H200 (Hopper)H100 (Hopper)H100 (Hopper)A100 (Ampere)A100 (Ampere)GV100 (Volta)GV100 (Volta)GP100 (Pascal)GP100 (Pascal)GM200 (Maxwell)GK110 (Kepler)\n\n\nProcess Node4nm4nm4nm4nm7nm7nm12nm12nm16nm16nm28nm28nm\n\n\nTransistors208 Billion80 Billion80 Billion80 Billion54.2 Billion54.2 Billion21.1 Billion21.1 Billion15.3 Billion15.3 Billion8 Billion7.1 Billion\n\n\nGPU Die SizeTBD814mm2814mm2814mm2826mm2826mm2815mm2815mm2610 mm2610 mm2601 mm2551 mm2\n\n\nSMs160132132114108108808056562415\n\n\nTPCs806666575454404028282415\n\n\nL2 Cache SizeTBD51200 KB51200 KB51200 KB40960 KB40960 KB6144 KB6144 KB4096 KB4096 KB3072 KB1536 KB\n\n\nFP32 CUDA Cores Per SMTBD128128128646464646464128192\n\n\nFP64 CUDA Cores / SMTBD128128128323232323232464\n\n\nFP32 CUDA CoresTBD16896168961459269126912512051203584358430722880\n\n\nFP64 CUDA CoresTBD16896168961459234563456256025601792179296960\n\n\nTensor CoresTBD528528456432432640640N/AN/AN/AN/A\n\n\nTexture UnitsTBD528528456432432320320224224192240\n\n\nBoost ClockTBD~1850 MHz~1850 MHz~1650 MHz1410 MHz1410 MHz1601 MHz1530 MHz1480 MHz1329MHz1114 MHz875 MHz\n\n\nTOPs (DNN/AI)20,000 TOPs3958 TOPs3958 TOPs3200 TOPs2496 TOPs2496 TOPs130 TOPs125 TOPsN/AN/AN/AN/A\n\n\nFP16 Compute10,000 TFLOPs1979 TFLOPs1979 TFLOPs1600 TFLOPs624 TFLOPs624 TFLOPs32.8 TFLOPs30.4 TFLOPs21.2 TFLOPs18.7 TFLOPsN/AN/A\n\n\nFP32 Compute90 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs800 TFLOPs156 TFLOPs\n(19.5 TFLOPs standard)156 TFLOPs\n(19.5 TFLOPs standard)16.4 TFLOPs15.7 TFLOPs10.6 TFLOPs10.0 TFLOPs6.8 TFLOPs5.04 TFLOPs\n\n\nFP64 Compute45 TFLOPs34 TFLOPs34 TFLOPs48 TFLOPs19.5 TFLOPs\n(9.7 TFLOPs standard)19.5 TFLOPs\n(9.7 TFLOPs standard)8.2 TFLOPs7.80 TFLOPs5.30 TFLOPs4.7 TFLOPs0.2 TFLOPs1.68 TFLOPs\n\n\nMemory Interface8192-bit HBM45120-bit HBM3e5120-bit HBM35120-bit HBM2e6144-bit HBM2e6144-bit HBM2e4096-bit HBM24096-bit HBM24096-bit HBM24096-bit HBM2384-bit GDDR5384-bit GDDR5\n\n\nMemory SizeUp To 192 GB HBM3 @ 8.0 GbpsUp To 141 GB HBM3e @ 6.5 GbpsUp To 80 GB HBM3 @ 5.2 GbpsUp To 94 GB HBM2e @ 5.1 GbpsUp To 40 GB HBM2 @ 1.6 TB/s\nUp To 80 GB HBM2 @ 1.6 TB/sUp To 40 GB HBM2 @ 1.6 TB/s\nUp To 80 GB HBM2 @ 2.0 TB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 1134 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 900 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 732 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 732 GB/s\n12 GB HBM2 @ 549 GB/s24 GB GDDR5 @ 288 GB/s12 GB GDDR5 @ 288 GB/s\n\n\nTDP700W700W700W350W400W250W250W300W300W250W250W235W\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's Ampere GA100 also features a new Tensor operation compute indicator known as Tensor Float 32 or TF32 which is based on the 3rd Generation Tensor Cores, offering higher AI/DNN core output.

That system, called Lung Doc \u2013 pneumonia edition, has already been rolled out to 30 hospitals in China over the past few months, where it will grow more accurate as it learns from more data.\nPowered by NVIDIA GPUs, the system is proving so effective, according to Zheng, that Shukun is working on beefing it up for use in the many other countries that have inquired about using it.\nSuper-Charging Radiologists\nPrior to Lung Doc, the three-year-old company had introduced two suites of products focused on heart ailments and strokes. At its essence, Shukun\u2019s technology serves a very specific and valuable function: Shortening the time radiologists spend reconstructing and analyzing 2D and 3D images, and making diagnoses based on their findings.\nTypically, these tasks require about a half-hour of a skilled radiologist\u2019s time. But radiologists use varying techniques and approaches, so some take longer. Shukun\u2019s AI adds consistency and speed, requiring just a minute to perform both the reconstruction and diagnosis processes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very efficient tool that helps radiologists deliver quicker, more accurate results,\u201d said Zheng.\nLittle public data is available for life-threatening diseases, so in building its AI models, Shukun has turned to a vast network of hospital, academic and research partners to obtain private datasets totaling more than 100,000 cases, each of which typically contains 200-300 images.\nAs the company has worked on its models, it\u2019s relied on blending imaging data to support segmentation and classification work. Transfer learning has helped speed the development process by applying lessons from one disease across others.\nGPUs Delivering Results\nNVIDIA GPUs have played a critical role for Shukun, which is a member of\u00a0NVIDIA Inception, a virtual accelerator program that enables early-stage companies with fundamental tools, expertise and go-to-market support. A combination of NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core and P100 GPUs (more than 500 in all) are used for training, while NVIDIA T4 data center GPUs handle inference locally. The company can set up hospitals to run the system completely on premises or in a private cloud-like environment.\nZheng said each of these GPUs is delivering 20 times the performance of previous generations of GPUs and CPUs, and heart disease and stroke products have achieved accuracy rates that rival human detection abilities.\nWhile future GPUs are expected to continue speeding up the training process, and thus ultimately the accuracy, Zheng said that a federated learning model, with hospitals and Shukun\u2019s data centers all exchanging data in real time, would help the company\u2019s cause.\nFor now, Shukun has to work with each hospital individually to obtain fresh data, and connectivity at individual facilities is often an issue. If each hospital could be connected to a federated data model, only local training would be required for them to access all the data flowing through Shukun\u2019s network of partners.\nIn Pursuit of Federated Data\nShukun\u2019s heart and stroke products are deployed in more than 200 hospitals throughout China. Many of these hospitals have already fully integrated the company\u2019s AI into their radiology and imaging departments, while some are choosing to invest a month or two in clinical trials before using the technology with live patient data.\nAs Shukun adds more data and builds its federated model, it plans to expand its horizons to tackle more diseases and modalities. For instance, it would like to develop MRI solutions, which would then open the door to introducing its AI in more clinical settings.\nThe company is also investigating the NVIDIA Clara application framework for its federated learning capabilities, which let researchers and data scientists collaborate on AI algorithms, while keeping data private and secure.\nSaid Zheng: \u201cWe plan to spread AI throughout the medical community.\u201d\nIn the meantime, the company will continue doing its part to help the world move closer to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | COVID-19 | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | NVIDIA Clara | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We\u2019re taking a look at most of what was announced, including, of course, a look at the company\u2019s new top-end data center GPU: the Ampere-based A100. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs planned, NVIDIA released its belated GTC 2020 keynote online earlier, and it\u2019s a reminder that we\u2019re living in really interesting times. Rather than a live broadcast, everything posted has been prerecorded, straight from Jensen\u2019s home (specifically: the kitchen) in California.\nJensen starts his keynote off by thanking everyone involved in the fight against COVID-19, from doctors to truck drivers. He goes on to mention that NVIDIA has been working heavily with scientists around the world to enhance containment, mitigation, treatment, and ultimately, tracking and monitoring. He boasts that with NVIDIA tech, Oxford was able to sequence the virus genome in a meager seven hours.\n\nAnd that right there is why this GTC comes at a good time. If someone didn\u2019t understand the importance of computing in the fight against diseases, chances are good that COVID-19 has opened their eyes. When the pandemic creeped up, unparalleled efforts around the world instantly focused on battling this virus. NVIDIA has long talked about using its GPUs for this very purpose, so it has reason to gloat here.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Ampere-based A100 & DGX A100\nWithout wasting time, let\u2019s get right to what most people reading this will be curious about: NVIDIA\u2019s new graphics hardware. As expected, the latest flagship architecture is Ampere, and following tradition, it\u2019s led to an \u201cA100\u201d GPU:\n\nLike the Pascal-based P100 and Volta-based V100 before it, the Ampere-based A100 is designed from the ground up for the data center. The A100 becomes NVIDIA\u2019s first 7nm GPU, built at TSMC, and it utilizes third-gen Tensor cores, NVLink, and NVSwitch.\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA P100\nNVIDIA V100\nNVIDIA A100\n\n\nTransistors\n15.3 billion\n21.1 billion\n54 billion\n\n\nDie Size\n610 mm2\n815 mm2\n826 mm2\n\n\nSMs\n56\n80\n108\n\n\nTensor Cores\nN/A\n672\n432\n\n\nPeak Tensor TFLOPS\nN/A\n125\n312\n\n\nFP64 CUDA Cores\n1,792\n2,560\n3,456\n\n\nFP64 Performance\n5.3 TFLOPS\n7.8 TFLOPS\n9.7 TFLOPS\n\n\nFP32 CUDA Cores\n3,584\n5,120\n6,912\n\n\nFP32 Performance\n10.6 TFLOPS\n15.7 TFLOPS\n19.5 TFLOPS\n\n\nMemory Density\n16GB HBM2\n16GB HBM2\n40GB HBM2\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n732 GB/s\n900 GB/s\n1,555 GB/s\n\n\n\nNVIDIA has a few technologies that have gone into the A100 worth talking about, right down to the die. With TSMC, NVIDIA has built a design around CoWoS (chip-on-wafer-on-substrate) packaging, which puts the memory and GPU on the same substrate, delivering the fastest possible access between them. With its improvements, the effective memory bandwidth jumps from 900 GB/s on the V100 to roughly 1.6 TB/s on the A100.\nAs mentioned, this design also brings forth the third-generation of Tensor cores, which introduces TF32 (TensorFloat32). With it,\u00a0any FP32 code imported can be processed as FP16, all without code changes. In an example between V100 and A100, the new Ampere card processed its matrix operations six times quicker.\n\nAlso new is sparsity, a feature that can effectively boost performance by 2x. It works by taking an original dense network, zeroing out all of the small weights, and then retrain with the same data structure and pipeline. As the above chart shows, it\u2019s not just one type of computation that benefits from this sparsity feature, but many.\nThe ultimate top-end performance metric for the A100 is 1.25 POPS \u2013 or 1,248 TOPS, representing INT4 (before sparsity), with INT8 half that. You can just imagine how much performance would be available to those equipped with a new A100 compute platform, which comes complete with 8 of the new top-end GPU.\n\nAccording to Jensen, this A100 platform board weighs 50lbs, sports 600GB/s NVLink connections, six NVSwitches, one million drill holes, over 1 kilometre of traces, and over 30,000 individual components. With eight of these A100 GPUs, you\u2019d have a total of 320GB of 1.6 TB/s memory, and 55,296 CUDA cores.\n\u201cMIG\u201d, or \u201cMulti-instance GPU\u201d, is another technology introduced with the A100. With it, one GPU can be split up into (up to) seven separate interfaces, allowing multiple users to take advantage of the same hardware to process their workloads. This is useful for cloud instances where such partitioning could end up reducing the cost-per-user.\nA MIG demo consisted of inference on a collection of bird sounds, working to detect which chirp came from which type of bird, with super high accuracy. While that operation on a full A100 is incredibly fast, using MIG to separate one card into seven instances of a GPU will largely deliver the overall inference performance of a V100 to just one of the MIGs\u00a0in this particular test. With V100, the example showed about 80 queries per second, while with a full A100, that jumped to over 500.\nNaturally, that big platform board pictured above needs to be put into an actual usable platform, so that\u2019s going to become the new DGX A100, offering 5 PFLOPS of total AI performance.\n\nIn addition to the six NVSwitches, the DGX A100 includes nine Mellanox ConnectX-6 HDR 200Gbps NICs and in-network acceleration engines, 15TB of internal PCIe 4.0 SSDs, and dual processors. Those processors happen to be 64-core AMD EPYC 7742, offering a total of 256 threads to the system. Because those CPUs also need to breathe, there\u2019s a healthy 1TB of system RAM. All of this can be yours for $199,999 \u2013 and remember: \u201cThe more you buy, the more you save\u201d.\nHere\u2019s the Ampere A100 GPU once it\u2019s slapped onto an EGX (Edge Computing) card, which has also been announced today:\n\nThis isn\u2019t your average GPU, to say the least. The chip seen to the left is Mellanox\u2019s ConnectX-6 DX, which offers dual 100Gbps Ethernet or InfiniBand connections. If it wasn\u2019t clear to you why NVIDIA acquired Mellanox by now, a picture like that should make it obvious. Installing this into a server turns it into a hyper-converged AI powerhouse, or as Jensen puts it, \u201can entire cloud data center in one box\u201d.\n\nOne example of this A100 card\u2019s use is in robotics, as the processing horsepower is unparalleled, as is its networking capabilities. BMW has already gotten on board with NVIDIA\u2019s Isaac platform, with plans to \u201cbuild the factory of the future\u201d. That at the very least means there will be many robots making the rounds throughout the process of building a Bimmer. Considering the amount of models and individual options that a carmarker like BMW offers, it\u2019s easy to understand why the help of robots, and increased automation in general, could prove to be a boon for this kind of environment.\nMellanox, Mellanox, Mellanox\nThe very first product Jensen showed off in NVIDIA\u2019s series of videos wasn\u2019t actually the Ampere-based A100 that everyone has been most hyped over, but instead a new Mellanox Spectrum 4000-series Ethernet switch. Each of the ports on this switch can scale up to 400Gbps, which is rather incredible when you consider most home users are still stuck on 1Gbps, or 10Gbps at the high-end.\n\nWith this switch, data buffering is used to meter the bandwidth across the entire unit, so that each port gets their fair share of resources, while virtualization can be used to spread VX LAN throughout an environment. A third feature talked about is \u201cWJH\u201d (What Just Happened), which uses advanced telemetry to better diagnose networking problems.\nInside of this beastly switch is a Mellanox BlueField-2 programmable NIC, which is an example of a third processor that has officially become integral to moving massive amounts of data around. For general compute, there\u2019s the CPU, while for accelerated compute, there\u2019s the GPU. For network? We have the DPU, or \u201cData Processing Unit\u201d, responsible for moving data as quickly as possible throughout a data center.\nDLSS & Ray Tracing\nJensen talked about the progress its DLSS (deep-learning super-sampling) technology has made since its unveiling alongside the RTX launch in late 2018. Ultimately, resolution has vastly improved, enabling a 1080p DLSS render to look even sharper than native 1080p \u2013 or so is the claim (that we need to test soon). Ray tracing is also brought up, as Minecraft has been updated to support both technologies in unison, allowing players to roam an environment with completely realistic lighting. Just be warned: you\u2019re going to want a powerful GPU.\n\nSpeaking of powerful GPU, a single Quadro RTX 8000 powered a Marbles RTX demo that looked stunning. A player takes control of different marbles, rolling them around the environment to ultimately reach an end goal. Marble Madness of old definitely comes to mind, and if we had have seen these graphics back then, we probably would have literally lost our minds.\n\nThe important thing to note with this demo is that absolutely everything is in real-time. The lighting isn\u2019t baked-in, but instead driven through ray tracing, and the end result is hugely convincing. The physics are likewise realistic, and all we could really think during the demo is that we\u2019d very much like to try it.\nTying into the ray tracing aspect a little bit, NVIDIA also announced Omniverse today, which is a full platform for collaboration in creative or industrial design. The base of Omniverse consists of an RTX server, which can use a virtual server to dole out resources to everyone according to needs. Because collaboration is the name of the game here, users tackling different projects can all work on the same server, and share assets and content easily. NVIDIA calls these environments \u201cportals\u201d, a shared world that should speed up development time (and perhaps improve sanity?)\n\nNVIDIA so far has added Adobe, Autodesk, Pixar, Rhinoceros, SideFX, Trimble, Unreal Engine, and Unity to its Omniverse partners list, so the support from the get-go is quite strong here.\nGPU-accelerated Datasets with Spark\nThe funny thing about technology is that what seems mind-blowing today may not seem so mind-blowing in just a few years. When it was released, the Pascal-powered Tesla P100 was a screamer of a GPU, and really, it still is. But with the introduction of Tensor cores, you really need to go current-gen if you want the best possible performance, and not to mention the best efficiency.\nWhen it comes to big data, bottlenecks have changed a little bit over the years. Today, the amount of data that has to be processed in large projects is simply incredible, and NVIDIA believes that today\u2019s biggest bottleneck in server crunching is the CPU. When a CPU has tens of megabytes of cache whereas a GPU can have tens of gigabytes, workloads that can go on the GPU probably should. While any on-die cache is going to be quicker than external memory, CPU-bound memory will not be as fast as NVIDIA\u2019s on-substrate HBM2.\n\nThe upcoming release of the hugely popular Apache Spark (3.0) is going to see to it that GPUs start working on more unique workloads, as it\u2019s going to become GPU-aware, and can use its scheduler to smartly partition work across the entire system. Part of this is made possible by another team effort with Mellanox: GPU direct storage. With it, the IO is accelerated, vastly reducing bottlenecks in multi-node systems.\nHardware is just one part of this whole equation, but software is just as important. NVIDIA\u2019s updated its RAPIDS libraries to work with Spark 3.0 to ensure ultimate efficiency, as it\u2019s able to intercept queries and direct them accordingly.\nWith all of this put into place, NVIDIA says that you can deliver better performance with RAPIDS at 1/5th the cost, and 1/3rd the power, versus a typical competitor, and we all know what that means. \u201cThe more you buy, the more you save.\u201d Databricks is a use-case mentioned, as it was built entirely around Spark to manage massive datasets, and as a service that spins up a literal million virtual machines a day, it\u2019s a good nod to NVIDIA to see it backing these efforts. Other platforms that are joining in on this bandwagon include Amazon SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning, and Google\u2019s Cloud AI and Cloud Dataproc.\nNVIDIA Merlin Recommender Acceleration\nSomething we bump into pretty much every day are \u201crecommenders\u201d. If you\u2019re a Spotify user, you\u2019ll see suggested playlists and songs. On Netflix, you\u2019ll be suggested shows similar to what you and other users with similar interests are likely to enjoy. In other uses, recommenders could be used for healthcare therapy suggestions, and for automation throughout a sales process.\nThe problem with recommenders is that they are extremely complex, and that\u2019s something NVIDIA naturally wants to help with. So, it\u2019s created Merlin, a complete framework that allows people to easily create dataframes that can process tens or hundreds of terabytes of data, with all partitioning and scaling done automatically.\n\nIt\u2019s being touted that you can write just a few lines of code with NVTabular to get up and running quickly, while the rest of the pipeline will involve HugeCTR for the acceleration of learning ranking systems. All of this is built on top of RAPIDS and cuDNN, and as the graphic above suggests, what it takes a CPU to do in one-and-a-half days will only take a top-end GPU sixteen minutes to pull off.\nThe sixteen minutes used to train here was only with 1TB of data, so if the delta between thirty-six hours and sixteen minutes doesn\u2019t seem impressive enough, consider the dramatic differences if many or hundreds of terabytes are needing to be dealt with. NVIDIA is launching Merlin with petabyte datasets in mind, so it seems like it\u2019s ready for anything.\nNVIDIA Jarvis Conversational AI\nWe\u2019ve heard about NVIDIA\u2019s Jarvis before, but today, the company unveils some major updates to its usefulness. Jarvis is one of NVIDIA\u2019s products that relies hugely on its TensorRT libraries, which have just reached the seventh generation. TensorRT now enables support for RNNs, and offers automatic mixed-precision processing between FP32/FP16/INT8.\nJensen says that conversational AI is one of the most intensive uses of inference, and that becomes especially true when what\u2019s trying to be achieved is true interaction. You can talk to Siri and get an answer back quickly, but NVIDIA wants you to be able to talk face-to-face with an avatar, and all responses be quick, and realistic.\n\nJarvis uses a series of technologies in its pipeline, including automatic speech recognition for activating instantly, natural language understanding for interpretation of what\u2019s being said, text-to-speech speech recognition, as well as audio-to-face, which produces the resulting output. To have all of this done in an instantaneous manner is hugely challenging.\nA demo was shown of a conversational AI avatar named Misty, an interactive chat bot. Jensen asks some basic questions, such as the weather, but ultimately highlights its ability to contextually understand what you\u2019re talking about. \u201cDo I need an umbrella?\u201d will lead to weather feedback from where you are located. When asked about the coldest current place on earth (Yakutsk, Russia), Misty turned ice cold and dropped to the floor, adding a lot of life to a mere bot.\n\nJensen said that all of the Jarvis models found in its NGC (NVIDIA GPU Cloud) represents several hundreds of thousands of hours of DGX training, so to call it comprehensive would be an understatement. It will, of course, only get even better as time goes on. If you had one DGX, which includes 8 top-end NVIDIA graphics cards, it\u2019d take well over ten years to train models like these.\nAmpere Hits NVIDIA Drive\nNVIDIA\u2019s latest computing architecture generally finds its way to its Drive platform sooner than later, but there has been no time at all wasted here. NVIDIA says that Ampere can power devices as small as 10 TOPS and 5W for assisted driving, and scale up as high as 2,000 TOPS and 800W for fully autonomous robotaxis.\n\nYou can see a cool example of the latest iteration of NVIDIA Drive at the 2m 20s mark in the video above. All of NVIDIA\u2019s employees who have been working on this technology have been safe at home, with much of the work being done in VR. In a completely virtual environment, they are able to use Drive to autonomously drive to work, and not have to deal with unsightly billboards.\nFinal Thoughts (For Now)\nNVIDIA\u2019s GTC sure didn\u2019t go according to its original plan, but it\u2019s been no less exciting hearing about all of the news a couple of months late. The Ampere A100 is close to the GPU we would have expected, although some rumors got quite a bit wrong. What we ultimately see is, compared to the V100, a 24% boost to single- and double-precision performance, and a massive jump in AI performance. Not to mention a whack of boosts to other metrics, like memory bandwidth.\nThese latest-gen GPUs are built from the ground up for data center and AI use, and it shows. The fact that NVIDIA is putting Mellanox chipsets directly on its EGX card shows just how serious it is about the edge, and also bandwidth. With the DGX A100, the level of performance delivered is simply astonishing, and with sparsity, which can boost inference performance by a factor of two, it could become doubly as impressive.\n\nNVIDIA Drive chip based on Ampere\nThe Mellanox deal didn\u2019t close long ago, but NVIDIA\u2019s made its reasons for acquiring the company clear, and we\u2019re already seeing just how tightly integrated into NVIDIA the company is becoming. Speaking of being integrated, Omniverse is also a notable project, allowing full teams to work together from the same hardware, with a huge focus on collaboration.\nTechnologies like the Jarvis voice conversational AI and the Merlin recommender platforms are also notable in their own right, and of course, both will be accelerated better with Ampere than anything to come before it.\nThe focus of Ampere so far has been entirely on the data center, and based on its major focus on that very environment, it\u2019s not an architecture that would translate easily to gaming. You may recall that Volta was largely expected to be featured in a GeForce at some point, but instead, the next step was Turing, which introduced ray tracing cores to sit alongside the Tensors that were shared by the Volta design.\nIf you\u2019re a gamer, it might be a bummer that nothing specific to you was revealed today, but the data center\u00a0is truly the biggest focus of NVIDIA\u2019s GPU Technology Conference. We have no clue when NVIDIA is planning to unveil its next GeForce or Quadro series, and since we\u2019re poor guessers, we will let you\u00a0folks speculate on when you think they\u2019ll arrive.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport our efforts!

The A100 has an incredible 54 billion transistors, 2.5 times as many as the V100.\nTensor performance, so vital in AI and machine learning, has been significantly improved. FP16 floating point calculations are almost 2.5x as fast as V100 and Nvidia introduced a new math mode called TF32. Nvidia claims TF32 can provide up to 10-fold speedups compared to single-precision floating-point math on Volta GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is significant because FP16 is useful for training, the compute-intensive part of machine learning, but overkill for inference, where the trained models are used to infer an outcome or result. So Nvidia added INT8 and INT4 to the A100 chip to handle the simpler inference part, and draw less power in the process. This means best performance cases for both training and inference from a single chip.\n\n\n\nMemory performance is also significantly improved thanks to 40GB of HBM2 memory on the die delivering a total of 1.6TB/second of bandwidth. And from the looks of the A100 die, Nvidia did what Fujitsu has done with its A64FX processor and put the HBM2 right next to the processor.\nThe A100 also sports a new feature called Multi-Instance GPU (MIG), where a single A100 can be partitioned into up to seven virtual GPUs, each of which gets its own dedicated allocation of cores, L2 cache, and memory controllers. Think of it as virtualization for a GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, Ampere comes with a new version of Nvidia\u2019s high-speed interconnect, NVLink. The third generation of NVLink nearly doubles the signaling rate for NVLink from 25.78Gbps on NVLink 2 to 50Gbps on NVLink 3. Nvidia has also cut the number of lanes needed by half to achieve the same speed. This in turn allows it to double the amount of throughput through the same number of lanes.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang made the Ampere announcement via video from his kitchen during the virtual GPU Technology Conference (GTC).\nNew cards and Servers are ready\nNvidia is wasting no time bringing the A100 to market. It says the A100 is in production and announced the DGX A100 system. The box comes with eight A100 accelerators, as well as 15 TB of storage, a pair of AMD Epyc 7742 CPUs with 64 cores each (you didn\u2019t think they were going to use Intel processors, did you?), 1TB of RAM, and HDR InfiniBand Mellanox controllers.\nThe DGX A100 will set you back $199,000 but it also packs 5 petaflops in a box the size of a small refrigerator, all dedicated to AI and machine learning.\nAlso, Nvidia\u2019s $7 billion merger with Mellanox is already bearing fruit in the form of the EGX A100 card, a combination of an A100 Ampere-based GPU package along with a Mellanox ConnectX-6 Dx NIC on one card.\nThat provides the A100 with 200Gbps of networking without requiring any CPU processing and will allow A100 GPUs to talk directly rather than go through the CPU. All of this means greater speed since GPU-to-CPU communication adds steps and thus latency. The card can also connect to either Infiniband or Ethernet fabrics. GPU-to-GPU communication over Infiniband means HPC is about to see a major jump in performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRelated content\n\n \n\n\nNews\n\nTop network and data center events 2025\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Denise Dubie \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n4 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCloud Computing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Center\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetwork Security\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\nEnterprises reevaluate virtualization strategies amid Broadcom uncertainty\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Neal Weinberg \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n11 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetwork Management Software\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetworking Devices\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\n5 alternatives to VMware vSphere virtualization platform\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Neal Weinberg \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n4 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetworking Devices\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tServer Virtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nVergeIO enhances VergeFabric network virtualization offering\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Sean Michael Kerner \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 13, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n5 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Center\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSDN\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Sections\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPODCASTS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVIDEOS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRESOURCES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEVENTS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotlight: Managing modern risks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom our editors straight to your inbox\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tGet started by entering your email address below.\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email address\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                        by                                                             \n                                                                Andy Patrizio                                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Andy Patrizio on X\n\n\nFollow Andy Patrizio on LinkedIn\n \n\n\n\nAndy Patrizio is a freelance journalist based in southern California who has covered the computer industry for 20 years and has built every x86 PC he\u2019s ever owned, laptops not included.\nThe opinions expressed in this blog are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of ITworld, Network World, its parent, subsidiary or affiliated companies.\n\n\n\n\nMore from this author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnewsIntel taps semiconductor veteran Lip-Bu Tan as new CEO Mar 12, 2025 4 minsnewsAltera targets low-latency AI edge applications with new FPGA products Mar 11, 2025 3 minsnewsLenovo introduces compact, liquid-cooled AI edge server Mar 07, 2025 3 minsfeatureSeven important trends in the server sphere Mar 06, 2025 4 minsfeatureData center vacancies hit historic lows despite record construction Mar 06, 2025 4 minsnewsAI driving a 165% rise in data center power demand by 2030 Mar 05, 2025 3 minsnewsTariffs for now won\u2019t impact IT organizations Mar 04, 2025 3 minsnewsLenovo renews ThinkSystem lineup for AI workloads and more Feb 26, 2025 2 mins \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me morePopularArticlesPodcastsVideos\n\n\nopinion  Jio teams with AMD, Cisco and Nokia to build AI-enabled telecom platform  By Zeus Kerravala\nMar 18, 20254 mins\nNetworkingTelecommunications\n\n\n\n\nnews  2025 network outage report and internet health check By Ann Bednarz\nMar 18, 202528 mins\nInternet Service ProvidersNetwork Management SoftwareNetworking\n\n\n\n\nnews  Cloudflare unveils network-powered posture management By Sean Michael Kerner\nMar 18, 20255 mins\nCloud ComputingNetwork Security\n\n\n\n\npodcast  Has the hype around \u2018Internet of Things\u2019 paid off?

And it\u2019s the people who aspire to make a dent in the universe.\nOur latest \u201cI Am AI\u201d video, unveiled during NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote address at the GPU Technology Conference, pays tribute to the scientists, researchers, artists and many others making historic advances with AI.\nTo grasp AI\u2019s global impact, consider: the technology is expected to generate $2.9 trillion worth of business value by 2021, according to Gartner.\nIt\u2019s on course to classify 2 trillion galaxies to understand the universe\u2019s origin, and to zero in on the molecular structure of the drugs needed to treat coronavirus and cancer.\nAs depicted in the latest video, AI has an artistic side, too. It can paint as well as Bob Ross. And its ability to assist in the creation of original compositions is worthy of the London Symphony Orchestra, which plays the accompanying theme music, a piece that started out written by a recurrent neural network.\nAI is also capable of creating text-to-speech synthesis for narrating a short documentary. And that\u2019s just what it did.\nThese fireworks and more are the story of I Am AI. Sixteen companies and research organizations are featured in the video. The action moves fast, so grab a bowl of popcorn, kick back and enjoy this tour of some of the highlights of AI in 2020.\nReaching Into Outer Space\nUnderstanding the formation of the structure and the amount of matter in the universe requires observing and classifying celestial objects such as galaxies. With an estimated 2 trillion galaxies to examine in the observable universe, it\u2019s what cosmologists call a \u201ccomputational grand challenge.\u201d\nThe recent Dark Energy Survey collected data from over 300 million galaxies. To study them with unprecedented precision, the Center for Artificial Intelligence Innovation at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign teamed up with the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility at the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Argonne National Laboratory.\n\nNCSA tapped the Galaxy Zoo project, a crowdsourced astronomy effort that labeled millions of galaxies observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Using that data, an AI model with 99.6 percent accuracy can now chew through unlabeled galaxies to ID them and accelerate scientific research.\nNASA has set a goal of human exploration of Mars by the mid-2030s. To accomplish this feat safely, scientists must understand how the sun and space weather will affect the journey. High-resolution images of the sun taken by NASA\u2019s Solar Dynamics Observatory are aiding scientists in this effort.\nResearchers at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center have developed algorithms using NVIDIA GPUs to analyze the immense number of solar images taken since 2010. They are using errors in the images to help identify origins of energetic particles in Earth\u2019s orbit that could damage interplanetary spacecraft. They are also using the same images to track solar surface flows to support better models for predicting the weather in space.\nRestoring Voice and Limb\n\nVoiceitt \u2014 a Tel Aviv-based startup that\u2019s developed signal processing, speech recognition technologies and deep neural nets \u2014 offers a synthesized voice for those whose speech has been distorted. The company\u2019s app converts unintelligible speech into easily understood speech.\nThe University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\u2019s Neuromuscular Rehabilitation Engineering Laboratory and North Carolina State University\u2019s Active Robotic Sensing (ARoS) Laboratory develop experimental robotic limbs used in the labs.\nThe two research units have been working on walking environment recognition, aiming to develop environmental adaptive controls for prostheses. They\u2019ve been using CNNs for prediction running on NVIDIA GPUs. And they aren\u2019t alone.\nHelping in Pandemic\nWhiteboard Coordinator remotely monitors the temperature of people entering buildings to minimize exposure to COVID-19. The Chicago-based startup provides temperature-screening rates of more than 2,000 people per hour at checkpoints. Whiteboard Coordinator and NVIDIA bring AI to the edge of healthcare with NVIDIA Clara Guardian, an application framework that simplifies the development and deployment of smart sensors.\nViz.ai uses AI to inform neurologists about strokes much faster than traditional methods. With the onset of the pandemic, Viz.ai moved to help combat the new virus with an app that alerts care teams to positive COVID-19 results.\n\nAxial3D is a Belfast, Northern Ireland, startup that enlists AI to accelerate the production time of 3D-printed models for medical images used in planning surgeries. Having redirected its resources at COVID-19, the company is now supplying face shields and is among those building ventilators for the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service. It has also begun 3D printing of swab kits for testing as well as valves for respirators. (Check out their on-demand webinar.)\nKiwiBot, a cheery-eyed food delivery bot from Berkeley, Calif., has included in its path a way to provide COVID-19 services. It\u2019s autonomously delivering masks, sanitizers and other supplies with its robot-to-human service.\n(All the companies above are members of the NVIDIA Inception program for AI startups.)\nMasterpieces of Art, Compositions and Narration\nResearchers from London-based startup Oxia Palus demonstrated in a paper, \u201cRaiders of the Lost Art,\u201d that AI could be used to recreate lost works of art that had\u00a0been painted over. Beneath Picasso\u2019s 1902 The Crouching Beggar lies a mountainous landscape that art curators believe is of Parc del Laberint d\u2019Horta, near Barcelona.\nThey also know that Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol painted Parc del Laberint d\u2019Horta. Using a modified X-ray fluorescence image of The Crouching Beggar and Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol\u2019s Terraced Garden in Mallorca, the researchers applied neural style transfer, running on NVIDIA GPUs, to reconstruct the lost artwork, creating Rusi\u00f1ol\u2019s Parc del Laberint d\u2019Horta.\n\nFor GTC a few years ago, Luxembourg-based AIVA AI composed the start \u2014 melodies and accompaniments \u2014 of what would become an original classical music piece meriting an orchestra. Since then we\u2019ve found it one.\n\nLate last year, the London Symphony Orchestra agreed to play the moving piece, which was arranged for the occasion by musician John Paesano and was recorded at Abbey Road Studios.\nNVIDIA alum Helen was our voice-over professional for videos and events for years. When she left the company, we thought about how we might continue the tradition. We turned to what we know: AI. But there weren\u2019t publicly available models up to the task.\nA team from NVIDIA\u2019s Applied Deep Learning Research group published the answer to the problem: Flowtron: an Autoregressive Flow-based Generative Network for Text-to-Speech Synthesis. Licensing Helen\u2019s voice, we trained the network on dozens of hours of it.\nFirst, Helen produced multiple takes, guided by our creative director. Then our creative director was able to generate multiple takes from Flowtron and adjust parameters of the model to get the desired outcome. And what you hear is \u201cHelen\u201d speaking in the I Am AI video narration.\n\n\n\nCategories: CorporateTags: COVID-19 | GTC 2020 | Inception | Social Impact | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia DGX A100 (Image credit: Nvidia)The DGX A100 is an ultra-powerful system that has a lot of Nvidia markings on the outside, but there's some AMD inside as well. A pair of core-heavy AMD Epyc 7742 (codenamed Rome) processors are at the heart of Nvidia's new $199,000 creation.The DGX A100 employs up to eight Ampere-powered A100 data center GPUs, offering up to 320GB of total GPU memory and delivering around 5 petaflops of AI performance. The A100 might be doing most of the heavy lifting, but the team still needs a leader. However, Intel doesn't fit the bill.\u00a0The A100 leverages PCIe 4.0, but Intel doesn't have any processors currently that support the interface. AMD, on the other hand, has openly embraced the PCIe 4.0 standard on the the majority of its modern CPUs. Nvidia ultimately found comfort in AMD's arms, more specifically the Red Team's second-generation Epyc offerings.The DGX A100 features two 7nm Epyc 7742 processors. Each Zen 2 processor comes with 64 cores and 128 threads that run with a 2.25 GHz base clock and 3.4 GHz boost clock. The Epyc 7742 duo accounts for 128 cores and 256 threads on the DGX A100.\u00a0The Epyc 7742 isn't just generous with cores; it's also pretty heavy on the cache too, supplying up to 256MB of L3 cache. More importantly, the 64-core part puts 128 high-speed PCIe 4.0 lanes at Nvidia's disposal.A typical DGX A100 system also comes with 1TB of memory (upgradeable to 2TB), two 1.92TB NVMe M.2 SSDs in a RAID 1 array for the operating system (Ubuntu Linux) and up to four 3.84TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe U.2 drives in a RAID 0 array for secondary storay. Nvidia also offers the option to add four additional SSDs to bump the RAID 0 volume from 15TB up to 30TB.The DGX A100 is designed with state-of-the-art networking. Nvidia recently acquired Mellanox Technologies in a whopping $6.9 billion deal, and it's already paying off. The DGX A100 packs eight single-port Mellanox ConnectX-6 VPI HDR InfiniBand adapters for clustering and one dual-port ConnectX-6 VPI Ethernet adapter for storage and networking usage. The aforementioned adapters have the capability to deliver up to 200 Gbps of throughput.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Today's best AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X deals255 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $1,800ViewLow Stock $1,918.99ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (33)\n\n\n\nZhiye LiuSocial Links NavigationNews Editor and Memory ReviewerZhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

Could they have shut this down, if they really wanted to?\nThe way I see Intel had nothing to do with Nvidia's decision. It was a choice between using an AMD product in their platform or not having a platform at all, since PCIe 4.0 was definitely needed for the amount of bandwith required.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I write about disruptive companies, technologies and usage models.Follow AuthorMay 14, 2020, 07:21pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang invited 100,000 GTC 2020 attendees into his kitchen YouTube grab from NVIDIA video\nI attend hundreds of events a year as an analyst and one way I rate them is by the number and industry impact of the announcements. I watched NVIDIA\u2019s GTC 2020 virtual keynote today, and the company scored high on both. Architecture is everything when you are a platform provider and NVIDIA rolled out its new architecture, Ampere, across most of its entire markets. The only exception was gaming but I\u2019m sure that will be rolled out at the next gaming show.\n\n\nNVIDIA rolled out its announcements in nine video chapters and I thought it made sense to roll out my coverage of GTC 2020 aligned with most of those eight chapters.\u00a0 I\u2019ve included links to the most relevant parts.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nClara healthcare platform updated and \u201cData-Center-Scale Accelerated Computing\u201d introduced\u00a0\n\nFrom his kitchen in 4K splendor, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang kicked off this section thanking front-line COVID-19 workers and citing numerous examples where GPU-accelerated computing was helping in the fight. The two that stood out to me were Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the Scripps Research Institute who respectively, sequenced the virus in seven hours and already screened a billion drug combinations in one day.\u00a0 It\u2019s important for all keynotes these days to start by talking about COVID-19 as I believe this matters a lot to the audience.\n\n\nThe company took the time to provide an update on Clara, NVIDIA\u2019s healthcare platform. It introduced Guardian to power smart hospitals, new AI models to advance COVID-19 research and improve detection and a new world record for analyzing the human genome in under 20 minutes.\u00a0 As I said here, supercomputing will only get more important as we look at today\u2019s and future pandemics.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nHuang continued onto NVIDIA\u2019s architecture for the datacenter, coined as \u201cData-Center-Scale Accelerated Computing\u201d. He went on to make the case that the datacenter is the new computing unit. This was a very provocative statement, but it basically says that the future is all about converged solutions containing CPU, GPU, networking (DPU), and a comprehensive software stack. It was an effective way for the company to reinforce why acquiring Mellanox made sense for NVIDIA and its customers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOmniverse and tip of the hat to NVIDIA RTX, DLSS 2.0 and ray tracing\u00a0\nThis segment was a bit of a victory lap for NVIDIA on ray tracing and upsampling using AI (DLSS), which, I believe it deserves. This led to the Omniverse announcement. I believe the company has led the industry in accelerated ray tracing and AI for both gaming and workstations. RTX was announced at SIGGRAPH 2018 and it\u2019s safe to say ray tracing is now a mainstream feature.\n\n \nJensen showed some cool eye candy demos of how the Unreal engine was upsampling a 540P scene to 1080P.\u00a0Then he showed how ray tracing and AI came together on Minecraft. I wrote about the Minecraft for RTX Beta\u00a0(here).\nHuang then moved into the announcement that \u201cOmniverse\u201d, a collaboration platform for graphics and simulation workflows, was now available to early access customers. Huang showed how different developers in AEC (architecture, engineering, construction) working on different tools (Rhino, Max, Revit, AR) could work on the same project, via the cloud.\nTo me, the biggest significance is seeing NVIDIA develop a cloud-based collaboration platform that micro-verticals like AEC can leverage\nApache Spark 3.0 acceleration for big data\nHuang then dove into GPU acceleration for the biggest of data in HPC and scientific computing where NVIDIA already performs well. NVIDIA\u2019s software library already supports over 700 CUDA-accelerated applications and Spark 3.0 acceleration is a huge announcement.\nMany data scientists use Apache Spark. Adobe is one of the first companies working with a preview release of Spark 3.0 running on Databricks and said it achieved a 7x performance improvement and 90 percent cost savings in an initial test.\nIn his classic phrase we have learned to appreciate, Huang said \u201cthe more you buy, the more you save.\u201d I have not scoured through every inch of the cost analysis, but similar prior claims he\u2019s made have passed my scrutiny.\u00a0\nHuang ended this session saying Databricks and Google Cloud Dataproc will soon be offering Spark with GPU acceleration. I find this announcement fascinating given just how much revenue opportunity there is in ETL (extract, transform, load). This news coupled with NVIDIA RAPIDS support on Google Cloud AI, AWS Sagemaker means NVIDIA is moving upstream in data workflows.\u00a0\nMerlin recommendation application framework\nNext, Huang jumped into \u201cMerlin\u201d, a new application framework for recommendation systems. You\u2019ve likely used thousands of recommendation systems before if you\u2019ve used Amazon (\u201cCustomers who bought this item also bought\u2026\u201d) or Netflix (suggested videos). He said, \u201cMerlin slashes the time needed to create a recommender system from a 1-terabyte dataset from a couple of days to just a few minutes\u201d.\nI will be watching this one very closely as I believe most real-time, or near real-time recommendation systems use CPUs today.\u00a0 The frameworks for recommenders are now more complex than ever and I believe, in need of acceleration.\nJarvis conversational AI application framework\nAll my readers have either used Alexa, Siri, Cortana, or Assistant intelligent agents.\u00a0 But what about application developers who want to use something else in their applications? Enter NVIDIA Jarvis.\u00a0\nJarvis is NVIDIA\u2019s application framework for multi-modal (speech and vision) and conversational AI applications. The company says it can recognize vision and sound so companies can create real-time translations, closed captioning of everyone speaking, transcriptions of video calls in real time or power a number of other applications such as smart speakers, call centers, interactions with robots and cars, and retail services.\u00a0\nI find this incredibly interesting as NVIDIA just got into the chatbot enabling business.\u00a0 The latest conversational applications use AI to be humanlike in intelligence and speech, it is impossible to run such systems in real time without GPUs. Jarvis opens the door for every enterprise to build and retrain such language-based applications for their use cases.\nNVIDIA A100 datacenter GPU and DGX A100 integrated system\nWhile the previous announcements were interesting, Huang put the biggest reveal in the middle of the program, the A100 datacenter GPU. This would be part six, for those counting at home.\u00a0 For the deepest dive on the A100, head on over to Moor Insights & Strategy AI analyst Karl Freund\u2019s post on the A100.\u00a0\nHuang kicked it off big by saying the A100 is in full production and shipping to customers worldwide. As Freund wrote, the company has \u201cearly commitments from the industry\u2019s major players, including Google, AWS, Microsoft, Alibaba, Dell, Lenovo, HPE.\u201d While Freund did a great job in his article, I wanted to point out my main takeaways on the NVIDIA A100:\u00a0\n\n\nDesire to unify both training and inference on a single chip\n20X performance boost using new TF32 over V100 using FP32\nMIG, or multi-instance GPU, to make many GPUs look like one to the programmer\n\n\nFor those who pay close attention to this space, the most interesting takeaway is on training-inference using the same chip. While the industry has coalesced on NVIDIA GPUs for training, there are currently 100s of options here or coming for inference. I wonder how many VCs will be losing sleep tonight.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt\u2019s one thing to do a chip, another to create an entire system based on the chip. Huang also announced what we at the firm consider \u201cconverged infrastructure\u201d, containing CPU, GPU, networking, memory, and storage. NVIDIA says the new platform, called DGX A100, is the first system to deliver 5 PetaFLOPS in a single \u201cnode\u201d. I checked and it\u2019s the only one I can find.\u00a0\u00a0\nA single DGX A100 can contain eight A100s, six NVSwitches, nine Mellanox NICs, one dual core AMD Rome-based EPYC processor, and 15TB NVMe SSD. What a beast. And yes, it can likely play Crysis.\nWhat a way to kick off an ecosystem.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nEGX A100 edge computing with Ampere architecture and BMW factory robotics win\n\u00a0After that high point with A100 and DGX A100, Huang wasn\u2019t finished. What\u2019s good for the datacenter is good for the edge, right?\u00a0\nHuang announced the NVIDIA EGX A100 for larger edge servers and the smaller EGX Jetson Xavier NX for what NVIDIA calls \u201cmicro-edge servers.\u201d The two products enable developers to enable different performance and price points as well as different form factors.\u00a0\nThe EGX A100 consists of an NVIDIA Ampere GPU and Mellanox ConnectX-6 DX SmartNIC and can support \u201chundreds of cameras\u201d while the EGX Jetson Xavier NX supports a couple of cameras.\u00a0\nIt was nice to see NVIDIA bring a major design win to the table, BMW, who committed to NVIDIA\u2019s robotics platform, called Isaac, to power many robots at its factories. Huang talked about numerous robots that split, pick, place, transport, and sort raw materials and work-in-progress assemblies.\u00a0\nBigger picture, I see NVIDIA raising the bar by adding increasingly higher amounts of performance at different price points with a software platform that leverages all the designs. While there weren\u2019t hard numbers on how many robots overall or revenue size, it sure is a positive feather in the NVIDIA cap. BMW is a very precise manufacturer and you can imagine how hard it would have been to win this business.\nMoor Insights & Strategy analyst Anshel Sag hit some points on EGX here.\nAutomotive goes Ampere with Orin\n\u00a0If you have ever attended an NVIDIA CES event, you will know that NVIDIA is serious about the automotive market. CEO Jensen Huang once spoke 90 minutes at a CES keynote about the state of\u00a0autonomous driving.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0Just like what was \u201cgood for the datacenter is good for the edge\u201d, what is good for the edge is good for automotive. With Orin, NVIDIA is bringing the Ampere architecture to automotive.\u00a0 What\u2019s new here is NVIDIA offerings now span ADAS (10 TOPS/5W) to L2+ autopilot (200 TOPS/45W) to full L5 robotaxi (2,000 TOPS/800W).\u00a0\nLike the EGX family, the benefit of having a scaled architecture is that as an automaker or Tier 1, you can leverage design resources across hardware and software.\u00a0 In the past, OEMs and Tier 1s would have to qualify two separate platforms: one for ADAS and one for self-driving.\u00a0 Now they have only one platform to qualify.\nWrapping up\u00a0\nWhile GTC 2020 was virtual this year, it certainly didn\u2019t decrease the number of announcements or excitement. Too many events I attend now are devoid of product and service announcements and I think they\u2019re real snoozers. Having attended nine GTCs, I can say this had the most announcements I can recall.\u00a0\nWhat I wanted to do was net out over 90 minutes of video from Jensen Huang\u2019s kitchen and eight press releases and talk about what it means for NVIDIA.\u00a0 With NVIDIA\u2019s chips based on the Ampere architecture and Mellanox networking, the company is bringing up to 20x AI performance in roughly the same power envelope.\u00a0 With the A100, it is very emphatically saying that you should be doing both training and inference on the same chip. That\u2019s a really big deal because, while NVIDIA does have competitive inference solutions, there are at least 50 competing solutions out there already or coming.\u00a0\nThe event also showcases Mellanox\u2019s value add and integration into NVIDIA\u2019s grand plan, which Huang hit first, which he described as \u201cData-Center-Scale Accelerated Computing.\u201d With Mellanox in the datacenter, nodes and GPUs connected by Mellanox becomes the datacenter. I think that\u2019s bold.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOverall, it was an impressive showing for NVIDIA. Now, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how NVIDIA will integrate Ampere into its GeForce gaming solutions.\nDisclosure: Moor Insights & Strategy, like all research and analyst firms, provides or has provided paid research, analysis, advising, or consulting to many high-tech companies in the industry, including\u00a0Amazon.com, Advanced Micro Devices,\u00a0Apstra,\u202fARM Holdings, Aruba Networks, AWS, A-10 Strategies,\u00a0Bitfusion,\u202fCisco Systems, Dell, Dell\u202fEMC, Dell Technologies, Diablo Technologies, Digital Optics,\u00a0Dreamchain, Echelon, Ericsson, Foxconn, Frame, Fujitsu, Gen Z Consortium, Glue Networks, GlobalFoundries,\u202fGoogle,\u202fHP\u202fInc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Huawei\u202fTechnologies,\u202fIBM, Intel, Interdigital, Jabil Circuit, Konica Minolta, Lattice Semiconductor, Lenovo, Linux Foundation, MACOM (Applied Micro),\u00a0MapBox,\u00a0Mavenir, Mesosphere,\u202fMicrosoft,\u202fNational Instruments, NetApp, NOKIA, Nortek,\u202fNVIDIA, ON Semiconductor, ONUG, OpenStack Foundation, Panasas,\u00a0Peraso, Pixelworks, Plume Design,\u00a0Portworx, Pure Storage,\u202fQualcomm, Rackspace, Rambus,\u00a0Rayvolt\u00a0E-Bikes, Red Hat, Samsung Electronics, Silver Peak, SONY,\u00a0Springpath, Sprint, Stratus Technologies, Symantec, Synaptics, Syniverse,\u00a0TensTorrent,\u00a0Tobii\u00a0Technology, Twitter, Unity Technologies, Verizon Communications,\u202fVidyo, Wave Computing,\u00a0Wellsmith, Xilinx, Zebra, which may be cited in this article.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

After a false start, the spring event was rescheduled as an all-digital affair, centered around CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s annual keynote. And with that keynote set to be broadcast on Thursday morning, the company has posted a short video teasing some of the new hardware we\u2019re presumably going to see in the keynote.\n\nIn the video, titled \u201cWhat\u2019s Jensen been cooking\u201d, Huang pulls out a rather heavy-looking 8 GPU baseboard from his oven, placing it on his kitchen counter. Calling it \u201cthe world\u2019s largest graphics card\u201d, the board has apparently \u201cbeen cookin\u2019 for a while.\u201d\nWith no other context provided in the 27 second video, the board looks a great deal like an updated version of the baseboards used in NVIDIA\u2019s DGX and HGX compute servers. And with NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation compute architecture and GPU widely expected to be unveiled at the event, we are almost certainly looking at a server board full of NVIDIA\u2019s next-gen accelerators.\nNo doubt we\u2019ll be seeing and hearing a lot more about this board and the GPUs on it come Thursday, where NVIDIA's keynote starts bright and early at 6am PT.\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n46 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nsaylick - Tuesday, May 12, 2020 - link\nI'm stoked to see what Ampere is all about on Thursday but I do find this video to be ironic given how one of their debacles in recent history meant some users fixing graphics cards by putting them directly into ovens.\n\n\n\nnathanddrews - Tuesday, May 12, 2020 - link\nAs excited as I am for AMD's new GPUs, I think NVIDIA will probably steal the show. (again)\n\n\n\nyeeeeman - Wednesday, May 13, 2020 - link\nAmd will basically fix what is broken in rdna...nothing spectacular. If they would have executed correctly then the RX5700XT would have been an entirely different story...\n\n\n\nwishgranter - Tuesday, May 12, 2020 - link\nyou mean the old Nvidia 8800 GTS ?  Still have the notebook with it and its working  :D  \n\n\n\ncoburn_c - Tuesday, May 12, 2020 - link\nYou don't understand advertising good sir.  Now when you search 'nvidia oven' you will get this video instead.  It's genius. \n\n\n\np1esk - Tuesday, May 12, 2020 - link\nbrilliant\n\n\n\na5cent - Wednesday, May 13, 2020 - link\nYou mean misleading... like all advertising.\n\n\n\nedzieba - Wednesday, May 13, 2020 - link\nBoth AMD and Nvidia GPUs were hit in the successive Macbook GPU solderball issues. Nobody is immune from suppliers swapping solder formulations without informing upstream customers. \n\n\n\nEliadbu - Wednesday, May 13, 2020 - link\nTrue there were issues with MacBook solder balls cracking, but heating in the oven is not a permanent fix it would works few weeks or few months (if you're lucky) and then break again, if you want to fix solder issues you nead to desolder the package and desolder with new solder balls for that you need more advanced equipment than home oven. \n\n\n\ncosmotic - Tuesday, May 12, 2020 - link\nCool mansion bro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

The successor to the Tesla V100 datacenter GPU (announced May 10, 2017), the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU offers impressive specifications and capabilities.\n \n\nNVIDIA A100, the first GPU based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, providing the greatest generational performance leap of NVIDIA\u2019s eight generations of GPUs, is also built for data analytics, scientific computing and cloud graphics, and is in full production and shipping to customers worldwide, Huang announced.\nEighteen of the world\u2019s leading service providers and systems builders are incorporating them, among them Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Google Cloud, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft Azure and Oracle.\nThe A100, and the NVIDIA Ampere architecture it\u2019s built on, boost performance by up to 20x over its predecessors, Huang said. He detailed five key features of A100, including:\n\nMore than 54 billion transistors, making it the world\u2019s largest 7-nanometer processor.\nThird-generation Tensor Cores with TF32, a new math format that accelerates single-precision AI training out of the box. NVIDIA\u2019s widely used Tensor Cores are now more flexible, faster and easier to use, Huang explained.\nStructural sparsity acceleration, a new efficiency technique harnessing the inherently sparse nature of AI math for higher performance.\nMulti-instance GPU, or MIG, allowing a single A100 to be partitioned into as many as seven independent GPUs, each with its own resources.\nThird-generation NVLink technology, doubling high-speed connectivity between GPUs, allowing A100 servers to act as one giant GPU.\n\nThe result of all this: 6x higher performance than NVIDIA\u2019s previous generation Volta architecture for training and 7x higher performance for inference.\n\n \nNVIDIA A100 Specifications\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at the specs for this new GPU, with the previous Tesla V100 and older Tesla P100 for comparison:\n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAmpere A100\nTesla V100\nTesla P100\n\n\nGPU\nGA100\nGV100\nGP100\n\n\nArchitecture\nAmpere\nVolta\nPascal\n\n\nSMs\n108\n80\n56\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n6912\n5120\n3584\n\n\nTensor Cores\n432\n640\n\u2013\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1410 MHz\n1530 MHz\n1480 MHz\n\n\nMemory\n40GB HBM2e\n16GB HBM2\n16GB HBM2\n\n\nMemory Interface\n5120-bit\n4096-bit\n4096-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n1.6 TB/s\n900 GB/s\n616 GB/s\n\n\nTransistor Count\n54B\n21.1B\n15.3B\n\n\nDie Size\n826 mm2\n815 mm2\n610 mm2\n\n\nProcess Tech\n7 nm\n12 nm\n16 nm\n\n\nTDP\n400W\n300W\n300W\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n \nThe GA100 GPU is manufactured on TSMC\u2019s 7nm process, with a die size of 826 mm 2. This is larger than the 815 mm 2 from GV100, and contains more than double the transistor count of the previous generation\u2019s GPU. The number is an incredible 54 billion (!) transistors, up from 21.1 billion with GV100.\nThe GA100\u2019s Stream Multiprocessor (SM) count is 108, and Ampere\u2019s SMs are organized as 64 PF32 and 32 FP64 each. This breaks down to 6912 FP32 (single precision) CUDA Cores, and 3456 FP64 (double precision) CUDA Cores. And while the 432 Tensor Core count is down from GV100\u2019s 640, A100 is using third-generation Tensor Core technology.\n \n\n\n\nThe third-generation Tensor Cores in the NVIDIA Ampere architecture are beefier than prior versions. They support a larger matrix size \u2014 8x8x4, compared to 4x4x4 for Volta \u2014 that lets users tackle tougher problems. That\u2019s one reason why an A100 with a total of 432 Tensor Cores delivers up to 19.5 FP64 TFLOPS, more than double the performance of a Volta V100.\n\nMemory size and bandwidth has also increased significantly, with 40GB of HBM2e on a 5120-bit bus providing nearly 1.6 TB/s in bandwidth (1,555 MB/s).\nThe DGX A100 platform shown during the KitchenNote is \u201cthe world\u2019s largest GPU\u201d; a massive 8-GPU configuration that weighs 50 lbs (NVIDIA\u2019s CEO pulled out of the oven just a couple of days ago). The price tag for the the DGX? $200,000.\nIs Ampere for Consumer GPUs Coming Soon?\nAs to potential consumer implications from Ampere, no new GeForce products have been announced, yet. Via VideoCardz, we find this quote from MarketWatch:\n\nAmpere will eventually replace Nvidia\u2019s Turing and Volta chips with a single platform that streamlines Nvidia\u2019s GPU lineup, Huang said in a pre-briefing with media members Wednesday. While consumers largely know Nvidia for its videogame hardware, the first launches with Ampere are aimed at AI needs in the cloud and for research.\n\u201cUnquestionably, it\u2019s the first time that we\u2019ve unified the acceleration workload of the entire data center into one single platform,\u201d Huang said.\n\nIt seems that we will have to wait a bit longer for more GeForce-related Ampere news.\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousSurprise Unreal Engine 5 and New License Announcement \n\nNextFree Grand Theft Auto V on the Epic Games Store \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nSebastian Peak\nEditor-in-Chief at PC Perspective.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe day has finally arrived for Nvidia to take the wraps off of its Ampere architecture. Sort of. While Ampere will inevitably make its way into some of the best graphics cards and find a place on our GPU hierarchy, today's digital GTC announcement is only about the Nvidia A100, a GPU designed primarily for the upcoming wave of exascale supercomputers and AI research. It's the descendant of Nvidia's existing line of Tesla V100 GPUs, and like Volta V100 we don't expect to see A100 silicon in any consumer GPUs. Well, maybe a Titan card\u2014Titan A100?\u2014but I don't even want to think about what such a card would cost, because the A100 is a behemoth of a chip.(Image credit: Nvidia)Let's start with what we know at a high level. First, the Nvidia A100 will pack a whopping 54 billion transistors, with a die size of 826mm square. GV100 for reference had 21.1 billion transistors in an 815mm square package, so the A100 is over 2.5 times as many transistors, while only being 1.3% larger. Nvidia basically couldn't make a larger GPU, as the maximum reticle size for current lithography is around 850mm square. The increase in transistor count comes courtesy of TSMC's 7nm FinFET process, which AMD, Apple, and others have been using for a while now. It's a welcome and necessary upgrade to the aging 12nm process behind Volta.Along with the monster GPU itself are six stacks of HBM2 memory, which Nvidia says provide 40GB of total memory capacity. Since HBM2 stacks come in power of two size increments (i.e., 8GB per stack), we can only assume one of the stacks is for either redundancy of some form and/or future products. We specifically asked and got a vague answer saying, \"We're only shipping products with five HBM2 stacks right now.\" Whether the sixth stack simple doesn't exist on current actual A100 boards, or is a dummy spacer, or is simply disabled ... Nvidia wouldn't say. But at some point, Nvidia plans to have A100 solutions that do support six HBM2 stacks and probably with more SMs enabled (more on that below).For HPC (high performance computing) nodes in a super computer, Nvidia also upgraded the NVLink to 600GB/s for each GPU, and NVSwitch provides full speed connections to any other node in a server. 8-way Nvidia A100 systems already exist and have been shipped to customers including the Department of Energy. These use six NVSwitch controllers with an aggregate 4.8 TBps of bandwidth.The Nvidia A100 isn't just a huge GPU, it's the fastest GPU Nvidia has ever created, and then some. The third generation Tensor cores in A100 provide a new hybrid FP32 format called TF32 (Tensor Float 32, which is basically like Google's bfloat16 format, with three extra bits of significant digits) that aims to provide a balanced option with the precision of FP16 and exponent sizes of FP32. For workloads that use TF32, the A100 can provide 312 TFLOPS of compute power in a single chip. That's up to 20X faster than the V100's 15.7 TFLOPS of FP32 performance, but that's not an entirely fair comparison since TF32 isn't quite the same as FP32.(Image credit: Nvidia)Elsewhere, the A100 delivers peak FP64 performance of 19.5 TFLOPS. That's more FP64 performance than the V100's FP32, and about 2.5 times the FP64 performance. However, Nvidia says that the third generation Tensor cores support FP64, which is where the 2.5X increase in performance comes from. The Tensor cores aren't be the same instruction set as FP64 CUDA cores, so if you're looking for CUDA FP64 performance it's 'only' 9.7 TFLOPS.Nvidia has now posted the specs of the A100 chip, and the details are ... surprising. First, the new Tensor cores are a significant change from the previous generation. There are only four Tensor cores per SM (compared to 8 on Volta and Turing), but those four cores deliver twice the performance of the previous generation's eight cores. The image on Nvidia's site showing the new SM is called \"New GA100 SM with Uber Tensor Core.png\" which pretty much says it all.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Something else to note: The full A100 chip has up to 128 SMs and 8192 FP32 CUDA cores, but only 108 SMs are enabled in the initial version. That says a lot about yields on such a massive chip, as well as TSMC's N7P node. Nvidia is probably saving up 'good' die for future products, but the initial A100 will only have about 85% of the SMs enabled (compared to 95% of SMs being enabled on the V100). There must be a massive amount of redundancy built into the critical paths to allow such a chip to exist and function at all.The full A100 GPU has 128 SMs and up to 8192 CUDA cores, but the Nvidia A100 GPU only enables 108 SMs for now. (Image credit: Nvidia)New GA100 SM with Uber Tensor Core, plus FP64 cores but no RT cores. (Image credit: Nvidia)One interesting tidbit that never came up in the announcement: ray tracing. The Volta V100 also skipped ray tracing, partly because it came before Turing but also because it was focused on delivering compute above all else. Given the above block diagrams, it appears the A100 follows a similar path and leaves RT cores for other Ampere GPUs. It's yet another clear indication that A100 isn't for consumers and probably won't even go into a Titan card. Or maybe we'll get a Titan A100 for entry-level compute and deep learning or whatever.Looking at the details of the SM, we get a similar design to Volta V100: 64 FP32 cores and 64 INT32 cores, with the four large Tensor clusters. With 54 SMs enabled, the A100 has a total of 6912 FP32 CUDA cores, and the same for INT32, with half as many (3456) FP64 cores. But as noted above, the Tensor cores can also do FP64 calculations, yielding the same 19.5 TFLOPS of compute for both FP64 and FP32. Interesting to note is that FP16 performance is up to 78 TFLOPS, but BF16 is half that.Here's the full specs table:Swipe to scroll horizontallyData Center GPUNVIDIA Tesla P100NVIDIA Tesla V100NVIDIA A100GPU CodenameGP100GV100GA100GPU ArchitectureNVIDIA PascalNVIDIA VoltaNVIDIA AmpereGPU Board Form Factor\u00a0SXMSXM2SXM4SMs5680108TPCs284054FP32 Cores / SM646464FP32 Cores / GPU358451206912FP64 Cores / SM323232FP64 Cores / GPU179225603456INT32 Cores / SMNA6464INT32 Cores / GPUNA51206912Tensor Cores / SMNA84Tensor Cores / GPUNA640432GPU Boost Clock1480 MHz1530 MHz1410 MHzPeak FP16 Tensor TFLOPS with FP16 AccumulateNA125312/624Peak FP16 Tensor TFLOPS with FP32 AccumulateNA125312/624Peak BF16 Tensor TFLOPS with FP32 AccumulateNANA312/624Peak TF32 Tensor TFLOPSNANA156/312Peak FP64 Tensor TFLOPSNANA19.5Peak INT8 Tensor TOPSNANA624/1248Peak INT4 Tensor TOPSNANA1248/2496Peak FP16 TFLOPS21.231.478Peak BF16 TFLOPSNANA39Peak FP32 TFLOPS10.615.719.5Peak FP64 TFLOPS5.37.89.7Peak INT32 TOPSNA15.719.5Texture Units224320432Memory Interface4096-bit HBM24096-bit HBM25120-bit HBM2Memory Size16 GB32 GB / 16 GB40 GBMemory Data Rate703 MHz DDR877.5 MHz DDR1215 MHz DDRMemory Bandwidth720 GB/sec900 GB/sec1.6 TB/secL2 Cache Size4096 KB6144 KB40960 KBShared Memory Size / SM64 KBConfigurable up to 96 KBConfigurable up to 164\u00a0 KBRegister File Size / SM256 KB256 KB256 KBRegister File Size / GPU14336 KB20480 KB27648 KBTDP300 Watts300 Watts400 WattsTransistors15.3 billion21.1 billion54.2 billionGPU Die Size610 mm\u00b2815 mm\u00b2826 mm\u00b2TSMC Manufacturing Process16 nm FinFET+12 nm FFN7 nm N7I've seen a few people prior to this announcement suggesting Nvidia will have Ampere GPUs running at upward of 2.0 GHz, maybe even as high as 2.5 GHz. Clearly, A100 isn't going that route, with a boost clock of 1410 MHz. All of the performance data discussed is also based on the boost clock, which the A100 may or may not maintain under heavy workloads. Nvidia tends to be conservative on its consumer boost clocks, but in the data center things aren't quite the same.Power use for a single Nvidia A100 is 400W this round, 33% higher than the P100 and V100 iterations. The HBM2 memory is also clocked at 1215 MHz this round, which is a healthy 38% increase over the V100 and currently represents the fastest HBM2 implementation we've seen. As noted above, while the images show six HBM2 stacks, Nvidia's specs table says the HBM2 has a 5120-bit interface, which is five 1024-bit interfaces. Is an entire HBM2 stack disabled due to yields, or is it just a dummy chip for now? We suspect the former, but Nvidia did not confirm this, saying only that current products are shipping with five HBM2 stacks.Let's reiterate that this GPU is not going into GeForce any time soon. Asked about the consumer line, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted that Nvidia doesn't use HBM2 in consumer parts. We can safely assume there will be GDDR6-equipped Ampere GPUs at some point, but they won't be using the A100 silicon. Which, again, is fair enough. 826mm square and 40GB HBM2 with 1.6 TBps of bandwidth isn't something our consumer PCs really need right now, never mind the FP64 and TF32 clusters or the lack of RT cores.[Obi-wan waves his hand: \"These aren't the GPUs you're looking for.\"](Image credit: Nvidia)The Nvidia A100 should definitely deliver the goods for the target market, though. Along with other architectural enhancements including sparse matrix optimizations where it's (up to?) twice as fast as V100, the A100 has multi-GPU instancing that allows it to be partitioned into seven separate instances. For scale-out applications, then, a single A100 can have 7X the instancing performance of a V100 GPU.Of course, supercomputers wouldn't just want a single A100 card, and while those will exist (for inference and instancing applications, among others), the real power comes in the form of the new Nvidia DGX A100. Packing eight A100 GPUs linked via six NVSwitch with 4.8 TBps of bi-directional bandwidth, it can in effect behave as a single massive GPU with the right workloads. The eight GPUs can also provide 10 POPS (PetaOPS) of INT8 performance, 5 PFLOPS of FP16, 2.5 TFLOPS of TF32, and 156 TFLOPS of FP64 in a single node. And all this can be yours, for only $199,000\u2014well, it could be at some point, as the waiting list is probably already quite long.(Image credit: Nvidia)Need even more performance? Say hello to the Nvidia DGX A100 Superpod. Housing 140 DGX A100 systems, each with eight A100 GPUs (1,120 total A100 GPUs), the A100 Superpod was built in under three weeks and delivers 700 PFLOPS of AI performance. Nvidia has added four such superpods to its Saturn V supercomputer, which previously had 1,800 DGX-1 systems with 1.8 ExaFLOPS of compute. Adding just 560 DGX A100 systems tacks on another 2.8 ExaFLOPS, for a total of 4.6 ExaFLOPS.All of this is great news for supercomputer and HPC use, but it leaves us with very little information about Nvidia's next generation Ampere GPUs for consumer cards. We know that Nvidia crammed in 2.5 times as many transistors in roughly the same die space, which means it could certainly do the same for consumer GPUs. Remove some of the FP64 and deep learning functionality and focus on ray tracing and graphics cores, and the resulting GPU should be very potent. We'll find out just how potent in the coming days.You can view all eight parts of Jensen's keynote here:\n\nPart 1 - Nvidia GTC keynote, introduction to data center computing\nPart 2 - Nvidia GTC keynote on RTX graphics and DLSS, and Omniverse\nPart 3 - Nvidia GTC keynote on GPU accelerated Spark 3.0\nPart 4 - Nvidia GTC keynote on Merlin and recommender system\nPart 5 - Nvidia GTC keynote on Jarvis and conversational AI\nPart 6 - Nvidia GTC keynote on the A100 and Ampere architecture (yeah, this is the one you want)\nPart 7 - Nvidia GTC keynote on EGX A100 and Isaac robotics platform\nPart 8 - Nvidia GTC keynote on Orin and autonomous vehicles\nPart 9 - Nvidia GTC keynote conclusionImage 1 of 21(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (35)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

That's up to 20X faster than the V100's 15.7 TFLOPS of FP32 performance, but that's not an entirely fair comparison since TF32 isn't quite the same as FP32.Right, a better comparison would be with the V100's fp16 tensor TFLOPS. Comparing it with general-purpose FP32 TFLOPS is apples vs. oranges, whereas TF32 vs fp16 tensor TFLOPS is maybe apples vs. pears.\n\nNvidia says elsewhere that the third generation Tensor cores support FP64, which is where the 2.5X increase in performance comes from, but details are a scarce. Assuming the FP64 figure allows similar scaling as previous Nvidia GPUs, the A100 will have twice the FP32 throughput and four times the FP16 performanceUm... don't assume that! Tensor cores are very specialized and support only a few, specific operations. You want to look at their spec for general-purpose fp64 TFLOPS.\n\nIt seems likely the A100 will follow a similar path and leave RT cores for other Ampere GPUs.Agreed.

Previously, he reported on the technology and gaming industries for more than a decade.Nvidia announced a new policy for its GeForce Now cloud gaming service on Wednesday that means publishers and developers will have to opt into the platform to have titles remotely playable via Nvidia servers.\u201cResponse has been strong with over 200 publishers committing to streaming on the service,\u201d reads a blog post from Phil Eisler, Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now vice president. \u201cGoing forward, only the games that are opted in will be available on the service, providing confidence in the GeForce Now game library. Yet some publishers are still figuring out their cloud strategies. Those that haven\u2019t opted in as of May 31 will be removed.\u201d\u201cThose that haven\u2019t opted in as of May 31 will be removed.\u201dThe shift is meant to address disputes over licensing, as Nvidia was including games on the platform without the express permission of some game developers and publishers and then removing the software later, apparently after complaints in private negotiations arose.Unlike Google Stadia, which requires you purchase a separate license to play a game in the cloud, Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now allows subscribers to access their existing library of games bought from storefronts like Epic and Steam. That approach has proved controversial because it raises important, largely unanswered questions about digital ownership and the underlying business models of cloud gaming. For now, it appears Nvidia would like to remain in amicable negotiation with its game publisher partners, many of which it works closely with on its PC graphics cards.One positive note for subscribers is that the change should mean we see far less abrupt removals, as was the case when big publishers like Activision Blizzard and Bethesda yanked entire libraries earlier this year, after GeForce Now exited beta and became a paid service. As of today, publishers that do not opt in GeForce Now by May 31st will have their games removed. Nvidia also shared a list of currently playable titles that will no longer be accessible later this week, including titles in Sega-published franchises like Sonic and Yakuza.GeForce Now already has lost or will soon lose games from these major publishers: Activision Blizzard, Bethesda, Capcom, Crytek, Konami, Xbox Game Studios, Rockstar, Sega, Square Enix, Take-Two / 2K Games, and Warner Bros. But Nvidia says its platform offers access to more than 2,000 titles, and it does include games from major publishers like Bandai Namco, Bungie, CCP Games, Electronic Arts, Epic, Riot, Ubisoft, and Valve.See More: EntertainmentGamingNewsPC GamingTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019Lego announces Pok\u00e9mon sets are coming next yearInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Egg's on our face for that one\u2014the new system packs a pair of AMD Epyc 7742 64-core, 128-thread CPUs, along with 1TiB of RAM, a pair of 1.9TiB NVMe SSDs in RAID1 for a boot drive, and up to four 3.8TiB PCIe4.0 NVMe drives in RAID 0 as secondary storage.\nGoodbye Intel, hello AMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      It seems entirely likely that Nvidia didn't want to monetarily support Intel's plans to muscle in on its own profitable deep-learning turf.\n              \nIntel Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems entirely likely that Nvidia didn't want to monetarily support Intel's plans to muscle in on its own profitable deep-learning turf.\n\nIntel Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The Intel DG1 at least exists\u2014but its leaked benchmarks don't seem impressive, hinting at performance similar to years-old Nvidia GPUs.\n              \nIntel Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Intel DG1 at least exists\u2014but its leaked benchmarks don't seem impressive, hinting at performance similar to years-old Nvidia GPUs.\n\nIntel Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      We've heard rumors of an Xe DG2, but all we've seen so far are concept renderings, not real hardware.\n              \nIntel Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've heard rumors of an Xe DG2, but all we've seen so far are concept renderings, not real hardware.\n\nIntel Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Intel DG1 at least exists\u2014but its leaked benchmarks don't seem impressive, hinting at performance similar to years-old Nvidia GPUs.\n\nIntel Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've heard rumors of an Xe DG2, but all we've seen so far are concept renderings, not real hardware.\n\nIntel Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnically, it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise that Nvidia would tap AMD for the CPUs in its flagship machine-learning nodes\u2014Epyc Rome has been kicking Intel's Xeon server CPU line up and down the block for quite a while now. Staying on the technical side of things, Epyc 7742's support for PCIe 4.0 may have been even more important than its high CPU speed and massive core/thread count.\nGPU-based machine-learning frequently bottlenecks on storage, not CPU. The M.2 and U.2 interfaces used by the DGX A100 each use 4 PCIe lanes, which means the shift from PCI Express 3.0 to PCI Express 4.0 means doubling the available storage transport bandwidth from 32Gbps to 64Gbps per individual SSD.\nThere may have been a little bit of politics lurking behind the decision to change CPU vendors, as well. AMD might be Nvidia's biggest competitor in the relatively low-margin consumer-graphics market, but Intel is muscling in on the data center side of the market. For now, Intel's offerings in discrete GPUs are mostly vapor\u2014but we know Chipzilla's got much bigger and grander plans as it shifts its focus from the moribund consumer-CPU market to all things data center.\nThe Intel DG1 itself\u2014which is the only real hardware we've seen yet\u2014has leaked benchmarks\u00a0that have it competing with the integrated Vega GPU from a Ryzen 7 4800U. But Nvidia might be more concerned about the Xe HP 4-tile GPU, whose 2048 EUs (execution units) might offer up to 36TFLOPS\u2014which would at least be in the same ballpark as the Nvidia A100 GPU powering the DGX unveiled today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDGX, HGX, SuperPOD, and Jetson\nThe DGX A100 was the star of today's announcements\u2014it's a self-contained system featuring eight A100 GPUs, with 40GiB GPU memory apiece. The US Department of Energy's Argonne National Lab is already using one DGX A100 for COVID-19 research. The system's nine 200Gbps Mellanox interconnects make it possible to cluster multiple DGX A100s\u2014but those whose budget won't support\u00a0lots of $200,000 GPU nodes can make do by partitioning the A100 GPUs into up to 56 instances apiece.\nFor those who\u00a0do have the budget to buy and cluster oodles of DGX A100 nodes, they're also available in an HGX\u2014Hyperscale Data Center Accelerator\u2014format. Nvidia says that a \"typical cloud cluster\" comprised of its earlier DGX-1 nodes along with 600 separate CPUs for inference training could be replaced by five DGX A100 units, capable of handling both workloads. This would condense the hardware down from 25 racks to one, the power budget from 630kW to 28kW, and the cost from $11 million to $1 million.\nIf the HGX still doesn't sound big enough, Nvidia has also released reference architecture for its SuperPOD\u2014no relation to Plume. Nvidia's A100 SuperPOD connects 140 DGX A100 nodes and 4PB of flash storage over 170 Infiniband switches, and it offers 700 petaflops of AI performance. Nvidia has added four of the SuperPODs to its own SaturnV supercomputer, which\u2014according to Nvidia, at least\u2014makes SaturnV the fastest AI supercomputer in the world.\nFinally, if the data center's not your thing, you can have an A100 in your edge computing instead, with Jetson EGX A100. There's also the EGX Jetson Xavier NX. For those not familiar, Nvidia's Jetson single-board platform can be thought of as a Raspberry Pi on steroids\u2014they're deployable in IoT scenarios but bring significant processing power to a small form factor that can be ruggedized and embedded in edge devices such as robotics, health care, and drones.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Looks like Nvidia is cooking up a new DGX deep-learning system\n          \n\n            Judging by the heatsinks, that system could preheat Huang's oven by itself.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Salter\nFormer Technology Reporter\n\n\n\n\nJim Salter\nFormer Technology Reporter\n\n\n      Jim is an author, podcaster, mercenary sysadmin, coder, and father of three\u2014not necessarily in that order.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    109 Comments\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Comments\n  \n\n\nForum view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Loading comments...\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrev story\n\n\nNext story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Most Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\nEverything you say to your Echo will be sent to Amazon starting on March 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\u201cAwful\u201d: Roku tests autoplaying ads loading before the home screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\nReport: mRNA vaccines are in RFK Jr\u2019s crosshairs; funding in question\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\nTrump plan to fund Musk\u2019s Starlink over fiber called \u201cbetrayal\u201d of rural US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\nSobering revenue stats of 70K mobile apps show why devs beg for subscriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArs Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

Ampere is a big generational jump in Nvidia\u2019s GPU architecture design, providing what the company says is the \u201clargest leap in performance to date\u201d across all eight generations of its graphics hardware.\nSpecifically, the A100 can improve performance on AI training and inference as much as 20x relative to prior Nvidia data center GPUs, and it offers advantages across just about any kind of GPU-intensive data center workloads, including data analytics, protein modeling and other scientific computing uses and cloud-based graphics rendering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe A100 GPU can also be scaled either up or down depending on the needs, meaning that you can use a single unit to handle as many as seven separate tasks with partitioning, and you can combine them to work together as one large, virtual GPU to tackle the toughest training tasks for AI applications. The \u201cMulti-instance GPU\u201d partitioning feature in particular is novel to this generation, and really helps emphasize the ability of the A100 to provide the most value for cost for clients of all sizes, since one could theoretically replace up to seven discrete GPUs in a data center if you\u2019re already finding you have some headroom on your usage needs.\nAlongside the production and shipping announcement, Nvidia is also announcing that a number of customers are already adopting the A100 for use in their supercomputers and data centers, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and just about every significant cloud provider that exists.\nNvidia also announced the DGX A100 system, which combines eight of the A100 GPUs linked together using Nvidia\u2019s NVLink. That\u2019s also available immediately directly from Nvidia, and from its approved resale partners.\n\n\nTopics\n\na100, AI, Amazon Web Services, Ampere, Artificial Intelligence (AI), computing, Google, GPGPU, GPU, Hardware, integrated circuits, Microsoft, nvidia, video card, web services \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDarrell Etherington\t\n\n\n\nEditor at Large\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tWriter covering space, science and health tech.

It also boasts a third-generation Tensor Core with TF32 precision, representing up to 20 times higher performance compared to the previous generation with no code changes, as well as an additional two times boost with automatic mixed precision and FP16, the vendor said.\n\"The larger number of tensor cores, the different precision levels allowing for different performance scenarios, the partitioning capability, all that is very relevant and important,\" Rutten said.\nBut the new chip, with a thermal design power (TDP) of 400 watts, is more power-intensive than Nvidia's Volta GPU chip, the V100, which had a TDP of 350w, Rutten noted.\nWith the A100, Nvidia clearly has supercomputing in mind, or at least some highly demanding AI inferencing and training workloads. Its need for great power could be unattractive to some enterprises that don't necessarily need such large-scale power for many AI jobs.\n\n\n\nNvidia A100\n  \n\n\n\n\n\"Whether this is the kind of capability [with the A100] that you need for a new AI initiative, that I would doubt,\" Rutten said.\n\n\nSupercomputing applications\nNvidia also revealed a new product in its DGX line -- DGX A100, a $200,000 supercomputing AI system comprised of eight A100 GPUs. The DGX A100, providing 320GB of memory for training huge AI datasets, is capable of 5 petaflops of AI performance. Another new product, the DGX SuperPOD, a cluster of 140 DGX A100 systems, is capable of hitting 700 petaflops of AI computing power, Nvidia said.\nAs far as the core Nvidia A100's position in the market, it's \"objectively fair to say that there is currently no competing product,\" said Rutten.\n\n\n\n    For super users, this is an exceptional processor.\n   \n\nPeter RuttenResearch director of infrastructure systems, platforms and technologies, IDC\n   \n\n\n\n\"In this sense, Nvidia has again succeeded in being far ahead of the competition,\" Rutten said. \"Of course, we don't know what's brewing at competing companies, both incumbents and startups, but I don't expect anything competitive to A100 to be launched anytime soon.\"\nMeanwhile, the DGX SuperPOD will likely be one of the more powerful supercomputers available. Nvidia's previous SuperPOD, built on V100s, is on the Super Computer Top 500 list, Rutten noted.\n\"So, safe to say that a SuperPod with A100s will be listed as well -- and pretty high up,\" he added.\n\n\nAI at the edge\nNvidia also unveiled two new products to its edge computing EGX line -- the EGX A100 and EGX Jetson Xavier NX.\nEnterprises can integrate the EGX A100 converged accelerator, built on the Ampere architecture, into their servers to carry out real-time AI or 5G signal processing on up to 200 Gbps of data.\nEGX Jetson Xavier NX, meanwhile, is a tiny, 70 mm by 45 mm supercomputer designed for high-performance compute or AI workloads in edge systems. The device can deliver up to 21 trillion operations/second (TOPS).\nFor Nvidia, AI at the edge is a critical piece of its market, Rutten said.\n\"AI inferencing will become a larger market than AI training in the near future,\" he said. \"A lot of inferencing will happen at the edge. Nvidia cannot allow itself to let that market slip away to other vendors.\"\nYet, Rutten questioned whether the core A100 platform is the answer for many enterprises' edge computing needs as they evolve.\n\"It could be overkill for an edge solution, except perhaps for very intensive, larger-scale edge deployments,\" he said.\n\n\nNext Steps\nNvidia extends its AI reach with cloud-based development hub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRelated Resources\n\n\nAI Infrastructure: An Insider's Roadmap to Success with Dell and AMD\n\u2013Video\n\n\nAI Supply Chains Under Siege: How to Secure Open-Source AI From Emerging Threats\n\u2013Talk\n\n\nAI\u2019s Next Leap: Smarter, Cheaper, and More Autonomous\n\u2013Video\n\n\nThe Art of Practical AI: Business Optimization Use Cases and Strategies\n\u2013Replay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDig Deeper on AI infrastructure\n\n\n\nNvidia's AI supercomputer garners support of Microsoft, Google\n\n\n\n\nBy: Ed\u00a0Scannell\n\n\n\n\nWhat Microsoft, Nvidia AI supercomputer partnership means\n\n\n\n\nBy: Esther\u00a0Shittu\n\n\n\n\nHPE's low-end supercomputers take aim at the AI market\n\n\n\n\nBy: Ed\u00a0Scannell\n\n\n\n\nAI vendor SambaNova intros next generation of DataScale\n\n\n\n\nBy: Esther\u00a0Shittu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored News\n\n\nThe Future of Private AI: How Industries Take Advantage of AI\n\u2013Equinix\n\n\nPrivate AI Demystified\n\u2013Equinix\n\n\n3 Transformative VDI Use Cases for Hybrid Work\n\u2013Dell Technologies\n\nSee More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRelated Content\n\n\nAWS launches P4d instances for deep learning training\n\u2013 Search Enterprise AI\n\n\nNvidia, University of Florida building AI ...\n\u2013 Search Enterprise AI\n\n\nNew Nvidia, AMD GPUs deliver more memory and speed --...\n\u2013 Search Enterprise AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest TechTarget resources\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness Analytics\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCIO\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Management\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tERP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Business Analytics\n\n\n\n\nData preparation in machine learning: 4 key steps\nData preparation for ML is key to accurate model results.

NVIDIA released a 27-second teaser of him taking \u201cthe world\u2019s largest graphics card\u201d out of an oven. The device appears to be a next-generation NVIDIA DGX computer (without its case).\nThere are some interesting things that can be seen from the above image (as numbered).\n\nFirst, the device appears to have eight enclosed boxes on it. My guess is that these are the individual graphics devices. The most recent DGX-1 contains 16x Volta GPUs spread across eight dual-GPU boards, so it would make sense that the next generation would also have 16 GPUs.\nNote: Comments suggest I\u2019m wrong about #2, #3, and #4. The CPU and RAM should be on a separate board. The numbered components should be interconnect devices. Original post continues below.\nSecond, and possibly more interesting, is that there appears to be six large heatsinks directly beside the eight GPUs. These look like CPU coolers. If that is the case, then it appears like NVIDIA has tripled the number of CPUs from 2x 20-core Xeons to 6x\u2026 somethings. Normally the RAM should be very close to the CPU\u2026 but there is not a lot of space around them. This leads me to\u2026\nThird, hanging on the other side of the cooler stacks, is six clusters of two\u2026 somethings that each seem to contain four\u2026 things. My guess is that these are where the banks of RAM are kept. If that is true, then it would further-suggest that there are six CPUs, each with eight sticks of RAM.\nFourth, there is an extra heatsink right underneath the handle that Jensen used. I do not know exactly what this is, but my guess is that it cools the motherboard\u2019s controller chip. That said, it could also be some form of power delivery.\nEither way, you are clearly not going to put this into your gaming machine. I expect that we will find out what exactly it is on Thursday during NVIDIA\u2019s GTC 2020 online keynote.\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousHere\u2019s Your Ryzen 3 Round Up \n\nNextLexar NM610 500GB SSD, New 3D TLC For Your Data \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nScott Michaud\nScott joined PC Perspective in May 2011.

Announced at the company's long-delayed GTC conference, the A100 isn't intended for gamers, or even for workstation users. Instead, it's the direct replacement to the Volta-based V100 \u2014 a 2017 GPU purpose-built for data centers.Volta never directly came to consumers \u2014 aside from the Titan V and a Quadro workstation card \u2014 but the improvements and tensor cores it introduced were a key part of Turing, the architecture which underpins almost all of NVIDIA's current GeForce and Quadro cards. Whether the next generation of GeForce and Quadro cards are also called Ampere, or something else entirely, you can expect some of the A100\u2019s new features to make their way over \u2014 and a lot of them not to.NVIDIA was a little hazy on the finer details of Ampere, but what we do know is that the A100 GPU is huge. Its die size is 826 square millimeters, which is larger than both the V100 (815mm2) and the NVIDIA\u2019s flagship gaming card, the RTX 2080 Ti (754mm2).ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementThose might not sound like big differences, but the A100 is NVIDIA's first GPU to be built on TSMC's 7nm process -- its current models are on 12nm. That means there\u2019s a roughly 40-percent reduction in the amount of space required for each transistor, which has let NVIDIA, apparently, squeeze 54 billion transistors into the A100. We say apparently because that's such an enormous increase over, say, the 2080 Ti\u2019s 18.6 billion transistors, that it almost feels like someone's done their math wrong. With that said, some quick calculations put the A100's transistor density at around 65 million per square mm, which is within the realms of possibility on TSMC's 7nm process.Moving away from transistors, the A100 has 6,912 FP32 CUDA cores, 3,456 FP64 CUDA cores and 422 Tensor cores. Compare that to the V100, which has 5,120 CUDA cores and 640 Tensor cores, and you can see just how much of an impact the new process has had in allowing NVIDIA to squeeze more components into a chip that\u2019s only marginally larger than the one it replaces.The A100 is being sold packaged in the DGX A100, a system with 8 A100s, a pair of 64-core AMD server chips, 1TB of RAM and 15TB of NVME storage, for a cool $200,000. For context, the DGX-1, a similar system with 8 V100s, cost around $150,000 at launch. That equates to a 33-percent generational price hike, but NVIDIA claims the A100 is 20 times faster at AI inference and training compared to the V100. And AI is really all these cards are likely to be used for \u2014 NVIDIA has already sold DGX A100s to partners in the space, and has sent one to the Argonne National Lab to aid in the fight against COVID-19.This 20x performance jump is partially due to the massive increase in cores, but architectural improvements and new ways of doing math (which we dive into in our video) are likely contributing much more. The A100 is also helped by its memory: It has 40GB of HBM2 memory, compared to the 16GB the V100 launched with (the company bumped the memory on Volta cards to 32GB later), which means each DGX A100 system has 320GB of VRAM to play with.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSo what can this tell us about NVIDIA's much-anticipated new gaming cards? Well, concretely, some of these AI improvements will find their way into GeForce cards, improving performance in upscaling tasks like DLSS, or denoising, which is a key aspect of ray-tracing.In a briefing with reporters, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang all-but-confirmed that, while there\u2019s \u201cgreat overlap in the architecture\u201d between Ampere and the upcoming consumer cards, these gaming cards won\u2019t feature HBM2 memory, and the sizing of the different elements in the chips will be very different, as they\u2019ll be more focused on graphics performance than high-precision math. That means you should expect far higher gains in FP32 compute (which is where that TFLOP figure you hear about whenever a new GPU or console is launched comes from) for consumer cards, given so much of the A100\u2019s die is given over to FP64-focused hardware.Moving into theory crafting, a GeForce GPU the size of a 2080 Ti with a density approaching that of the A100, entirely targeted at gaming, would probably be twice as fast. To be clear, that's highly unlikely to happen: NVIDIA will probably shrink the chip down considerably, reducing its costs and letting it sell much faster cards at similar prices to its current generation. The current rumor du jour comes from the YouTuber Moore's Law is Dead, who suggests that the anticipated \"3080 Ti\" will have around 30-percent more cores than the 2080 Ti, which could make for a flagship GPU on a much-more reasonable 450mm2 die. Will a smaller die mean GPU prices go down? Given those specs will likely put NVIDIA\u2019s offerings ahead of AMD\u2019s rumored new cards, we doubt it.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

The 4x GPU \u201cRedstone\u201d platform is a smaller NVLink mesh platform that is designed to be a lower-cost option.\nNVIDIA A100 4x GPU HGX Redstone Platform\nThe NVIDIA A100 \u201cRedstone\u201d HGX platform is important since it is a smaller and less complex version of the HGX A100 platform. The Redstone platform incorporates 4x SXM NVIDIA A100 GPUs onto a PCB. As we saw with the Tesla A100 overview, the new GPUs have 12x NVlinks per GPU. Each NVLink provides 50GB/s of GPU-to-GPU bandwidth for 600GB/s total.\nNVIDIA A100 NVLink Bandwidth\nRedstone takes those 12 NVLinks and splits them into three groups. Instead of the\u00a0NVIDIA NVSwitch solution we see on the HGX A100 platform, we get a mesh topology without switching. NVIDIA has offered both switched and non-switched systems for some time.\nNVIDIA NVSwitch System\nThis type of topology, NVIDIA has been using for years and is the basis for many important compute nodes. For example, Summit uses NVLink directly attached between Tesla V100 GPUs. With four GPUs per node, each GPU can talk directly to every other GPU.\nIBM Power9 Talk At Hot Chips 31 OpenCAPI And NVLink Accelerator Bandwidth\nThe importance of Redstone is that the smaller HGX A100 4 GPU board uses much less power due to having fewer GPUs and omitting NVSwitch. Leaving NVSwitch out also means one saves on per-node systems costs. If you simply wanted to 7 MIGs per Tesla A100 up to 4 Tesla A100\u2019s per instance, then this topology can make a lot more sense. Supermicro, along with other vendors are adding A100 4 GPU systems to their portfolios.\nSupermicro HGX A100 4x GPU Board Redstone Example\nAs with the larger HGX A100 option, these GPUs have PCIe Gen4 connectivity to their hosts. One can use the HGX A100 4 GPU Redstone board with Intel Xeon Scalable, however, to get full PCIe Gen4 performance one needs to use the AMD EPYC 7002 family or potentially an emerging Arm or POWER option.\nYou can see the Supermicro Redstone platform based on the AMD EPYC 7002 Rome series here:\nSupermicro HGX A100 4x GPU Redstone Platform\nThis is a great example of how server OEMs can take the HGX A100 4 GPU platform and innovate to provide their own feature sets around the new Ampere generation.\nFinal Words\nFor many organizations, the 4x GPU mesh architecture has made a lot of sense. The new HGX A100 4 GPU Redstone platform makes integration of these solutions much easier but also moves some of the design differentiation away from NVIDIA\u2019s partners. Still, this seems to make sense from an industry perspective. Other companies, such as Dell have focused on these 4x Tesla GPU compute nodes for its customers instead of pushing larger solutions. For customers who want the smaller, less costly, and less complex form factor, Redstone makes a lot of sense.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSAmpereHGXNVIDIATeslaTesla A100 \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleNVIDIA A100 Ampere Resets the Entire AI IndustryNext articleDiscussing Next-Gen OCP NVMeoF Solution with Inspur Patrick Kennedyhttps://www.servethehome.comPatrick has been running STH since 2009 and covers a wide variety of SME, SMB, and SOHO IT topics.

With this series, we\u2019re taking an engineering-focused look at individual autonomous vehicle challenges and how the NVIDIA DRIVE AV Software team is mastering them. Catch up on our earlier posts, here.\nIntersections are common roadway features, whether four-way stops in a neighborhood or traffic-light-filled exchanges on busy multi-lane thoroughfares.\nGiven the frequency, variety and risk associated with intersections \u2014 more than 50 percent of serious accidents in the U.S. happen at or near them \u2014 it\u2019s critical that an autonomous vehicle be able to accurately navigate them.\nHandling intersections autonomously presents a complex set of challenges for self-driving cars. This includes the ability to stop accurately at an intersection wait line or crosswalk, correctly process and interpret right of way traffic rules in various scenarios, and determine and execute the correct path for a variety of maneuvers, such as proceeding straight through the intersection and unprotected intersection turns.\nEarlier in the DRIVE Labs series, we demonstrated how we detect intersections, traffic lights, and traffic signs with the WaitNet DNN. And how we classify traffic light state and traffic sign type with the LightNet and SignNet DNNs. In this episode, we go further to show how NVIDIA uses AI to perceive the variety of intersection structures that an autonomous vehicle could encounter on a daily drive.\n\nManual Mapmaking\nPrevious methods have relied on high-definition 3D semantic maps of an intersection and its surrounding area to understand the intersection structure and create paths to navigate safely.\nHuman labeling is heavily involved to create such a map, hand-encoding all potentially relevant intersection structure features, such as where the intersection entry/exit lines and dividers are located, where any traffic lights or signs are, and how many lanes there are in each direction. The more complex the intersection scenario, the more heavily the map would need to be manually annotated.\nAn important practical limitation of this approach is lack of scalability. Every intersection in the world would need to be manually labeled before an autonomous vehicle could navigate them, which would create highly impractical data collection, labeling, and cost challenges.\nAnother challenge lies in temporary conditions, such as construction zones. Because of the temporary nature of these scenarios, writing them into and out of a map can be highly complex.\nIn contrast, our approach is analogous to how humans drive. Humans use live perception rather than maps to understand intersection structure and navigate intersections.\nA Structured Approach to Intersections\nOur algorithm extends the capability of our WaitNet DNN to predict intersection structure as a collection of points we call \u201cjoints,\u201d which are analogous to joints in a human body. Just as the actuation of human limbs is achieved through connections between our joints, in our approach, actuation of an autonomous vehicle through an intersection may be achieved by connecting the intersection structure joints into a path for the vehicle to follow.\nFigure 1 illustrates intersection structure prediction using our DNN-based method. As shown, we can detect and classify intersection structure features into different classes, such as intersection entry and exit points for both the ego car and other vehicles on the scene, as well as pedestrian crossing entries and exits.\nFigure 1. Prediction of intersection structure. Red = intersection entry wait line for ego car; Yellow = intersection entry wait line for other cars; Green = intersection exit line. In this figure, the green lines indicate all the possible ways the ego car could exit the intersection if arriving at it from the left-most lane \u2013 specifically, it could continue driving straight, take a left turn, or make a U-turn.\nRather than segment the contours of an image, our DNN is able to differentiate intersection entry and exit points for different lanes. Another key benefit of our approach is that the intersection structure prediction is robust to occlusions and partial occlusions, and it\u2019s able to predict both painted and inferred intersection structure lines.\nThe intersection key points of figure 1 may also be connected into paths for navigating the intersection. By connecting intersection entry and exit points, paths and trajectories that represent the ego car movements can be predicted.\nOur live perception approach enables scalability for handling various types of intersections without the burden of manually labeling each intersection individually. It can also be combined with map information, where high-quality data is available, to create diversity and redundancy for complex intersection handling.\nOur DNN-based intersection structure perception capability will become available to developers in an upcoming DRIVE Software release as an additional head of our WaitNet DNN.

Mellanox and NVIDIA have developed open networking software together since 2013.\u00a0 Mellanox products are deployed in many of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers and largest hyperscale data centers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Mellanox Spectrum switches already ship with Cumulus Linux and SONiC, the open-source offering for Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud and managed by the Open Compute Project.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith Mellanox, the new NVIDIA has end-to-end technologies from AI computing to networking, full-stack offerings from processors to software, and significant scale to advance next-generation data centers,\u201d said \u00a0Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA at the close of that acquisition.\nThe Nvidia/Cumulus combination expands that plan and enables the new era of the accelerated, software-defined data center, said Amit Katz, a vice president of Ethernet Switch at NVIDIA (who until last week had the same title at Mellanox) in a blog about the acquisition. With Cumulus, NVIDIA can innovate and optimize across the entire networking stack from chips and systems to software including analytics, he stated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result of both acquisitions is a stronger NVIDIA data-center hardware and software portfolio \u2013 its data center group made close to $1 billion in revenue in the last quarter and is growing at better than a 50% clip year-over-year\u00a0\u2013 that would bring it further into the enterprise-network and cloud-computing contest with the likes of Arista, Cisco, HPE, Dell EMC, VMware and others, many of which are also its allies. NVIDIA, Mellanox and Cumulus also have a big presence in some huge hyperscaler and big white-box customers, environments including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, and Oracle.\nOthers see the Nvidia Cumulus buy as a further \u00a0shrinking of open networking software options. For example, Arista recently bought open software-defined networking and cloud-software vendor Big Switch Networks for an undisclosed amount.\n\u201cThese recent acquisitions are evidence that the great disruption that was predicted around software defined and open networking a decade ago is happening right now. At that time, the companies that were most competitive in creating a viable open networking ecosystem were Cumulus, Big Switch and Pluribus Networks,\u201d said \u00a0Kumar Srikantan, CEO of Pluribus Networks in a statement.\n\u201cWith Big Switch and Cumulus being acquired by vertically-integrated system providers, Pluribus Networks is well-positioned to both remain independent and scale into a disruptive force as the market moves well beyond the original hyperscaler segment to achieve increasingly broad adoption in service provider and enterprise private cloud deployments,\u201d Srikantan stated. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRelated content\n\n \n\n\nNews\n\nTop network and data center events 2025\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Denise Dubie \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n4 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCloud Computing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Center\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetwork Security\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\nEnterprises reevaluate virtualization strategies amid Broadcom uncertainty\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Neal Weinberg \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n11 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetwork Management Software\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetworking Devices\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\n5 alternatives to VMware vSphere virtualization platform\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Neal Weinberg \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n4 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetworking Devices\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tServer Virtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nVergeIO enhances VergeFabric network virtualization offering\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Sean Michael Kerner \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 13, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n5 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Center\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSDN\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Sections\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPODCASTS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVIDEOS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRESOURCES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEVENTS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotlight: Managing modern risks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom our editors straight to your inbox\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tGet started by entering your email address below.\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email address\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                        by                                                             \n                                                                Michael Cooney                                                            \n\n\nSenior Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Michael Cooney on X\n\n\nFollow Michael Cooney on LinkedIn\n \n\n\n\nMichael Cooney is a Senior Editor with Network World who has written about the IT world for more than 25 years.

We expected the reveal to manifest in the form of a massive data center GPU, and Huang\u2019s extra-large serving indeed looks like the \u201cDGX A100.\u201d DGX is the brand for Nvidia\u2019s Tesla-loaded graphics workstations, and Nvidia recently filed a trademark for \u201cDGX A100.\u201d\n\n[ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ]\n\n\n \n\n\nWe\u2019d expect to see Ampere-based consumer GeForce graphics cards later this year, powered by the same underlying graphics technology as the Tesla GPUs inside the DGX A100.\nNvidia hasn\u2019t uttered a peep about its next-gen GPUs beyond this video and a cheeky call to \u201cGet Amped\u201d for the GTC 2020 digital keynote. Ampere\u2019s expected to make the leap to the 7nm transistor process that helped give AMD\u2019s \u201cNavi\u201d Radeon GPUs a huge increase in power efficiency. After losing the 7nm race to AMD, Nvidia must be excited to put its best foot forward before Radeon rolls out more powerful \u201cBig Navi\u201d GPUs later this year.\n\n\n\nBoth Big Navi and the next-gen PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles debuting later this year will be built on AMD\u2019s RDNA 2 graphics tech, bringing ray tracing capabilities to the Radeon lineup for the first time. Nvidia (with Microsoft) put ray tracing on the map, so we\u2019d expect the ultra-competitive company to fight tooth and nail with its hardware. Current rumors suggest that Nvidia\u2019s next-gen hardware will include a sizeable boost in real-time ray tracing performance.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nZotac Gaming GeForce RTX 2070 Super Mini\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFingers crossed that new-look GeForce GPUs will bolster traditional rendering speeds, too. Despite introducing ray tracing to the masses, the GeForce RTX 20-series found itself rocked by controversy, as most of the consumer graphics cards weren\u2019t any faster than their GTX 10-series predecessors in traditional games (read: 99 percent of games) for the same price. Months later, the RTX \u201cSuper\u201d refreshes rectified the situation, and Nvidia\u2019s vastly improved DLSS 2.0 is now firing on all cylinders, too.\nHopefully, Nvidia learned its lesson after RTX 20-series got off to a slower-than-expected sales start. Even in data center form, we can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s next on Thursday. \u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Project timelines continue to shrink. And with many people working remotely, a fast and reliable computer is more important than ever.\nNew NVIDIA-powered laptops and mobile workstations from Dell, HP and Microsoft give creators amazing choices to turn their imagination into actual creations.\nThese new systems launch just shy of the one-year anniversary of our introduction of NVIDIA Studio, a platform featuring dedicated drivers, performance-enhancing software development kits, and thin and light RTX Studio laptops purpose-built for creators.\nSince then, we\u2019ve worked with every major system manufacturer to expand the RTX Studio lineup and provide a wide range of choices that feature NVIDIA Quadro and GeForce RTX GPUs. In total, there are now 78 RTX Studio systems.\nDell-ightful RTX Studio Laptops and Mobile Workstations\nDesigned to be Dell\u2019s most powerful XPS laptop ever, the XPS 17 muscles through intensive creative projects and gaming alike, with up to NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 graphics. Thanks to a thin bezel design, it\u2019s the smallest 17-inch laptop, with similar dimensions to a typical 15-inch one.\nDell XPS 17\nPacking this much performance into an RTX Studio laptop of this size requires a little engineering ingenuity to keep the system performing smoothly. Under the hood is a new proprietary thermal design that provides more overall airflow and higher sustained performance to fuel the most demanding projects.\nToday, Dell announced it has reengineered its Precision workstation portfolio. These RTX Studio mobile workstations are designed to handle demanding workloads like 8K editing, 3D rendering, data analysis and CAD modeling. The Precision 5750 and 7000 series mobile workstations are ISV certified and feature Quadro RTX graphics.\nDell Precision 5750\nThe Dell Precision 5750 allows creators and engineers to see and do more with up to Quadro RTX 3000 graphics and a 16:10, four-sided InfinityEdge (up to HDR 400) display. For editors, engineers and scientists running intensive workloads, the Dell Precision 7550 and Dell Precision 7750 are available with up to Quadro RTX 5000 GPUs. They\u2019ve been reengineered with more power and intelligent performance in an even smaller, lighter footprint.\nA Laptop to ENVY\nHP\u2019s new Create Ecosystem is empowering creators of all types. That starts with the HP ENVY 15 that\u2019ll be available later this month on HP.com.\nHP ENVY 15\nThe ENVY 15 is an RTX Studio laptop that can be configured with up to a GeForce RTX 2060 GPU for the ultimate in creator performance. It also features an all-aluminum chassis with 82.8 percent screen-to-body ratio, up to a 4K OLED VESA DisplayHDR 400 True Black display with touch interface display, 10th gen Intel processors, and gaming-class thermals.\nCreative pros will want to keep an eye out for HP\u2019s ZBook Studio and ZBook Create. Shipping later this year, they provide true mobility without compromise, thanks to Quadro and GeForce RTX GPUs, respectively. These systems also feature an 87 percent screen-to-body ratio and bring creators the first DreamColor display with all-day battery life.\nInside the Surface\nMicrosoft recently announced their most powerful laptop ever, the Surface Book 3. And it\u2019s being powered by Quadro RTX and GeForce GTX graphics. The Surface Book 3 has the power of a desktop, the versatility of a tablet and the freedom of a thin and light laptop in one beautifully designed device.\nMicrosoft Surface Book 3\nIn addition to NVIDIA graphics, the Surface Book 3 can be configured with 10th Generation Intel Core processors, up to 32GB of RAM, the fastest SSD Microsoft has ever shipped, a beautifully crisp, high-DPI PixelSense display, and up to 17.5 hours of battery life.\nSurface Book 3 starts at $1,599 and will be available starting May 21.\nGPU-Accelerated Exports in Adobe Premiere Pro\nThese new laptops will take advantage of over 200 NVIDIA GPU-accelerated creative and design applications, including one major addition released just yesterday.\nAdobe Premiere Pro is helping content creators go from concept to completion faster with new GPU-accelerated exports. With NVIDIA encoder acceleration in Adobe Premiere Pro, editors can export high-resolution videos up to five times quicker than on CPU.\nAdobe Premiere Pro, now with NVENC support\nCreators can still take advantage of a limited time offer. Purchase a new RTX Studio laptop or desktop and both new and existing Adobe users get a free three-month subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud.\nThese new laptops, along with 10 recently announced RTX Studio laptops powered by new GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs, are powering the creative intersection between imagination and innovation.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Studio and RTX Studio systems. And stay tuned for exciting announcements as the platforms continue to grow.\n\n\nCategories: Laptops | Mobile | WorkstationTags: GeForce | NVIDIA RTX | NVIDIA Studio | RTX Mobile Workstations \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The initiative includes a commitment from UF to hire 100 faculty members specifically focused on AI, in addition to the 500 new faculty hired across disciplines -- many of whom will integrate AI into their teaching and research.\u200b UF is also embarking on a unique plan to infuse AI across academic majors, creating a next generation AI-enabled workforce and democratizing a technology that has the potential to solve some of the globe's most formidable challenges.\u00a0\n\u201cArtificial intelligence is poised to transform the way we all work with information, helping us address challenges and make discoveries that once seemed unattainable,\u201d UF President Kent Fuchs said. \u201cBy immersing this powerful technology in the curriculum across UF, we are positioning Florida as a global leader in a technological revolution that -- similar to the smartphone -- will transform the way we live, work and interact with the world around us.\u201d\n\u201cAI is transforming every industry, and the NVIDIA DGX A100 will help the University of Florida bring AI training, inference and data science into every field of study,\u201d said Charlie Boyle, vice president and general manager of DGX systems, NVIDIA. \u201cAs the world\u2019s most advanced AI system, DGX A100 will position the University of Florida to teach tomorrow\u2019s leaders to harness the powers of AI as they take on our greatest challenges.\u201d\nThe DGX A100 , which consolidates the performance and capabilities of an entire data center, supporting training, inference and analytics workloads on a single system for the first time, is an important building block in UF\u2019s technological AI infrastructure. With the advanced workload of DGX A100, data that might previously have taken years for researchers to compile and analyze can be processed in minutes. Applicable across disciplines, UF\u2019s commitment to the future of AI will raise the university\u2019s national profile and position it as a global leader in addressing some of society\u2019s most pressing challenges and opportunities, such as rising seas, aging populations, data security, climate change, personalized medicine, urban transportation and food insecurity.\n\u201cArtificial intelligence is already changing the way fields such as medicine, engineering, agriculture, business and pharmacy operate, and this trend will only accelerate as AI becomes ubiquitous,\u201d said Joe Glover, UF provost. \u201cAt UF, we see an opening to position ourselves as a global leader and to help lead the nation to develop an advanced workforce trained and capable in AI.\"\u00a0\nThe initiative has generated enthusiasm across the university. In April, 590 faculty and researchers from across UF participated in an AI Retreat, which included planning for how powerful AI technology will be integrated across academic curricula, offer new opportunities for workforce partnerships, and raise UF's national research profile.\n\n\n\n\nBrittany Wise/\nMay 14, 2020\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\u00a0\nUniversity of Florida,Gainesville, FL 32611\nnews@ufl.edu\n3523920186\n\n\nNews Categories \n\nAgriculture + Environment\nArts + Media\nBusiness + Economics\nCampus + Community\nEducation\nGovernment + Society\nHealth + Science\n\n\n\nFor Faculty  \n\nFaculty Resources\nSenior Communicators\n\n\n\nFor Media\n\nContact\nSubscribe to News Releases\nUF Facts for Media\nUF Administration\nUF Directory\nHurricane Hub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2025\r\n                                  University of Florida\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nPrivacy Statement\n\n\nAcceptable Use Policy\n\n\nText Only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Cumulus offers both its own Linux distribution for network switches, as well as tools for managing network operations. With Cumulus Express, the company also offers a hardware solution in the form of its own data center switch.\nThe two companies did not announce the price of the acquisition, but chances are we are talking about a considerable amount, given that Cumulus had raised $134 million since it was founded in 2010.\nMountain View-based Cumulus already had a previous partnership with Mellanox, which Nvidia acquired for $6.9 billion. That acquisition closed only a few days ago. As Mellanox\u2019s Amit Katz notes in today\u2019s announcement, the two companies first met in 2013, and they formed a first official partnership in 2016. Cumulus, it\u2019s worth noting, was also an early player in the OpenStack ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving both Cumulus and Mellanox in its stable will give Nvidia virtually all the tools it needs to help enterprises and cloud providers build out their high-performance computing and AI workloads in their data centers. While you may mostly think about Nvidia because of its graphics cards, the company has a sizable data center group, which delivered close to $1 billion in revenue in the last quarter, up 43% from a year ago. In comparison, Nvidia\u2019s revenue from gaming was just under $1.5 billion.\n\u201cWith Cumulus, NVIDIA can innovate and optimize across the entire networking stack from chips and systems to software including analytics like\u00a0Cumulus NetQ, delivering great performance and value to customers,\u201d writes Katz. \u201cThis open networking platform is extensible and allows enterprise and cloud-scale data centers full control over their operations.\u201d\n\n\nTopics\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI), computing, Cumulus Networks, Enterprise, linux, Mellanox, Mergers and Acquisitions, nvidia, Startups, telecommunications \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tFrederic Lardinois\t\n\n\n\nEditor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore he joined TechCrunch in 2012, he founded SiliconFilter and wrote for ReadWriteWeb (now ReadWrite).

In the age of AI, a new \u201cbuilding material\u201d will serve as the cornerstone of modern data centers: the NVIDIA DGX A100.\nMany of the biggest challenges and opportunities organizations now face are rooted in data. The DGX A100, the world\u2019s most advanced AI system, empowers organizations to solve problems in record time while providing revolutionary elasticity and agility in delivering AI computing power across analytics, training and inference.\nCombining multiple DGX systems, last year we introduced the DGX SuperPOD, which achieved top 20-class performance at a fraction of the cost and energy usage of typical supercomputers.\nToday, we\u2019re lifting the curtain on our second-generation SuperPOD, which offers record-breaking performance and was deployed in just three weeks. It dismantles the notion that it takes many months to build a world-class AI supercomputing cluster.\nBuilt on NVIDIA DGX A100 systems and NVIDIA Mellanox network fabric, SuperPOD shows that it\u2019s possible to deliver a platform that can reduce processing times on the world\u2019s most complex language understanding models from weeks to under an hour.\nRethinking Infrastructure Scaling\nWhether you need a supercomputing cluster to solve huge, monolithic problems, or a center of excellence to democratize access to resources across all of your researchers and developers, AI is a significant infrastructure commitment.\nA big part of that has traditionally included pre-planning how big you\u2019ll have to scale, and then laying down the network fabric to support that end goal from day one. This approach was needed to make growth possible, but it created significant upfront costs.\nWith NVIDIA Mellanox technology, we\u2019re redefining the data center with an architecture that can parallelize the most complex problems and solve them as fast as possible. The DGX A100 comes new Mellanox ConnectX-6 VPI network adaptors with 200Gbps HDR InfiniBand \u2014 up to nine interfaces per system. We\u2019re taking advantage of Mellanox switching to make it easier to interconnect systems and achieve SuperPOD-scale.\nWith DGX SuperPOD and DGX A100, we\u2019ve designed the AI network fabric to make growth easier with a pay-as-you-grow model, while minimizing impact to operations along the way.\nDeployment end-states no longer need to be the starting point \u2014 we\u2019ve modularized SuperPOD into scalable groups of 20 DGX A100 systems. Each is supported by a two-tiered fat-tree switch network topology, using Mellanox HDR InfiniBand, delivering full bi-section bandwidth with no oversubscription. And by adding a third switching tier, you can scale to thousands of systems using DragonFly+ or fat-tree topologies as part of our extended reference designs.\nWith this new unit of scale, organizations can enjoy a more linear approach to growth, with more modest incremental spend associated with the addition of each 20-system module.\nExpanding DGX SATURNV with SuperPOD\nThe DGX SATURNV powers NVIDIA\u2019s most important work, from R&D and autonomous vehicle system development to gaming and robotics. And SATURNV isn\u2019t static \u2014 it continually grows in response to business demand. This makes it the perfect proving ground for our new SuperPOD design.\nLeading up to our DGX A100 announcement, our engineers deployed our newest SuperPOD to deliver approximately 700 petaflops of AI performance. This expansion incorporated:\n\n140 DGX A100 systems\n1,120 NVIDIA A100 GPUs\n170 Mellanox Quantum 200G InfiniBand switches\n15km of optical cable\n4PB of high-performance storage\n\nFor the storage infrastructure in the expansion, we partnered with DDN. As one of our DGX POD partners, they\u2019re helping us bring the performance and scale needed for our AI infrastructure offerings. SuperPOD let us put DDN technology to work supporting the most challenging workloads we could throw at our most advanced system.\nThe Best Architecture for Scaling\nNot all AI projects require a DGX SuperPOD. But every organization aspiring to infuse their business with AI can leverage the power, agility and scalability of DGX A100 or a DGX POD.\nForward-looking organizations focus on protecting customer loyalty, reducing costs and distancing themselves from competitors. AI is uniquely beneficial in all of these areas.\nBut AI innovation moves fast, with models and datasets exponentially increasing in size.

These workloads benefit from GPU chips because they are tightly coupled with accelerated hardware.\nMedia and entertainment companies rely on HPC for animation, special effects rendering, and media transcoding. These tasks are characterized by bursty workloads requiring hundreds or even thousands of nodes running in parallel.\nFinancial technology companies run HPC tasks for risk analysis, high frequency trading, and financial modeling. This industry has occasional demands for lots of compute and storage resources, such as when running quarterly reports.\nAutomotive companies run complex simulations throughout the design, manufacture, and testing of new vehicles. HPC workloads support computer-aided engineering models for crash testing, simulations, and various types of analyses.\nOil and gas companies depend on HPC for geological modeling to predict where to find oil and natural gas resources. These jobs require spatial analysis, seismic analysis, and very large data sets.\nAerospace companies require HPC infrastructure for computational fluid dynamics, such as simulating airflow over airplane wings. These simulations require a lot of nodes, each with lots of CPUs and memory.\n\n\u00a0\nNVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\n\nScales up to clusters of thousands of interconnected servers running GPUs to power the most demanding AI and HPC workloads\nCan partition each A100 GPU into as many as seven GPU instances using its multi-instance GPU feature to optimize utilization, and extend access to more teams and services\nProvides the ability to scale down and partition into virtual GPUs to accommodate workloads that run best in a scaled down architecture\nAdvances all major deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch and Caffe\nOperates with more than 650 GPU applications for HPC and AI such as MATLAB, Gaussian and NAMB\n\n\u00a0\nThe new GPU bare metal shape, BM.GPU4.8, will feature 8 x 40 GB NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, all interconnected via NVIDIA NVLink. The CPU on board has 64 physical cores of AMD Rome processors running at 2.9 GHz. The new bare metal instance has 2,048 GB of memory, 24 TB NVMe, 1.6 Tbps throughput with RDMA provided by Oracle\u2019s Cluster Networking.

After all, what are you doing when you go to someone for advice? When you\u2019re looking for feedback? You\u2019re asking for a recommendation.\nNow, driven by vast quantities of data about the preferences of hundreds of millions of individual users, recommender systems are racing to get better at doing just that.\nSign up now for the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute workshop.\nThe internet, of course, already knows a lot of facts: your name, your address, maybe your birthplace. But what the recommender systems seek to learn better, perhaps, than the people who know you are your preferences.\nKey to Success of Web\u2019s Most Successful Companies\nRecommender systems aren\u2019t a new idea. Jussi Karlgren formulated the idea of a recommender system, or a \u201cdigital bookshelf,\u201d in 1990. Over the next two decades researchers at MIT and Bellcore steadily advanced the technique.\nThe technology really caught the popular imagination starting in 2007, when Netflix \u2014 then in the business of renting out DVDs through the mail \u2014 kicked off an open competition with a $1 million prize for a collaborative filtering algorithm that could improve on the accuracy of Netflix\u2019s own system by more than 10 percent, a prize that was claimed in 2009.\nOver the following decade, such recommender systems would become critical to the success of Internet companies such as Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, Baidu and Alibaba.\nVirtuous Data Cycle\nAnd the latest generation of deep-learning powered recommender systems provide marketing magic, giving companies the ability to boost click-through rates by better targeting users who will be interested in what they have to offer.\nNow the ability to collect this data, process it, use it to train AI models and deploy those models to help you and others find what you want is among the largest competitive advantages possessed by the biggest internet companies.\nIt\u2019s driving a virtuous cycle \u2014 with the best technology driving better recommendations, recommendations which draw more customers and, ultimately, let these companies afford even better technology.\nThat\u2019s the business model. So how does this technology work?\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 Recommender Systems 101: NVIDIA\u2019s Even Oldridge Breaks It Down \u2013 Ep. 164\nCollecting\u00a0 Information\nRecommenders work by collecting information \u2014 by noting what you ask for \u2014 such as what movies you tell your video streaming app you want to see, ratings and reviews you\u2019ve submitted, purchases you\u2019ve made, and other actions you\u2019ve taken in the past\nPerhaps more importantly, they can keep track of choices you\u2019ve made: what you click on and how you navigate. How long you watch a particular movie, for example. Or which ads you click on or which friends you interact with.\nAll this information is streamed into vast data centers and compiled into complex, multidimensional tables that quickly balloon in size.\nThey can be hundreds of terabytes large \u2014 and they\u2019re growing all the time.\nThat\u2019s not so much because vast amounts of data are collected from any one individual, but because a little bit of data is collected from so many.\nIn other words, these tables are sparse \u2014 most of the information most of these services have on most of us for most of these categories is zero.\nBut, collectively these tables contain a great deal of information on the preferences of a large number of people.\nAnd that helps companies make intelligent decisions about what certain types of users\u00a0 might like.\nContent Filtering, Collaborative Filtering\nWhile there are a vast number of recommender algorithms and techniques, most fall into one of two broad categories: collaborative filtering and content filtering.\nCollaborative filtering helps you find what you like by looking for users who are similar to you.\nSo while the recommender system may not know anything about your taste in music, if it knows you and another user share similar taste in books, it might recommend a song to you that it knows this other user already likes.\nContent filtering, by contrast, works by understanding the underlying features of each product.\nSo if a recommender sees you liked the movies \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail\u201d and \u201cSleepless in Seattle,\u201d it might recommend another movie to you starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, such as \u201cJoe Versus the Volcano.\u201d\nThose are extremely simplistic examples, to be sure.\nData as a Competitive Advantage\nIn reality, because these systems capture so much data, from so many people, and are deployed at such an enormous scale, they\u2019re able to drive tens or hundreds of millions of dollars of business with even a small improvement in the system\u2019s recommendations.\nA business may not know what any one individual will do, but thanks to the law of large numbers, they know that, say, if an offer is presented to 1 million people, 1 percent will take it.\nBut while the potential benefits from better recommendation systems are big, so are the challenges.\nSuccessful internet companies, for example, need to process ever more queries, faster, spending vast sums on infrastructure to keep up as the amount of data they process continues to swell.\nCompanies outside of technology, by contrast, need access to ready-made tools so they don\u2019t have to hire whole teams of data scientists.\nIf recommenders are going to be used in industries ranging from healthcare to financial services, they\u2019ll need to become more accessible.\nGPU Acceleration\nThis is where GPUs come in.\nNVIDIA GPUs, of course, have long been used to accelerate training times for neural networks \u2014 sparking the modern AI boom \u2014 since their parallel processing capabilities let them blast through data-intensive tasks.\nBut now, as the amount of data being moved continues to grow, GPUs are being harnessed more extensively. Tools such as RAPIDS, a suite of software libraries for accelerating data science and analytics pipelines much more quickly, so data scientists can get more work done much faster.\nAnd NVIDIA\u2019s just announced Merlin recommender application framework promises to make GPU-accelerated recommender systems more accessible still with an end-to-end pipeline for ingesting, training and deploying GPU-accelerated recommender systems.\nThese systems will be able to take advantage of the new NVIDIA A100 GPU, built on our NVIDIA Ampere architecture, so companies can build recommender systems more quickly and economically than ever.\nOur Recommendation?

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I cover emerging technologies with a focus on infrastructure and AIFollow AuthorMay 17, 2020, 10:45am EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.The GPU Technology Conference is the most exciting event for the AI and ML ecosystem. From researchers in academia to product managers at hyperscale cloud companies to IoT builders and makers, this conference has something relevant for each of them.\u00a0\n\nAs an AIoT enthusiast and a maker, I eagerly look forward to GTC. Due to the current COVID-19 situation, I was a bit disappointed to see the event turning into a virtual conference. But the keynote delivered by Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA made me forget that it was a virtual event. Jensen\u2019s keynote was set in the kitchen of his California home which became the center stage for the game-changing technologies debuted at GTC.\u00a0\n\nJensen Huang, CEONVIDIA\nI love Jensen\u2019s passion and conviction for technology. He makes a strong and compelling pitch for the new hardware and software products from NVIDIA. GTC 2020 was no different. Jensen was at his best when he unveiled the next-generation GPU technology from NVIDIA - Ampere.\u00a0\n\n\nAmpere is the successor to Volta, the GPU architecture that powers a variety of AI accelerators in the data center and the cloud. Ampere becomes the unified and consistent GPU technology platform from the edge to the cloud. It becomes the cornerstone of NVIDIA\u2019s AI strategy and product portfolio.\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at NVIDIA Ampere and the related products.\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\nAmpere - The core of artificial intelligence workloads\n\nAmpere features the third generation of Tensor Core - a chip that\u2019s purpose-built for accelerating AI. Tensor Core was first introduced in NVIDIA Volta architecture in 2017 which dramatically changed the time it took to train complex deep learning models. Ampere supports new data types including Tensor Float (TF32) and Floating Point 64 (FP64) that make it possible to train models with increased precision.\nA100 GPU based on Ampere architectureNVIDIA\n\n\nWhen training complex deep learning models based on images and videos, it\u2019s a common practice to convert the data type to a lower bit data type such as FP16 to speed up the process. But the side effect of this is the loss of precision. With Ampere, NVIDIA makes it possible to use the native data type to train models without any tradeoff between speed and precision. Using a technique called Automatic Mixed Precision, researchers can gain an additional 2X performance by mixing and matching FP32 and FP16 by adding just a couple of lines of code.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a common practice to apply quantization - a process to optimize the fully trained model for inference by replacing higher bit data type such as FP32 and FP16 with INT8 and INT4. The quantization technique speeds up the forward propagation of deep learning neural networks during inference. Ampere also supports data types such as bfloat16, INT8 and INT4 typically used for inference. The ability to accelerate both training and inference of deep learning models makes Ampere the most versatile GPU in the industry.\u00a0\nThe Ampere architecture boasts of the fastest memory with 1.6 terabytes per second (TB/sec) bandwidth, which is a 67 percent increase over Volta. It also comes with more on-chip memory, including a 40 megabyte (MB) level 2 cache which is 7X larger than the previous generation. The enhanced memory architecture maximizes the compute performance of VMs in IaaS and servers in the data center.\u00a0\nAmpere also makes it possible to slice a GPU into multiple virtual GPU instances. This concept is known as Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) that expands the performance and value of each Tensor Core GPU. MIG can partition the A100 GPU into as many as seven instances, each fully isolated with their own high-bandwidth memory, cache, and compute cores. MIG enables cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP to offer GPU instances in multi-tenant, virtualized environments without compromising on performance.\u00a0\nAmpere comes with the next generation of NVLink, the technology that connects multiple GPUs for parallel computing. The third generation of NVIDIA NVLink built for Ampere doubles the GPU-to-GPU direct bandwidth to 600 gigabytes per second (GB/s), almost 10X higher than PCIe Gen4. To enable all the Ampere-based GPUs connected to the same server to talk to each other, NVIDIA has updated NVSwitch that delivers a whopping 9.6 TB/s total aggregate bandwidth. The second-generation NVSwitch for Ampere can connect up to 16 GPUs.\u00a0\nThe Ampere architecture is built to deal with structural sparsity of deep learning models without losing accuracy. Sparsity is a technique that carefully omits unneeded weights and parameters of a neural network without compromising on the accuracy. The NVIDIA Ampere architecture takes advantage of the prevalence of small values in neural networks in a way that benefits the widest possible swath of AI applications. Specifically, it defines a method for training a neural network with half its weights removed, or what\u2019s known as 50 percent sparsity.\nA100 - The first AI accelerator to be powered by Ampere\nThe A100 GPU is the first commercially available AI accelerator based on the Ampere architecture. It\u2019s the workhorse of the next-generation products including DGX, HGX and EGX. A100 will have massive adoption due to its unified support for training and inference.\nDGX A100 - The last thing an enterprise needs for cutting-edge AI\nDGX, the flagship appliance from NVIDIA is refreshed for A100. It\u2019s a one-stop-shop for running AI workloads in training and inference modes. NVIDIA calls the DGX A100 as the universal system for all AI infrastructure, from analytics to training to inference. Enterprises can run accelerated ETL jobs based on RAPIDS while using TensorFlow and PyTorch for training models. They can host models for inference by taking advantage of TensorRT and MIG. One hardware and software platform for data preparation, training and inference is a huge benefit for data scientists, ML engineers, and DevOps teams in an enterprise.\u00a0DGX A100NVIDIA\nNVIDIA is also offering a super computer based on DGX A100, the DGX Pod, which boasts of a\u00a0 64 node cluster of DGX A100 machines. This is undoubtedly the world\u2019s most powerful AI computer.\u00a0\nHGX A100 - The hyperscale data center AI accelerator\u00a0\nIf DGX A100 is targeted towards enterprises, the HGX A100 is for webscale and hyperscale infrastructure providers. It comes with three configurations - 4-GPU, 8-GPU and 16-GPU.HGX A100NVIDIA\nNVIDIA has partnered with Alibaba, Amazon, Baidu, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, and Tencent to bring A100 to the public cloud. Expect a new family of VMs and instances for AI from these cloud providers.\u00a0\nEGX A100 - Bringing The Power of A100 to the edge\nWhile DGX and HGX family of products target enterprises and hyperscale providers, EGX A100 aims to bring the power of the A100 accelerator to the edge.

It looks like NVIDIA has registered a trademark for its new DGX system over at Justia which was spotted by Komachi (via Videocardz). Being an HPC product, it makes a lot of sense for NVIDIA to be filing a trademark for a new DGX system that will go on to house its next-generation graphics processing units.\nNVIDIA's DGX A100 Trademark Spotted - Powered by The Next-Generation Ampere GA100 Flagship GPU\nThe specific name for the DGX system is DGX A100 which has a lot to say. The DGX system is solely designed for the deep learning and HPC community, offering supercomputing capabilities inside a workstation form factor. NVIDIA has released DGX solutions based on its Pascal and Volta GPUs but with the release of Ampere GPU imminent, a new DGX solution has to be designed.\nRelated Story Watch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For UnveilingThe Volta line of DGX systems was streamlined to offer more options to HPC users. We saw several variants ranging from the DGX Station which featured a total of four Tesla V100 GPUs all the way to the 16 Tesla V100 housing DGX-2 monster which NVIDIA had termed as the \"World's Largest GPU\".\n\nWith Ampere GPU, NVIDIA would be releasing its latest DGX A100 system. The name makes it clear that the system would be based on the GA100 GPU. The GA100 GPU would be the biggest chip in the Ampere lineup and would definitely feature one of the flagship 128 SM configurations that we expect to see on an NVIDIA GA100 chip. NVIDIA may start off its Ampere line of DGX systems in a more traditional manner, offering 8 Tesla GPU configurations in the beginning and moving on to the larger and denser parts later on as the yields get better for the new Ampere chips.\nA picture of the NVIDIA DGX A100 trademark. (Image Credits: Videocardz)\nWhile the Ampere GPU would remain the key component of the DGX system, it will be interesting to see where NVIDIA goes with the rest of the tech configuration on its DGX A100 systems. NVIDIA's current DGX-2 system makes use of Intel's Xeon Platinum processors based on the 14nm Skylake architecture. It also features 1.5 TB of memory and a range of NV Switches which act as the main protocol channel between GPUs. NVIDIA would further expand its NVLINK & NVSwitch proprietary interconnect technologies in Ampere based systems, offering higher bandwidth and tighter links for faster GPU-to-GPU communications than existing products.\nIt will also be interesting to see NVIDIA offer users a choice to select between an Intel Xeon or an AMD EPYC powered DGX A100 system. AMD's EPYC GPUs have been winning the hearts of several top-tier HPC customers and is being embedded in some of the world's faster supercomputers that will become operational in a few years.\n\nThis would be a great opportunity for NVIDIA to have a lead as the first GPU carrier offering DNN/DL solutions featuring both Intel & AMD HPC chips. We will have to wait and see if this happens but even if NVIDIA goes all onboard with Intel again, then it will make sense from an optimization perspective as NVIDIA's previous line of DGX system had lots of optimizations embedded for Intel's Xeon CPUs.\nNVIDIA Tesla Graphics Cards Comparison\n\n\n\nTesla Graphics Card NameNVIDIA Tesla M2090NVIDIA Tesla K40NVIDIA Telsa K80NVIDIA Tesla P100NVIDIA Tesla V100NVIDIA Tesla Next-Gen #1NVIDIA Tesla Next-Gen #2NVIDIA Tesla Next-Gen #3\n\n\n\n\nGPU ArchitectureFermiKeplerMaxwellPascalVoltaAmpere?Ampere?Ampere?\n\n\nGPU Process40nm28nm28nm16nm12nm7nm?7nm?7nm?\n\n\nGPU NameGF110GK110GK210 x 2GP100GV100GA100?GA100?GA100?\n\n\nDie Size520mm2561mm2561mm2610mm2815mm2TBDTBDTBD\n\n\nTransistor Count3.00 Billion7.08 Billion7.08 Billion15 Billion21.1 BillionTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nCUDA Cores512 CCs (16 CUs)2880 CCs (15 CUs)2496 CCs (13 CUs) x 23840 CCs5120 CCs6912 CCs7552 CCs7936 CCs\n\n\nCore ClockUp To 650 MHzUp To 875 MHzUp To 875 MHzUp To 1480 MHzUp To 1455 MHz1.08 GHz (Preliminary)1.11 GHz (Preliminary)1.11 GHz (Preliminary)\n\n\nFP32 Compute1.33 TFLOPs4.29 TFLOPs8.74 TFLOPs10.6 TFLOPs15.0 TFLOPs~15 TFLOPs (Preliminary)~17 TFLOPs (Preliminary)~18 TFLOPs (Preliminary)\n\n\nFP64 Compute0.66 TFLOPs1.43 TFLOPs2.91 TFLOPs5.30 TFLOPs7.50 TFLOPsTBDTBDTBD\n\n\nVRAM Size6 GB12 GB12 GB x 216 GB16 GB48 GB24 GB32 GB\n\n\nVRAM TypeGDDR5GDDR5GDDR5HBM2HBM2HBM2eHBM2eHBM2e\n\n\nVRAM Bus384-bit384-bit384-bit x 24096-bit4096-bit4096-bit?3072-bit?4096-bit?\n\n\nVRAM Speed3.7 GHz6 GHz5 GHz737 MHz878 MHz1200 MHz1200 MHz1200 MHz\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth177.6 GB/s288 GB/s240 GB/s720 GB/s900 GB/s1.2 TB/s?1.2 TB/s?1.2 TB/s?\n\n\nMaximum TDP250W300W235W300W300WTBDTBDTBD\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's Ampere GPUs are definitely going to shake things up in the HPC market with several variants already leaked and performance\u00a0being rated at around 30 TFLOPs (FP32).

The news is interesting because previously, NVIDIA had opted to release its professional and consumer line of products under two different architectures.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB MemoryThe NVIDIA GeForce 20 (RTX), GeForce 16 (GTX) and Quadro RTX lineups featured the Turing GPU architecture while the professional Tesla hardware featured the Volta GPU architecture. There is an exception in the case of Quadro series which had both Volta and Turing based offerings and so is the case with the Titan series which are prosumer variants. Regardless, both GPU architectures ended up being vastly different than each other although the fundamental design was similar to each other.\n\nAccording to Jensen, all next-generation products will be featuring the same NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture. The first outing of Ampere will be for the cloud and research segment in the form of the Ampere GA100 GPU which is designed solely for the HPC environment. The gaming cards will definitely feature Ampere GPUs but will come later.\nAmpere will eventually replace Nvidia\u2019s Turing and Volta chips with a single platform that streamlines Nvidia\u2019s GPU lineup, Huang said in a pre-briefing with media members Wednesday. While consumers largely know Nvidia for its videogame hardware, the first launches with Ampere are aimed at AI needs in the cloud and for research.\n\u201cUnquestionably, it\u2019s the first time that we\u2019ve unified the acceleration workload of the entire data center into one single platform,\u201d Huang said. - Market Watch\nThe other interesting thing that Jensen stated during the interview session was that while both consumer and enterprise GPUs will feature the Ampere GPU architecture, there would be a great overlap between the microarchitecture itself. This suggests that while all Ampere GPUs will have some fundamental similarities, the will end up being vastly different based on their respective segment while featuring similar configurations.\nNvidia did not release any information Wednesday about consumer GPUs using Ampere, but when asked by a reporter in the briefing about the difference between enterprise and consumer approaches to Ampere, Huang said \u201cthere\u2019s great overlap in the architecture, but not in the configuration.\u201d - Market Watch\nThat's something to be expected as HPC GPUs generally feature a lot of hardware-level integrations that aren't beneficial for the consumer market. Take for example the double-precision cores which are not that much of a use for gaming PCs as of yet. The HPC GPUs also feature 64 cores per SM as seen with Pascal and Volta GPUs while the consumer cards feature 128 cores per SM.\n\nIt is likely that a Titan variant will feature the full-fat Ampere core but downscaled for the prosumer market but other than that, the overall chip design for consumers and enterprise markets will look very different. As for what to expect from NVIDIA's Ampere GPU based GeForce graphics cards, there are a lot of rumors on the internet but I suggest we rather wait and dissect the Ampere GPU architecture itself and try to figure out what the consumer lineup would look like.\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA GeForce 'Ampere' GPU are you waiting for the most?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n160\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

In this review, we will look at the NVIDIA Quadro P2200 graphics card, which we first saw in our Intel NUC9VXQNX review here. The Quadro P2200 is an upgrade over the Quadro P620 which we reviewed here. While the Quadro P2200 is not what we would call a \u201cheavy hitter\u201d in the graphics area, it is designed for a different market. With a single-slot cooler and 75W power envelope, it can integrate into a single PCIe\u00a0 x16 slot without additional power or slot requirements. For users, it provides enhanced capabilities for streaming and necessary certifications for applications, plus four DisplayPort outputs for multi-monitor setups.\nNVIDIA Quadro P2200 Overview\nThe NVIDIA Quadro P2200 GPU has a length of 7.9\u201d long, and a height of 4.4\u201d. It is a single-slot graphics card using a blower type cooler. This size allows for better integration into more platforms that do not have room for larger GPUs.\nNVIDIA Quadro P2200 Front\nNVIDIA Quadro P2200 does not use a backplate as we see in many commercial GPU\u2019s.\nNVIDIA Quadro P2200 Back\nThe NVIDIA Quadro P2200 is a single-slot graphics card with the bulk of the card being taken up bu the blower-style cooler while still maintaining a very low profile. What is somewhat interesting is that the GPU cooler is offset. It sits slightly off of one end of the PCB while stopping well short of the display headers.\nNVIDIA Quadro P2200 Top\nSince the card needs a blower-style cooler to keep a single-slot form factor, that limits cooling options. Further, the quad DisplayPort output is a key feature that takes up the majority of the rear I/O faceplate. As a result, the hot air from the GPU will be partially expelled through the perforations in the rear I/O faceplate but mostly back into the chassis.

NVIDIA certainly seems to think so. According to a report from Heise, Nvidia has dropped the name Tesla which has been standing since 2007. It will leave only the GeForce brand and the Quadro brand as only of the names that have been standing for a long time. Tesla started off with the C870 released in the summer of 2007 and the most recent one being the Tesla T4 which has been secretly rebranded the T4, just cutting off the Tesla branding. This name change actually occurred last year but remained hidden until now.\nNVIDIA Has Allegedly Dropped Tesla Branding To Avoid Confusion Between Them And Tesla Automobiles\nThe reasoning behind the name change was not unreasonable. The name change was determined to be the correct move because they do not want to confuse their graphics card with the Tesla brand of cars. They find the risk of confusion to be too great to run the risk of using the same name. The Tesla brand has been the center of Nvidia's data center division. As I said earlier, Nvidia changed the Tesla T4 to the T4 in a hidden maneuver layer, but retailers have not done the same as partner manufacturers still bearing the name.\nRelated Story Ampere Intros AmpereOne Aurora SOC, Up To 512 Cores, 3x Performance Increase & Compatible With Air-Cooling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nWe saw Nvidia GA100 accelerator unveiled a few days ago, and that's when some got wind of the name change. A card that is supposedly 20 times more powerful than the Volta chips and the largest chip to date. The card started in 2007 with a blower-style design on the C870 but has shifted to be a more server friendly passive cooling heat pipe system. The difference between Quadro and Tesla can be seen on the GV100 which has a Tesla and a Quadro version with the Quadro having more display ports. The Quadro will still stand, but no longer will the Tesla stand.\nIt is quite sad to see the Tesla name go, but it is equally justified to remove any confusion with the cars. It is exciting to see where they go from here, but it is unfortunate it will not continue under the Tesla brand.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAmpereOne-3 Chiplet CPU To Feature 256 Cores on TSMC\u2019s 3nm Node With PCIe 6.0 & DDR5, Launches Next Year\n\nMuhammad Zuhair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Instinct MI300X AI GPU Is Causing \u201cHeadaches\u201d For Competitors As It Receives Massive Interest\n\nMuhammad Zuhair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Plans Cut-Down Instinct AI Accelerators For China To Comply With US Policies\n\nMuhammad Zuhair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmpere Computing Intros AmpereOne CPUs: Up To 192 Cores, 8-Channel DDR5, 128 PCIe Gen5, 350W TDP\n\nJason R.

Scribe, an end-to-end speech recognition solution specifically optimized for the finance and business community. Scribe leverages the latest deep learning techniques to process more audio in less time with better accuracy.\nOver the past decade, S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global, has transcribed more than 100,000 hours of earnings calls. Using NVIDIA NeMo on NVIDIA GPUs, Kensho trained Scribe to systematically transcribe tens of thousands of earnings calls, management presentations, and acquisition calls each year - improving accuracy and enabling S&P Global to increase earnings call coverage by more than 25%. \n\"Technology and data science are playing a crucial role in how we bring value to our customers,\" said Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Market Intelligence. \"Kensho's collaboration with NVIDIA exemplifies S&P Global's commitment to leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning to deliver our clients the essential intelligence they need to make informed business decisions with conviction.\"\nScribe is purpose-built to handle the complexities of financial audio \u2013 including financial jargon, product names and industry-specific terminology. Scribe's syntactic capabilities seamlessly enable enumeration, capitalization and determination of sentence structure, while significantly outperforming other commercial solutions on business and financial audio. Scribe, among a suite of other AI-enabled capabilities designed to streamline workflows, will soon be available on the S&P Global Marketplace.\u00a0\nKensho and NVIDIA are actively exploring further opportunities for collaboration. Kensho is already experimenting with NVIDIA NeMo acoustic model, which helps researchers quickly integrate model components, pushing the envelope of automatic speech recognition even further.\nTo see a demo or learn more about Scribe, please contact [email\u00a0protected]. \nAbout Kensho Technologies Inc.Kensho is a machine intelligence company founded out of Harvard University in 2013 and acquired by S&P Global in 2018.

The software is capable of analyzing the whole human genome DNA sequence in under 20 minutes.\nNVIDIA also introduced GPU-accelerated RNA-sequencing pipelines that return results in less than 2 hours, giving researchers critical insights into patient susceptibility to disease, its progression\u00a0and response to treatment.\nIn addition, NVIDIA released a set of AI models that can help researchers detect and study infected patients through chest CT scan data. Jointly developed by NVIDIA\u2019s applied research team and clinicians and data scientists at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) through a cooperative research and development agreement, the models used data from locations with high rates of COVID-19 infections, including China, Italy, Japan\u00a0and the United States.\nThe AI models were built using the NVIDIA Clara application framework for medical imaging. NVIDIA Clara contains domain-specific AI training and deployment workflow tools that allowed NVIDIA and NIH to develop the models in under three weeks.\nFinally, the new NVIDIA Clara Guardian application framework enables a critically needed ecosystem of AI solutions for hospital public safety and patient monitoring by transforming everyday sensors into smart sensors. Critical use cases include automated body temperature screening, protective masks detection, safe social distancing\u00a0and remote patient monitoring.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LARGER TREND\nIn a HIMSS20 Digital presentation, leaders from Google Cloud, Nuance and the Health Data Analytics Institute agreed that AI and machine learning technologies are key to responding to the coronavirus pandemic, and how they can aid patients and providers.\u00a0\nHealthcare technology company Cerner and Amazon Web Services also teamed up to offer researchers fighting the COVID-19 pandemic access to de-identified patient data for them to build intelligent models, which could in theory anticipate patient outcomes or help improve predictive analytics, HealthCare IT News reported.\u00a0\nLast October, the University of California, San Francisco partnered with NVIDIA to develop new AI tools for radiology. The AI projects include brain tumor segmentation, liver segmentation and clinical deployment, leveraging NVIDIA\u2019s Clara healthcare toolkit and the tech giant's DGX-2 AI system.\nON THE RECORD\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has supercharged the collaboration of technology, research and the healthcare industry to develop new computing solutions that accelerate the understanding of the spread, scale and severity of this disease,\u201d said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at\nNVIDIA.\u00a0\n\u201cNever before has there been such a critical need to apply the best AI technology and accelerated computing to every facet of healthcare, and its effects will be felt widely beyond this pandemic and across healthcare going forward.\u201d\nTopics:\u00a0Analytics, Artificial Intelligence\nMore regional news\n\n\n\n\nHHS layoffs temporarily reversed by federal judgeBy Jeff LagasseMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\nHow leveraging cardiac data via RPM can help overcome many clinical challengesBy Bill SiwickiMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\nEHRs and agentic AI: Balancing human and automated collaborationBy Andrea FoxMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to get more stories like this\n          one?
