Since taking the reins in 1965, he's led his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) to an average annual gain of 20.1%, which translates into an aggregate return of 3,641,613%, as of the end of 2021. Though no investor is infallible, Buffett's knack for picking winners has earned him a captive audience.\nThe easiest way for investors to ride the Oracle of Omaha's coattails is to track Berkshire Hathaway's required quarterly Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBuffett's \"hidden\" portfolio purchased three fast-growing companies in the second quarter\nA 13F is essentially a snapshot of what the brightest money managers with at least $100 million in assets under management were holding at the end of the most recent quarter. It allows investors to see what these fund managers have been buying, selling, and holding, as well as establish what trends or industries are piquing the attention of professional money managers. Berkshire Hathaway filed its 13F exactly one week ago today, on Aug. 15.\nHowever, you might be surprised to learn that Berkshire Hathaway's 13F fails to tell the full story behind Buffett's direct and indirect holdings. For instance, you won't find any information about Warren Buffett's most-purchased stock over the past four years in Berkshire's 13F. That's because stock buybacks are only disclosed in the company's quarterly operating results. Since July 2018, Buffett and his right-hand man Charlie Munger have overseen the repurchase of $62.1 billion of Berkshire Hathaway's Class A and Class B (BRK.B) shares.\nSomething else Berkshire Hathaway's 13F doesn't disclose is Warren Buffett's secret portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in 1998, the Oracle of Omaha's company acquired reinsurer General Re for $22 billion. While the prize of this deal was the reinsurance operations, General Re also ran a specialty investment subsidiary known as New England Asset Management (NEAM). When the deal closed, NEAM and its assets under management became an owned entity of Berkshire Hathaway.\nEven though Buffett and his investment team don't oversee the $5.9 billion New England Asset Management has in assets under management (as of June 30), the securities NEAM owns are, ultimately, part of Berkshire Hathaway.\nAccording to New England Asset Management's latest 13F filing, Buffett's \"hidden\" portfolio bought three brand-new supercharged growth stocks.\u00a0\n\nNvidia\nAlthough the Oracle of Omaha isn't big on buying fast-growing tech stocks, he's now the proud indirect owner of shares of Nvidia (NVDA -2.71%). The 13F filing with the SEC notes that NEAM acquired more than 3,000 shares of the graphics card and networking solutions company during the second quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thought process behind adding Nvidia probably has to do with some combination of shares losing about half their value at one point during the second quarter and the company's enticing longer-term growth outlook for a variety of its operating segments.\nWhile Nvidia is likely best-known for its graphics cards, which have performed relatively well with the release of new gaming consoles and the rise of cryptocurrency mining, it's the company's data center solutions that are its most intriguing growth driver. Businesses were already shifting data into the cloud at a steady pace prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In its wake, the pace of this shift has accelerated, putting even more data center demand on the table. For the time being, only supply chain concerns have slowed Nvidia's sustainable double-digit annual growth opportunity in data center solutions.\u00a0\nThe company's ancillary operating segments could also become stars by the midpoint of the decade. Providing solutions to next-generation vehicles, including autonomous vehicles, as well as offering a gateway to the metaverse with its professional visualization software, gives Nvidia supercharged growth potential from what are currently smaller revenue operating segments.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNextEra Energy\nThe second fast-paced growth stock added during the second quarter by Buffett's secret portfolio is electric utility NextEra Energy (NEE -2.14%). Although NextEra isn't generating the same type of annual revenue growth as tech stocks, it is substantially outpacing the growth rate of pretty much all other utility stocks and has done so for more than a decade. Relative to its peers, NextEra is absolutely a supercharged growth stock.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes NextEra Energy such a superstar among utility stocks is its renewable-energy projects. Among U.S. utilities, none is generating more capacity from wind and solar. With up to $55 billion set aside for predominantly green energy projects between 2020 and 2022, and the company forecasting up to 36,900 megawatts of renewable energy projects in its backlog between 2022 and 2025, no other utility looks close to challenging NextEra as the renewable energy kingpin.\u00a0\nAlthough wind, solar, and energy storage projects can be costly, the company was able to take advantage of years of historically low interest rates to advance its green energy push. The end result is significantly reduced electricity generation costs and a compound annual growth rate that's stayed in the high single digits for over a decade.\nAs an added bonus, NextEra Energy is also a Dividend Aristocrat. This is a term bestowed on S&P 500-listed companies that have raised their base annual dividend for at least 25 consecutive years. NextEra has increased its payout for 28 consecutive years, with management anticipating double-digit percentage increases in the company's base annual distribution through 2024.\n\nChewy\nThe third and final supercharged growth stock added to Warren Buffett's secret portfolio during the second quarter is online-based pet food and treats company Chewy (CHWY -3.42%). New England Asset Management opened its position with a stake of more than 1,600 shares.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best aspects of pet industry stocks is that they're practically recession-proof. According to data from the American Pet Products Association, the percentage of U.S. households that own a pet hit an all-time high (at least during the APPA's period of survey-taking) of 70% in 2022. Further, it's been at least a quarter of a century, if not much longer, since year-over-year pet spending in the U.S. declined. No matter what you throw at pet owners, they're always willing to open their wallets to ensure the health and happiness of their furry, feathered, scaled, and gilled family members.\nAside from operating in a highly defensive industry, what makes Chewy so great is its online focus. Partnering with over 3,000 brands and offering north of 100,000 products online, Chewy has made itself a go-to e-commerce shop for pet owners. Since it doesn't have to spend its time guessing what products to put in brick-and-mortar stores, Chewy is able to generate juicier gross margins than most traditional retail operators in the pet industry.\nWhat's more, Chewy is using innovation to its advantage. It recently partnered with Trupanion to introduce CarePlus, a health insurance and wellness plan that covers preventative care and surgeries.\u00a0 The addressable pet insurance market in the U.S. has hardly been penetrated. This should give Chewy and Trupanion a long runway to offer what should be a high-margin insurance product.\n\n\n\nSean Williams has positions in NextEra Energy. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Berkshire Hathaway (B shares), Chewy, Inc., NextEra Energy, Nvidia, and Trupanion. The Motley Fool recommends the following options: long January 2023 $200 calls on Berkshire Hathaway (B shares), short January 2023 $200 puts on Berkshire Hathaway (B shares), and short January 2023 $265 calls on Berkshire Hathaway (B shares).

While no specific hostile military action has been taken by either nation, China has been rattling its saber. Mainland China recently restarted military drills near Taiwan after its neighbor received a visit from U.S. lawmakers. This delegation included members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Wall Street Journal reports that those present discussed the maintenance of regional stability and increasing trade relations between the two nations. If tensions do boil over then investors will be considering the best stocks to watch to avoid global conflict-induced turbulence.\nAnd the financial world is definitely nervous about the prospect. Business leaders across the globe are quietly but increasingly preparing for a possible conflict between the two nations. As the Financial Times notes: \u201cThe intensified planning by business leaders in the US, Europe, Japan and elsewhere is a signal that investors in China no longer consider an invasion of Taiwan to be merely a low probability \u2018black swan\u2019 risk to the world\u2019s second-biggest economy.\u201d\nNow, the U.S. foreign policy community is mixed about\u00a0the prospects of war any time soon. There currently doesn\u2019t seem to be much pressure from China\u2019s domestic audience for war but that could always change.\nMost major interstate conflicts are seen as black swan risks, meaning they\u2019re highly unlikely events. But ever since Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year, the world has had to accept that a similar event is possible in East Asia. That unprecedented conflict has led to significant turbulence in financial markets. Now is the time for investors to protect their portfolios if war breaks out between China and Taiwan too.\nLet\u2019s take a look at seven stocks to watch for investors concerned about China and Taiwan tensions boiling over.\n\n\n\n\nTicker\nCompany\nPrice\n\n\nTSM\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company\n$89.57\n\n\nAAPL\nApple\n$174.58\n\n\nUMC\nUnited Microelectronics Corporation\n$7.13\n\n\nNVDA\nNvidia\n$187.95\n\n\nTSLA\nTesla\n$917.39\n\n\nTXN\nTexas Instruments\n$179.99\n\n\nAMD\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n$100.26\n\n\n\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM)\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\nIt\u2019s a safe bet that Taiwan\u2019s leading electronics producers would be hit hard if war broke out. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) has carved out a lucrative niche for itself as a producer of high-end chips. Many of the U.S. tech sector\u2019s biggest names depend on TSMC\u2019s products. Although Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is its biggest client, the company\u2019s long client list includes Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). And that concern deservedly puts TSM at the top of this list of stocks to watch if tensions boil over in East Asia.\nInvestors should note that all companies that buy from TSMC would be negatively affected if Taiwan is attacked. But as a leading Taiwanese company that primarily caters to the U.S., TSMC is a company that China would target. At the very least, it would be forced to suspend operations.\nWhile it is unclear for how long, TSMC should be on every list of stocks to watch if the conflict between China and Taiwan escalates. Mark Liu, the company\u2019s chairman, recently told CNN that an invasion would render TSMC unable to operate. Many companies would suffer under such an invasion but TSMC might be the worst affected.\n\nApple (AAPL)\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\nThe largest company by far on this list of stocks to watch is the tech juggernaut Apple. As noted, Apple is heavily dependent on chips produced by TSMC. Their relationship has proven highly profitable for both companies in better times. In April 2022, DigiTimes Asia reported that: \u201cTSMC is estimated to rake in revenues of [$17.024 billion] from fulfilling Apple orders in 2022.\u201d The outlet also noted that represented a significant increase from the previous year. As Apple moves to scale production, it makes sense that its reliance on its chief chip maker would be increasing.\nSemiconductors are used in almost every type of consumer electronic device from smartphones to personal computers. Additionally, Apple\u2019s foray into the metaverse promised to increase its need for chips even more. TSMC holds a unique position within Apple\u2019s network as the only company to produce series-A chips for it.\nAccording to Investopedia: \u201cApple accounts for about one-fifth of TSMC\u2019s annual revenue.\u201d If geopolitical events compromise one, it would be very bad for both companies, rendering Apple unable to fulfill orders. The tech giant would be forced to find another chipmaker. But TSMC\u2019s primary competitor is also based in Taiwan. The growing demand for current and upcoming iPhones has kept AAPL stock a hedge fund favorite. But if its primary chip provider is knocked out of commission, that could quickly change. According to Liu, \u201cthe war brings no winners, everybody\u2019s losers.\u201d But TSMC and Apple would likely be the two biggest losers.\n\nUnited Microelectronics Corporation (UMC)\nSource: Ascannio via shutterstock\nThis smaller chip maker is also based in Taiwan. United Microelectronics (NYSE:UMC) produces semiconductor wafers in metal casting foundry facilities. While it often plays second fiddle to TSMC, that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be pushed down if China moves to invade or blockade. Small companies often move in solidarity with their larger peers but UMC has actually been outperforming TSMC throughout the month.\nThat said, everything that applies to the latter likely applies to its smaller peer. If TSMC is indeed rendered unable to operate, as Liu predicts, UMC would likely face the same fate. The smaller company doesn\u2019t have a client list of top U.S. tech companies but it does cater to Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), a tech producer that also relies heavily on chips. Other clients include Taiwanese firms MediaTek and Realtek which also might be shut down if war breaks out.\nExposure to both U.S. and Asian markets puts the company at significant risk. Jack DeGan, the chief investment officer of Harbor Advisory, recently discussed this with Reuters. As he noted: \u201cChip stocks are really exposed to Asia. Some of them, especially chip equipment companies, have 70% of their sales in that region so it\u2019s a big deal for them.\u201dA war would likely compromise UMC\u2019s client relationships in both Taiwan and China.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\nExperts have been worried about Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) lately. The recent CHIPS Act passed by Congress is seen as bad news for the metaverse darling. As InvestorPlace\u2019s Louis Navellier notes:\nThis bill, which will provide subsidies to the U.S. semiconductor manufacturing industry, is seen as good news for chip makers who produce their own chips, but for \u2018fabless\u2019 chip companies like Nvidia, which outsource production.\nSpecifically, Nvidia outsources its chip production to TSMC, like its Silicon Valley peer Apple. \u201cTSMC manufactures the bulk of [Nvidia\u2019s chips], and with TSMC hit by the [potential] Chinese invasion, [NVDA] will also suffer as a consequence,\u201d reports Insider Monkey. In March 2022, Citi analyst Christopher Danely predicted that if China moved to take over Taiwan, investors would gravitate towards companies with low reliance on TSMC. Since Nvidia\u2019s exposure to TSMC is roughly 50%, it makes sense that this type of speculation would push NVDA stock down.\nMonths later, invasion fears are rising and NVDA stock is not performing well, indicating that this prediction is correct. Clearly, investors should keep this one on their list of stocks to watch for more reasons than just Taiwan.\n\nTesla (TSLA)\nSource: Zigres / Shutterstock.com\nIt\u2019s well known that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is heavily dependent on China. The country accounts for 34% of the global electric vehicle (EV) market. This means that if anything were to endanger U.S. relations with China, it would be very bad for EV producers. China has already imposed sanctions on Taiwan following the U.S. visit earlier this month. In the event of a war, if the U.S. continues to send aid to the smaller nation, China could retaliate with sanctions against American companies that build in China.\nTesla would likely be among the hardest hit companies. A significant portion of its growing business stems from EV production and sales in China. In June 2022, Tesla\u2019s EV sales in China reached a new record just two months after being shut down. Insider EVs reported that: \u201cTesla\u2019s cumulative wholesale volume from the Tesla Gigafactory 3 as of the end of June is close to 905,000, including roughly 606,000 in the past 12 months.\u201d The Shanghai gigafactory has become a critical part of Tesla\u2019s empire, helping it reach a 3 million car milestone. If it were rendered unable to build and/or sell in China, TSLA stock would suffer. Additionally, Tesla\u2019s primary battery cell supplier is the Chinese firm Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL). Sanctions against the U.S. could render it unable to export to U.S. clients, causing more production problems.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN)\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\nExperts flagged this semiconductor and integrated circuit producer as a winner from the CHIPs Act. Unfortunately, Texas Instruments stands to fall significantly if tensions between China and Taiwan escalate. TI already saw revenue fall in April 2022 when China\u2019s government imposed industry-wide shutdowns to curb the spread of Covid-19. Like Tesla, it is a U.S. company that both produces and sells in China. Both operations would likely be compromised if China imposes sanctions against the U.S. It doesn\u2019t help that the company has invested significantly in expanding its China base.\nIn May 2022, Seeking Alpha reported that \u201cChina [has been] the main driver of sales growth for Texas Instruments since the United States, Japan, Asia excl. China and Europe, Middle East and Africa all grew at a significantly lower rate during the past few years.\u201d The author noted that while he saw positioning improve for TI, high exposure to China remained a significant risk. Now it is an even greater one. Any time problems arise in China, TXN is a stock that suffers. Its high exposure to the country and overall reliance on its Asian market operations put it at risk if tensions in East Asia escalated.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\nIf Nvidia is on a list of stocks to watch, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) will usually be there as well. Like Nvidia, this chipmaker grew steadily in late 2021 amid the metaverse boom but has struggled throughout most of 2022. Insider Monkey notes that: \u201cIf China invades Taiwan, [AMD\u2019s] manufacturing line could be significantly impacted as tensions between the US and China escalate.\u201d That is certainly true, given that AMD\u2019s exposure to TSMC is 55%, even higher than Nvidia\u2019s. As of the end of 2021, AMD accounted for more than 4% of TSMC\u2019s business, making it the firm\u2019s third largest customer behind Apple and MediaTek.\nAMD has a long history with China that helped the company turn itself around in just a few years. However, its partnerships with Chinese military contractors have worried U.S. national security officials. If China and Taiwan were to go to war, AMD would be in a difficult position. Regardless of how any conflict transpires, a stock like AMD with ties to both nations would be pushed down for as long as tensions persist. Both China and the U.S. would likely move to impose sanctions on the other.\nAMD, as a U.S.-based company that depends on a Taiwanese company but maintains strong ties to China, would have no good moves to weather the storm.\nOn the date of publication, Samuel O\u2019Brient\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2022/08/7-stocks-to-watch-in-case-china-taiwan-tensions-rise/.\n\u00a92025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Headlines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMore from InvestorPlace\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHot Stocks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Top Stocks to Buy Under Trump Come From Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018BRAIN\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Luke Lango, InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Danger that Could Derail Our Economy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Jeff Remsburg, Contributing Editor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Prediction Came True: Where to Find Opportunity Despite Market Unpredictability\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Eric Fry, Editor, Fry's Investment Report\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTop Stories\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFeb 8, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWolfpack Research Short Report Sends B.

Grab has reported a loss of US$572 million ($794 million) for 2QFY2022 ended June, 29% lower than the loss recorded in the previous corresponding quarter at US$801 million. This is primarily attributed to the elimination of non-cash interest expense of Grab\u2019s convertible redeemable preference shares that converted to ordinary shares in December 2021.  The loss included a US$173 million non-cash expense from the revaluation of Grab\u2019s equity investments that are marked-to-market each quarter as well as US$111 million in stock-based compensation expense. Revenue for 1QFY2022 stood at US$321 million, a 79% growth y-o-y driven by strong growth in mobility and deliveries revenue including contributions by Jaya Grocer. Gross merchandise value (GMV) grew 30% y-o-y to US$5.1 billion on mobility segment recovery, as countries reopened and international and domestic travel resumed. For 1QFY2022, adjusted ebitda declined by 9% to negative US$233 million as Grab continued to invest in product and platform development in anticipation of its digibank launches in Singapore in the second half of 2022, followed by Malaysia and Indonesia in 2023. However, adjusted ebitda improved on a q-o-q basis by 19% due to lower incentive spending. Cash liquidity totalled US$7.7 billion at the end of the 2QFY2022, while its net cash liquidity was US$5.6 billion. Looking ahead, Grab says it is focused on accelerating its path to profitability, says group CEO and cofounder Anthony Tan. \u201cWe will get there by doubling down on product innovation that increases user engagement and reduces our cost-to-serve and focusing on growing high quality transactions on our platform,\u201d he adds.  Grab will focus on increasing high quality GMV transactions, optimising its fixed cost base and reducing its incentive spend in order to drive sustainable growth as well as an improved profitability profile for its segments. The focus on increasing high quality GMV transactions will come with the trade off of slower GMV growth, it notes. The company is pulling forward its core food deliveries and overall deliveries segment breakeven timelines by one quarter and two quarters respectively to the first quarter of 2023 and second quarter of 2023. It also expects its revenue for 2022 to come in between US$1.25 billion to US$1.3 billion, at the higher end of its previously announced guidance range of US$1.2 billion to US$1.3 billion. Shares in Grab closed 13 US cents higher or 3.75% up on Aug 24 at US$3.60.

Future Tech, a Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based IT solution provider and member of the NVIDIA Partner Network, is the Alliance\u2019s inaugural funding and global distribution partner.\n\u201cPopulation data is critical information for policy decisions, whether it\u2019s for urban planning, climate action or monitoring the spread of COVID-19,\u201d said Oliver Chinganya, Director of the African Centre for Statistics at UNECA. \u201cWithout a strong digital infrastructure, many of these nations struggled to collect and report data during the pandemic.\u201d\nBetter public health data can help countries track real-time COVID infection rates, detect hotspots and target their response efforts. And beyond the pandemic, strengthening data systems will allow local experts to connect population statistics to agricultural data, climate trends and economic indicators.\nLaying the Groundwork for Long-Term Benefits\nFuture Tech is covering the cost of procurement and overseeing the distribution and deployment of NVIDIA-Certified Systems and data science workstations powered by NVIDIA RTX and NVIDIA Quadro RTX GPUs for each country \u2014 starting with Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal and Sierra Leone. Up next will be Guinea, Mali, Nigeria, Somalia and Togo.\n\u201cPublic-sector institutions play a critical role in providing the data used for policymaking at all levels. But often they face huge gaps in infrastructure and expertise required to tap the benefits of the data revolution,\u201d said Future Tech founder and CEO Bob Venero.\nTo further support the countries\u2019 data science capabilities, NVIDIA is teaming up with local universities, research institutes and data science communities to build a pipeline of developers that can extract insights from census information and other data sources.\n\u201cThis is the first time many of these countries will be digitizing their census efforts, which represents a potential goldmine of data,\u201d said Keith Strier, VP of AI Nations at NVIDIA. \u201cBy connecting these efforts with the local developer ecosystem, we can help more organizations harness this for the benefit of society.\u201d\nNVIDIA is putting together a curriculum of free Deep Learning Institute courses \u2014 starting with fundamentals such as accelerated computing with CUDA Python and accelerated data science workflows \u2014 tailored to the needs of each country\u2019s national statistical office. It\u2019s also providing access to workshops and data science teaching kits for each of the nations.\nThis work extends the company\u2019s support of AI and data science in Africa through the NVIDIA Inception startup program and the NVIDIA Emerging Chapters initiative, which bolsters developer communities in emerging markets with education and technical resources.\nUsing Data to Drive Environmental and Social Progress\nAround the world, the pandemic has accelerated the transition to digitization. The United AI Alliance is supporting this transformation by working with grassroots groups at the core of AI development in Africa, with the goal of enabling data practitioners in every region to build meaningful solutions to local challenges.\nMany of the continent\u2019s developers are part of local technology communities, including groups like the Kenya-based AI Center of Excellence or nonprofit organization Data Science Africa. United AI Alliance is pairing many of these developers with governments to drive new data analysis projects.\n\u201cMany countries are still excluded from using big data, AI and digital technologies to improve the quality of information for making decisions,\u201d said Claire Melamed, CEO of the Global Partnership. \u201cTogether we can change that and collaborate to support data-driven progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals.\u201d\nWhile the project\u2019s initial focus is in Africa, the collaborators plan to roll out the same model in Southeast Asia and Latin America.\nTo learn more about this initiative, watch the replay session of \u201cDemocratizing AI in Emerging Markets through the United AI Alliance\u201d from NVIDIA GTC and visit the United AI Alliance site.\nLearn more about the NVIDIA Emerging Chapters, NVIDIA Developer and NVIDIA Inception programs, and register free for NVIDIA GTC, running online Sept. 19-22.\nMain image shows (L to R) Jean Paul Ngom and Ibrahima Diop, of Senegal\u2019s national statistical office, working with an NVIDIA GPU-powered mobile workstation.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Data Science | Developer Program | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And, Huang said, it will be vibrant with what will become one of the most popular forms of robots: digital human avatars.\nWith 45 demos and slides, five NVIDIA speakers announced:\n\nA new platform for creating avatars, NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE).\nPlans to build out Universal Scene Description (USD), the language of the metaverse.\nMajor extensions to NVIDIA Omniverse, the computing platform for creating virtual worlds and digital twins.\nTools to supercharge graphics workflows with machine learning.\n\n\u201cThe announcements we made today further advance the metaverse, a new computing platform with new programming models, new architectures and new standards,\u201d he said.\nMetaverse applications are already here.\nHuang pointed to consumers trying out virtual 3D products with augmented reality, telcos creating digital twins of their radio networks to optimize and deploy radio towers and companies creating digital twins of warehouses and factories to optimize their layout and logistics.\nEnter the Avatars\nThe metaverse will come alive with virtual assistants, avatars we interact with as naturally as talking to another person. They\u2019ll work in digital factories, play in online games and provide customer service for e-tailers.\n\u201cThere will be billions of avatars,\u201d said Huang, calling them \u201cone of the most widely used kinds of robots\u201d that will be designed, trained and operated in Omniverse.\nDigital humans and avatars require natural language processing, computer vision, complex facial and body animations and more. To move and speak in realistic ways, this suite of complex technologies must be synced to the millisecond.\nIt\u2019s hard work that NVIDIA aims to simplify and accelerate with Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine. ACE is a collection of AI models and services that build on NVIDIA\u2019s work spanning everything from conversational AI to animation tools like Audio2Face and Audio2Emotion.\n\nMetaHuman in Unreal Engine image courtesy of Epic Games.\n\u201cWith Omniverse ACE, developers can build, configure and deploy their avatar application across any engine in any public or private cloud,\u201d said Simon Yuen, a senior director of graphics and AI at NVIDIA. \u201cWe want to democratize building interactive avatars for every platform.\u201d\nACE will be available early next year, running on embedded systems and all major cloud services.\nYuen also demonstrated the latest version of Omniverse Audio2Face, an AI model that can create facial animation directly from voices.\n\n\u201cWe just added more features to analyze and automatically transfer your emotions to your avatar,\u201d he said.\nFuture versions of Audio2Face will create avatars from a single photo, applying textures automatically and generating animation-ready 3D meshes. They\u2019ll sport high-fidelity simulations of muscle movements an AI can learn from watching a video \u2014 even lifelike hair that responds as expected to virtual grooming.\nUSD, a Foundation for the 3D Internet\nMany superpowers of the metaverse will be grounded in USD, a foundation for the 3D internet.\nThe metaverse \u201cneeds a standard way of describing all things within 3D worlds,\u201d said Rev Lebaredian, vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology at NVIDIA.\n\u201cWe believe Universal Scene Description, invented and open sourced by Pixar, is the standard scene description for the next era of the internet,\u201d he added, comparing USD to HTML in the 2D web.\nLebaredian described NVIDIA\u2019s vision for USD as a key to opening even more opportunities than those in the physical world.\n\u201cOur next milestones aim to make USD performant for real-time, large-scale virtual worlds and industrial digital twins,\u201d he said, noting NVIDIA\u2019s plans to help build out support in USD for international character sets, geospatial coordinates and real-time streaming of IoT data.\nExamples of NVIDIA\u2019s planned investments in USD\nTo further accelerate USD adoption, NVIDIA will release a compatibility testing and certification suite for USD. It lets developers know their custom USD components produce an expected result.\nIn addition, NVIDIA announced a set of simulation-ready USD assets, designed for use in industrial digital twins and AI training workflows. They join a wealth of USD resources available online for free including USD-ready scenes, on-demand tutorials, documentation and instructor-led courses.\n\u201cWe want everyone to help build and advance USD,\u201d said Lebaredian.\nOmniverse Expands Its Palette\nOne of the biggest announcements of the special address was a major new release of NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform that\u2019s been downloaded nearly 200,000 times.\nHuang called Omniverse \u201ca USD platform, a toolkit for building metaverse applications, and a compute engine to run virtual worlds.\u201d\nThe latest version packs several upgraded core technologies and more connections to popular tools.\nThe links, called Omniverse Connectors, are now in development for Unity, Blender, Autodesk Alias, Siemens JT, SimScale, the Open Geospatial Consortium and more. Connectors are now available in beta for PTC Creo, Visual Components and SideFX Houdini. These new developments join Siemens Xcelerator, now part of the Omniverse network, welcoming more industrial customers into the era of digital twins.\nLike the internet itself, Omniverse is \u201ca network of networks,\u201d connecting users across industries and disciplines, said Steve Parker, NVIDIA\u2019s vice president of professional graphics.\nExamples of new features in NVIDIA Omniverse.\nNearly a dozen leading companies will showcase Omniverse capabilities at SIGGRAPH, including hardware, software and cloud-service vendors ranging from AWS and Adobe to Dell, Epic and Microsoft. A half dozen companies will conduct NVIDIA-powered sessions on topics such as AI and virtual worlds.\nSpeeding Physics, Animating Animals\nParker detailed several technology upgrades in Omniverse. They span enhancements for simulating physically accurate materials with the Material Definition Language (MDL), real-time physics with PhysX and the hybrid rendering and AI system, RTX.\n\u201cThese core technology pillars are powered by NVIDIA high performance computing from the edge to the cloud,\u201d Parker said.\nFor example, PhysX now supports soft-body and particle-cloth simulation, bringing more physical accuracy to virtual worlds in real time. And NVIDIA is fully open sourcing MDL so it can readily support graphics API standards like OpenGL or Vulkan, making the materials standard more broadly available to developers.\nOmniverse also will include neural graphics capabilities developed by NVIDIA Research that combine RTX graphics and AI. For example:\n\nAnimal Modelers let artists iterate on an animal\u2019s form with point clouds, then automatically generate a 3D mesh.\nGauGAN360, the next evolution of NVIDIA GauGAN, generates 8K, 360-degree panoramas that can easily be loaded into an Omniverse scene.\nInstant NeRF creates 3D objects and scenes from 2D images.\n\nAn Omniverse Extension for NVIDIA Modulus, a machine learning framework, will let developers use AI to speed simulations of real-world physics up to 100,000x, so the metaverse looks and feels like the physical world.\nIn addition, Omniverse Machinima \u2014 subject of a lively contest at SIGGRAPH \u2014 now sports content from Post Scriptum, Beyond the Wire and Shadow Warrior 3 as well as new AI animation tools like Audio2Gesture.\nA demo from Industrial Light & Magic showed another new feature. Omniverse DeepSearch uses AI to help teams intuitively search through massive databases of untagged assets, bringing up accurate results for terms even when they\u2019re not specifically listed in metadata.\nGraphics Get Smart\nOne of the essential pillars of the emerging metaverse is neural graphics. It\u2019s a hybrid discipline that harnesses neural network models to accelerate and enhance computer graphics.\n\u201cNeural graphics intertwines AI and graphics, paving the way for a future graphics pipeline that is amenable to learning from data,\u201d said Sanja Fidler, vice president of AI at NVIDIA. \u201cNeural graphics will redefine how virtual worlds are created, simulated and experienced by users,\u201d she added.\nAI will help artists spawn the massive amount of 3D content needed to create the metaverse. For example, they can use neural graphics to capture objects and behaviors in the physical world quickly.\nFidler described NVIDIA software to do just that, Instant NeRF, a tool to create a 3D object or scene from 2D images. It\u2019s the subject of one of NVIDIA\u2019s two best paper awards at SIGGRAPH.\nIn the other best paper award, neural graphics powers a model that can predict and reduce reaction latencies in esports and AR/VR applications. The two best papers are among 16 total that NVIDIA researchers are presenting this week at SIGGRAPH.\nNeural graphics blends AI into the graphics pipeline.\nDesigners and researchers can apply neural graphics and other techniques to create their own award-winning work using new software development kits NVIDIA unveiled at the event.\nFidler described one of them, Kaolin Wisp, a suite of tools to create neural fields \u2014 AI models that represent a 3D scene or object \u2014 with just a few lines of code.\nSeparately, NVIDIA announced NeuralVDB, the next evolution of the open-sourced standard OpenVDB that industries from visual effects to scientific computing use to simulate and render water, fire, smoke and clouds.\nNeuralVDB uses neural models and GPU optimization to dramatically reduce memory requirements so users can interact with extremely large and complex datasets in real time and share them more efficiently.\n\u201cAI, the most powerful technology force of our time, will revolutionize every field of computer science, including computer graphics, and NVIDIA RTX is the engine of neural graphics,\u201d Huang said.\nWatch the full special address at NVIDIA\u2019s SIGGRAPH event site. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll also find details of labs, presentations and the debut of a behind-the-scenes documentary on how we created our latest GTC keynote.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | RoboticsTags: 3D | Artificial Intelligence | Creators | Digital Twin | Events | Game Development | Industrial and Manufacturing | Machine Learning | Media and Entertainment | Metaverse | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo | NVIDIA Research | NVIDIA RTX | Omniverse | Omniverse Enterprise | Open Source | Rendering | SIGGRAPH 2022 | Simulation and Design | Universal Scene Description | Virtual Reality \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

These include international character support, which will allow users from all countries and languages to participate in USD. Support for geospatial coordinates will enable city-scale and planetary-scale digital twins. And real-time streaming of IoT data will enable the development of digital twins that are synchronized to the physical world.\nTo accelerate USD development and adoption, the company also announced development of an open USD Compatibility Testing and Certification Suite that developers can freely use to test their USD builds and certify that they produce an expected result.\n\u201cBeyond media and entertainment, USD will give 3D artists, designers, developers and others the ability to work collaboratively across diverse workflows and applications as they build virtual worlds,\u201d said Rev Lebaredian, vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology at NVIDIA. \u201cWorking with our community of partners, we\u2019re investing in USD so that it can serve as the foundation for architecture, manufacturing, robotics, engineering and many more domains.\u201d\nOpen-Source USD Resources and Leaders Supporting USD\r\nNVIDIA is releasing a collection of free resources to speed USD adoption, including thousands of USD assets purpose-built to open up virtual-world building for users without 3D expertise. The company is also providing hundreds of on-demand tutorials, documentation and developer tools to help spread USD education.\n\u201cUSD is a cornerstone of Pixar\u2019s pipeline, and it\u2019s seeing rapidly growing momentum as an open-source framework across not only VFX and animation, but now industrial, design and scientific applications,\u201d said Steve May, chief technology officer at Pixar Animation Studios. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s contributions to help evolve USD as the open foundation of fully interoperable 3D platforms will be a great benefit across industries.\u201d\nNVIDIA also announced investment in building USD plugins from popular 3D software ecosystems to NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122, a platform for connecting and creating virtual worlds based on Universal Scene Description. New beta releases include PTC Creo and SideFX Houdini, with Autodesk Alias and Autodesk Civil3D, Siemens Xcelerator and more in development.\n\u201cSiemens and NVIDIA are coming together to enable the industrial metaverse where the future of design, engineering and collaboration will occur,\u201d said Dirk Didascalou, chief technology officer of Siemens Digital Industries. \u201cWe are excited to support USD in the Siemens Xcelerator platform and plan to collaborate with NVIDIA on the next generation of the format.\u201d\nAt SIGGRAPH, NVIDIA is also bringing together hundreds of engineering and product leads across the USD ecosystem into working councils to help align on USD development priorities and get feedback on where NVIDIA can centralize development efforts. Among the many companies contributing to and supporting USD are Adobe, Autodesk, Pixar and Siemens.\n\u201cAutodesk has been closely involved in the development of USD from its early inception as a means of standardizing the exchange of 3D data in animation and visual effects workflows,\u201d said Raji Arasu, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Autodesk. \u201cWe have long understood the importance of 3D interoperability and have already begun extending USD\u2019s applications beyond media and entertainment to design, engineering and industrial applications. We are excited by the momentum behind USD from partners like NVIDIA, which we believe will help better realize the concept of the metaverse and all the workflows it unlocks for our customers.\u201d\nInnovators in media, gaming, robotics, industrial automation, retail and grocery are already adopting USD as their metaverse language of choice, including Kroger and Volvo Cars.\n\u201cThe promise of USD is immense. At Volvo, we immediately understood the value of the open, extensible, interoperable 3D scene description for our metaverse projects. Being able to maintain assets as a single source of truth and bring them from virtual world to virtual world will be seamless in 3D internet consumer applications,\u201d said Mattias Wikenmalm, senior expert of visualization at Volvo Cars.\nLearn more about NVIDIA\u2019s USD resources.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

ACE combines many sophisticated AI technologies, allowing developers to create digital assistants that are on a path to pass the Turing test.\u201d\nACE is built on top of NVIDIA\u2019s Unified Compute Framework, which provides access to the rich software tools and APIs needed to harness the wide range of skills needed for highly realistic, fully interactive avatars. These include NVIDIA Riva for developing speech AI applications, NVIDIA Metropolis for computer vision and intelligent video analytics, NVIDIA Merlin\u2122 for high-performing recommender systems, NVIDIA NeMo Megatron for large language models with natural language understanding, and NVIDIA Omniverse for AI-enabled animation.\nThe assistants and avatars ACE enables will transform interactions in gaming, entertainment, banking, transportation and hospitality.\nTwo applications built on ACE include NVIDIA\u2019s Project Maxine and Project Tokkio. Project Maxine brings state-of-the-art video and audio features to virtual collaboration and content creation applications. Project Tokkio enables interactive avatars that see, perceive, converse intelligently and provide recommendations to enhance customer service in places like restaurants.\nOmniverse ACE Support\r\nDevelopers of virtual assistants and digital humans plan to use ACE to accelerate their avatar development efforts.\n\u201cReallusion developers can build convincing characters quickly and easily, and now we step forward with the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and real-time rendering,\u201d said Elvis Huang, head of innovation in the Innovation Development Department at Reallusion, Inc. \u201cPairing our Character Creator and iClone tools with NVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine will be a great way to create lifelike avatars that interact with end users realistically.\u201d\n\u201cDemand for digital humans and virtual assistants continues to grow exponentially across industries, but creating and scaling them is getting increasingly complex,\u201d said Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at TIRIAS Research. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine brings together all of the AI cloud-based microservices needed to more easily create and deliver lifelike, interactive avatars at scale.\u201d\nLearn more about Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

On Wednesday, the government imposed new license requirements on NVIDIA for any future exports to China, which also includes Hong Kong. The new restrictions will apply to the company's line of A100 and H100 chips.\nThe following is an excerpt from a United States Securities and Exchange Commision report issued on Wednesday:\n\n\nOn August 26, 2022, the U.S. government, or USG, informed NVIDIA Corporation, or the Company, that the USG has imposed a new license requirement, effective immediately, for any future export to China (including Hong Kong) and Russia of the Company\u2019s A100 and forthcoming H100 integrated circuits. DGX or any other systems which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits and the A100X are also covered by the new license requirement. The license requirement also includes any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving both peak performance and chipto-chip I/O performance equal to or greater than thresholds that are roughly equivalent to the A100, as well as any system that includes those circuits. A license is required to export technology to support or develop covered products. The USG indicated that the new license requirement will address the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a \u2018military end use\u2019 or \u2018military end user\u2019 in China and Russia. The Company does not sell products to customers in Russia.\n\n\nThe news was first reported by Reuters late Wednesday afternoon. The A100 and H100 line of chips are said to relate to AI and machine learning. While NVIDIA previously announced expectations to ramp up new GPU, CPU, DPU, and robotics processors during the recent Q1 2023 financial report, the company cautions that the new restrictions could affect the completion of the H100 chips.\n\nSource: Yahoo! Finance\n\nNVIDIA now appears to be caught in an escalating conflict between the United States and China. NVIDIA (NVDA) shares closed at $150.94 per share, down 2.42 percent, and appear to be falling further in afterhours trading.\nWe'll continue to monitor this story as it develops, as further U.S. government restrictions could stand to affect both NVIDIA and competitor AMD in both the short and long-term futures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOzzie Mejia\nSenior Editor\n\n\n\nOzzie has been playing video games since picking up his first NES controller at age 5. He has been into games ever since, only briefly stepping away during his college years. But he was pulled back in after spending years in QA circles for both THQ and Activision, mostly spending time helping to push forward the Guitar Hero series at its peak. Ozzie has become a big fan of platformers, puzzle games, shooters, and RPGs, just to name a few genres, but he\u2019s also a huge sucker for anything with a good, compelling narrative behind it. Because what are video games if you can't enjoy a good story with a fresh Cherry Coke? \n\n\nFiled Under\n\nNvidia\nNews\nNVDA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom The Chatty\n\nRefresh\nGo To Thread\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShacknews\n\n\n\n\n\ueaa3\nreply\nAugust 31, 2022 2:47 PM\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOzzie Mejia posted a new article, NVIDIA (NVDA) exports to China have new U.S. government-imposed license requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin / Register\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1996 - 2025 Shacknews LTD.\n\n\n\nCompany\nAbout Shacknews\nShackpets\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\n\n\nDo It For Shacknews\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTwitch\nYoutube\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Good news: Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ: META) is back on the list of the top 10 most valuable companies in the world. Bad news: everything else Meta (except their expenses) is on a downtrend. \nThe company climbed up to the number 8 slot after its fall to number 11 in February. \n\nMost companies on the list posted a decline in market capitalization from when Facebook\u2019s parent company was booted off the top 10, with American chipmaker NVIDIA slipping down farthest. Tesla, meanwhile, stayed in its slot and grew by over US$130 billion.\n\nMeta has dropped out of Top 10 most valuable US comps & is now #11, behind AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA, BRK, UNH, JNJ, V, NVDA.\u00a0There used to be 5 Big Tech comps but there are now only 4 (AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT all have >$1tn mkt caps while META <$440bn. (HT @knowledge_vital) pic.twitter.com/kKRtc3t7T9\u2014 Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) July 29, 2022\n\nMeta switched positions with the American chipmaker, which lost over US$123 of its market capitalization since February. Also climbing into the top 10 is American healthcare and insurance firm UnitedHealth with a market capitalization of US$490 billion.\u00a0\nMeta last traded at US$159.10 on the Nasdaq, a 54.79% decline year on year. The company\u2019s stock saw its sharpest decline in early February 2 at 23% overnight after the then newly-named company reported a rare weak revenue forecast and an increase in expenses. \n\nMeta\u2019s Q2 report, released late last week, indicates a continued trend of lower revenue and growing expenses. Early in July, the company announced a 30% cut-down on its hiring plans to brace itself for \u201cone of the worst downturns\u201d in recent history.\nThe company continues to face a decrease in advertising demand as rising costs and inflation has pushed many companies across numerous markets to cut back on ad spending. The performance is also impacted by the iOS privacy update that Apple implemented late in 2021, as this limited Meta\u2019s ability to track and target its users.\n\nInformation for this briefing was found via the companies mentioned.

There have recently been announcements of certain blocks in Ang Mo Kio being selected for the scheme, as well as in Marsiling\u2026 that\u2019s two SERS projects in 2022 alone! Considering that the previous SERS projects were few and far between since 2012.  SERS, or Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme is an initiative by HDB that\u2019s been around since 1995. Residents whose blocks are selected will have the chance to move to a spanking new home with a brand-new 99-year lease, close to their previous neighbourhood. They\u2019ll also get compensation and rehousing benefits!

If you haven\u2019t heard, there\u2019s been a saga and controversy surrounding SERS projects, citing smaller living spaces, a hassle to move especially for senior residents, cost (new flats are pricier), and other concerns. In particular, for the Ang Mo Kio SERS project, which affects Blocks 562 to 565 at Avenue 3 and comprises 606 households, there\u2019s been a few options thrown into the mix: An additional replacement site at the upcoming Central Weave @ Ang Mo Kio HDB BTO project, where up to 10% of the units will be set aside for priority allocation for those affected by SERS. The designated replacement site is next to ITE College Central. The option to buy a new replacement flat with a shorter lease of 50 years (versus a new one that has 99 years) The option for eligible seniors affected by SERS to take up the lease buyback scheme for their existing flat, so they are able to buy a new HDB flat as replacement on a short lease (depends what\u2019s remaining on their SERS flat after they sell the lease to HDB). This was previously not available to homeowners affected by SERS after the SERS announcement.   In addition, there\u2019s also been a change to the Minimum Occupancy Period for SERS replacement flats. It\u2019s now 5 years from the date of key collection, just like your typical HDB flat. Previously, it was 7 years from the date of selection \u2014 not key collection \u2014 which meant that many of them were able to sell off their SERS replacement flat much earlier.   Story continues So, what\u2019s the deal with SERS, especially the latest \u201cAMK-SERS-gate\u201d?HDB Ang Mo Kio SERS: 5 Things Singaporeans Are Unhappy AboutTo find out the ground sentiments of Singaporeans and SERS, we\u2019ve trawled the Facebook comment section of news articles to suss out what Singaporeans are angry/unhappy about regarding the AMK SERS and the reasons for their furore.Here are the top 5 issues we found:Unnecessary stress for elderly homeowners Cash outlay for costs of moving house Size of replacement flat could be smaller Lack of choice in the matter Shortchanged by 50-year lease option Disclaimer: The opinions shared in this article do not represent PropertyGuru. They are public feedback compiled from online social media channels.HDB AMK SERS Issue #1: Unnecessary Stress for Elderly HomeownersMany of those who commented were concerned about the elderly homeowners residing in the Ang Mo Kio SERS flats. For one, moving house is a big project that they might not have the means to do on their own. In addition, needing to look for another home at this juncture in their lives when they should be relaxing, is added stress.  Furthermore, for those who had already worked hard to successfully complete the payments for their HDB loan, buying a new HDB flat could mean taking on another mortgage and relinquishing their debt-free life.It is also common for people to forge bonds within their community and neighbours, especially if they have lived in the area for a long time. Especially for the elderly homeowners affected by the AMK SERS, they\u2019re being \u201cuprooted\u201d from a place and the people they\u2019ve become so used to, which again, causes unnecessary stress.HDB AMK SERS Issue #2: Cash Outlay for Costs of Moving HouseEven if the compensation and replacement flat offered could defray the costs of buying a new HDB flat, commenters argue that other cash outlay, such as renovation, buying new appliances and furniture, or even hiring movers could be costly.  According to estimates, renovating a HDB flat could cost an average of $35,000 for a 3-room flat and above for larger, more elaborate layouts. Even the most spartan of renovations, such as giving the walls a fresh coat of paint, is still an additional cost.[ArticleCallout]{ \u201ctitle\u201d: \u201cSingapore\u2019s HDB BTO Renovation Cost Guide (2022)\u201d, \u201cexcerpt\u201d: \u201cKnow more about the renovation cost here. \u201c, \u201clink\u201d: \u201chttps://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-guides/hdb-bto-renovation-costs-singapore-41435\u201d, \u201cimage\u201d: \u201chttps://img.iproperty.com.my/angel-legacy/1110\u00d7624-crop/static/2021/01/HDB-BTO-Renovation-Cost-Guide-2021.jpg\u201d } [/ArticleCallout]HDB AMK SERS Issue #3: Size of Replacement Flat Could Be SmallerA check on the size of the flats at Block 562 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 showed that a unit with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms was a spacious 990 sqft (about 92 sqm). These days, a 4-room BTO flat (with the same number of bedrooms and bathrooms) measures from around 85 to 93 sqm, or about 914 to 1,001 sqft, and/or might have a less spacious layout.  Related article: HDB Floor Plans Over the Years: How 3 Homeowners in Singapore Have Adapted to ChangesSome commenters also suggested that due to the rising prices of BTO flats now versus the depreciating price of older flats, homeowners of the AMK SERS flats would likely have to top-up cash or CPF to get a similarly-sized replacement flat.  Source: Teoalida HDB AMK SERS Issue #4: Lack of Choice in the MatterWith a choice of words such as \u201cforced\u201d and \u201cchased out\u201d, it seems that comments focused on the lack of homeowners\u2019 autonomy on the SERS decision, versus the process of en-bloc sale for private developers where a consensus to sell must be reached by the majority of homeowners.  Related article: Potential En Bloc Condos in Singapore: Does Yours Stand A Chance in 2022?Another interesting point was on the rights of tenants, who would benefit the least from SERS as they receive no compensation whatsoever.HDB AMK SERS Issue #5: Shortchanged by 50-year Lease Option, LocationLast but not least, other issues raised were the shortchanging of affected AMK SERS residents with the option of a replacement unit with a 50-year lease, which had undergone significant depreciation. In general, the value of an HDB flat on the resale market is typically the highest in the first 15 years.  Other commenters also compared the location of the existing AMK SERS blocks and the location of the replacement flats, in particular the original designated replacement site. They said the latter was inferior, with fewer public transport connections than the original, and hence was not worth the premium price.HDB AMK SERS: Real Estate Agency Weighs InMr Lee Sze Teck, Senior Director (Research), Huttons Asia, also shared his take on the Ang Mo Kio SERS situation, with a focus on the scramble for the new BTO flats as replacements:\u201cThe residents affected by SERS are limited to just 10% of Central Weave @ AMK BTO flats which is just 89 flats. Competition will be stiff and we estimate that the SERS applicants will also have to ballot for a flat. The other BTO locations are in non-mature estates and will be seen as worse off for them.\u201cIf they are not successful, they will be placed at the back of the queue for the new flat at the SERS replacement site. Residents will have to weigh this against the better location of the BTO flat.\u201cFurthermore they have to pay the same price as public applicants. Hence it will most probably be residents who are younger and qualify for a longer loan tenure.\u201cThis is another step to appease some residents affected by SERS. But it will never be enough. Residents will question why only 10% and not BTO in Bukit Merah. HDB should rethink the whole SERS policy and even VERS given that our HDB flats are ageing.\u201dHDB AMK SERS: Closing CommentsAs many of the options provided by HDB for the Ang Mo Kio SERS case are new, the actual results are yet to be seen. Hopefully, in view of the changing property landscape, improvements to an initiative that began in 1995 can be made and aligned to current times.Commenters had some helpful feedback and suggestions regarding the direction that SERS and our housing mindset should move in:  What do you think? Is SERS a bane or a boon?For more property news, resources and useful content like this article, check out PropertyGuru\u2019s guides section.Are you looking to buy a new home?

Elizabeth Choong   23 August 2022 9 min read             Singapore Quarry in Dairy Farm Nature Park. The Hillview Rise GLS site is near the nature park (Photo: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Two GLS sites launching this month There are six sites on the Confirmed List of the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme for the second half of this year.\u00a0Five of the sites are residential sites, including one site for executive condominiums. The remaining site is for commercial and residential use. The Reserve List has six residential sites (including two executive condominium sites), a white site and a hotel site.  Two residential sites will be launched for tender this month \u2013 Bukit Timah Link and Hillview Rise. Both sites are near an MRT station on the Downtown Line and they are only a stop away from each other. Despite the close proximity of both sites, the Bukit Timah Link site is in the more prestigious Bukit Timah planning area and in District 21. The Hillview Rise site is in the Bukit Batok planning area and in District 23. Population demographics for both sites Eighty-two percent of the population in the Bukit Timah planning area are owner-occupiers and 16% are tenants. Those aged 40 to 54 years make up the largest group, followed by those aged 5 to 14 years; indicating a large presence of families with school-going children. The elderly aged 55 to 69 years also make up a significant portion of the population.     Likewise, a large majority (91%) of the population in the Bukit Batok planning area are owner-occupiers with only 8% being tenants. However, the population in Bukit Batok is younger with the more residents being 25 to 34 years old. There are also more young children below five years old and fewer elderly residents.     Bukit Timah Link site scores highly on connectivity and convenience The GLS site at Bukit Timah Link is located beside Beauty World MRT Station and across the road from Beauty World Centre. It is a short walk to Bukit Timah Plaza as well as Bukit Timah Market and Food Centre. Pan Island Expressway (PIE) and Bukit Timah Nature Reserve are a quick drive away.     Two upcoming developments in the vicinity will have retail space, thus adding to the existing amenities in the area. The Linq @ Beauty World will have a two-storey retail podium and the upcoming development along Jalan Anak Bukit will have some F&B outlets and retail shops. Parents of young children will be pleased to know that Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary School is a short walk away. There are a total of five schools found within a 2km radius of the site, including the popular Methodist Girls\u2019 School.   Story continues   The Linq @ Beauty World sold out in two monthsThe upcoming The Linq @ Beauty World stands on an en-bloc site that was sold in May 2017 to BBR Holdings for $101.5 million. When completed, the freehold development will have 120 condominium units and a two-storey retail podium. It will also be directly linked to Beauty World MRT Station.  The condominium units were first launched for sale in November 2020 and 115 units were sold on the first day of launch. All 120 unit were sold a month later at an average price of $2,378 psf. The outstanding sales performance of The Linq @ Beauty World is a strong testament to the demand for condominium units in the area.\u00a0Strong sales performance for other new launches Other than The Linq @ Bukit Timah, Daintree Residence, Verdale and Forett At Bukit Timah are another three major recent launches within a 1km radius of the site.  Daintree Residence was launched in July 2018 and sold out in September 2021, achieving an average price of $1,881 psf.  Verdale got off to a slow start, selling only 39 units during its launch weekend in September 2020. However, it caught up soon, selling out all its 258 units by May and achieved an average price of $1,814 psf.  Forett At Bukit Timah was launched in August 2020. Take-up rate for project was 94.6% as at July. Average price for the freehold development is $2,106 psf.  The excellent sales performance of the three uncompleted condominiums is a good endorsement of the neighbourhood from home buyers. Additionally, the sold-out or almost-sold-out status of the above-mentioned developments means limited new supply in the area, and hence less competition for the future development on the Bukit Timah Link GLS site.  Jalan Anak Bukit GLS site: a double-edged swordThe Jalan Anak Bukit GLS site, across the road from the Bukit Timah Link GLS site, was awarded to Far East Organization and Sino Group in August last year for $1.03 billion ($989 psf ppr). It will have\u00a0 700 condominium units, 150 serviced apartments, an integrated transport hub, offices, F&B outlets, retail shops, a plaza and community spaces. The residential units in the integrated project are expected to be launched for sale later this year.The upcoming project is likely to attract much attention because of its convenience and connectivity. However, future residents will have to put up with more traffic noise from the integrated bus interchange and the nearby PIE.The future development at the Jalan Anak Bukit GLS site will pose competition to the future condominium at the Bukit Timah Link GLS site. However, it is a double-edged sword because the bus interchange and shops at Jalan Anak Bukit will boost connectivity for the neighbourhood and benefit all residents when they are completed.Small units for Bukit Timah Link site?Bearing in mind the relatively mature population and that two-bedroom units account for only 26.9% of all units within a 1km radius of the site, it might be a wise decision for developers to include more two-bedroom units to the development to attract empty-nesters, especially since the upcoming development on the Jalan Anak Bukit site is likely to target families. Some 160 units can be built on the Bukit Timah Link site.  Hillview Rise residents will have sufficient nearby amenities to meet daily needs The Hillview Rise GLS site was moved from the Reserve List of the GLS programme for the first half of this year to the Confirmed List for the second half of this year.The GLS site is located within walking distance of Hillview MRT Station and Hillview Community Club. The site is also sandwiched between Dairy Farm Nature Park and Little Guilin in Bukit Batok Town Park.  The Hillview Rise GLS site is beside HillV2 which has a supermarket and several casual restaurants to cater to the daily needs of residents. Residents can take a longer walk to The Rail Mall and enjoy a larger variety of caf\u00e9s and bistros as well as a supermarket. For larger malls, Junction 10 is a short drive away, while Hillion Mall and Bukit Panjang Plaza are two MRT stops away.Parents will be pleased to know that there are 10 schools within a 2km radius of the Hillview Rise GLS site, which is double the number of schools located near the Bukit Timah Link GLS site.  Larger units for Hillview Rise site?With the presence of numerous schools plus the demographics for the planning area, it makes sense for the successful bidder of the Hilllview Rise GLS site to develop a family-friendly development. As there is a limited number of units with at least four bedrooms within a 1km radius of the site, it might be a winning strategy to have more large units or even dual-key units.  Likely to launch at a palatable price levelThere are two uncompleted condominiums located within a 1km radius of the Hillview Rise GLS site. Midwood is located just beside the subject site. The leasehold condominium was launched in October 2019 and all 564 units were sold out by May. Average price as at 2Q2022 was $1,691 psf.  Mont Botanik Residence is located further away from the GLS site. The 108-unit condominium was launched in August 2018 and only one unit remains unsold. The development achieved an average price of $1,784 psf as at 2Q2022. Mont Botanik Residence achieved a higher average price than Midwood due to its freehold tenure.  The 335 condominium units that can be built on the Hillview Rise GLS site are likely to be launched at similar price levels as the average prices of Midwood and Mont Botanik Residence. The average prices for both uncompleted condominiums are a good indicator of the price level deemed acceptable by buyers of new condominiums in the neighbourhood.  Large tracts of undeveloped land near Hillview Rise siteCurrently, there are no upcoming launches within a 2km radius, which means no new supply in the vicinity and hence limited competition for the future project on the Hillview Rise GLS site. However, the lack of new developments is not expected to remain unchanged because there are lots of undeveloped land near the site. The surrounding plots of land are designated under the Master Plan for residential, education and special use.  The nearby land plot, designated for special use, is probably set aside for military use. Bukit Gombak Camp is located nearby.Which GLS site is better?The Bukit Timah Link site would seem to be more appealing site for developers because there are more existing and future amenities in the vicinity. The site is also in a more established and prestigious residential enclave.Based on the average prices of recent launches, the future development at the Bukit Timah Link site can be launched at a higher price point compared to the Hillview Rise site. However, this would make the future development at Bukit Timah Link less attractive to buyers with a smaller budget. As both sites are only an MRT stop away from each other, buyers with a more modest budget may turn to the future development at the Hillview Rise site as a more affordable alternative.The upcoming integrated development at Jalan Anak Bukit will pose keen competition to the future development at the Bukit Timah Link site. However, the risk to developers is mitigated by the smaller size of site, which translates to less capital outlay and fewer units to be sold. The smaller capital outlay plus the Upper Bukit Timah location may also attract a larger variety of developers, including niche players, to bid for the site.While there are no new launches near the Hillview Rise site at the moment, it is unlikely to remain that way for long because it is near large tracts of undeveloped land that are designated for residential use.The future development at Hillview Rise will appeal to far-sighted buyers who are prepared to put up with some inconvenience and future construction noise in exchange for potential capital appreciation. Resale residential prices for District 23 have grown 51% since 2012, outpacing District 21 (22%) and the whole Singapore (34%). However, the buyer must time their sale carefully after taking into account lease decay and competition from future new condominiums.  \u00a0Check out the latest listings near Hillview Rise, Bukit Timah Link, The Linq @ Beauty World, Beauty World, Daintree Residence, Verdale, Forett At Bukit Timah, Midwood, Mont Botanik Residence, Beauty World MRT Station, Hillview MRT Station, Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary School, Methodist Girls\u2019 School\u00a0\u00a0See Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) Government releases 14 sites under 2H2022 GLS programme CDL top bidder for Jalan Tembusu GLS site at $1,302 psf ppr Government releases 13 sites under 1H2022 Government Land Sales Programme En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Cited reasons for lowering its revenue guidance include the war in Ukraine and lockdowns in China as a result of the COVID pandemic.\nThe news of Nvidia failing to hit its target comes a few weeks ahead of when the company plans to share its Q2 earnings report on August 24. At that time, we\u2019ll be able to dig even deeper into where Nvidia is at for Q2, and what the outlook is moving forward.\nAccording to Nvidia, the miss in hitting its $8.1 billion target primarily reflects weaker-than-forecast gaming revenue, which fell 44 percent sequentially and 33 percent from 2021 as reported by outlets like CNBC.\n\n\u00a9 Google Finance\n\nElaborating further, Nvidia pointed to things like \u201clower sell-in of gaming products\u201d and a reduction in channel partner sales \u201clikely due to macroeconomic headwinds\u201d among the factors contributing to the latest dip in revenue. Other factors include ongoing supply chain disruptions.\nDespite this, the company believes its long-term gross margin profile remains intact. In a quote from CNBC, executive vice president and CFO of Nvidia, Colette Kress, stated:\n\n\u201cWe have slowed operating expense growth, balancing investments for long-term growth while managing near-term profitability. We plan to continue stock buybacks as we foresee strong cash generation and future growth.\u201d\n\nFollowing the less than stellar results from Nvidia today, shares dropped 8 percent. It\u2019ll be interesting to see whether they\u2019ll be able to bounce back, or whether they\u2019ll dip further once Nvidia shares its earnings report on August 24. Speaking of which, we\u2019ll be covering those earnings report results here at Shacknews, so be sure to check back for more on where Nvidia is at for Q2!\nFor more on what else Nvidia has been up to, we\u2019ve got a wealth of previous coverage worth reading through including how Nvidia (NVDA) lowered its Q2 2023 revenue guidance below Wall Street estimates, and how Nvidia (NVDA) increased its share buyback to $15 billion through the end of 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorgan Shaver\nSenior Editor\n\n\n\nMorgan is a writer from the frozen wastelands of Maine who enjoys metal music, kpop, horror, and indie games.

It turns out that there are actually retailers offering green electricity plans, and I didn\u2019t do the research properly before making my choice. I doubt I\u2019m the only one who wasn\u2019t very aware of the green options,\u00a0because the OEM website itself doesn\u2019t display information about solar and carbon neutral electricity in any way.\u00a0 It\u2019s almost exclusively\u00a0cost-related information on there (you can hardly blame Singaporeans for being\u00a0 \u201cprice-sensitive\u201d).  Well, if you find yourself in a position to research the companies before committing, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learnt about the various environmentally-friendly and sustainable electricity options in Singapore. Before you deep dive into solar and carbon neutral energy in Singapore, brush up on your electricity basics with\u00a0Moneysmart\u2019s Ultimate Guide to Cheapest Electricity in Singapore: Beginner\u2019s guide to the\u00a0Open Electricity Market\u00a0in Singapore 5 Most common questions about\u00a0switching from Singapore Powers (SP) to electricity retailer Compare 9 Best Electricity Price Plans\u00a0in Singapore All\u00a0Green and Solar Electricity\u00a0in Singapore A list of\u00a0hidden costs to look out for when choosing electricity retailers  Contents Comparison of green electricity plans What exactly is \u201cgreen electricity\u201d?

What can you do if you\u2019ve already chosen another plan?  1. Green electricity plans in Singapore No time to read?

Story continues Back to top2. What exactly is \u201cgreen electricity\u201d in Singapore\u2019s context? Before you get swayed by any greenwashing, it\u2019s essential to understand a bit of the basics.Electricity is usually generated by burning fossil fuels (i.e. oil and gas). This process produces all kinds of awful pollutants and greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, which is widely regarded as the culprit of global warming.\u00a0Also, fossil fuels are non-renewable natural resources, meaning that at some point in the future, they will be completely depleted.Green electricity is a catch-all phrase to describe the less-terrible alternatives. But it actually comes in two forms in Singapore: clean (usually solar) energy\u00a0and carbon neutral electricity.In its strictest form, green electricity = clean energy, which is electricity generated using renewable, non-polluting resources such as sunlight or wind. Think solar panels.But in Singapore\u2019s electricity market, many \u201cgreen electricity\u201d options actually refer to carbon neutral electricity instead. Carbon neutral electricity is basically your normal electricity (fossil fuel and all), except the retailer also helps you buy a bunch of carbon offset credits. These credits go to companies/businesses with activities that reduce carbon emissions. So it\u2019s kind of like\u2026 hurting someone\u2019s feelings, then being extra nice to them to make up for it.At first glance, it seems like choosing clean electricity (e.g. solar energy) is a better option if you\u2019re environmentally-conscious.But since electricity is delivered through the common SP Group\u2019s electricity grid, there\u2019s no way to tell if you are actually using the solar-powered electricity you paid for. (Whereas in rural places, people can install their own solar roofs and personally use the energy harvested from there.)So, ultimately, it\u2019s a symbolic choice. By choosing one of these green plans, you\u2019re telling retailers that you care about the environment and you\u2019re willing to pay a premium, which indirectly creates demand for more emission-reducing activities around the world.Back to top3. Which electricity retailers in Singapore offer green plans? Electricity retailerSolar electricity?Carbon neutral? Diamond Electric  \u274c    \u274c   Geneco  \u2714  (For Businesses)  \u2714   (Add-ons) Keppel Electric  \u2714  (Landed property)\u00a0   \u2714   Pacific Light Energy  \u274c  \u00a0   \u2714   Sembcorp Power  \u2714  (Sunshine Plan)  \u2753  (all plans include RECs) Senoko Energy Supply  \u274c    \u2714  (LifeGreen24) Sunseap Energy  \u2714  (Sunseap-100)  \u274c   Tuas Power Supply  \u274c    \u274c   Union Power  \u274c    \u274c   There are 6 retailers offering green (to varying degrees) electricity options on the market: Geneco, Keppel Electric, Pacific Light Energy, Sembcorp, Senoko, and Sunseap.But not all green electricity retailers and plans are built the same way, so it\u2019s difficult for consumers to make an informed decision. I\u2019ll do my best to cover the nuances of each retailer and its offerings below.Back to top4. Geneco \u2013 Power Eco Add-Ons Electricity retailer planPrice per kWhContract Geneco Power Eco Add-On \u2013 Carbon Credits$0.0025 \u2013 $0.01 (before GST)6 to 24 months Geneco Power Eco Add-On \u2013 Renewable Energy Certifications$0.0025 \u2013 $0.01 (before GST)6 to 24 months Geneco is one of the more popular electricity retailers in Singapore, and it used to have two types of green electricity plans back in 2019: Get It Green, and Get Sunny. However, these carbon neutral and solar-powered electricity plans have since been phased out. Replacing them are ala carte add-ons that existing Geneco customers can purchase.When you purchase the Geneco Power Eco Add-On (Carbon Credits), you\u2019re basically giving Geneco $1 to $4 per month to ask them to help you offset your carbon footprint. Using the few dollars you give them, Geneco will buy carbon credits to fund sustainability projects such as forestry, \u201cupdating power plants and factories, or increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and transportation.\u201dThe other add-on,\u00a0Renewable Energy Certifications, where your dollars and cents will be used to purchase\u00a0Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) \u2013 literally certificates that confirm the electricity you used came from a renewable source. RECs are also often traded like stocks where people profit from the buy-sell price differences.Bottom line:\u00a0Geneco used to have one of the cheapest carbon neutral electricity plan in Singapore alongside a fixed rate solar plan. However, Geneco\u2019s green offerings have since been sidelined to symbolic add-on features.Back to top5. Sunseap \u2013 100% solar energy Electricity retailer planPrice per kWhContract Sunseap 100% Solar Energy$0.44946 months Sunseap 1% Solar Energy$0.41736 months Sunseap is the only electricity retailer on this list that\u2019s fully focused on solar energy, so if you\u2019d like to support a company that\u2019s doing work in the clean energy field, this is probably your best bet.Like Geneco, Sunseap has very clear FAQs on how exactly their solar electricity plans work, so that\u2019s quite reassuring at least:\u201cWhen you sign up for any of our solar energy plans, every kWh of solar energy you consume will help displace a kWh of electricity needed from the traditional power generator, up to the amount of solar energy component in the plan you signed up for. This reduces our carbon footprint.\u201d\u201cFor instance, if you are on our Sunseap 100 plan and your monthly electricity usage is around 450kWh, you will essentially be reducing about 450kWh of electricity per month generated from the traditional power generator, thus contributing to reducing our country\u2019s carbon footprint.\u201dPrice-wise, it\u2019s naturally more expensive to be signing up for a 100% solar plan, but if you are living in a relatively small home I think the price difference is not that huge, probably a few dollars more a month. Bottom line:\u00a0Sunseap offers a 100% solar plan at $0.4494/kWh \u2013 also the most expensive green electricity plan in Singapore. Sunseap, however, has been fully invested in their solar energy efforts from the get-go, and is also the clearest in explaining how their solar plans work.Back to top6. Sembcorp Power \u2013 Sunshine Plan Electricity retailer planPrice per kWhContract Sembcorp Sunshine Plan$0.362612 months Sembcorp Power labels all of their electricity plans as \u201cgreener\u201d. All of Sembcorp\u2019s fixed rate, discount off tariff, and no contract electricity plans come with a small portion of \u201cgreen electricity\u201d. How much greener, exactly?VP (Retail) at Sembcorp Power Mr Lim Han Kwang explained in 2019 that by \u201cgreener\u201d they meant \u201cwe retire 50kWh worth of renewable energy certificates (RECs) every month on your behalf.\u201d That\u2019s only a fraction of the 360kWh worth of electricity that a typical HDB 4-room household usage. Ok\u00a0lah, little bit better than nothing right?Bottom line:\u00a0Sembcorp offers a very straightforward Sunshine Plan which is a metered 100% solar energy electricity plan at $0.3626/kWh for 12 months. This is significantly more expensive than the usual Sembcorp fixed rate plans that are priced at $0.3226/kWh.Back to top7. Senoko \u2013 Carbon neutral LifeGreen24 Electricity retailer planPrice per kWhContract Senoko LifeGreen24$0.317324 months Senoko LifePower12$0.316012 months Senoko LifePower24$0.313024 months Senoko\u00a0offers a 100% green electricity plan, LifeGreen24, that\u2019s overladen with marketing speech. For the layman, it\u2019s pretty confusing to land on Senoko\u2019s website and see that it\u2019s both 100% carbon neutral and 100% solar energy at the same time. Can,\u00a0meh?Well, the crux of Senoko\u2019s LifeGreen24 is the purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) from solar generation farms in the Southeast Asian region. So, technically that makes LifeGreen24 a carbon neutral electricity plan that supports solar energy farms via RECs. You will then receive a report every August detailing the RECs that have been retired on your behalf.Bottom Line: Senoko\u2019s LifeGreen24 comes with a 24-month contract but has no transmission loss charges, which eliminates hidden costs for individuals who prefer fuss-free plans.Back to top8. Keppel Electric \u2013 carbon neutral ecoGreen plan Electricity retailer planPrice per kWhContract Keppel Electric ecoGreen12$0.372012 months Keppel Electric ecoGreen24$0.372024 months Keppel Electric launched their ecoGreen plans in February 2022, and they come in two contract periods: 12 months and 24 months.\u00a0Keppel Electric\u2018s green electricity plans are carbon neutral, and are not solar energy. According to Keppel Electric, customers who sign up for the ecoGreen plans will have \u201cRenewable Energy Certificates (REC) from Singapore\u201d retired annually for them.For all you ballers living in landed properties, you can install Keppel Electric\u2019s solar panels in your place. Again, the process is not that romantic \u2013 you don\u2019t actually get to use the solar energy generated on premises. Instead, the solar electricity generated has to be sold back to SP Group, and you get rebates in your electricity bill. If you\u2019re interested, there\u2019s a DBS Green Renovation loan that you can take up to finance the installation.Bottom Line:\u00a0At $0.3720/kWh, Keppel\u2019s carbon neutral ecoGreen plan is pretty expensive compared to competitors\u2019.Back to top9. Conclusion: Which green electricity plan is best?There are two types of \u201cgreen\u201d electricity plans in Singapore: carbon neutral and solar energy. The former involves bundling carbon offset credits with your electricity plan, while the latter typically represents an investment into developing and implementing solar energy systems. In my opinion, choosing a solar energy plan probably has a bigger impact on the environment, especially if the retailer is funnelling the proceeds directly into their own clean energy business. But it is more expensive.If you\u2019re OK with somewhat\u00a0carbon neutral electricity and are focusing only on price, Geneco offers carbon credits and Renewable Energy Certificate add-ons to their usual plans.There are only 3 100%\u00a0solar electricity\u00a0plans in Singapore: Senoko LifeGreen24, Sembcrop Sunshine Plan, and Sunseap-100.Senoko\u2019s LifeGreen24\u00a0is the cheapest on the market right now at $0.2923/kWh.Make no mistake though \u2013 solar is usually significantly more expensive than a regular electricity plan.Back to top10. What can you do if you didn\u2019t choose a green plan?But I do realise that choosing the \u201cright\u201d electricity retailer isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all. In fact, the whole idea of carbon offsets has been criticised as being ineffective at dealing with the root of the problem, which is overconsumption of energy. If you care about the environment, you can still do your part by reducing your electricity (and overall energy) consumption \u2013 which, incidentally, helps you save money too, so it\u2019s a win-win.Other things you can do are to purchase your own carbon offset credits if it helps you sleep at night. These will soon to be available to residential consumers via SP\u2018s fancy new \u201cdigital marketplace\u201d.Alternatively, you could also invest in a company that is innovating in the clean energy field, rather than investing purely based on financial gain. Crazy, I know. Just putting it out there.Is it worth it to opt for a green electricity plan?

Internship opportunities will also be offered to tertiary students to develop their professional aptitude and prepare them for full-time roles when they graduate. Meanwhile, GrabMerchant Centre will be established to provide 1-on-1 business consultation services for its small and medium enterprises (SME) merchant-partners. Located at Grab HQ @ Singapore, the centre is a one-stop hub dedicated to helping businesses optimise their online presence, maximise GrabFood, GrabMart, GrabFin and GrabAds services for their businesses, as well as learn to use digital tools to grow. \u201cAs we celebrate Grab\u2019s 10th anniversary this year, we hope that our announcements today will help small businesses and our future workforce upskill and maximise their opportunities, even in this challenging macro environment,\u201d says Grab cofounder and group CEO Anthony Tan.  In his opening remarks, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Lawrence Wong congratulates Grab on its 10th anniversary, adding that the company has come a long way over the past decade and has been a good partner of Singapore. \u201cI look forward to our continued partnership in building a stronger tech ecosystem and forging a more inclusive digital economy. There are many opportunities ahead, and I am confident we can make the most of them if we work together,\u201d says Wong. He adds that Southeast Asia\u2019s growth potential remains strong especially for the tech sector, with a huge, untapped but fast growing digital consumer market. As Singapore and tech companies like Grab continue to face uncertain economic outlook and heightened geopolitical tensions, Wong believes that these challenges can be turned into new opportunities for growth. \u201cWhat will be crucial in this journey is our people \u2014 we must stay united in purpose, and work together to look for the next frontier and fresh possibilities for our people,\u201d says Wong.   Story continues Tan says Grab is very optimistic about Southeast Asia in the longer term, given the significant market opportunity and current under-penetration of digital services. However, the company is also pragmatic about the current realities of rising inflation and its direct impact on its business and partners.\u201cThis is prompting our consumers to expect more affordable services, and conversely, our driver and merchant-partners to expect higher net earnings,\u201d adds Tan.To build a sustainable and thriving marketplace that balances the interests of both its consumer and partners, Grab is making a long-term commitment towards inclusive growth and innovation for the digital economy on three fronts \u2014these are empowering SMEs to thrive online, developing a hyperlocal tech to solve problems for Southeast Asia and investing in and creating equal opportunities for Southeast Asian talent development.At a doorstop interview, Grab Singapore managing director Yee Wee Tang said many \u201cGrabbers\u201d did not expect for the company to own a building or celebrate a 10 year anniversary. \u201cThe 10 years have been really exciting but challenging as we tried to solve the problems that we hear from our users,\u201d he adds.When asked, Yee did not respond to whether Grab might do a secondary listing in Singapore, deferring instead to his PR team member, who said \"he is not the right person\" to take this question. Grab listed late last year on the Nasdaq.Shares in Grab closed 12 cents higher or 3.37% up on August 10 at US$3.68.\u00a0See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore Grab hits 10 billion rides and deliveries as it celebrates 10th anniversary Sea to find most success by replicating a strategy similar to Tencent: Maybank CGS-CIMB initiates 'add' on Grab with TP of US$3.60 Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

According to sole marketing agent CBRE, the unit has a guide price of $11 million.  Read also:\u00a0Commercial Siakson Building on the market for $30 mil The property is in Basement Two, facing the main central plaza of the retail complex. It has 20m frontage and a total strata area of approximately 3,391 sq ft. It is currently fully leased. Bukit Timah Plaza is a mixed-use development that was completed in 1979. It sits on an island site bounded by the Pan-Island Expressway, Jalan Anak Bukit and Upper Bukit Timah Road. The development comprises a four-storey retail block and two apartment blocks known as Sherwood Towers, with 269 residential units. Clemence Lee, executive director of capital markets, Singapore, at CBRE, notes that strata-commercial units within the Beauty World sub-precinct are limited in supply. \u201cInvestors are aware that supply of strata-commercial properties will be limited in the future, as the authorities begin to restrict further strata subdivision of the commercial component of properties located in key central areas,\u201d he adds. (Find Singapore commercial properties with our commercial directory)  To that end, he anticipates strong interest in the property from local and foreign buyers, including high-net-worth individuals, family offices and owner-occupiers. In addition, Lee views that the rejuvenation happening in Beauty World will likely boost rental and capital appreciation for properties in the area over the medium to long term. Upcoming projects include a landmark mixed-use development by Far East Organization and Sino Group at the Jalan Anak Bukit Government Land Sales (GLS) site. The joint-venture partners won the 3.22ha site, located at the junction of Upper Bukit Timah Road and Jalan Jurong Kechil, with a bid of $1.03 billion ($989 psf per plot ratio) in August 2021. The development will comprise a commercial podium, residential units, serviced apartments, and a new integrated transport hub. There is also an upcoming site under the 2H2022 GLS Programme located at Bukit Timah Link, which can yield 160 residential units.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

The legal completion of the en bloc sale to a consortium comprising Far East Organization, Perennial Holdings and Sino Land is slated for November this year, with the building to be handed over to the developers next May. The landmark transaction will see the consortium transforming the conserved building into a new mixed-use integrated development comprising office, retail and residential components.\u00a0(See potential condos with en bloc calculator) On the other end of Beach Road is the construction of the new Shaw Tower, which commenced in May. The mixed-use development, which includes 435,000 sq ft of Grade A office space and a five-storey podium with 15,700 sq ft of retail space, will replace the original building that dates back to the 1970s. The redevelopment, managed by Lendlease, is expected to be completed by 2025. The two projects are the latest milestones in the wider, long-term redevelopment taking place in the Bugis area, says Knight Frank\u2019s head of consultancy Alice Tan. During the EdgeProp Singapore NDP Master Plan Master Class webinar on Aug 13, Tan spoke on the ongoing rejuvenation happening in Bugis and how it heralds a bright outlook for developments in the area.    The en bloc sale of Golden Mile Complex to a consortium comprising Far East Organization, Perennial Holdings and Sino Land is slated for legal completion in November (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore) A history of transformation Bugis has seen various iterations of urban rejuvenation over the years. In the 1980s, the Singapore government embarked on the redevelopment of Bugis Street in a bid to clean up the area, which was then known as a notorious entertainment and nightlife precinct. Shophouses on Bugis Street were demolished, laying the foundation for mixed-use development Bugis Junction which opened on Sept 8, 1995. Across the road is Bugis Street, which was reincarnated as a pedestrianised shopping street. Meanwhile, integrated development Suntec City opened its doors nearby in 1997. From the early 2000s, a slew of new developments started populating the area including office tower Parkview Square, the National Library building, and a new campus for the Singapore Management University in the adjacent Bras Basah area.   Story continues Knight Frank\u2019s Tan explains that a major shift for Bugis came in tandem with the expansion of Singapore\u2019s central business district (CBD) over the years. Planning for the Marina Bay area \u2014 envisioned to serve as an extension of the CBD \u2014 started in the 1970s. Following extensive land reclamation and resettlement works, new commercial developments started sprouting up in the Marina Bay area in the 1990s and 2000s.As the government continued to redevelop Bugis, it saw the potential for the area to further supplement the CBD. In 2008, URA announced plans for the Ophir-Rochor corridor, which would feature mixed-use developments intended to create a vibrant office cluster that would complement the financial district at Marina Bay and Raffles Place.From a planning standpoint, Bugis is now one of eight subzones within the Downtown Core planning area. It lies adjacent to the City Hall, Nicoll and Marina Centre subzones. Tan notes that this location \u2014 straddling newer business-focused areas such as Marina Centre as well as heritage-rich neighbourhoods such as Kampong Glam and the Civic District \u2014 gives Bugis an interesting hybrid setting. \u201cBugis is right at the intersection of modernity, culture and heritage,\u201d she says.The opening of the Downtown Line, which included a station in Bugis which is an interchange between the Downtown and East-West Lines, further propelled the area\u2019s function as an extension of the CBD, while also boosting its overall vibrancy.  An artist\u2019s impression of the upcoming Shaw Tower, which will include 435,000 sq ft of Grade A office space and 15,700 sq ft of retail space (Picture: Lendlease)Premium office spacesAs part of the expansion of the CBD, the government sought to inject more office spaces in the Beach Road-Bugis area. In 2007, a Government Land Sales (GLS) site at Beach Road was awarded to a consortium led by City Developments (CDL) for $1.69 billion, which was developed into the South Beach integrated development. Completed in 2016, it has 510,000 sq ft of office space, a 654-key hotel and 190 luxury residences.Not long after, the DUO integrated development was completed. Located in the Ophir-Rochor corridor, it comprises 570,000 sq ft of office space, 660 residences, a 342-key hotel, and 56,000 sq ft of retail space. It was developed by M+S, a joint venture between Temasek and Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional.The two developments, which introduced nearly 1.1 million Grade A office spaces in total, attracted major MNC occupiers to the area. This includes French pharmaceutical company Sanofi, which took up some 53,000 sq ft at South Beach, while Mastercard and American medical devices firm Abbot Labs took up 74,000 sq ft and 100,000 sq ft respectively at DUO.In July 2019, the office and retail components at DUO were sold for $1.58 billion to a 60:40 joint venture between Allianz Real Estate and Hong Kong-based private equity firm Gaw Capital. Later that same year, the hotel component \u2014 Andaz Singapore \u2014 was sold to Hoi Hup Realty for $475 million.Knight Frank\u2019s Tan says that despite being located outside the core CBD area, office spaces at South Beach and DUO today can command rents exceeding $10 psf per month, putting it on par with the Raffles Place and Marina Bay area, where rents range from around $9 to $12 psf per month.One reason for the strong performance, she believes, is the premium standard of the buildings, offering features such as Green Mark Platinum certification, distinctive design and architecture, and a focus on sustainability and greenery.Another huge factor is connectivity, with South Beach located next to the Esplanade MRT Station on the Circle Line, while DUO is connected to the Bugis MRT Interchange Station, connecting the East-West and the Downtown Lines.In any case, the developments underpin an overall rising trend in office rents for the Beach Road-Bugis area, which has resumed growing following contractions during the pandemic. Tan says that in 2Q2022, Grade A office rents in the Beach Road and Middle Road area rose 1.1% q-o-q, matching the pace of growth for prime grade office rents in the Raffles Place and Marina Bay area and indicating strong and sustained demand from occupiers.  Construction site for Guoco Midtown, captured on Aug 11 (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore)A new wave of projectsThe strong office demand in the Beach Road Bugis area bodes well for the next major project in the area \u2014 Guoco Midtown. The $2.4 billion mixed-use development at the 99-year leasehold Beach Road site \u2014 awarded to a joint venture between GuocoLand and Guoco Group for $1.62 billion in 2017 \u2014 will include 770,000 sq ft of Grade A office space, an 80,000 sq ft business and lifestyle hub, and over 30,000 sq ft in retail space to be completed in phases from 4Q2022.Guoco Midtown features two residential developments \u2014 the 219-unit Midtown Bay, as well as the 588-unit Midtown Modern. The latter sits on a GLS site at Tan Quee Lan Street that was awarded in 2019 to GuocoLand for $800.2 million and is slated for completion in 2025. The site, which had previously been allotted for predominantly commercial use, was updated in the 2019 URA Master Plan to reflect residential use with first-storey commercial.Read also:\u00a0Midtown Modern banks on connectivity, greenery and full facilitiesTan says that in recent years, the government has tweaked the planning for Bugis as it recognised the need for more residential components to balance out existing office and commercial supply. \u201cThe government is cognisant of the fact that a business district needs to have day and night vibrancy,\u201d she adds.In 2019, a GLS site on Middle Road zoned for residential use with first-storey commercial was awarded to Wing Tai Holdings for $492 million. The development, dubbed The M, will comprise three 20-storey towers and a six-storey tower with a total of 522 residential units. It is slated for completion in 2024. (Find Singapore commercial properties with our commercial directory)For Tan, the boost in residential offerings is also a positive development for Bugis in a post-pandemic environment, where hybrid working is still very much in the mode. \u201cWith more residential components being added to the Bugis area, it helps people view it as a viable place to both work and live,\u201d she notes.  Construction site for the 522-unit The M project at Middle Road, captured on Aug 11 (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore)Bright outlook for residential propertiesAverage prices for private residential sales in Bugis have steadily increased over the years as an outcome of the ongoing rejuvenation. Tan notes that the strong performance of residential components at DUO and South Beach paved the way for the current crop of upcoming developments.Midtown Bay, the residential component at Guoco Midtown that was launched in October 2019, drove up average prices for new private residential sales in District 7, where Bugis is located. To date, 86 of a total of 219 units (39%) at Midtown Bay have been sold at an average price of $2,966 psf. Midtown Modern, which was launched in March last year, saw over 60% of its 558 units sold during its launch weekend at an average price of around $2,800 psf. Since then, the takeup rate has increased to 79%, with units sold at an average price of $2,744 psf. Meanwhile, The M has also seen similarly healthy sales, with 93% of the 522 units sold at an average price of $2,488 psf since its launch in February 2020.As of 1H2022, Tan notes that the average price for new private residential sales in District 7 stands at just under $2,800 psf, exceeding prices in District 2 which includes the Anson and Tanjong Pagar area. It is a clear indication of a preference for the Bugis area, which Tan believes is anchored by its connectivity, good mix of new residential and commercial developments, and overall vibrancy.  Apart from redevelopment projects such as Golden Mile Complex and Shaw Tower, the Bugis and Beach Road area is expected to further benefit from other ongoing rejuvenation projects (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)Other key developmentsApart from redevelopment projects such as Golden Mile Complex and Shaw Tower, Tan expects the Bugis and Beach Road area to further benefit from other ongoing rejuvenation projects.One of these is the government\u2019s efforts to create an expanded arts and cultural precinct. Spanning the Fort Canning Park, Civic District and the Bras Basah-Bugis areas, the precinct is envisioned to be a pedestrianised area that offers a walkable and immersive experience around Singapore\u2019s key heritage assets in\u00a0the city centre.Residential developments in the vicinity will also see diversification through the HDB Build-To-Order (BTO) project near the Jalan Besar MRT Station, not far from the Ophir-Rochor corridor. The project is the first under the Prime Location Public Housing model and will have a total of 960 units upon completion in 2028. Following its launch during the November 2021 BTO exercise, the project saw a subscription rate exceeding seven times, with most applicants vying for the larger four-room units. (Find HDB flats for rent or sale with our Singapore HDB directory)In the longer-term, the redevelopment of the Kampong Bugis precinct, located at the mouth of Kallang River, is also expected to have a spillover effect that will impact the Bugis and Beach Road area. The government also intends to develop the sprawling 8.2ha white site over the next nine to 11 years, with plans to add 4,000 private homes, and over 50,000 sq ft of retail, offices and community facilities to the waterfront district.Read more:\u00a0Midtown Modern banks on connectivity, greenery and full facilitiesCheck out the latest listings near Bugis Junction, Beach Road, Midtown Modern, Guoco Midtown, Golden Mile Complex, Shaw Towers, Bugis MRT Interchange Station, Esplanade MRT Station, Jalan Besar MRT StationSee Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) Enjoy modern, urban loft-living at penthouse apartments at The M Why integrated developments command a price premium Midtown Modern banks on connectivity, greenery and full facilities En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Reuters \u2022 yesterday   State Bank of India shelves $1.7 billion fund raising as yields elevated, sources say MUMBAI (Reuters) -State Bank of India, the country's largest lender by assets, is shelving plans to raise funds this fiscal year, discouraged by elevated bond yields despite a policy rate cut and liquidity boost from the central bank, three sources aware of the matter said on Monday.  The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

The rupee was aided by dollar sales by foreign banks and exporters during the session, a trader at a mid-sized private bank said.   Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Now the company is nearly ready to show its next-generation cards. \nRelated: Now Might Be the Best Time to Buy a GPU\nNVIDIA confirmed during an earnings call that it will reveal its new architecture for consumer graphics cards next month, at the company's GTC 2022 keynote on September 20, 2022. We might not see new graphics cards ready to buy on that day -- NVIDIA could reveal products for server and high-end workstation setups first -- but we'll get a peek at the general architecture that will power upcoming GeForce GPUs.\nNVIDIA also revealed on the call that demand for gaming hardware was down 33% from this time last year, and 44% from the previous quarter. The company said that is due to \"challenging market conditions.\" The global economy is experiencing some inflation right now, so fewer people are likely ready to spend hundreds of dollars on gaming hardware. However, demand has also dropped -- crypto mining is less profitable right now (if at all), so crypto farms aren't buying up all available supply like was happening a few months ago.\nNVIDIA usually starts new generations of graphics cards at the high end, so we can expect an RTX 4080, 4090, and possibly other expensive GPUs before new mid-range and budget cards become available. On the lower end, Intel is starting to compete with its new Arc cards, though they aren't widely available outside of China yet.\nSource: The Register \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware\n\n\n\n\nComputer Hardware\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

(PHOTO: Getty Images)   SINGAPORE \u2013 Five businesses were alleged to have used the GST increase as an excuse to increase the prices of essential products and services, said Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong. In a written reply to a parliamentary question on Tuesday (2 August), Gan said that the Committee Against Profiteering (CAP) \u2013 whose role is to review and investigate feedback on such unjustified increases in prices \u2013 has received and reviewed about 100 feedback submissions between April and July 2022. Of them, five involved specific allegations of GST misrepresentation.

The businesses committed to be transparent on their pricing and in their communications with consumers,\" Gan said. \"There have so far been no repeat complaints.\" As part of its role, the CAP may make public errant businesses that seek to profiteer by using the rise in GST as a reason.

(Source: Singapore Police)  \u00b7 Singapore Police SINGAPORE \u2014 The Singapore police said that since January, at least 997 people have fallen victim to scammers posing as property agents resulting in total losses of at least S$3.9 million. There has been a resurgence of a scam whereby scammers impersonate legitimate property agents and ask victims for payment to secure the rental of a unit before viewing the property, according to a police advisory on Friday (26 August).  The police said in this scam variant, the victims would typically respond to an online property listing and start a conversation with the scammer via WhatsApp using the contact numbers in the fake online listing. During the conversation, the scammer would impersonate a registered property agent and convince the victim of his credentials by sending a picture of the property agent's business card and pictures or videos of the property to be leased. The scammer would then request for the victim's personal details to prepare the lease agreement.

To add an air of legitimacy, scammers would send a copy of a lease agreement with the name and NRIC of the purported owner of the unit to the victims for signature.  After signing, victims would then be instructed to make payment for various reasons (such as rental deposits, stamp duty or other fees) to secure the rental. They would only discover that they had been scammed after the scammer ceased contact with them or when they reach out to the legitimate property agents through other means. Check legitimacy of listings The police advised members of the public to adopt precautionary measures such as verifying the legitimacy of a property listing. They can do so by liaising with a property agent using only the agent's phone number registered on the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA)'s Public Register. Members of the public may check whether a property agent is registered with the CEA by searching for the agent's phone number on the CEA Public Register. If the search does not lead to the property agent's profile page, it means that the property agent has not registered that phone number with the CEA and the listing may be a scam. The public can also contact the agent's property agency to verify the authenticity of the listing.   Story continues The police also warned the public to beware of calls with the \"+\" prefix which originate from overseas, as well as not to make any payments before a property viewing, and not to disclose personal information, credit card and bank details or passwords, including one-time passwords (OTPs), to anyone.Anyone with information related to such scams can call the Police Hotline at 1800-255-0000, or submit an online report at this website.Follow us on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter.

(PHOTO: Getty Creative)  \u00b7 Photo by Alex Tihonov via Getty Images By Mia Glass (Bloomberg) \u2014With a tantalising array of satay chicken, wok-fried mud crab and chilled tiger prawns, the dinner buffet at Singapore\u2019s Grand Hyatt hotel typically sets diners back about US$70. Those on a tighter budget and with an eye on sustainability can fill a box for a 10th of that price.  Across Asia, tech startups are taking food otherwise destined for landfill and providing discounted meals through mobile phone apps. About a third of food is lost or wasted every year globally, and the mountains of waste are estimated to cause 8-10% of greenhouse gas emissions such as methane, the United Nations says. The Asia-Pacific region is among the worst in the world for food waste, accounting for more than half of food squandered globally. \u201cA common mantra that I have is that being sustainable should be attainable,\u201d said Preston Wong, chief executive officer and co-founder of treatsure, which collaborates with chains including the Hyatt, Accor Group and the Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel to allow app users to pick out and collect a \u201cbuffet-in-a-box\u201d of food that would otherwise be thrown out. \u201cI think technology can bridge that gap,\u201d he said. With more than 30,000 users, treatsure has saved an estimated 30 metric tons of food from going to waste since it launched in 2017, with users typically having to wait until the end of service before they can collect their food, according to Wong. Still, that\u2019s a far cry from the 817,000 tons of food waste in Singapore in 2021, a 23% increase from the year prior. Authorities say the city state\u2019s only landfill, Semakau, is expected to meet Singapore\u2019s solid waste disposal needs up to 2035 and beyond.  Hong Kong faces similar problems. It has already filled up 13 landfills, and about 3,300 tons of food waste per day were dumped in its remaining sites in 2020, according to Hong Kong\u2019s Environmental Protection Department. \u201cThe space is very limited,\u201d said Anne-Claire B\u00e9raud, Hong Kong country manager of Phenix by OnTheList, an app launched in the territory last year. \u201cEverything is very dense so there isn\u2019t a lot of space to treat all this waste.\u201d The app allows users to pick up a \u201cMystery Basket\u201d of food at stores including Pret A Manger and local cake shop The Cakery for a minimum 50% discount. So far it\u2019s sold 25,000 baskets, with each equating to about 1 kilogram of food saved from going to waste and 4.5 kilograms of CO2 emissions avoided, the company says. Phenix\u2019s original platform was launched in France in 2014 and expanded to four other European countries where it\u2019s saved 150 million meals. It collaborated with OnTheList, a flash-sale company, to bring the app to Asia.   Story continues The concept of food sustainability is still in its infancy in Asia, compared with North America and Europe where authorities are cracking down. France has already banned supermarkets from throwing away unsold food, and Spain recently drafted legislation to tackle waste by fining companies. US states including California and New Jersey have laws to reduce the amount of food going to landfills.That\u2019s boosted the popularity of apps like Too Good To Go, which was launched in Denmark in 2016 and now operates in 17 countries including the US, Canada and the UK. It has has provided more than 152 million meals through its so-called Magic Bags, which are sold at a discount by shops and restaurants at the end of the day with items that would otherwise have been thrown out.In a region as culturally diverse as Asia, smaller local startups are getting a foothold catering to their home market.Companies \u201chave to match that region\u2019s culture and habits,\u201d said Taichi Isaku, co-founder and chief product officer of CoCooking, which created the Tabete food-rescue app in Japan. \u201cIt\u2019s an area that has to be nurtured in order to successfully introduce new technologies.\u201dTabete, released in 2018 in Japan, is a free app with a similar business model to Too Good To Go. It has rescued 384,000 meals, accumulated 525,000 users, and partnered with 2,140 shops.Tess Kermode, director of international expansion at UK-based Olio, agrees that companies need to \u201cunderstand the culture and the people in a particular market.\u201dThe firm operates in 62 countries including India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Thailand and the Philippines. The app is mostly community based with neighbors posting free food to be picked up from their homes. So-called Food Waste Heroes also collect surplus produce from businesses and bring it home to list.   Olio says the app has helped save almost 58 million portions of food worldwide. Its largest international market is Singapore, where it has over 125,000 users and a formal partnership with foodpanda\u2019s online market. The firm has ambitions to expand but, like other apps, says a lack of awareness of food sustainability in Asia is currently a handbrake on growth.\u201cConsumer-facing technology such as applications on personal devices can be very useful,\u201d said Anthony Bennett, senior food systems officer for the UN Food and Agriculture Organization in the Asia-Pacific. \u201cHowever, this topic should be considered along with increasing the overall food literacy for consumers.\u201dSome apps, including treatsure and Tabete, are taking such matters into their own hands and trying to educate users with tips on reducing food waste and recipes on their social media pages.\u201cIn North America and Europe, there\u2019s been some maturity in understanding such challenges and tackling them,\u201d said treatsure\u2019s Wong. \u201cBut in Asia, this narrative has just begun.\u201d\u00a9 2022 Bloomberg L.P.

(PHOTO: Getty Creative)  \u00b7 BNBB Studio via Getty Images SINGAPORE \u2014 More than 40 per cent in a survey said they wouldn't accept a job offer if they're unable to work from home or don't have flexible work hours. These are some of the findings of the bi-annual 2022 Randstad Workmonitor survey in Singapore which polled 1,000 locally-based respondents who are employed and aged between 18 and 67 years old.  The survey, conducted between 21 February and 13 March this year, highlights the workforce's latest sentiments and perceptions of the local job market. While 77 per cent said that they value the importance of remote work, only 52 per cent reported that their employers provided them such options. About 42 per cent said that they would not accept the job if they are unable to work from home. Similarly, four in five respondents, or 80 per cent, said that having flexibility in terms of working hours is important to them, but only 60 per cent reported being given this autonomy by their employers. About 41 per cent said that they would not accept a job if they could not work during the hours that they want to.   A majority of workers maintained that work-life balance is important.

Work-life balance Finding happiness and meaning in one's career isn't a new concept, but more and more Singaporeans have been cognizant of this issue since the pandemic. Younger workers in Singapore are more also likely to quit if they felt that their jobs prevented them from enjoying life, the survey found. About 56 per cent of respondents aged between 18 and 24 said that they would quit if their jobs prevented them from enjoying life. Likewise, 57 per cent of respondents aged 25 to 34 echoed that same thinking. However, less than half (46 per cent) of respondents aged between 45 and 54 agreed with this sentiment   Story continues The report said that mature workers may have higher financial responsibilities, or a more established career, which makes them less likely to switch employers as they would rather not risk their job and income security.On the other hand, Generation Z workers yearn for career progression and opportunities to learn and upskill, which drives them to find employers that have a structure and culture that best match their career growth goals.Meaningful jobsAbout 41 per cent of workers in Singapore said that they would rather be unemployed than feel unhappy in their jobs.Almost one in two, or 48 per cent, of respondents aged 18 to 24 said they would rather be unemployed than feel unhappy in their jobs. This is higher than the global average of 33 per cent.Remarkably, 47 per cent of respondents aged between 45 and 54 reported that they would not mind earning a lower salary if they felt that their job contributed to society, which made up the largest proportion across all the generations.More than two in five respondents said that they would not accept a job with a business that does not align with their values on social and environmental issues, and if the company was not making a proactive effort to improve diversity and equity.Follow us on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

When you see banks' advertisements that boast bonus cash rebate and rewards points, it can be difficult to resist the temptation of applying for a new card just to get those welcome bonuses. But is it really a smart financial move to apply for a card simply to get some extra points? The answer, like many others in the realm of credit cards, isn't a straightforward \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d  The credit card rewards churning process is to sign up for as many credit cards as possible. People do this for the sole purpose of gaining the very first credit card rewards, points and other rewards in their possession. After getting the rewards, the user then closes and cancels the credit card account - which is a red flag to credit card issuers. The idea of applying for a credit card based solely on its bonus isn\u2019t new. Credit card churners have been doing it for years. Churners are individuals who frequently open and close reward credit cards to collect miles, points and cash back from welcome offers. After using up these bonuses, they quickly cancel their cards to avoid incurring further costs in annual fees. In today\u2019s market, this is a highly profitable hobby: Singapore has some of the most generous credit card offers in the world, and reward credit cards are outdoing one another to compete for the business of everyday consumers. Churners are simply taking money that is sitting on the table. However, this practice of \"credit card churning\" has its own pitfalls that cannot be taken lightly. Risk #1: Credit Card Rewards Are Not Worth Going into Debt, Spending More than You Can Afford Or Wrecking Your Credit Churning requires some time investment and planning. Even opening a single credit card just to get the bonus can lead to a financial loss if you aren't careful. Churners are typically well versed about these risks, and take great care to avoid them. For example, one needs to be sure of their ability to meet a card's requirements to be eligible for its bonuses. Most cards only give welcome offers to people who manage to charge a certain amount to their card within a few months of account opening. Citi PremierMiles Visa Card, for example, has you spending at least S$10,000 within the first 3 months in order to qualify for its 15,000 bonus mile offer. For many, this can be an immense strain on their monthly budget, especially if they are juggling multiple credit cards at the same time.  You also need to account for annual fees. For instance, Standard Chartered Visa Infinite Card charges users S$588.6 per year. Ask yourself, is this something worth paying just because you want to earn its 35,000 bonus miles? Consider the value of what you're getting out of the bonus, and whether it justifies paying the fee. Also, you should ask yourself whether you can afford the payment. Even cards with an annual fee waiver charge the annual fee immediately on your first month's bill, and refund your fee after you meet the minimum spending requirement. You better have the necessary funds to pay it off, otherwise you may incur interest charges on your first bill.   Story continues Let's do some math to prove that spending out of your means just to earn bonus mile awards is not a profitable exercise. Tom has a monthly budget of S$2,000 and gets a new Citi PMV card. In order to receive the 15,000 bonus miles, he spends S$10,000 for the first 3 months, S$4,000 more than what he could afford. He may be happy about getting the 15,000 miles, but what he doesn't realise is that he now has a credit card debt of S$4,000 that charges him an annual interest of 25%. Even if Tom were to decrease his monthly spending to S$1,500 from the 4th month to pay his debt back S$500 a month, he will end up paying S$245 in interest, which is significantly more than S$150 that he will have earned in miles (1 mile = S$0.01 for economy flights). This doesn't even take into account the annual fee you had to pay!  monthly interest expense a person needs to pay in order to fully repay a credit card loan of S$4,000 with 25% APR when repaying S$500 per month  Risk #2: Opening A Card Just For The Bonus Can Get You On The Bank's Bad SideBanks are increasingly cracking down on the practice of churning. While you can probably get away with it once or twice, sustaining it over a long period of time can be difficult. When issuers like DBS put out a big bonus promotions for credit cards, they are accepting the loss in hopes of winning over a long-term customer who may prove profitable over a long period of time. This is why most credit card promotions are eligible only for \"new customers\" who have not held a card from the issuer in the last 6-12 months. If a user closes a card after getting the bonus, they are eating away into the profitability of these products. To discourage this behavior, some banks in the US have already begun to freeze accounts and points of people who they suspect earned their bonuses in this way.On top of everything we mentioned above, opening and closing a new account can have consequences on your credit score. This could have a potentially negative effect when you need to get bank loans to buy a home or to get some quick cash to take care of a personal emergency. Because of these reasons, frequently churning through credit cards may affect your ability to be approved for future credit card and loan applications from these banks.The Bottom LineWhile credit card rewards like S$180 of cash rebate or 10,000 bonus miles can be lucrative, blindly pursuing credit card rewards without regard to your monthly budget could actually leave you worse off. The factors we discussed above should make it clear that there is a lot you need to consider before hitting that application button. Like churners, you can benefit greatly from grabbing credit card bonuses. However, you shouldn\u2019t do it without a proper understanding of the intricacies involved. None of the individual topics are too difficult to understand. You just have to put in the time to understand what you can afford and what you are able to get in return.The article When Rewards Credit Card Churning Becomes Dangerous originally appeared on ValueChampion.ValueChampion helps you find the most relevant information to optimise your personal finances.

Maybank Securities Singapore and BOB Capital Markets India (BOBCAPS) have entered into an agreement to advance Asean and global interest in Indian equities. In a joint press release dated Aug 8, the two financial institutions say the tie-up would enable Maybank to enhance its product coverage to global institutional clients, while allowing BOBCAPS to strengthen its India offerings to clients in Asean and the rest of the world.  Maybank Securities is part of Maybank Investment Banking Group (Maybank IBG), the investment banking arm of Maybank, Asean\u2019s fourth largest bank by assets, and BOBCAPS is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of Baroda \u2014\u00a0 a government of India majority-owned commercial bank \u2014 offering a spectrum of financial services across equity products as well as debt advisory services in restructuring & syndication. They add that this relationship \u201cfurther augments\u201d Maybank\u2019s capabilities in serving clients in Asean and key global markets while \u201cempowering\u201d Maybank with bespoke, on-ground and in-depth research insights from BOBCAPS. The association is planned to extend across research, corporate access and roadshows to elevate interest in India equity products. Sanjiv Saraff, joint managing director of BOBCAPS says, \u201cWe are extremely pleased and excited about this alliance. This is a great opportunity for us to leverage the existing global clientele of Maybank to significantly improve our distribution reach and to provide them with insightful India equity research.\u201d  According to McLagan Data and Analytics, India forms 10% or around US$4.5 billion ($6.22 billion) of the overall foreign client commissions paid in Asia excluding Japan for cash equities, while Asean is a large contributor of foreign portfolio flows into India including the secondary equity market, new listings, bonds, as well as private equity and venture capital investments. CEO of Maybank IBG Ami Moris says, \u201cAs our client franchise grows, we continue our focus on delivering value, and strengthening our platform and thought leadership. India is now the world\u2019s fifth largest stock exchange with a total market capitalisation of over $3 trillion. Since the start of the pandemic, the Nifty 50 benchmark index has risen 41%, and is a consistent outperformer versus other emerging markets. The investment case for India remains sound, and is supported by strong economic growth.\u201d \u201cMaybank IBG has over recent years successfully constructed a significant strategic partnership portfolio in Asia Pacific, and our alliance with BOBCAPS finally adds India, a most critical target market, to our comprehensive product offering. We expect to unlock more Asean plus global capital flows into India through this combined service,\u201d finishes Moris.

In July alone, 33 units were sold for at least a million dollars.  If the market continues at this pace, we are well on our way to surpassing past years\u2019 records. There were 259 million-dollar HDB flats transacted in 2021 and 82 million-dollar HDB resale flats transacted in 2020. These million-dollar flats are found in prime neighbourhoods such as Bishan, Bukit Merah, Ang Mo Kio, Kallang/Whampoa, Queenstown, and Toa Payoh.\u00a0\u00a0 Since we\u2019re on the topic of million-dollar HDB flats, let\u2019s take a trip down memory lane and look at the top five most expensive resale flats in every decade since the 1990s.

In fact, the most expensive flat recorded in that era was a $900,000 executive maisonette in November 1996. That\u2019s considered expensive even by today\u2019s standards!

Singapore Exchange (SGX)\u2019s chairman Kwa Chong Seng will step down on Dec 31 as part of the board renewal process. Kwa was also the non-executive non-independent director of the board. Kwa was appointed to SGX's board back in Sept 2012 and took on the chairman role in 2016.  Koh Boon Hwee, another Singapore Inc stalwart, will take over as the new chairman of SGX. Koh, whose appointment to the role will be effective on Jan 1, 2023, is currently the chairman and general partner of Altara Ventures, a technology venture capital firm. Koh is probably more adept than most in chairing big Singapore government-linked entities. He held the same role at the likes of Singapore Telecommunications, DBS Group Holdings and Singapore Airlines. Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, says Kwa has made outstanding contributions to SGX. \"As chairman, he successfully led SGX Group to position itself as a multi-asset exchange and a leading and trusted market infrastructure in Asia. \"MAS welcomes SGX Group\u2019s announcement of its leadership renewal and looks forward to working with its incoming Chairman, Mr Koh Boon Hwee, in the next phase of SGX Group\u2019s development,\" says Menon.

(PHOTO: Getty Creative)  \u00b7 Street, Building, Landscape and Interesting Photograph via Getty Images By Ann Koh (Bloomberg) \u2014 Singapore can stabilise wild swings in power prices without needing to impose state control over the energy market, according to a government minister. Steps including efforts to build standby inventories of liquefied natural gas and requirements on power generation companies to bolster fuel stockpiles have helped \u201censure uninterrupted energy supply\u201d and steadied prices \u201cwithout the need to bring the electricity market under state control within the short to medium term,\u201d Tan See Leng, second minister for trade and industry, told parliament Tuesday. Tan was responding to a lawmaker\u2019s question asking if temporary nationalisation would be considered as businesses and consumers in the city-state struggle with soaring wholesale costs of electricity, and after some power retailers collapsed. Wholesale electricity prices last month had a series of spikes close to a maximum limit of S$4,500 a megawatt-hour, which was last reached in 2012, because of tight fuel supply as global utilities contend with the impact of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Retailers have been particularly exposed to the price fluctuations as they buy power from the wholesale market, but sell to customers at a fixed rate. \u00a9 2022 Bloomberg L.P.

The building sits on a freehold site of 5,626 sq ft and has a gross floor area (GFA) of 16,733 sq ft.

The building was redeveloped in 2004, and was refurbished recently. It comes with a basement, lift and 10 mechanical parking spaces. Currently, the building has a retail store on the first level and a wedding banquet organizer and event space on the upper floors, namely the Afi iki Palace. However, the building will be sold with vacant possession, says Richard Tan, PropNex senior associate group district director. The building comes with a restaurant/F&B licence. According to Tan, it is increasingly difficult to obtain new F&B licences or change of use to F&B in the Little India Conservation Area. \u201cThe standalone building has a double frontage along Serangoon Road and Hindoo Road,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe building is unique as it has a gold fa\u00e7ade.\u201d    The freehold, five-storey commercial building at 202 Serangoon Road is located within a five-minute walk of the Farrer Park MRT station and the City Square Mall (Source: EdgeProp Landlens) Having parking spaces within the building is an added bonus, observes Tan, especially in an area like Little India Conservation Area where parking space is rare.\u00a0Farrer Park MRT station and the City Square Mall is also within a five- to six-minute walk. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of investor interest \u2013 from both local and foreign entities \u2013 in commercial shophouses,\u201d says Tan. This is backed up by PropNex Research in its recent 2Q2022 report on the commercial shophouse market.  In 2Q022, there were 64 commercial shophouse deals with a total value of $481 million, according to PropNex Research. It is 23% higher than the 52 transactions in 1Q2022, but 9.2% lower q-o-q than the $531 million worth of deals the previous quarter.\u00a0(Find Singapore commercial properties with our commercial directory) District 8 (Little India, Jalan Besar) recorded the highest number of transactions among the various districts. It accounted for 34 transactions worth more than $218 million in 2Q2022, smashing the last record of 29 transactions valued at $130 million in 2Q2013, according to PropNex Research.   Story continues   More than 860 rental contracts worth $8.2 million were signed in 2Q2022. Median monthly shophouse rentals continued to grow to $5.50 psf in 2Q2022, from $5.37 psf in 1Q2022.In the Serangoon Road neighbourhood, units with F&B licensing can command rental rates of $8 to $10 psf per month, and upper floors at $4 psf per month, estimates PropNex\u2019s Tan. The building at 202 Serangoon Road will be sold with vacant possession, he adds.\u201cWith looming global economic headwinds, investors are expected to continue to view commercial shophouses as a defensive asset with the ability to ride out uncertain times,\u201d says PropNex Research.The EOI for the freehold, commercial building at 202 Serangoon Road closed on September 8, 2022.Check out the latest listings near Serangoon Road, Hindoo Road, Little India, District 8, Farrer Park MRT StationSee Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) Portfolio of six freehold shophouses on Serangoon Road for sale at $63 mil lyf Farrer Park, an art focused co-living space managed by The Ascott, debuts in May  Euro-Asia Apartments on Serangoon Road up for collective sale at $218 mil En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

The consortium will pay S$304 million to buy 80% stake in 800 Super, one of the three public waste collectors in the city-state. The group will hold the stake via Keppel Asia Infrastructure Fund and Keppel Infrastructure.

The interest earned will be accrued up to five decimal places and credited to accounts with every cent earned. In contrast, POSB, the most commonly used bank, offers 0.05% for the first $10,000. To encourage a habit of saving, GXS customers can also customise up to eight Savings Pockets within their accounts. Designed to help users save for specific goals, users can transfer funds anytime from their main savings accounts to individual Pockets. Customers also earn greater daily interest with Pockets at 1.58% p.a. In addition to naming their Pockets after their goals, users can also choose photo labels. To help them stay on track, the app will send \u201cnudges\u201d to users, encouraging them to top up their Pockets when they are close to reaching their saving goals, says GXS.  According to Charles Wong, Singapore CEO of GXS, the bank will leverage Grab and Singtel\u2019s platform users, which together welcome more than three million Singaporeans daily. \u201cGXS is uniquely positioned to learn and to refine the banking experience so that it is extremely personalised and relevant to customers because we are part of a powerhouse ecosystem that includes Grab and Singtel.\u201d Wong had spent two decades at Citi before joining Grab in April 2020 as senior managing director. He took on the lead role at GXS in April 2022. Wong adds: \u201cThe frequent interactions between consumers and the platforms within our ecosystem provide us with deeper and sharper insights on what our customers need and how we can serve them seamlessly across all touchpoints within our ecosystem.\u201d GXS\u2019s digital bank app will be available in Apple\u2019s App Store and the Google Play Store from Sept 5. The bank\u2019s services will be rolled out progressively, says GXS, starting with selected employees and underbanked customers within GXS, Grab and Singtel, followed by consumers thereafter.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

Amidst such conditions, both retail investors and hedge funds alike have experienced losses in one way or another. If 1Q wasn\u2019t bad enough for Temasek Holdings, 2Q failed to show any recovery as their portfolio fell by a further 22%. As such, with this recent 13F report, Temasek\u2019s portfolio has reduced by almost 40% since their all-time high back in 2Q2021.Whalewisdom2Q2022 Reported Value : $18,331,006 (-38.6%)2Q2021 Reported Value : $29,876,5344Q2021 Reported Value : $27,704,8711Q2022 Reported Value : $23,711,491At a time where all seems lost, perhaps what could be \u201cwisdom\u201d to us are some of the highest conviction buys that Temasek executed during this bear market. After all, why buy in a bear market if you think it won\u2019t bring you gains in the future? \n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDB Resale Prices (2025) by MRT and PSF: A Complete Visual Guide\n\n March 15, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina Growth + Steady Dividends \u2013 One ETF to Get Both\n\n March 11, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith that, here are:Top 5 buys Temasek Holdings made in 2Q221. NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ : NVDA)Temasek doubled their position in NVDA since 1Q2022Rank :51Total Shares Held : 234,309Change in Shares : +152,162Market Value : $35,519,000Previous % of Portfolio : 0.09Current % of Portfolio : 0.19Nvidia would most certainly be a familiar name to many given how prominent they are in the manufacturing of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs). A clear beneficiary of the pandemic, investors of Nvidia reaped huge gains during covid where GPUs were in high demand due to people playing more games during lockdowns as well as their utility in crypto-mining. At present, with the crypto bear rally and the general reduction in your average \u201cstay-at-home\u201d gamer, demand for GPUs have fallen significantly and with that so has the share price of Nvdia. In my opinion, present levels do indicate decent risk-to-reward with the stock trading at about 50% off their high\u2019s of $300+.What the future holds for Nvidia is anyone\u2019s guess but what\u2019s interesting is that GPUs are likely to gain more utility in our daily lives overtime as they are now being used in as part of the OS in many high-end cars as well as in our Metaverse Headsets such as the Oculus!2. Orchard Therapeutics (NASDAQ : ORTX)Rank :85Total Shares Held : 4,319,049Change in Shares : +4,319,049Market Value : $2,523,000Previous % of Portfolio : 0Current % of Portfolio : 0.01Orchard Therapeutics plc develops gene therapies for serious and life-threatening rare diseases. The company\u2019s gene therapy approach seeks to transform a patient\u2019s hematopoietic stem cells into a gene-modified cellular drug product. It provides Strimvelis, a gammaretroviral-based product for the treatment of adenosine deaminase-severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID)WhaleWisdomRanked 85th in their portfolio with a market value of a little over 2 million, Temasek\u2019s entry into Orchard Therapeutics is not considered big by any means and in all honestly is indeed negligible. However, what I\u2019ve found to be interesting with this trade is how Temasek is buying into a PENNY STOCK. At the time of writing ORTX is trading at a mere $0.55 which then begs the question that don\u2019t investors avoid penny stocks? In which case, I would consider this one of their more \u201cnotable\u201d buys given how they are playing in very dangerous waters. 3. Gogoro Inc (NASDAQ : GGR)Rank :42Total Shares Held : 8,002,475Change in Shares : +8,002,475Market Value : $61,219,000Previous % of Portfolio : 0Current % of Portfolio : 0.33Gogoro\u00a0is a\u00a0Taiwanese\u00a0company that developed a\u00a0battery-swapping\u00a0refueling platform for urban\u00a0electric\u00a0two-wheel\u00a0scooters,\u00a0mopeds\u00a0and\u00a0motorcycles. It also develops its own line of electric scooters and offers its own vehicle innovations to vehicle maker partners like Hero, Yamaha, Aeonmotor, PGO, eReady and eMOVING.WikipediaDespite the overall lack of interest and appetite in the market for growth stocks, it is clear that Temasek is still in the game as they bought into yet another money-losing, EV related high-growth stock. Listed via a SPAC merger, think of Gogoro as a more mobile version of NIO where they provide \u201csmart swappable batteries, charging infrastructure and cloud software that monitors the condition and performance of vehicles and batteries\u201d. With present market conditions, I must say that a trade worth $61 million into a non-profitable company does indeed warrant additional attention. Upon more in-depth research, it would seem that Gogoro has a monopoly over the refueling industry for two-wheeled vehicles as they were able to achieve 92% market share in Taiwan in the first half of 2022. As skeptical as I am about money-losing stocks, having such a significant market share does seem promising for a small company with little over 1.24B in Market Cap.4. TPG Inc (NASDAQ : TPG)Temasek increased their stake in TPG by 22%.Rank :32Total Shares Held : 5,220,258Change in Shares : +970,258Market Value : $124,816,000Previous % of Portfolio : 0.53Current % of Portfolio : 0.68TPG is a leading global alternative asset management firm founded in San Francisco in 1992 with $127 billion of assets under management and investment and operational teams in 12 offices globally. TPG invests across five multi-product platforms: Capital, Growth, Impact, Real Estate, and Market Solutions and our unique strategy is driven by collaboration, innovation, and inclusion.About TPGFirst and foremost, do note that this company is NOT the telco that we know here in Singapore. TPG inc is in fact an asset management firm in the alternative asset space managing about $127 billion in assets through a principled focus on innovation. What\u2019s interesting about this firm is that while Temasek lost about 40% of its portfolio value as compared to this time last year, TPG actually reported an increase of 17% in their total AUM ($127 billion) as of June 30, 2022 as compared to June 30, 2021 ($108 billion)TPG inc does come across to me as more of a value play considering that they are sitting on a PE Ratio of about 14.86. This in my opinion is of fair value as compared to other asset managers such as Blackrock (PE 18.4) and BAM (PE 12.27). Furthermore, with a dividend yield of about 5%, this may very much be one of those stocks in Temasek\u2019s portfolio that add stability over growth. 5. Nu Holdings Ltd (NYSE : NU)Rank :77Total Shares Held : 1,442,994Change in Shares : +1,442,994Market Value : $5,397,000Previous % of Portfolio : 0.00Current % of Portfolio : 0.03Nu Holdings Ltd. operates as a digital financial services platform and technology company primarily in Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia. It offers Nu credit and debit cards; Ultraviolet credit and debit cards; and mobile payment solutions for NuAccount customers to make and receive transfers, pay bills, and make everyday purchases through their mobile phones.\u00a0Yahoo FinanceNU Holdings seems to be a stock that more institutional investors are adding of late. I first learnt of this company when Buffett took a $1B bite into the company early this year. Since then, NU has indeed been in the spotlight quite abit as both bulls and bears couldn\u2019t quite figure out why Buffett would make such a bet. Institutions seem to have taken a liking to this stock as even JPMorgan bought 38.9 Million shares of the company back in early July.With their most recent earnings report, it would seem apparent that while NU remains fundamentally weak (not profitable at present), their growth story is indeed intact as they have historically grown both user acquisition and revenue quickly. Investing during a bear marketI\u2019d think that every dollar counts for more during a bear market as capital becomes more costly due to rising interest rates. Therefore, I do look at the trades of institutional investors a little closer as they do help to narrow down investing ideas greatly. Much speculation still surrounds the many trades made by Temasek this quarter hence discretion is always advised.

Learn More\n\n\n\nToday\u2019s demand for real-time data analytics at the edge marks the dawn of a new era in machine learning (ML): edge intelligence. That need for time-sensitive data is, in turn, fueling a massive AI chip market, as companies look to provide ML models at the edge that have less latency and more power efficiency.\u00a0\nConventional edge ML platforms consume a lot of power, limiting the operational efficiency of smart devices, which live on the edge. Those\u00a0devices are also hardware-centric, limiting their computational capability and making them incapable of handling varying AI workloads. They leverage power-inefficient GPU- or CPU-based architectures and are also not optimized for embedded edge applications that have latency requirements.\u00a0\nEven though industry behemoths like Nvidia and Qualcomm offer a wide range of solutions, they mostly use a combination of GPU- or data center-based architectures and scale them to the embedded edge as opposed to creating a purpose-built solution from scratch. Also, most of these solutions are set up for larger customers, making them extremely expensive for smaller companies. \nIn essence, the $1 trillion global embedded-edge market is reliant on legacy technology that limits the pace of innovation.\nA new machine learning solution for the edge\nML company Sima AI seeks to address these shortcomings with its machine learning-system-on-chip (MLSoC) platform that enables ML deployment and scaling at the edge. The California-based company, founded in 2018, announced today that it has begun shipping the MLSoC platform for customers, with an initial focus of helping solve computer vision challenges in smart vision, robotics, Industry 4.0, drones, autonomous vehicles, healthcare and the government sector.\nThe platform uses a software-hardware codesign approach that emphasizes software capabilities to create edge-ML solutions that consume minimal power and can handle varying ML workloads.\u00a0\nBuilt on 16nm technology, the MLSoC\u2019s processing system consists of computer vision processors for image pre- and post-processing, coupled with dedicated ML acceleration and high-performance application processors. Surrounding the real-time intelligent video processing are memory interfaces, communication interfaces, and system management \u2014 all connected via a network-on-chip (NoC). The MLSoC features low operating power and high ML processing capacity, making it ideal as a standalone edge-based system controller, or to add an ML-offload accelerator for processors, ASICs and other devices.\nThe software-first approach includes carefully-defined intermediate representations (including the TVM Relay IR), along with novel compiler-optimization techniques. This software architecture enables Sima AI  to support a wide range of frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, etc.) and compile over 120+ networks.\u00a0\nThe MLSoC promise \u2013 a software-first approach\nMany ML startups are focused on building only pure ML accelerators and not an SoC that has a computer-vision processor, applications processors, CODECs, and external memory interfaces that enable the MLSoC to be used as a stand-alone solution not needing to connect to a host processor. Other solutions usually lack network flexibility, performance per watt, and push-button efficiency \u2013 all of which are required to make ML effortless for the embedded edge.\nSima AI\u2019s MLSoC platform differs from other existing solutions as it solves all these areas at the same time with its software-first approach.\u00a0\nThe MLSoC platform is flexible enough to address any computer vision application, using any framework, model, network, and sensor with any resolution. \u201cOur ML compiler leverages the open-source Tensor Virtual Machine (TVM) framework as the front-end, and thus supports the industry\u2019s widest range of ML models and ML frameworks for computer vision,\u201d Krishna Rangasayee, CEO and founder of Sima AI, told VentureBeat in an email interview.\u00a0\nFrom a performance point of view, Sima AI\u2019s MLSoC platform claims to deliver 10x better performance in key figures of merit such as FPS/W and latency than alternatives.\u00a0\nThe company\u2019s hardware architecture optimizes data movement and maximizes hardware performance by precisely scheduling all computation and data movement ahead of time, including internal and external memory to minimize wait times.\u00a0\nAchieving scalability and push-button results \nSima AI offers APIs to generate highly optimized MLSoC code blocks that are automatically scheduled on the heterogeneous compute subsystems. The company has created a suite of specialized and generalized optimization and scheduling algorithms for the back-end compiler that automatically convert the ML network into highly optimized assembly codes that run on the machine learning-accelerator (MLA) block.\u00a0\nFor Rangasayee, the next phase of Sima AI\u2019s growth is focused on revenue and scaling their engineering and business teams globally. As things stand, Sima AI has raised $150 million in funding from top-tier VCs such as Fidelity and Dell Technologies Capital.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Sony, Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nUpscaling tech has been the surprise hit of recent graphics card releases.\u00a0Ray tracing may grab the headlines, and make for some beautiful images, but being able to run your games at higher frame rates with little noticeable difference in quality is often more useful.Nvidia has the lead here with its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), producing far better image quality than the competition, although AMD's FSR 2.0 is closing the gap. Competition is great though and means both AMD and Nvidia are trying to perfect their technologies to get the most out of the latest games.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNew modder tool makes it easier than ever to swap AMD's FSR 4 scaling for Nvidia's DLSS or Intel's XeSS and vice versa\n\n\n\n\nThere's a simple way to enable FSR 3 frame gen in Avowed and it more than doubled my frame rate, but it makes waterfalls look ugly as sin\n\n\n\nOne frustration with DLSS is that a lot of the settings are hidden out of sight. That's absolutely fine if you just want to get on and enjoy your games, but if you enjoy peering behind the curtain to see what's actually happening, you can be left wanting. Until you discover this simple little registry tweak that is.\u00a0By adding a single line to the registry, you can see what version of DLSS the game is running, which of Microsoft's DirectX APIs is being used, and possibly most interesting of all, what resolution the game is rendering at and what it is upscaling to. This is all shown in a simple text interface in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen, and it's easy to turn it all off again once you've played around a bit too.To get up and running with this, simply hit Win + R and enter Regedit in the box. Make your way to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\NVIDIA Corporation\\Global\\NGXCore and right-click on the right-hand panel and create a new DWORD (32-bit) Value called ShowDlssIndicator. Set the value of this to 1024 in decimal and then close the Registry Editor and you're done.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Microsoft)(Image credit: Sony, Nvidia)(Image credit: CD Projekt Red, Nvidia)Now when you launch a game that runs DLSS you'll get the pertinent information in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen. Note that while this does work in Cyberpunk 2077, Chromatic Aberration makes it very hard to read, so you'll want to turn that off. It's much easier to see what's happening in most other games, such as in God of War for example.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.To turn it off again, just go to the same registry address and set ShowDlssIndicator to 0 or delete it completely if you prefer.

He fondly remembers the killer combo of a Matrox Millenium and 3dfx Voodoo, and seeing Lara Croft in 3D for the first time. He's very glad hardware has advanced as much as it has though, and is particularly happy when putting the latest M.2 NVMe SSDs, AMD processors, and laptops through their paces. He has a long-lasting Magic: The Gathering obsession but limits this to MTG Arena these days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew modder tool makes it easier than ever to swap AMD's FSR 4 scaling for Nvidia's DLSS or Intel's XeSS and vice versa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a simple way to enable FSR 3 frame gen in Avowed and it more than doubled my frame rate, but it makes waterfalls look ugly as sin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's latest 572.16 driver isn't just for the RTX 50-series, as 20, 30 and 40-series cards are also gifted with significant updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll say it: The best thing I saw from Nvidia at CES wasn't its sweet new GPUs, but some tasty AI every RTX gamer can enjoy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Infused with AMD DNA': FSR 4 has been announced with a healthy dose of machine learning and support for 30+ games at launch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nvidia App is damaging frame rates in some games, on some PCs, with Nvidia staffers recommending you nix the Game Filters overlay as a potential solution to the problem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest in Graphics Cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsus appears to have quietly changed the design of its Q-Release PCIe slot after claims of potential GPU pin damage \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree lucky folks in India can win the dubious honour of buying an RTX 5080 GPU at Nvidia MSRP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup allegedly trying to smuggle Nvidia Blackwell chips stare down bail set at over $1 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI will be crammed in more of the graphics pipeline as Nvidia and Microsoft are bringing AI shading to a DirectX preview next month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia says it's sold twice as many RTX 50-series cards as RTX 40-series in the first 5 weeks.

Literal stick figures and sketches allow him to lay out possible compositions and configurations, scanned into Figma, complementing his moodboard, which prepared him to begin the 3D stage.\nFESQ deployed Cinema 4D to build out the base model for the skull. Cinema 4D let him select from popular GPU-accelerated 3D renderers, such as V-Ray, OctaneRender and Redshift, giving him the freedom to switch depending on which renderer is more advantageous.\n\u201cDouble/Sided\u201d base model with supplemental assets.\nAs his system is equipped with a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU, the viewport becomes GPU-accelerated, enabling smooth interactivity while editing the 3D model. Satisfied with the look, FESQ turned his attention towards creating supplemental assets that were placed on the skull, such as the flowers and electrical emitters. FESQ often tabs Daz Studio at this point in his projects. While not needed with Double/Sided, Daz offers the largest 3D model library with a wide selection of free and premium 3D content, and artists benefit from its RTX-accelerated AI denoiser.\nIndividual flowers are created then exported into Cinema 4D.\nFESQ quickly renders out high-quality files with his GPU\u2019s RTX-accelerated NVIDIA Iray renderer, saving valuable time without having to wait.\nThis shade of purple is just right.\nNext, FESQ pivoted to Adobe Substance 3D Painter to apply colors and textures. This \u201cmight be one of the most important aspects of my work,\u201d he stated.\nAnd for good reason, as FESQ is colorblind. One of the more challenging aspects in his creative work is distinguishing between different colors. This makes FESQ\u2019s ability to create stunning, vibrant art all the more impressive.\nFESQ then applied various colors and light materials directly to his 3D model. NVIDIA RTX and NVIDIA Iray technology in the viewport enabled him to ideate in real time and use ray-traced baking for faster rendering speeds \u2014 all accelerated by his GPU.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/studio-itns-fesq-wk16-double-sided-bts.mp4\n\u00a0\nHe returned to Cinema 4D to rig the asset, apply meshes and finish animating the scene, leaving final composite work to be completed in Adobe After Effects.\nRealism can be further enhanced by adding accurate depth effects. For more insights, watch FESQ\u2019s Studio Session tutorial Using MoGraph to Create Depth in Animations in Cinema 4D & Redshift.\nFESQ\u2019s color scheme manifested over time as the consistent use of red and blue morphs into a distinct purple.\nHere FESQ used the Lumetri Color effect panel to apply professional-quality grading and color correction tools to the animation, directly on his timeline, with GPU-accelerated speed. The Glow feature, also GPU accelerated, added the neon light look that makes Double/Sided simply stunning.\nFor tips on how to create neon cables like these, check out FESQ\u2019s Studio Session tutorial Easily Create Animated Neon Cables in Cinema 4D & Redshift to bring animated pieces to life.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/studio-itns-fesq-wk16-double-sided-final.mp4\n\u00a0\nFESQ couldn\u2019t contemplate how he\u2019d complete his vision without his GPU, noting \u201cpretty much my entire workflow relies on GPU acceleration.\u201d\n3D artist FESQ.\nArtists seeking ways to create surreal landscapes can view FESQ\u2019s Studio Session tutorial Creating Surreal Landscapes Using Cloners in Cinema 4D & Redshift.\nCheck out FESQ\u2019s Instagram for a sampling of his work.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

Over long periods, high-quality companies and the indexes they're a part of tend to increase in value.\nSomething else that's commonplace on Wall Street is change. It's perfectly normal for innovation, acquisitions, competitive advantages, and other factors to shake up the world's largest publicly traded companies on a fairly regular basis.\nJust 18 years ago, companies like General Electric, AIG, and Intel were among the 10 largest publicly traded companies by market cap. As of Aug. 4, Intel wasn't even in the top 50 any longer, while GE and AIG had fallen out of the top 125 and top 250, respectively. Eight years from now, in 2030, the stock market's 10 largest stocks could look vastly different than they do today.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhile absolutely nothing is set in stone, I predict that the following 10 stocks will have the largest market caps by 2030. Note that these 10 companies aren't listed in any particular order.\n1. Berkshire Hathaway\nThe first stock, conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.03%) (BRK.B 0.04%), should retain its spot in the top 10, even if billionaire CEO Warren Buffett isn't at the helm come 2030. After overseeing an average annual return on the company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 20.1% since 1965, Buffett has clearly shown he's set his company up for long-term success.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne factor that makes Berkshire Hathaway such an incredible company is the mountain of passive income it collects every year. Over the next 12 months, Buffett's company is expected to bring in well over $6 billion in dividend income, with $4.25 billion coming from just a handful of companies. Because dividend stocks have a long history of outperforming nondividend payers, holding these time-tested companies for years or decades provides an added boost.\n2. Apple\nPerhaps the least-surprising prediction is that the largest publicly traded company in the U.S., Apple (AAPL -0.77%), will remain in the top 10 largest stocks by market cap by 2030.\nAside from an easily recognized brand name and faithful customer base, Apple's innovation is key to its success. Introducing a 5G-capable iPhone quickly pushed up its market share in the U.S., while CEO Tim Cook is busy leading a multiyear transition that emphasizes subscription services. Ultimately, subscriptions should boost Apple's operating margins and lessen the sales volatility witnessed during product replacement cycles.\nApple has also repurchased $520 billion worth of its own common stock since the beginning of 2013. If this aggressive buyback program continues, value investors are likely to continue plowing into Apple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Visa\nPayment processor Visa (V -0.08%) currently finds itself on the outside looking in (No. 11). By the turn of the decade, I expect it to firmly find itself as one of the 10 largest companies by market cap.\nVisa's opportunity for expansion is enormous. Most global transactions are still being conducted in cash, which means it can expand organically into underbanked regions, such as the Middle East, Africa, and Southeastern Asia, or lean on acquisitions to grow (e.g., the Visa Europe buyout in 2016). Sustained double-digit annual growth should be the expectation throughout the decade.\nWhat's more, Visa strictly sticks to payment processing. Although the company would probably do just fine as a lender, it would also expose Visa to potential loan delinquencies and losses during recessions. By avoiding lending, Visa is able to bounce back from economic downturns faster than its peers and maintain a profit margin above 50%.\n4. Alphabet\nAnother FAANG stock that has an exceptionally high likelihood of retaining its top-10 ranking by market cap come 2030 is Alphabet (GOOGL -2.33%) (GOOG -2.37%), the parent company of internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle has long been Alphabet's foundational operating segment. Over the past two years, it's handled no less than 91% of global internet search share, a big reason why Alphabet sports such incredible ad-pricing power. As traffic acquisition costs decline over time, Google should continue to be a cash cow for the company.\nBut Alphabet's future is about its higher-growth initiatives like YouTube and Google Cloud. YouTube has grown into the second-most-visited social site in the world, while Google Cloud has gobbled up 8% of global cloud infrastructure spending.\u00a0\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n5. Salesforce\nCloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider Salesforce (CRM -0.80%) could make one of the biggest leaps (currently No. 43) in terms of market cap by 2030. CRM software is what's used to help businesses enhance customer relationships and boost sales.\nGlobal CRM software sales are expected to sustain double-digit growth through at least mid-decade, which is great news for the industry's unquestioned leader. According to IDC, Salesforce commanded a 23.8% share of CRM software spending in 2021 (over four times its next-closest competitor).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to its commanding market share, co-CEO and co-founder Marc Benioff has a penchant for making earnings-accretive acquisitions. These deals broaden the Salesforce ecosystem and help with the company's cross-selling opportunities.\n6. Amazon\nE-commerce stock Amazon (AMZN -1.18%) is another really strong bet to retain its spot in among the 10 largest stocks by the turn of the decade.\nMost folks know Amazon for its industry-leading online marketplace. In 2022, eMarketer projects that Amazon will account for 39.5% of all U.S. online retail sales. But the real crown jewel is the more than 200 million Prime members who've signed up as a result of its leading marketplace. The fees collected from Prime members help Amazon expand its logistics network and reinvest in high-growth initiatives.\nThere's also Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is the global No. 1 in cloud infrastructure spending with 33% market share. Corporate cloud spending is still in its early innings, which means Amazon's operating cash flow could skyrocket in the years ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. PayPal Holdings\nThe company I predict will make the biggest leap into the top 10 stocks by market cap is fintech giant PayPal Holdings (PYPL -0.68%). PayPal is currently No. 88, with a $112 billion market cap.\nDigital payments are still in their infancy, which bodes well for fee-based payment platforms. Even with U.S. gross domestic product declining in back-to-back quarters, PayPal's total payment volume on its network continues to grow by a double-digit percentage on a constant-currency basis.\nArguably even more important, active users are more engaged than ever. At the end of 2020, active users were completing 40.9 transactions over the trailing 12 months (ttm). This figure is up to 48.7 transactions per active account on a ttm basis through June 2022, and it continues to climb.\u00a0\n8. Microsoft\nSoftware kingpin Microsoft (MSFT -1.41%), the only company from the 10 largest stocks by market cap in 1999 to still have a top-10 position today, has a good shot at sustaining its dominance throughout the decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft's success is a function of raking in mammoth amounts of cash flow from its legacy operations and funneling this cash into faster-growing projects. For instance, even though its high-margin Windows franchise is generally a slow grower, it still accounts for a 76% share of global desktop operating systems.\u00a0\nMicrosoft is utilizing this cash flow to reinvest in a variety of cloud initiatives -- Azure is the global No. 2 in cloud infrastructure spending and grew sales by 46% on a constant-currency basis in the June-ended quarter -- and fuel acquisitions.\u00a0 For instance, Microsoft offered $68.7 billion to acquire gaming company Activision Blizzard\u00a0in January.\n\n9. Chevron\nDespite a feverish renewable energy push by most developed countries, I predict oil and gas major Chevron (CVX 1.13%) will find its way into 10 largest publicly traded companies by market cap in 2030.\nThe biggest reason for this push is the expectation that oil and natural gas prices will remain elevated for many years to come. The pandemic resulted in multiple years of reduced domestic and international drilling and pipeline investment. Couple this with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and you'll see there's a clear risk to global energy supply.\n\n\n\n\n\nChevron is also in excellent financial shape compared to most other integrated oil stocks. By prudently deploying its capital and minimizing debt, Chevron has been able to maintain its superior dividend, repurchase its own stock, and fund key natural gas projects in the Asia-Pacific region.\n10. Meta Platforms\nLastly, social media stock Meta Platforms (META -3.66%), the company formerly known as Facebook, should find itself as one of the 10 largest stocks in 2030. You'll note that current top-10 stocks Tesla (TSLA -4.72%), UnitedHealth Group (UNH 1.24%), Nvidia (NVDA -2.71%), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 0.79%), didn't make the cut.\nAlthough social media usage statistics can be extremely fickle to project one year in advance, let alone in eight years, Meta has four of the most downloaded apps in the world. On a combined basis, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger attracted 3.65 billion monthly active users in the June-ended quarter. That's over half the global adult population and a big reason why Facebook's ad-pricing power is exceptionally strong more often than not.\nThe wild card is the company's metaverse ambitions, the \"metaverse\" being the next iteration of the internet that allows connected users to interact with each other and their surroundings in a 3D virtual environment. It will be years before the necessary infrastructure is in place to support the metaverse. But once there, Meta's hefty investments could make it a key player in this potentially $30 trillion opportunity.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Aerospace company ST Engineering is the final investor in a Series B capital raise and takes the latest round of fundraising to US$26.1 million, Skyports said Tuesday. The first Series B round in March raised US$23 million. Interest in electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles, or eVTOLs, has grown in recent years, with airlines around the world ordering hundreds of them. Skyports said in April it expects to start operating its first eVTOL terminal in Singapore in 2024.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeMonica Chin is a senior reviewer covering laptops and other gadgets. Monica was a writer for Tom\u2019s Guide and Business Insider before joining The Verge in 2020.There are numerous third-party screen readers available for Windows 11. The most popular ones include Job Access With Speech (JAWS) and NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA). (Microsoft has a full list on its website.)But Windows also has a free, built-in screen reader called Narrator. Given the wealth of options that are out there, the majority of people don\u2019t use it as their primary screen reader. But if you\u2019re in that majority, it can be useful if you\u2019re borrowing someone else\u2019s device and can be there in a pinch if you can\u2019t use your preferred software for whatever reason.If you want to turn on Narrator, there are a couple ways to do it.How to turn on Narrator with the keyboardAssuming you\u2019re not using a remapped keyboard, you can turn on Narrator by pressing Control + Windows + Enter. This will start Narrator and will open Narrator Home (where you can learn about Narrator\u2019s features and tweak settings). You can minimize this, and Narrator will still run, or you can exit it to exit Narrator.This is what will pop up after you turn on Narrator.How to turn on Narrator in the accessibility menuYou can also turn Narrator on in Windows 11\u2019s accessibility settings menu. To do this, go to Settings > Accessibility > Narrator. These options, and more.On this page, you can customize various features of Narrator, including speed, pitch, volume, verbosity, and navigation mode. This is also where you can connect a braille display, sync your settings with other devices, and make other changes that you may need to make. You can turn the keyboard shortcut on and off here as well.How to turn on Narrator from the dockYou can also turn on Narrator in the Windows search bar. To do this, click on the magnifying glass in the Taskbar at the bottom of your screen and type \u201cNarrator.\u201dType \u201cNarrator\u201d into the text box that pops up and click the first result that comes up. This will start Narrator.Should be the first result.Alternatively, you can click on the Windows logo to open the Start menu, click on All apps, and scroll down to Windows Ease of Access. Click on that, and Narrator will be an option beneath it.It\u2019s buried in there.RelatedHow to make the most of your Windows PC\u2019s accessibility featuresSee More: CreatorsHow toMicrosoftTechWindowsMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

However, you or a visually challenged loved one may not be finding the Narrator adequate for your needs. Or maybe, you just don't like its voices. \nBut there are some good alternatives to the Narrator that you could try. Read on to explore a few such screen-reading apps that offer advanced features or more natural-sounding voices\u2014they might be what you need to connect, work, and enjoy your way. \n                        1. Dolphin Screen Reader\n\n\n\n\nDolphin ScreenReader is a powerful screen reader that is designed and developed for blind or severely visually impaired individuals. It will enable you or a visually challenged family member to access the information on your Windows desktop through intelligent speech or a connected braille display.\nThe Dolphin ScreenReader offers you full accessibility to Windows applications and Microsoft Office so you'll be able to work easily and efficiently. You will find ScreenReader easy to navigate with its simple keyboard access and well-laid-out control panel.\nScreenReader supports over 60 braille display models and you can switch between speech and braille at any time\u2014use speech to type and read pages, use braille to work alongside sighted colleagues or deliver presentations with your speaker notes in braille.\nMoreover, you have a choice of synthetic and natural voices with 30 different accents and languages. Plus you get speak-as-you-type functionality and can also control the description verbosity, and the volume and speed of your preferred ScreenReader voices.\nEasyReader for Windows is also included in Dolphin ScreenReader, so you get fully accessible versions of thousands of books and newspapers.\nAs per users of the Dolphin ScreenReader, the settings are very easy to change, updates are easy to do, and the online help and support facility is excellent too.\nDownload: Dolphin Screen Reader (Subscription required, free trial available) \n                        2. Natural Reader\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Are you seeking a screen reader with natural-sounding voices to read out documents, text, and books? The easy-to-use Natural Reader could make for a good assistant.\nNatural Reader will read any text such as Microsoft Word files, webpages, PDF files, and emails. It also features a Pronunciation Editor so you can manually modify the pronunciation of a particular word.\nUsing the OCR function, you can convert printed characters into digital text, which you can listen to and edit in a word-processing program. You can also use OCR to convert screenshots of text from eBook desktop apps, such as Kindle, into speech and audio files.\nAlong with Natural Reader, you can enhance your computing experience further by setting up the improved accessibility features in Windows 11.\nNatural Reader's free version gives you unlimited use with two free Microsoft voices and a Miniboard to read text directly on the page in other applications. However, you'll need to buy one of the three paid plans to access the natural voices.\nThe paid versions also let you convert text into MP3 files. This can help a dyslexic child who finds reading challenging, as you could convert the child's reading assignments into MP3 files to listen to on a music player.\nDownload: Natural Reader (Free, in-app purchases available ) \n                        3. JAWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n JAWS (Job Access With Speech) was originally released in 1989 for MS-DOS by Ted Henter, a former motorcycle racer who lost his sight in a 1978 automobile accident.\nToday, JAWS is the world\u2019s most popular screen reader developed for visually impaired computer users. You can use JAWS to access the apps on your PC through speech and braille.\nWith JAWS, you can surf the internet with web browsing keystrokes, write a document, fill out web forms, read emails and create presentations from your office, remote desktop, or from home.\nJAWS lets you set your voices, keystrokes, HTML preferences, verbosity levels, and more. And with JAWS scripting, you can customize JAWS to work with any application, such as proprietary software developed by large employers.\nYou'll find it easy to work on documents and browse the web, thanks to its inbuilt commands and hotkeys for Microsoft Office, Google Docs, Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and other popular web browsers. Moreover, you'll enjoy clear and understandable audio enabled by its two multilingual synthesizers.\nThe JAWS version 2022 includes a Sound Splitter, so if you're using a stereo headset or speakers, you can route all JAWS or Fusion speech to one ear while routing audio from all other apps to the other ear. That way, you can continue work with JAWS while following along during a Zoom or Teams meeting, a Skype call, or a YouTube video.\nYou can download JAWS for free and check out its 40-minute demo mode before you decide to buy one of its licenses.\nDownload: JAWS (From $95/year) \n                        4. NVDA\n\n\n\n\nNVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) screen reader for the blind and vision impaired stands apart from the others. It is not only free and open source but also as powerful and functional as the paid screen readers.\nDeveloped by NV Access, a registered charity, the award-winning NVDA has been translated by volunteers into more than 55 languages, and been used by people in more than 175 countries.\nYou can use NVDA for free, globally and it's great if you speak a minority language where options are limited or expensive.\nIf you're looking for a job, NVDA can be good support since your hiring company won't have to bear the cost of a paid screen reader. You can carry NVDA on a USB and work or connect wherever you want to. Also, on the move, you can stay empowered with some great text-to-speech apps for your Android phone.\nYou'll work better and smarter with NVDA as this fast and lightweight screen reader offers superior stability and is easy, intuitive, and comfortable to use.\nWith NVDA you can access and interact with many popular apps, including web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, email clients, internet chat software, music players, and office programs such as Microsoft Word and Excel.\nMoreover, you can use NVDA in your preferred language as the built-in speech synthesizer supports over 50 languages and many other third-party voices. And with support for many refreshable braille displays, you can easily work with braille too.\nAs the developers put it: \nThe NVDA screen reader can be downloaded free of charge by anyone. We do this because we believe everyone, especially the world\u2019s poorest blind people deserve access to computers and a way out of poverty.\n\nDownload: NVDA (Free) \n                        5. Text Aloud\n\nJust click the Speak button on the TextAloud toolbar and listen to a text, documents, emails, and webpages as natural-sounding speech on your Windows PC.\nYou can also listen by using TextAloud extensions available in Microsoft Word, Outlook, Edge, Google Chrome, and Firefox. If you want to listen to the text later, TextAloud lets you create audio files which you can download to your smartphone or portable device.\nMoreover, if you or a loved one struggle to read, you'll find that word highlighting in TextAloud helps strengthen recognition when you follow along. TextAloud helps individuals dealing with Dyslexia, ADD, and also low vision.\nYou can try TextAloud free for 20 days. The paid version offers premium voices with a variety of languages and accents.\nDownload: TextAloud ($34.95, free trial available) \n                        Choose A Windows Screen Reader That Makes Computing Easy and Enjoyable\n               \nIf you're not too happy with Narrator, this could be a good time to try out the Windows screen readers featured here. We hope they will assist you or your loved ones to attain a more fulfilling computing experience and make things easy and enjoyable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\n\n\nWindows 10\n\n\n\n\nWindows 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support MakeUseOf.

It is thought that this particular graphics card will be a good vehicle for Nvidia and partners to burn through remaining large stocks of GA102 GPUs, due to its original scarcity and the favor it has found with hardware enthusiasts in recent months.\n\n\nThe 12GB variant of the RTX 3080 was launched at the height of the crypto-boom, but it was never even given an official MSRP. Its street price reflected its relative desirability though, with a premium over its 10GB sibling in excess of 40% during the ETH mining heydays. \n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3080 12GB doesn\u2019t only offer 2GB more VRAM than the 10GB variant, there are some important (mostly positive) differences to the CUDA core configuration and to the memory bus width. One slight change which might be considered for the worse is that the 12GB version of the RTX 3080 Nvidia scaled back the base clock, though it retained the same boost clocks. Lastly, the new 12GB model had a slightly raised reference TDP of 350W (vs 320W).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTallying all the differences, the CUDA core quota and memory quantity/bus advantage meant that the 12GB version of the GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card was the one to covet, especially when gaming at higher resolutions like 4K. Though Nvidia and partners reportedly ceased production of the RTX 3080 12GB about two months ago, its reputation as a choice Ampere product probably helped get it once again rolling along production lines. \n\n\n\nThe consumer GPU business is under pressure right now, with prices spiraling down. This has already started to be evidenced by recent financial reports from the likes of Nvidia. GPU makers and their partners are hoping to sell off remaining stocks yet must rush to do this before buyers decide to just wait for the next generation. At the weekend we reported on a wide range of Nvidia and AMD graphics cards bargains, and it all looks like good news from the consumer side for the next few months anyway. \n\n\n\r\nThe Tweet by @Zed__Wang about Nvidia and partners resuming GeForce  RTX 3080 12GB production probably means that more stock of this currently highly desirable graphics card is on the way, and pricing will get even better. However, as with all such 'leaks', please take the information with a pinch of salt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, GeForce, (nasdaq:nvda), rtx 3080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

Along the way, I tried almost everything I could to get my hands on one at the actual retail price. I joined Discord servers dedicated to posting stock alerts. I found Twitter accounts that did the same for Canadian retailers. But no matter how persistent I was, I could never beat everyone else who wanted a 3070 just as much as I did. By the time summer came, I was ready to give up, and I would have if not for the crypto crash. Igor Bonifacic / EngadgetIf you haven\u2019t followed the market, Bitcoin and Ethereum's slide has dramatically affected GPU prices, particularly on the NVIDIA side of things. The company\u2019s add-in board partners, firms like ASUS and EVGA that produce the majority of GPUs you can buy, are reportedly struggling with overstock after crypto-miners flooded the used market with cheap 30-series video cards. According to some reports, the issue is so bad that NVIDIA may push back the release of its next-generation Ada Lovelace architecture to the end of the year to give its partners time to sell their existing stock. Either way, you can buy a current-generation GPU without jumping through hoops for the first time in nearly two years.When I finally pulled the trigger on my ASUS Dual RTX 3070, I paid $740 CAD before tax or about $565 USD. I probably could have found a used model for less, but I decided I was okay with spending more to get a video card with a full warranty that someone hadn\u2019t abused for crypto-mining. Igor Bonifacic / EngadgetWhat you probably what to know is why I didn\u2019t wait a bit longer for NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation GPUs to arrive. The answer is twofold. Unless the US decides to regulate cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s hard to see a future where the market doesn\u2019t recover and mining becomes lucrative again. Even if that doesn\u2019t happen, by the time NVIDIA\u2019s new GPUs are available to buy, they might not be easy to find.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementAll signs point to the company opening the Ada Lovelace generation with RTX 4090, 4080 and 4070 models. Not only will those likely be more expensive than their 30-series counterparts, but you can also bet they\u2019ll be in high demand among gamers who want the latest and greatest \u2013 particularly the 4070 as the most mainstream model of the trio.For those reasons, I thought there would be a short window where I could buy a new GPU at a reasonable price. That I was running a GTX 1660 Ti with a QHD monitor made my decision easier. I was starting to see the 1660 Ti sometimes struggle to maintain a consistent rate of 60 frames per second in games like Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order at 1440p. The fact the 1660 Ti doesn\u2019t include NVIDA\u2019s DLSS upscaling technology also meant I was looking at a future where I would have to play some games at reduced quality. Igor Bonifacic / EngadgetI can safely say I won\u2019t regret buying the RTX 3070 with its successor right around the corner. Playing games like God of War\u00a0with all graphical settings maxed out and without a single hiccup has been delightful. Even more revelatory has been revisiting games like Control and finally being able to experience them with ray tracing. Sometimes I think we get so caught up trying to pull off the perfect purchase that we don\u2019t buy the product that would serve our needs well right now. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t fall into that trap.If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

The card now has the same amount of cores and memory albeit at a much lower TGP than what was reported earlier.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\nI'm not a chatterbox, but I have to make some updates. I hope you don't mind. a possible RTX 4080, PG136/139-SKU360AD103-300-A19728FP32256bit 16G 21Gbps GDDR6Xtotal power ~420WTSE ~15000Now I have completed the latest update for 4090, 4080 and 4070.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) August 5, 2022\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 'Expected' Specifications\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 is expected to utilize a cut-down AD103-300 GPU configuration with 9,728 cores or 76 SMs enabled of the total 84 units whereas the previous configuration offered 80 SMs or 10,240 cores. While the full GPU comes packed with 64 MB of L2 cache and up to 224 ROPs, the RTX 4080 might end up with 48 MB of L2 cache and lower ROPs too due to its cut-down design.\n\nThe clock speeds are not confirmed yet but considering that the TSMC 4N process is being used, we are expecting clocks between the 2.0-3.0 GHz range. The higher than usual clock speed bump comes from the fact that NVIDIA is making a two-node jump considering the Ampere GPUs with Samsung 8nm node was in reality a 10nm process node with some optimizations. NVIDIA is skipping 7nm and going straight for a 5nm node and not even the vanilla variant but an optimized version of it. With Pascal on the TSMC 16nm node, NVIDIA delivered a huge frequency leap and we can expect a similar jump this time around too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nAs for memory specs, the GeForce RTX 4080 is expected to rock 16 GB GDDR6X capacities that are said to be adjusted at 21 Gbps speeds across a 256-bit bus interface. This will provide up to 672 GB/s of bandwidth. For power, the TBP is said to be rated at around 420W which is close to the RTX 4090 and since the memory clocks aren't that aggressive, it is likely that the core clocks could be tuned for maximum graphics performance.\nIn terms of performance, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 is expected to offer 15,000 points in the 3DMark Time Spy benchmark which the leaker had previously stated as a conservative figure so one can expect around a 35% performance uplift over the RTX 3090 Ti in this specific benchmark.\n\n\n3DMark Time Spy Extreme Graphics\n\nScore\n\n\n04000800012000160002000024000\n\n\n\n\n\n04000800012000160002000024000\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090\n\n19k\n\n\nRTX 4080\n\n15k\n\n\nRTX 3090 Ti\n\n11.3k\n\n\nRTX 4070\n\n11k\n\n\nRX 6950 XT\n\n10.7k\n\n\nRTX 3090\n\n10.1k\n\n\nRTX 3080 Ti\n\n9.8k\n\n\nRTX 3080\n\n8.9k\n\n\nRTX 3070 Ti\n\n7.3k\n\n\nRTX Titan\n\n7.1k\n\n\nRTX 3070\n\n6.7k\n\n\nRTX 2080Ti\n\n6.6k\n\n\nRTX 2080\n\n5.1k\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for its feature set, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 graphics cards will rock all the modern NV feature sets such as the latest 4th Gen Tensor Cores, 3rd gen RT cores, the latest NVENC Encoder, and NVCDEC Decoder, and support for the latest APIs. They will pack all the modern RTX features such as DLSS, Reflex, Broadcast, Resizable-BAR, Freestyle, Ansel, Highlights, Shadowplay, and G-SYNC support too. The graphics card should launch around Q4 2022 or may even slip too Q1 '23 but it should come priced at around $699-$799 US.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series Official Specs:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 DNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAda Lovelace AD102-300Ada Lovelace AD102-250Ada Lovelace AD103-300Ada Lovelace AD104-400Ada Lovelace AD104-250Ada Lovelace AD106-350Ada Lovelace AD107-400\n\n\nProcess NodeTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4N\n\n\nDie Size608mm2608mm2378.6mm2294.5mm2294.5mm2190.0mm2146.0mm2\n\n\nTransistors76 Billion76 Billion45.9 Billion35.8 Billion35.8 Billion22.9 BillionTBD\n\n\nCUDA Cores163841459297287680588843523072\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs512 / 176TBD320 / 112240 / 80184 / 64136 / 48TBD\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores512 / 128456 / 128304 / 76240 / 60184 / 46136 / 34TBD\n\n\nL2 Cache72 MB72 MB64 MB48 MB36 MB32 MB24 MB\n\n\nBase Clock2230 MHz2280 MHz2210 MHz2310 MHz1920 MHz2310 MHz1830 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock2520 MHz2520 MHz2510 MHz2610 MHz2475 MHz2535 MHz2460 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute83 TFLOPsTBD49 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs29 TFLOPs22 TFLOPs15 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPs191 TFLOPsTBD113 TFLOPs82 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs51 TFLOPs35 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPs1321 TOPsTBD780 TOPs641 TOPs466 TOPs353 TOPs242 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity24 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X16 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X8-16 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus384-bit384-bit256-bit192-bit192-bit128-bit128-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed21.0 Gbps21.0 Gbps23.0 Gbps21.0 Gbps21.0 Gbps18.0 Gbps17.0 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth1008 GB/s1008 GB/s736 GB/s504 GB/s504 GB/s288 GB/s\n(554 GB/s Effective)272 GB/s\n(453 GB/s Effective)\n\n\nTBP450W425W320W285W200W160-165W115W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$1599 US / 1949 EU12,999 RMB (China-Only)$1199 US / 1469 EU$799 US$599 US$399-$499 US$299 US\n\n\nPrice (Current)$1599 US / 1859 EU12,999 RMB (China-Only)$1199 US / 1399 EU$799 US$599 US$399-$499 US$299 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)12th October 202228th December 202316th November 20225th January 202313th April 202324th May / 18th July 202329th June 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n129\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n92\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n59\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales;

Earlier today, an NVIDIA GPU leaker of some repute shared what he referred to as \u201csome updates\u201d on the GeForce RTX 4080 model. The key purported changes are that the memory chips appear to have been upgraded to 23 Gbps, and that the total card power is now a much more modest 340W.\n\n\nIt is easy to imagine NVIDIA engineers and marketers fervently finalizing the specs of the RTX 40 series of graphics cards, with so many factors to consider in the current landscape. In addition to considering the details of its own products, NVIDIA must also strategize in light of competing offerings that are coming down the pipeline. And all of this is happening at a time of great difficulty in the semiconductor industry, so it's no surprise that some rumored specs remain in flux.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first change highlighted in this latest leak is that the RTX 4080's memory spec has been upgraded from 21 Gbps GDDR6X memory to 23 Gbps. It is odd to call this an upgrade because this is still a rumor after all, but if what has been Tweeted is true the newer memory configuration is nearly 10% faster than what was previously reported.\n\n\nAnother quite significant change comes to the power requirements for the RTX 4080 graphics card. According to the new data the \u201ctotal board power\u201d (TBP) has been set at 340W, for reference models at least. Before today, the TBP of the RTX 4080 was rumored to be nearly 25% higher, at 420W. If the power reduction is genuine, NVIDIA's engineers have done some worthwhile optimizing, or perhaps decided it is prudent to wind back the voltage / clocks to compete with what they reckon AMD is going to do with the Radeon 7000 family.\n\n\nOther key specs from Kopite7Kimi appear to have remained the same, from the GPU code name, to CUDA core count of 9,728, to the 16GB of memory connected via a 256-bit bus. \n\n\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve reported on a purported specs change of the GeForce RTX 4080\u00a0and likely won't be the last.

The card now has the same amount of cores and memory albeit at a much lower TGP than what was reported earlier.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\nThere is an update of RTX 4070. PG141-SKU3317680FP3212G 21Gbps GDDR6X300WTSE >11000\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) August 4, 2022\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 'Expected' Specifications\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 is expected to utilize the full-fat AD104 GPU core with 7680 cores or 60 SM units. From previous leaks, we also know that the AD104 GPU will come packed with 48 MB of L2 cache and up to 160 ROPs which is simply insane. That's a 25% increase in core count and a 12x increase in cache versus the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti which rocks the GA104 GPU core.\n\nThe clock speeds are not confirmed yet but considering that the TSMC 4N process is being used, we are expecting clocks between the 2.0-3.0 GHz range. The higher than usual clock speed bump comes from the fact that NVIDIA is making a two-node jump considering the Ampere GPUs with Samsung 8nm node was in reality a 10nm process node with some optimizations. NVIDIA is skipping 7nm and going straight for a 5nm node and not even the vanilla variant but an optimized version of it. With Pascal on the TSMC 16nm node, NVIDIA delivered a huge frequency leap and we can expect a similar jump this time around too.\nAs for memory specs, the GeForce RTX 4070 is expected to rock 12 GB GDDR6X capacities that are said to be clocked at 21 Gbps speeds across a 192-bit bus interface for 504 GB/s bandwidth. While the RTX 4070 Ti was reported to get a 400W TBP, the RTX 4070 will be getting a 100W lower TBP of 300W. Now, this could be the power limit for custom designs with the Founders Edition roaming around the 255-285 power limit. The graphics card is expected to be based on the PG141-SKU331 PCB design. The graphics card is expected to deliver 11,000 points in 3DMark Time Spy which will easily match a stock RTX 3090 Ti graphics card.\n\n\n3DMark Time Spy Extreme Graphics\n\nScore\n\n\n04000800012000160002000024000\n\n\n\n\n\n04000800012000160002000024000\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090\n\n19k\n\n\nRTX 4080\n\n15k\n\n\nRTX 3090 Ti\n\n11.3k\n\n\nRTX 4070\n\n11k\n\n\nRX 6950 XT\n\n10.7k\n\n\nRTX 3090\n\n10.1k\n\n\nRTX 3080 Ti\n\n9.8k\n\n\nRTX 3080\n\n8.9k\n\n\nRTX 3070 Ti\n\n7.3k\n\n\nRTX Titan\n\n7.1k\n\n\nRTX 3070\n\n6.7k\n\n\nRTX 2080Ti\n\n6.6k\n\n\nRTX 2080\n\n5.1k\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for its feature set, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070\u00a0 graphics cards would rock all the modern NV feature sets such as the latest 4th Gen Tensor Cores, 3rd gen RT cores, and the latest NVENC Encoder, and NVCDEC Decoder, and support for the latest APIs. They will pack all the modern RTX features such as DLSS, Reflex, Broadcast, Resizable-BAR, Freestyle, Ansel, Highlights, Shadowplay, and G-SYNC support too. Performance is said to easily match an RTX 3090 Ti which is a $1999 US card (MSRP).

Do we have a layoff? No. Instead, we have given raises to take care of your families as all of you are facing sky-high inflation,\" he wrote.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's not clear if Huang was referring to a new pay raise initiative for Nvidia employees, or speaking more generally about the company's compensation practices. In the email, Huang also did not rule out the possibility of layoffs in the future. Nvidia declined to comment on this story.\nHe said that the company will instead take the opportunity to make Nvidia a better, more efficient company, and that the company will hold \"investments at current levels.\"\u00a0\n\"We will exercise extreme collaboration, a hallmark of our culture, finding every opportunity to leverage and reuse. We will find and eliminate all wasted time, process, and material,\" he wrote. \"Take this opportunity to make Nvidia even faster, leaner, and agile.\"\u00a0\n\n\nIn an announcement made on Monday, Nvidia said that its quarterly earnings are expected to come in at $6.7 billion, down significantly from the $8.1 billion it had previously told investors to expect. Nvidia's stock sunk over 6% on Monday on the news.\u00a0\nNvidia chalked the decrease to a decline in the firm's gaming division which saw a drop of 44%.\u00a0 It also called out a slowdown in its data center business, which provides powerful server chips for businesses, but which has been impacted by the global supply chain slowdowns. That business is expected to post $3.81 billion in quarterly revenue, Nvidia said in its Monday filing, which would be up only 1% from the quarter before \u2014 but 61% from the same timeframe of 2021.\u00a0\nNvidia's pledge that layoffs aren't imminent comes as tech industry peers like Oracle and Robinhood have cut jobs as markets sour and fears of a recession loom. Others have tightened their belts in different ways, including by rescinding offers to new hires.\u00a0\n\n\nHuang closed out his email by urging Nvidia's employees to turn their energies towards doubling down on the company's investments in cutting-edge fields like the metaverse and artificial intelligence, where he says future growth will be found.\u00a0\n\"So let's turn our alertness and agility to maximum, engines full-throttle, and fly through the challenges ahead while continuing to do our impactful work,\" he wrote.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayoffs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n      subscribers.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Fritzchens Fritz | Flickr)\n\n\n\n\nProving that Nvidia's RTX 40-series graphics cards are seemingly no nearer an actual release, the rumoured specs for the RTX 4080 and RTX 4070 have changed. Again.\u00a0Now, obviously these aren't final, confirmed GPU specifications, just rumoured chip numbers, but the fact that the specs for two of the most important graphics cards of the entire Nvidia next-gen are still fluid would suggest they're still not in manufacturing proper.Interestingly, it looks like Jen-Hsun giveth and Jen-Hsun taketh away, as the RTX 4070 is reportedly getting 12GB of GDDR6X memory now\u2014as opposed to the 10GB it originally was rumoured to have\u2014while the RTX 4080 is getting a cut to its CUDA core count.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nSpecs for Nvidia's new RTX 5050, 5060, and 5060 Ti GPUs leak out and that 5060 might actually be half decent. If it's priced right\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like AMD's expecting the RX 9070 XT to rival the RTX 4070 Ti, which is fine if it ends up being the right price\n\n\n\nOf course this is all based on the tweets of chatterbox Twitter leaker, Kopite7kimi, who has been throwing numbers around like an over-enthusiastic bingo caller for the past year or so. In the past day or so they have posted updated GPU specs, with potential 3DMark Time Spy Extreme scores to boot.\u00a0I'd say the most interesting is the RTX 4070 rumour, suggesting Nvidia has heard the unnecessary clamour for 'moar memories' from the ravening tech hordes unhappy at the prospect of only 10GB of GDDR6 on the third-tier AD104 Lovelace GPU, and thrown them another couple of gigabytes of quick VRAM to keep 'em quiet.\u00a0Aside from that, however, the increase to a 192-bit bus is more welcome, and the fact it's supposedly got the speedy 21Gbps memory now, too. But it is also getting a healthy extra dollop of CUDA cores if this latest leak is to be believed. The previous spec held 7168 cores, where the new number's 7680.There is an update of RTX 4070. PG141-SKU3317680FP3212G 21Gbps GDDR6X300WTSE >11000August 4, 2022The opposite has happened with the new prospective RTX 4080 GPU, however, with the latest AD103 chip spec coming with 9,728 CUDA cores as opposed to the 10,240 that was previously promised.\u00a0The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.That means the RTX 4080 has 512 fewer cores, while the RTX 4070 has 512 more cores. Which likely equates to four streaming multiprocessors (SMs), though probably won't make a huge difference in general rasterised performance. It might make a difference in ray traced performance, however, as you're either gaining or losing a further four RT cores in the mix.I'm not a chatterbox, but I have to make some updates.

We've spoken to insiders who have said it's likely not to be a big launch this year, which plays into the expectation that only the hyper-expensive, mostly unattainable RTX 4090 will be the only genuinely new graphics card from the green team in 2022.And that's rather depressing.\nBest CPU for gaming: Top chips from Intel and AMD \nBest gaming motherboard: The right boards \nBest graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game first\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\nPRODUCTS\n\nNvidia RTX 4080\nNvidia RTX 4070\nNvidia RTX 40-series\n\n\nDave JamesSocial Links NavigationEditor-in-Chief, HardwareDave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the Colecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!).

Its Level 5 Control Tower is a mesh network of sensors and computers placed on infrastructure around a facility, like buildings or light poles \u2014 rather than on individual cars \u2014 to capture an unobstructed view of the environment.\nThe system enables cars to move autonomously by directing their vehicle-to-everything, or so-called V2X, communication systems. These systems pass information from a vehicle to infrastructure, other vehicles, any surrounding entities \u2014 and vice versa. V2X technology, which comes standard in many modern cars, is used to improve road safety, traffic efficiency and energy savings.\nSeoul Robotics\u2019 platform, dubbed LV5 CTRL TWR, collects 3D data from the environment using cameras and lidar. Computer vision and deep learning-based AI analyze the data, determining the most efficient and safest paths for vehicles within the covered area.\nThen, through V2X, the platform can manage a car\u2019s existing features, such as adaptive-cruise-control, lane-keeping and brake-assist functions, to safely get it from place to place.\nLV5 CTRL TWR is built using NVIDIA CUDA libraries for creating GPU-accelerated applications, as well as the Jetson AGX Orin module for high-performance AI at the edge. NVIDIA GPUs are used in the cloud for global fleet path planning.\nSeoul Robotics is a member of NVIDIA Metropolis \u2014 a partner program centered on an application framework and set of developer tools that supercharge vision AI applications \u2014 and NVIDIA Inception, a free, global program that nurtures cutting-edge startups.\n\nAutonomy Through Infrastructure\nSeoul Robotics is pioneering a new path to level 5 autonomy, or full driving automation, with what\u2019s known as \u201cautonomy through infrastructure.\u201d\n\u201cInstead of outfitting the vehicles themselves with sensors, we\u2019re outfitting the surrounding infrastructure with sensors,\u201d said Jerone Floor, vice president of product and solutions at Seoul Robotics.\nUsing V2X capabilities, LV5 CTRL TWR sends commands from infrastructure to cars, making vehicles turn right or left, move from point A to B, brake and more. It achieves an accuracy in positioning a car of plus or minus four centimeters.\n\u201cNo matter how smart a vehicle is, if another car is coming from around a corner, for example, it won\u2019t be able to see it,\u201d Floor said. \u201cLV5 CTRL TWR provides vehicles with the last bits of information gathered from having a holistic view of the environment, so they\u2019re never \u2018blind.\u2019\u201d\nThese communication protocols already exist in most vehicles, he added. LV5 CTRL TWR acts as the AI-powered brain of the instructive mechanisms, requiring nothing more than a firmware update in cars.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, we knew we needed deep learning in the system in order to achieve the really high performance required to reach safety goals \u2014 and for that, we needed GPU acceleration,\u201d Floor said. \u201cSo, we designed the system from the ground up based on NVIDIA GPUs and CUDA.\u201d\nNVIDIA CUDA libraries help the Seoul Robotics team render massive amounts of data from the 3D sensors in real time, as well as accelerate training and inference for its deep learning models.\nAs a Metropolis member, Seoul Robotics received early access to software development kits and the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin for edge AI.\n\u201cThe compute capabilities of Jetson AGX Orin allow us to have the LV5 CTRL TWR cover more area with a single module,\u201d Floor added. \u201cPlus, it handles a wide temperature range, enabling our system to work in both indoor and outdoor units, rain or shine.\u201d\nDeployment Across the Globe\nLV5 CTRL TWR is in early commercial deployment at a BMW manufacturing facility in Munich.\nAccording to Floor, cars must often change locations once they\u2019re manufactured, from electrical repair stations to parking lots for test driving and more.\nEquipped with LV5 CTRL TWR, the BMW facility has automated such movement of cars \u2014 resulting in time and cost savings. Automating car transfers also enhances safety for employees and frees them up to focus on other tasks, like headlight alignment and more, Floor said.\nAnd from the moment a vehicle is fully manufactured until it\u2019s delivered to the customer, it moves on average through up to seven parking lots. Moving cars manually costs manufacturers anywhere from $30 to $60, per car, per lot \u2014 meaning LV5 CTRL TWR can address a $30 billion market.\nThe technology behind LV5 CTRL TWR can be used across industries, Floor highlighted. Beyond automotive factories, Seoul Robotics envisions its platform to be deployed across the globe \u2014 at retail stores, airports, traffic intersections and more.\nNVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin 32GB production modules are now available.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Metropolis and apply to join NVIDIA Inception.\nFeature image courtesy of BMW Group.\n\n\nCategories: Driving | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | CUDA | Customer Stories | Data Science | Inception | Jetson | Metropolis \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

There's no point trying to save our conclusion for the end of the review\u2014it'd be silly to act as if we don't already know the RTX 3090 Founders Edition is going to ace our benchmark tests. That said, there's still a lot we can learn from benchmarking this mighty GPU, and we've done that. (The card debuted in late 2020 in the teeth of the pandemic run on GPUs, and we only managed to get our mitts on the Founders Edition version now.) Blazing frame rates are all well and good, but it's how the card stacks up against competitors at different prices that'll make it or break it. And in this case, it's closer to breaking: The RTX 3090's stratospheric $1,499 list price and even its $1,299 street price from a few sellers are hard to justify unless you run GPGPU applications that need its huge allotment of RAM. Gamers will get better value from the RTX 3080 family. Still, it's a cost-no-object beast.The Design: A Metal MonolithThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition was the company's flagship graphics card at the launch of the RTX 30 Series. It's since been replaced in that role by the fractionally more powerful GeForce RTX 3090 Ti, but runs a close second with only a marginal difference in specs.Feature-wise, the GeForce RTX 3090 has 10,496 CUDA cores, 328 TMUs, 112 ROPs, 82 Ray Tracing (RT) cores, and 328 Tensor cores baked into an enormous 628.4-square-mm die. The core has access to a whopping 24GB pool of GDDR6X memory over a 384-bit memory interface. As tech enthusiasts, all of this sounds amazing, but on reflection we can't deny that 24GB of display RAM is kind of overkill for gaming. We suspect Nvidia would agree to at least some extent, as its next card down, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, has \"only\" 12GB of GDDR6X.All that extra RAM is likely to be more useful for compute-intensive GPGPU tasks than for today's or even tomorrow's games. It may help make the card a bit more future-proof, to the extent that anything in the tech world can be, but most games simply can't take advantage of such an enormous amount of memory. Unless you're seriously into GPU computing, you shouldn't consider buying an RTX 3090 just for its huge reservoir of RAM alone.To keep the card cool, Nvidia opted to use its usual hybrid blower-style cooler on the RTX 3090 Founders Edition. Most coolers predominantly blow air in the case straight down onto the GPU and other components. This is an effective way of cooling a graphics card, but it also tends to cause heat to build up in cases that aren't extremely well ventilated. Most blower-style coolers work to push air out the back of the case instead.Nvidia's cooler does a bit of both. One fan toward the front of the card pushes air out of the case, while another fan on the opposite side circulates air over the card to provide more immediate cooling. The RTX 3090's cooler does differ from some of Nvidia's other Founders Edition gear by being thicker, as this is a triple-slot thermal solution. It appears to be an effective design, as you'll see from our tests below.Test Setup & Spec ComparisonWe tested the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition with our new 2022 GPU testbed, a desktop based on an Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Hero motherboard. The processor is an Intel Core i9-12900K with a 240mm Corsair Hydro Series H100X water cooler. We opted to use 32GB (2x16GB) of Corsair Vengeance RAM clocked at 5,600MHz and a 1TB Corsair MP600 Pro NVMe PCIe 4.0 solid-state drive for storage. The Windows 11 Pro system is powered by a Corsair RMx Series RM850x 850-watt 80 Plus Gold PSU.The RTX 3090's primary competition comes from AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and Radeon RX 6800 XT. These cards' core configurations are vastly different and not comparable head-to-head due to their different architectures, but you can get at least an idea of how they stack up by looking at their transistor counts. This isn't entirely accurate for far too many reasons to list here, but still gives you a better idea than comparing core counts.When it comes to comparing cards by RAM and price, however, the story is entirely different. With its vast 24GB pool of GDDR6X, the GeForce RTX 3090 has a distinct advantage. This benefit, however, comes with a cost: At $1,499, the Nvidia card's MSRP is more than double that of a Radeon RX 6800 XT. The value argument for Nvidia's more affordable GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3070 Ti writes itself, assuming they can turn in performance numbers that aren't too far behind the RTX 3090.All games below were tested at their highest graphics presets unless otherwise noted.Synthetic Tests & Game BenchmarksOur synthetic test results show the RTX 3090 Founders Edition taking a noticeable early lead over its rivals in all areas. The GPU's 3DMark scores were particularly impressive, with nothing else coming close to matching it.Though the RTX 3090 Founders Edition maintained its top spot in the chart throughout the synthetic tests, the Radeon RX 6800 XT and GeForce RTX 3080 came close to tying it in Furmark. Those cards also pulled close to the RTX 3090 in our DirectX 4K Superposition test. If you plan to game on Linux or play OpenGL games, it's worth noting that AMD didn't perform nearly as well in the OpenGL test.DLSS, FSR and Ray TracingIn F1 22, the RTX 3090 kept its place at the head of the pack, and the AMD cards didn't come close to matching it. We tested the game first without DLSS or FSR enabled, then retested all the Nvidia cards with DLSS turned on and all the AMD cards with FSR enabled. With this done, the performance gap between the RTX 3090 and Radeon RX 6800 XT did diminish, but the Nvidia GPU still had a fairly hefty 17% advantage.Tougher competition for the RTX 3090 came from Nvidia's own GeForce RTX 3080, which was only around 10% slower in F1 22 with DLSS off and with it on at 4K\u2014not bad for a card that costs about half as much. The overall situation remained about the same in the Guardians of the Galaxy benchmark, with the RTX 3090 and RTX 3080 finishing relatively close to one another while the Radeon RX 6800 XT fell far behind.Recommended by Our EditorsRate Your Favorite PC Hardware, Peripherals, and Components to WinNVIDIA Expands RTX AI Innovations With Neural Shading, DLSS 4, and RTX RemixPC Desktop Vendor Laments 'Insane' RTX 5090 Prices: 'We're Getting Scalped'It's important to note that a key reason for AMD's relatively poor performance in F1 22 and Guardians of the Galaxy is that both of these games support ray tracing. These tests clearly show that if you plan to play ray-traced games, AMD is not your best option at the moment. As you'll see, however, AMD is much more competitive in games that don't support ray tracing.Other AAA GamesIn games without ray tracing, the results varied much more from one game to the next. In Total War: Three Kingdoms and Far Cry 5, the GeForce RTX 3090 maintained its lead, closely followed by the RTX 3080. In Far Cry 5, the RTX 3080 even managed to virtually match the RTX 3090 at 1080p and 2K.As for Nvidia versus AMD, the Radeon RX 6800 XT was just slightly behind the RTX 3090 in Far Cry 5 with the GeForce card holding a 3% to 8% advantage. Nvidia's edge grew to between 11% and 20% in Total War: Three Kingdoms. The RTX 3090 was also the fastest card tested in Red Dead Redemption 2 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, with a 3% to 18% performance advantage depending on the game and resolution. At 1080p and 2K, it was only slightly faster than the RX 6800 XT, but in 4K tests the GeForce card's extra RAM and memory bandwidth helped it achieve far better performance.The only game in which the GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition didn't dominate the charts was Rainbow Six Siege, where AMD's Radeon RX 6800 XT took the lead by a large margin.Legacy GamesHeading into our legacy game tests, we found few surprises. These games utilize DirectX 11 instead of DirectX 12, and due to their age the drivers for modern graphics cards aren't always as well optimized for them. It's somewhat amusing to see newer cards struggle to run Hitman Absolution at the same frame rates they manage for the much more graphically intense Far Cry 5 or Shadow of the Tomb Raider.In terms of head-to-head matchups, the GeForce RTX 3090 once again led the way with the RTX 3080 coming in second and the Radeon RX 6800 XT finishing third or fourth depending on the game. The most shocking result is that the RX 6800 XT can't maintain 60fps in Hitman Absolution at 4K! But we're here to review the GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition, not the AMD card, so let's move on.Power and Temperature ReadingsThe RTX 3090 may have been the fastest card in almost every test we tried, but it's also the most power-hungry. We recorded each card's highest observed power draw while running Guardians of the Galaxy's 2K DLSS/FSR benchmark. The numbers in the chart reflect the total system power draw and not just that of the card itself, but it's nevertheless clear that the GeForce RTX 3090 sucks up more current than any competing AMD card.We also recorded power readings in FurMark after running a stress test on each card for three minutes, and we noted each card's temperature reading at the same time. Power consumption was lower in FurMark as that test doesn't take advantage of the extra hardware used for ray tracing, DLSS, or FSR, but the RTX 3090 and RTX 3080 were still considerably hungrier than the Radeon RX 6800 XT.Last but not least, the GeForce RTX 3090's idle power consumption was also surprisingly high, roughly triple that of the RX 6800 XT. If you're building a gaming PC and don't want something that draws an enormous amount of power or are planning to use your PC off-grid where power is limited, this could be a deal-breaker.In spite of the high power draw, the RTX 3090 was actually one of the coolest cards we tested. Clearly the thermal solution Nvidia chose is doing its job well.Verdict: All the Frames, for All the MoneyWith numbers in hand, we're in a much better position to judge whether the GeForce RTX 3090 is worth buying or not\u2014and the answer is, well, maybe. The card has its pros and cons, and whether you'll want one comes down to your personal circumstances.If money isn't a major factor in your decision, then the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition is absolutely the card for you. If you're at all budget-conscious, however, the RTX 3090 really isn't a great option; if you don't play games with ray tracing support, both the GeForce RTX 3080 and Radeon RX 6800 XT are much more affordable and only slightly slower in many tests. And if you do play games with ray tracing support, the RTX 3080 is still an arguably better choice, as what you save by choosing that card is enough to pay for a high-end processor, RAM, and maybe the entire rest of your system.Simply put, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition is a great GPU, but you should definitely think long and hard, as you can get one almost as good for a great deal less cash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to PCMag Middle East newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Michael Justin Allen Sexton\n\n\n\n\n            For as long as I can remember, I've had love of all things tech, spurred on, in part, by a love of gaming.

But according to a new report, people aren't rushing to buy the GPUs in the sort of numbers that were expected. The solution? Make the cards even cheaper. \nThe report from MyDrivers states that efforts to shift excess Nvidia and AMD graphics card stock by reducing their prices aren't going as well as hoped. Citing the Taiwan Economic Daily and sources from the country, the publication claims a new round of price cuts will be implemented in September, one that will see deductions even larger than those implemented throughout August.\nIt's ironic that after consumers spent so long looking at expensive, out-of-stock graphics cards with sadness, the companies and retailers selling them are now being forced to keep dropping their prices due to excess stock. There are several reasons behind this, such as the crypto market crashing, the shaky economy/rising inflation discouraging luxury purchases, and the upcoming next-gen cards. Lovelace could actually prove to be a problem for Nvidia: with even the mid-range RTX 4000 cards said to outperform current flagships, why pay more for the latter?\nAugust GPU Pricing Update: Nvidia and AMD Seriously Want to Offload Current-Gen GPUs\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMSRP\nNewegg Lowest Price June\nNewegg Lowest Price July\nNewegg Lowest Price August\nCurrent Price Inflation\nPrice Increase July to Aug\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3090 Ti\n$2,000\n$1,650\n$1,470\n$1,350\n-33%\n-8%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3090\n$1,500\n$1,600\n$1,270\n$1,220\n-19%\n-4%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n$1,200\n$1,000\n$930\n$870\n-28%\n-6%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080 12GB\nn/a\n$870\n$740\n$750\nn/a\n1%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080 10GB\n$700\n$770\n$820\n$730\n4%\n-11%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3070 Ti\n$600\n$680\n$670\n$620\n3%\n-7%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3070\n$500\n$580\n$530\n$520\n4%\n-2%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti\n$400\n$500\n$470\n$450\n13%\n-4%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3060\n$330\n$380\n$410\n$380\n15%\n-7%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3050\n$250\n$330\n$330\n$310\n24%\n-6%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAverage\n-2%\n-6%\n\n\n\nIt was only a couple of weeks ago when reports from two Chinese sources claimed Nvidia planned to continue pushing down GPU prices and that, once again, the RTX 3090 and 3090 Ti were to receive some of the most significant price drops; Nvidia previously knocked $400 off the latter card's $1,999 MSRP (Founders Edition).\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang last week confirmed that the company is now experiencing excess inventory and that the only solution was to drop prices \"to give the channel an opportunity to correct.\" \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\n AMD board partner says Radeon RX 9070 GPU supply will stabilize after April \n\n\n\nIt's all good news for consumers, of course. The only problem gamers face now is whether to take advantage of the falling prices, wait to see just how far they drop, or hang on for the RTX 4000 series. There were rumors that the only Lovelace card to land this year will be the now-in-production RTX 4090, which could influence people's decision, but with the RTX 4070's performance said to match that of the RTX 3090 Ti, it's quite a dilemma.\n\n\n\n\n 37 comments\n \n826 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 GPUs \"unprecedented\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 specs and official performance benchmarks leaked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

The CPU is fabricated on TSMC's 4N process node, an optimized version of the 5nm process node which is made exclusively for NVIDIA.\n\nGrace is designed to be paired and as such, one of the most crucial aspects of the design is its C2C (Chip-To-Chip) interconnect. Grace achieves this with NVLINK which is used to make the Superchips and removes all bottlenecks that are associated with a typical cross-socket configuration.\n\nThe C2C NVLINK interconnect provides 900 GB/s of raw bi-directional bandwidth (same bandwidth as a GPU to GPU NVLINK switch on Hopper), while running at a very low power interface of just 1.3 pJ/bit or 5 times more efficient than the PCIe protocol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe NVIDIA Grace CPU features a scalable coherency fabric with a distributed cache design. The chip has up to 3.225 TB/s of bi-section bandwidth, is scalable beyond 72 cores (144 on Superchip), integrates 117 MB of L3 cache, and features support for Arm memory partitioning and monitoring (MPAM). Grace also allows for a unified memory architecture with shared page tables. Two NVIDIA Grace+Hopper Superchips can be interconnected together through an NVSwitch and a Grace CPU on one Superchip can directly communicate to the GPU on the other chip or even access its VRAM at native NVLINK speeds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nGetting a closer look at the memory design of Grace, NVIDIA is utilizing up to 512 GB of LPDDR5X across 32 channels, delivering up to 546 GB/s of memory bandwidth. NVIDIA states that LPDDR5X provides the best value when keeping in mind the overall bandwidth, cost, and power requirement. For I/O, you get 68 PCIe Gen 5.0 lanes, four of which can be used for x16 links at 128 GB/s, and the rest of the two are used for MISC. There are also 12 lanes of coherent NVLINK lanes shared with two Gen 5 PCIe x16 links.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nAs for TDP, the NVIDIA Grace (CPU Only) Superchip is optimized for single-core performance and offers up to 1 TB/s of memory bandwidth and a TDP of 500W for the 144-core dual chip config. We have already put the numbers into perspective in a previous article which can be seen below:\n\n\nSPEC Integer Performance (NVIDIA Grace vs AMD EPYC)\n\nSpecrate_int_base\n\n\n020040060080010001200\n\n\n\n\n\n020040060080010001200\n\n\n\n\n\nEPYC 7763 (128 Core)\n\n861\n\n\nGrace (144 Core)\n\n740\n\n\nEPYC 7742 (128 Core)\n\n667\n\n\nGrace (72 Core)\n\n370\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nNow, this isn't that big of a performance difference but what we would really like to see are the performance metrics. The Grace SUPERCHIPS are rated at around 500W while each AMD EPYC 7763 chip has a TDP of 280W so two of them will be around 560W and we aren't adding the additional system wattage whereas NVIDIA's 500W figure is for the whole GRACE SUPERCHIP package.\nNVIDIA states that its Grace is a highly specialized processor targeting workloads such as training next-generation NLP models that have more than 1 trillion parameters. When tightly coupled with NVIDIA GPUs, a Grace CPU-based system will deliver 10x faster performance than today\u2019s state-of-the-art NVIDIA DGX-based systems, which run on x86 CPUs.\n\nIt will definitely be interesting to see how the Grace CPUs stack up against x86 chips but by the time they release, they will be competing against AMD's Genoa and Intel's Sapphire Rapids CPUs. The NVIDIA Grace CPUs are planned to be used in the ATOS supercomputer as reported here.\nNVIDIA also\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nChina Unveils Its First \u201cAI PC\u201d Compliant SOC Featuring Up To 45 TOPS NPU, 6nm CPU With 12-Cores\n\nMuhammad Zuhair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD & NVIDIA Fight It Out In The Server CPU Segment: Each Claiming Over 2x Performance Uplift With EPYC Genoa & Grace Chips\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s 72-Core Grace \u201cARM\u201d CPU Is Almost As Fast As 96-Core AMD Threadripper 7995WX Chip In Geekbench\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s Next-Gen \u201cAI PC\u201d SOC May Incorporate Arm Cortex X5 Blackhawk CPU, Blackwell RTX GPU & LPDDR6 Memory On A Singular Package\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n129\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n92\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n59\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

These circuits are fundamental to high-performance digital design and can be defined at a higher level as prefix graphs. PrefixRL is focused on this class of arithmetic circuits and the main goal of this approach is to understand if an AI agent could design a good prefix graph, considering that the state-space of the problem is O(2^n^n) and cannot be resolved using brute-force methods.\nThe desirable circuit should be small, fast and consume less power. Nvidia found that power consumption is well-correlated with area for the circuits of interest but circuit area and delay are often competing properties. The goal of PrefixRL is to find the Pareto frontier of designs that effectively trades off of the area and the delay: fitting more circuits in a lower area, decreasing the delay of the chip in order to improve the performances and consuming less power.\u00a0\nHopper GPU, the latest Nvidia architecture, has nearly 13,000 circuits designed by AI.\nA fully convolutional neural network (Q-learning agent) is used to train the PrefixRL agent. At input and output of the Q network there is a grid representation for prefix graphs, where each element in the grid uniquely maps to a prefix node. Each element in the input grid represents whether a node is present or absent. On the output side each element represents the Q values for adding or removing a node. PrefixRL agent predicts the value of area and delay separately because these properties are observed separately during training.\n\nRepresentations of prefix graphs (left) and fully convolutional Q-learning agent architecture (right).\nThe RL agent can add or remove a node from the prefix graph and, at each episode step of the reinforcement learning task, the agent receives the improvement in the corresponding circuit area and delay as rewards. In the other steps, the design process: legalizes the prefix graph to always maintain a correct prefix sum computation then generates a circuit from the legalized prefix graph. Finally a physical-synthesis tool optimizes the circuit and the last design-process step is to measure the area and delay properties of the circuit.\nThe best tradeoff between area and delay, the Pareto frontier of designs, is obtained by training a lot of agents with various weights (from 0 to 1). So, the physical-synthesis optimizations in the RL environment can generate various solutions. This synthesis process is slow (~35 seconds for 64-bit adders) and \u00a0computationally demanding: physical simulation required 256 CPUs for each GPU and training the 64-bit case took over 32,000 GPU hours.\nFor this kind of RL tasks, Nvidia developed Raptor, an in-house distributed reinforcement-learning platform that takes special advantage of Nvidia hardware. The core features that enhance scalability and training speed for this kind of RL tasks are: Job scheduling, GPU-aware data structures and custom networking. In order to improve the networking performances, Raptor has the ability to switch between NCCL (for point-to-point transfer to transfer model parameters directly from the learner GPU to an inference GPU), Redis (for asynchronous and smaller messages such as rewards or statistics) and a JIT-compiled RPC (to handle high volume and low-latency requests such as uploading experience data).\u00a0\n\nNVIDIA framework powers concurrent training and data collection.\nRaptor increases the training speed allowing the actor agents to not wait to step through the environment thanks to a pool of CPU workers that perform the physical synthesis in parallel. To avoid redundant computations on the same state, when CPU workers return the rewards, the transition is inserted into the replay buffer and the rewards are cached.\nThe adders designed by the RL agents have a 25% lower area than EDA tools at the same delay and have irregular structures. This achievement is reached by the RL agents learning to design circuits from scratch with feedback from synthesized circuit properties.\n \nAbout the Author \n \n \n\nClaudio Masolo\n\n\n\n\n\nShow moreShow less\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRate this Article\n\n\nAdoption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStyle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Author Contacted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                \n                    \n                This content is in the AI, ML & Data Engineering topic\n            \n\nRelated Topics:\n\n\nAI, ML & Data Engineering\n\n\nNeural Networks\n\n\nReinforcement Learning\n\n\nDeep Learning\n\n\nMachine Learning\n\n\nGPU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Editorial\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Sponsored Content\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular across InfoQ\n\n\n\n\n                                Node.js 23.6 Now Runs TypeScript Natively\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n                                SharePoint Framework 1.21 Adds Minor Updates for UI Components\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n                                OpenAI Introduces Software Engineering Benchmark\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n                                Vercel Fluid: a New Compute Model and an Alternative to Serverless?\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n                                Checklist for Kubernetes in Production: Best Practices for SREs\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n                                Understanding What Really Matters for Developer Productivity: a Conversation with Lizzie Matusov\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite Your Way to a QCon or InfoQ Dev Summit!\nJoin the InfoQ article competition to win a complimentary ticket to QCon or InfoQ Dev Summit!

Their Hopper H100, as such, is one of the biggest GPUs to be made using TSMC's 4N process node, a design that was optimized and made exclusively for NVIDIA.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe H100 GPU is a monster chip that comes packed with the latest 4nm tech and incorporates 80 Billion transistors along with the bleeding-edge HBM3 memory technology. The H100 is built upon the PG520 PCB board which has over 30 power VRMs & a massive integral interposer that uses TSMC's CoWoS tech to combine the Hopper H100 GPU with a 6-stack HBM3 design. Some of the main technologies of the Hopper H100 GPU include:\n\n132 SMs (2x Performance Per Clock)\n4th Gen Tensor Cores\nThread Block Clusters\n2nd Gen Multi-Instance GPU\nConfidential Computing\nPCIe Gen 5.0 Interface\nWorld's First HBM3 DRAM\nLarger 50 MB L2 Cache\n4th Gen NVLink (900 GB/s Total Bandwidth)\nNew SHARP support\nNVLink Network\n\nOut of the six stacks, two stacks are kept to ensure yield integrity. But the new HBM3 standard allows for up to 80 GB capacities at 3 TB/s speeds which are crazy. For comparison, the current fastest gaming graphics card, the RTX 3090 Ti, offers just 1 TB/s of bandwidth and 24 GB VRAM capacities. Other than that, the H100 Hopper GPU also packs in the latest FP8 data format, and through its new SXM connection, it helps accommodate the 700W power design that the chip is designed around. It also offers twice the FP32 and FP64 FMA rates and 256 KB L1 cache (shared memory).\nNVIDIA Hopper H100 GPU Specifications At A Glance\nSo coming to the specifications, the NVIDIA Hopper GH100 GPU is composed of a massive 144 SM (Streaming Multiprocessor) chip layout which is featured in a total of 8 GPCs. These GPCs rock total of 9 TPCs which are further composed of 2 SM units each. This gives us 18 SMs per GPC and 144 on the complete 8 GPC configuration. Each SM is composed of up to 128 FP32 units which should give us a total of 18,432 CUDA cores.\n\nFollowing are some of the configurations you can expect from the H100 chip:\nThe full implementation of the GH100 GPU includes the following units:\n\n8 GPCs, 72 TPCs (9 TPCs/GPC), 2 SMs/TPC, 144 SMs per full GPU\n128 FP32 CUDA Cores per SM, 18432 FP32 CUDA Cores per full GPU\n4 Fourth-Generation Tensor Cores per SM, 576 per full GPU\n6 HBM3 or HBM2e stacks, 12 512-bit Memory Controllers\n60 MB L2 Cache\nFourth-Generation NVLink and PCIe Gen 5\n\nThe NVIDIA H100 GPU with SXM5 board form-factor includes the following units:\n\n8 GPCs, 66 TPCs, 2 SMs/TPC, 132 SMs per GPU\n128 FP32 CUDA Cores per SM, 16896 FP32 CUDA Cores per GPU\n4 Fourth-generation Tensor Cores per SM, 528 per GPU\n80 GB HBM3, 5 HBM3 stacks, 10 512-bit Memory Controllers\n50 MB L2 Cache\nFourth-Generation NVLink and PCIe Gen 5\n\nThis is a 2.25x increase over the full GA100 GPU configuration. NVIDIA is also leveraging more FP64, FP16 & Tensor cores within its Hopper GPU which would drive up performance immensely. And that's going to be a necessity to rival Intel's Ponte Vecchio which is also expected to feature 1:1 FP64. NVIDIA states that the 4th Gen Tensor Cores on Hopper deliver 2 times the performance at the same clock.\n\nThe following NVIDIA Hopper H100 performance breakdown shows that the additional SMs are only a 20% performance increase. The main benefit comes from the 4th Gen Tensor Cores and the FP8 compute the path. Higher frequency also adds a decent 30% uplift to the mix.\n\nAn interesting comparison that points out GPU scaling shows that a single GPC on a Hopper H100 GPU is equivalent to a Kepler GK110 GPU, a flagship HPC chip from 2012. The Kepler GK110 housed a total of 15 SMs whereas the Hopper H110 GPU packs 132 SMs and even a singular GPC on the Hopper GPU features 18 SMs, 20% more than the entirety of SMs on the Kepler flagship.\n\nThe cache is another space where NVIDIA has given much attention, upping it to 48 MB in the Hopper GH100 GPU. This is a 20% increase over the 50 MB cache featured on the Ampere GA100 GPU and 3x the size of AMD's flagship Aldebaran MCM GPU, the MI250X.\nRounding up the performance figures, NVIDIA's GH100 Hopper GPU will offer 4000 TFLOPs of FP8, 2000 TFLOPs of FP16, 1000 TFLOPs of TF32 and 60 TFLOPs of FP64 Compute performance. These record-shattering figures decimate all other HPC accelerators that came before it. For comparison, this is 3.3x faster than NVIDIA's own A100 GPU and 28% faster than AMD's Instinct MI250X in the FP64 compute. In FP16 compute, the H100 GPU is 3x faster than A100 and 5.2x faster than MI250X which is literally bonkers.\nThe PCIe variant which is a cut-down model was recently listed over in Japan for over $30,000 US so one can imagine that the SXM variant with a beefier configuration will easily cost around $50 grand.\nNVIDIA HPC / AI GPUs\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Tesla Graphics CardNVIDIA B200NVIDIA H200 (SXM5)NVIDIA H100 (SMX5)NVIDIA H100 (PCIe)NVIDIA A100 (SXM4)NVIDIA A100 (PCIe4)Tesla V100S (PCIe)Tesla V100 (SXM2)Tesla P100 (SXM2)Tesla P100\n(PCI-Express)Tesla M40\n(PCI-Express)Tesla K40\n(PCI-Express)\n\n\n\n\nGPUB200H200 (Hopper)H100 (Hopper)H100 (Hopper)A100 (Ampere)A100 (Ampere)GV100 (Volta)GV100 (Volta)GP100 (Pascal)GP100 (Pascal)GM200 (Maxwell)GK110 (Kepler)\n\n\nProcess Node4nm4nm4nm4nm7nm7nm12nm12nm16nm16nm28nm28nm\n\n\nTransistors208 Billion80 Billion80 Billion80 Billion54.2 Billion54.2 Billion21.1 Billion21.1 Billion15.3 Billion15.3 Billion8 Billion7.1 Billion\n\n\nGPU Die SizeTBD814mm2814mm2814mm2826mm2826mm2815mm2815mm2610 mm2610 mm2601 mm2551 mm2\n\n\nSMs160132132114108108808056562415\n\n\nTPCs806666575454404028282415\n\n\nL2 Cache SizeTBD51200 KB51200 KB51200 KB40960 KB40960 KB6144 KB6144 KB4096 KB4096 KB3072 KB1536 KB\n\n\nFP32 CUDA Cores Per SMTBD128128128646464646464128192\n\n\nFP64 CUDA Cores / SMTBD128128128323232323232464\n\n\nFP32 CUDA CoresTBD16896168961459269126912512051203584358430722880\n\n\nFP64 CUDA CoresTBD16896168961459234563456256025601792179296960\n\n\nTensor CoresTBD528528456432432640640N/AN/AN/AN/A\n\n\nTexture UnitsTBD528528456432432320320224224192240\n\n\nBoost ClockTBD~1850 MHz~1850 MHz~1650 MHz1410 MHz1410 MHz1601 MHz1530 MHz1480 MHz1329MHz1114 MHz875 MHz\n\n\nTOPs (DNN/AI)20,000 TOPs3958 TOPs3958 TOPs3200 TOPs2496 TOPs2496 TOPs130 TOPs125 TOPsN/AN/AN/AN/A\n\n\nFP16 Compute10,000 TFLOPs1979 TFLOPs1979 TFLOPs1600 TFLOPs624 TFLOPs624 TFLOPs32.8 TFLOPs30.4 TFLOPs21.2 TFLOPs18.7 TFLOPsN/AN/A\n\n\nFP32 Compute90 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs800 TFLOPs156 TFLOPs\n(19.5 TFLOPs standard)156 TFLOPs\n(19.5 TFLOPs standard)16.4 TFLOPs15.7 TFLOPs10.6 TFLOPs10.0 TFLOPs6.8 TFLOPs5.04 TFLOPs\n\n\nFP64 Compute45 TFLOPs34 TFLOPs34 TFLOPs48 TFLOPs19.5 TFLOPs\n(9.7 TFLOPs standard)19.5 TFLOPs\n(9.7 TFLOPs standard)8.2 TFLOPs7.80 TFLOPs5.30 TFLOPs4.7 TFLOPs0.2 TFLOPs1.68 TFLOPs\n\n\nMemory Interface8192-bit HBM45120-bit HBM3e5120-bit HBM35120-bit HBM2e6144-bit HBM2e6144-bit HBM2e4096-bit HBM24096-bit HBM24096-bit HBM24096-bit HBM2384-bit GDDR5384-bit GDDR5\n\n\nMemory SizeUp To 192 GB HBM3 @ 8.0 GbpsUp To 141 GB HBM3e @ 6.5 GbpsUp To 80 GB HBM3 @ 5.2 GbpsUp To 94 GB HBM2e @ 5.1 GbpsUp To 40 GB HBM2 @ 1.6 TB/s\nUp To 80 GB HBM2 @ 1.6 TB/sUp To 40 GB HBM2 @ 1.6 TB/s\nUp To 80 GB HBM2 @ 2.0 TB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 1134 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 900 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 732 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 732 GB/s\n12 GB HBM2 @ 549 GB/s24 GB GDDR5 @ 288 GB/s12 GB GDDR5 @ 288 GB/s\n\n\nTDP700W700W700W350W400W250W250W300W300W250W250W235W\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs;

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s graphics card shipments for 2022 could fall dramatically, at least if a new prediction is right.This comes from a DigiTimes report which claims that, going by forecasts from Taiwanese graphics card suppliers, Nvidia\u2019s shipments for this year are set to fall by something like 40% to 50%.DigiTimes underlines that this will mean the amount of money raked in by Team Green will also drop substantially, or indeed as the report puts it, revenue is set to decline at a \u201cpace beyond imagination\u201d \u2013 which sounds pretty serious.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nAnother gloomy Nvidia RTX 5000 rumor suggests next-gen GPUs will be price hiked over the MSRP in many cases, and I\u2019m getting worried now\n\n\n\n\nSorry, AMD, Nvidia's price tags for its RTX 5000 GPUs could win me over\n\n\n\nAll of this is down to the crypto crash and an overall post-pandemic weakening in demand for desktop GPUs.Analysis: More fuel on the GPU price cut fire?This prediction for Nvidia lines up with the firm\u2019s recent fiscal results which showed a chunky drop in revenue, and gaming graphics cards were badly hit, with sales falling by 33% year-on-year. So the rest of 2022 ushering in drops of 40% in shipments, or maybe more, is not an unbelievable scenario; although we must of course be very cautious when it comes to predictions like this from DigiTimes. Obviously, this is just educated guesswork at what\u2019s around the corner for Nvidia, and things may turn out differently.That said, looking at the current economic climate \u2013 which is seriously shaky on a number of fronts \u2013 it\u2019s not difficult to imagine that the rest of 2022 will be a sticky wicket for Team Green. As inflation and cost of living hikes hit home and heap misery on consumers, there\u2019s clearly going to be less money to spend on more frivolous things like upgrading graphics cards.As you may have seen, Nvidia and its partners have already been dropping prices to counter what Team Green described as a \u2018significant\u2019 decline in sell-through projections for fiscal Q2, and as we\u2019ve argued before, we anticipate further price cuts to come on current-gen Ampere GPUs.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.There is purportedly still a fair bit of excess RTX 3000 stock to clear before next-gen Lovelace graphics cards are launched (and those new GPUs take much of the remaining momentum out of current-gen sales). And this forecast of potential further weakness for Nvidia as the rest of 2022 plays out \u2013 if the company really does experience a revenue decline at an \u2018unimaginable\u2019 pace \u2013 might reinforce the need to generate further RTX 3000 sales via more discounting.After all, it\u2019s crucial that Nvidia\u2019s graphics card making partners can get rid of excess Ampere stock before RTX 4000 GPUs can be fully unleashed (and if that stock clearance doesn\u2019t happen in good time, we might even see all but the RTX 4090 delayed until 2023, as the rumor mill has already suggested).Nvidia isn\u2019t the only company to be affected by the current economic woes, of course. The DigiTimes report also asserts that AMD and Intel now have a gloomier outlook for shipment and revenue projections for this year. Intel expects a revenue drop of between $8 and $11 billion, and a 10% drop in PC sales compared to 2021.AMD expects shipments to drop by around 15%, but its revenue for Q3 should still go up slightly, putting it in a better position than Intel \u2013 after it took market share off Team Blue in server CPUs and embedded processors during Q2, during which Team Red\u2019s revenue grew massively (by 70%, no less).Today\u2019s best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $38.99View $63ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesVia Tom\u2019s Hardware\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

Those only set Nvidia up for a major comeback, however, and sometimes that led to a real game-changing card.\n\n\n\t\t\tRecommended Videos\t\t\n\n\n\nIt was hard to choose which Nvidia GPUs were truly worthy of being called the best of all time, but I\u2019ve narrowed down the list to six cards that were truly important and made history.\n\n\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tReSpec\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSubscribe\t\t\n\n\n\t\tCheck your inbox!\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPrivacy Policy\t\t\n\n\n GeForce 256\nThe very first\nVGA Museum\nAlthough Nvidia often claims the GeForce 256 was the world\u2019s first GPU, that\u2019s only true if Nvidia is the only company that gets to define what a GPU is. Before GeForce there were the RIVA series of graphics cards, and there were other companies making their own competing graphics cards then, too. What Nvidia really invented was the marketing of graphics cards as GPUs, because in 1999 when the 256 came out, terms like graphics card and graphics chipset were more common.\nNvidia is right that the 256 was important, however. Before the 256, the CPU played a very important role in rendering graphics, to the point where the CPU was directly completing steps in rendering a 3D environment. However, CPUs were not very efficient at doing this, which is where the 256 came in with hardware transforming and lighting, offloading the two most CPU intensive parts of rendering onto the GPU. This is one of the primary reasons why Nvidia claims this is the first GPU.\nAs a product, the GeForce 256 wasn\u2019t exactly legendary: Anandtech wasn\u2019t super impressed by its price for the performance at the time of its release. Part of the problem was the 256\u2019s memory, which was single data rate, or SDR. Due to other advances, SDR was becoming insufficient for GPUs of this performance level. A faster dual data rate or DDR (the same DDR as in DDR5) launched just before the end of 1999, which finally met Anandtech\u2019s expectations for\u00a0 performance, but the increased price tag of the DDR version was hard to swallow.\nThe GeForce 256, first of its name, is certainly historical, but not because it was an amazing product. The 256 is important because it inaugurated the modern era of GPUs. The graphics card market wasn\u2019t always a duopoly; back in the 90s, there were multiple companies competing against each other, with Nvidia being just one of them. Soon after the GeForce 256 launched, most of Nvidia\u2019s rivals exited the market. 3dfx\u2019s Voodoo 5 GPUs were uncompetitive and before it went bankrupt many of its technologies were bought by Nvidia; Matrox simply quit gaming GPUs altogether to focus on professional graphics.\nBy the end of 2000, the only other graphics company in town was ATI. When AMD acquired ATI in 2006, it brought about the modern Nvidia and AMD rivalry we all know today.\nGeForce 8800 GTX\nA monumental leap forward\nVGA Museum\nAfter the GeForce 256, Nvidia and ATI attempted to best the other with newer GPUs with higher performance. In 2002, however, ATI threw down the gauntlet by launching its Radeon 9000 series, and at a die size of 200mm squared, the flagship Radeon 9800 XT was easily the largest GPU ever. Nvidia\u2019s flagship GeForce4 Ti 4600 at 100mm had no hope of beating even the midrange 9700 Pro, which inflicted a crushing defeat on Nvidia. Making a GPU was no longer just about the architecture, the memory, or the drivers; in order to win, Nvidia would need to make big GPUs like ATI.\nFor the next four years, the size of flagship GPUs continued to increase, and by 2005 both companies had launched a GPU that was around 300mm. Although Nvidia had regained the upper hand during this time, ATI was never far behind and its Radeon X1000 series was fairly competitive. A GPU sized at 300mm was far from the limit of what Nvidia could do, however. In 2006 Nvidia released its GeForce 8 series, led by the flagship 8800 GTX. Its GPU, codenamed G80, was nearly 500mm and its transistor count was almost three times higher than the last GeForce flagship.\nThe 8800 GTX did to ATI what the Radeon 9700 Pro and the rest of the 9000 series did to Nvidia, with Anandtech describing the moment as \u201c9700 Pro-like.\u201d A single 8800 GTX was almost twice as fast as ATI\u2019s top-end X1950 XTX, not to mention much more efficient. At $599, the 8800 GTX was more expensive than its predecessors, but its high level of performance and DirectX 10 support made up for it.\nBut this was mostly the end of the big GPU arms race that had characterized the early 2000s for two main reasons. Firstly, 500mm was getting pretty close to the limit of how large a GPU could be, and even today 500mm is relatively big for a processor. Even if Nvidia wanted to, making a bigger GPU just wasn\u2019t feasible. Secondly, ATI wasn\u2019t working on its own 500mm GPU anyway, so Nvidia wasn\u2019t in a rush to get an even bigger GPU to market. Nvidia had basically won the arms race by outspending ATI.\nThat year also saw the acquisition of ATI by AMD, which was finalized just before the 8800 GTX launched. Although ATI now had the backing of AMD, it really seemed like Nvidia had such a massive lead that Radeon wouldn\u2019t challenge GeForce for a long time, perhaps never again.\nGeForce GTX 680\nBeating AMD at its own game\nNvidia\nNvidia\u2019s next landmark release came in 2008 when it launched the GTX 200 series, starting with the GTX 280 and GTX 260. At nearly 600mm squared the 280 was a worthy monstrous successor to the 8800 GTX. Meanwhile, AMD and ATI signaled that they would no longer be launching high-end GPUs with big dies in order to compete, rather focusing on making smaller GPUs in a gambit known as the small die strategy. In its review, Anandtech said \u201cNvidia will be left all alone with top performance for the foreseeable future.\u201d As it turned out, the next four years were pretty rough for Nvidia.\nStarting with the HD 4000 series in 2008, AMD assaulted Nvidia with small GPUs that had high value and almost flagship levels of performance, and that dynamic was maintained throughout the next few generations. Nvidia\u2019s GTX 280 wasn\u2019t cost effective enough, then the GTX 400 series was delayed, and the 500 series was too hot and power hungry.\nOne of Nvidia\u2019s traditional weaknesses was its disadvantage when it came to process, the way processors are manufactured. Nvidia was usually behind AMD, but it had finally caught up by using the 40nm node for the 400 series. AMD, however, wanted to regain the process lead quickly and decided its next generation would be on the new 28nm node, and Nvidia decided to follow suit.\nAMD won the race to 28nm with its HD 7000 series, with its flagship HD 7970 putting AMD back in first place for performance. However, the GTX 680 launched just two months later, and not only did it beat the 7970 in performance, but also power efficiency and even die size. As Anandtech put it, Nvidia had \u201clanded the technical trifecta\u201d and that completely flipped the tables on AMD. AMD did reclaim the performance crown yet again by launching the HD 7970 GHz Edition later in 2012 (notable for being the first 1GHz GPU), but having the lead in efficiency and performance per millimeter was a good sign for Nvidia.\nThe back and forth battle between Nvidia and AMD was pretty exciting after how disappointing the GTX 400 and 500 series had been, and while the 680 wasn\u2019t an 8800 GTX, it signaled Nvidia\u2019s return to being truly competitive against AMD. Perhaps most importantly, Nvidia was no longer weighed down by its traditional process disadvantage, and that would eventually pay off in a big way.\nGeForce GTX 980\nNvidia\u2019s dominance begins\nBill Roberson/Digital Trends\nNvidia found itself in a very good spot with the GTX 600 series, and it was because of TSMC\u2019s 28nm process. Under normal circumstances, AMD would have simply gone to TSMC\u2019s next process in order to regain its traditional advantage, but this was no longer an option. TSMC and all other foundries in the world (except for Intel) had an extraordinary amount of difficulty progressing beyond the 28nm node. New technologies were needed in order to progress further, which meant Nvidia didn\u2019t have to worry about AMD regaining the process lead any time soon.\nFollowing a few years of back and forth and AMD floundering with limited funds, Nvidia launched the GTX 900 series in 2014, inaugurated by the GTX 980. Based on the new Maxwell architecture, it was an incredible improvement over the GTX 600 and 700 series despite being on the same node. The 980 was between 30% and 40% faster than the 780 while consuming less power, and it was even a smidge faster than the top-end 780 Ti. Of course, the 980 also beat the R9 290X, once again landing the trifecta of performance, power efficiency, and die size. In its review, Anandtech said the 980 came \u201cvery, very close to doing to the Radeon 290X what the GTX 680 did to Radeon HD 7970.\u201d\nAMD was incapable of responding. It didn\u2019t have a next-generation GPU ready to launch in 2014. In fact, AMD wasn\u2019t even working on a complete lineup of brand-new GPUs to even the score with Nvidia. AMD instead was planning on rebranding the Radeon 200 series as the Radeon 300 series, and would develop one new GPU to serve as the flagship. All of these GPUs were to launch in mid 2015, giving the entire GPU market to Nvidia for nearly a full year. Of course, Nvidia wanted to pull the rug right from under AMD and prepared a brand-new flagship.\nLaunching in mid 2015, the GTX 980 Ti was about 30% faster than the GTX 980, thanks to its significantly higher power consumption and larger die size at just over 600mm squared. It beat AMD\u2019s brand-new R9 Fury X a month before it even launched. Although the Fury X wasn\u2019t bad, it had lower performance than the 980 Ti, higher power consumption, and much less VRAM. It was a demonstration of how far ahead Nvidia was with the 900 series; while AMD was hastily trying to get the Fury X out the door, Nvidia could have launched the 980 Ti any time it wanted.\nAnandtech put it pretty well: \u201cThe fact that they get so close only to be outmaneuvered by Nvidia once again makes the current situation all the more painful; it\u2019s one thing to lose to Nvidia by feet, but to lose by inches only reminds you of just how close they got, how they almost upset Nvidia.\u201d\nNvidia was basically a year ahead of AMD technologically, and while what they had done with the GTX 900 series was impressive, it was also a bit depressing. People wanted to see Nvidia and AMD duke it out like they had done in 2012 and 2013, but it started to look like that was all in the past. Nvidia\u2019s next GPU would certainly reaffirm that feeling.\nGeForce GTX 1080\nThe GPU with no competition but itself\nNvidia\nIn 2015, TSMC had finally completed the 16nm process, which could achieve 40% higher clock speeds than 28nm at the same power or half the power of 28nm at similar clock speeds. However, Nvidia planned to move to 16nm in 2016 when the node was more mature. Meanwhile, AMD had absolutely no plans to utilize TSMC\u2019s 16nm but instead moved to launch new GPUs and CPUs on GlobalFoundries\u2019s 14nm process. But don\u2019t be fooled by the names: TSMC\u2019s 16nm was and is better than GlobalFoundries\u2019s 14nm. After 28nm, nomenclature for processes became based in marketing rather than scientific measurements. This meant that for the first time in modern GPU history, Nvidia had the process advantage against AMD.\nThe GTX 10-series launched in mid-2016, based on the new Pascal architecture and TSMC\u2019s 16nm node. Pascal wasn\u2019t actually very different from Maxwell, but the jump from 28nm to 16nm was massive, like Intel going from 14nm on Skylake to 10nm on Alder Lake. The GTX 1080 was the new flagship, and it\u2019s hard to overstate how fast it was. The GTX 980 was a little faster than the GTX 780 Ti when it came out. By contrast, the GTX 1080 was over 30% faster than the GTX 980 Ti, and for $50 less, too. The die size of the 1080 was also extremely impressive, at just over 300mm squared, nearly half the size of the 980 Ti.\nWith the 1080 and the rest of the 10-series lineup, Nvidia effectively took the entire desktop GPU market for itself. AMD\u2019s 300 series and the Fury X were simply no match. At the midrange, AMD launched the RX 400 series, but these were just three low to mid-range GPUs that were a throwback to the small die strategy, minus the part where Nvidia\u2019s flagship was in striking distance like with the GTX 280 and the HD 4870. In fact, the 1080 was nearly twice as fast as the RX 480. The only GPU AMD could really beat was the mid-range GTX 1060, as the slightly cut down GTX 1070 was just a little too fast to lose to the Fury X.\nAMD did eventually launch new high-end GPUs in the form of RX Vega, a full year after the 1080 came out. With much higher power consumption and the same selling price, the flagship RX Vega 64 beat the GTX 1080 by a hair but wasn\u2019t very competitive. However, the GTX 1080 was no longer Nvidia\u2019s flagship; with relatively small die size and a full year to prepare, Nvidia launched a brand-new flagship a whole three months before RX Vega even launched; it was a repeat of the 980 Ti. The new GTX 1080 Ti was even faster than the GTX 1080, delivering yet another 30% improvement to performance. As Anandtech put it, the 1080 Ti \u201cfurther solidifie[d] Nvidia\u2019s dominance of the high-end video card market.\u201d\nAMD\u2019s failure to deliver a truly competitive high-end GPU meant that the 1080\u2019s only real competition was Nvidia\u2019s own GTX 1080 Ti. With the 1080 and the 1080 Ti, Nvidia achieved what is perhaps the most complete victory we\u2019ve seen so far in modern GPU history. Over the past 4 years, Nvidia kept increasing its technological advantage over AMD, and it was hard to see how Nvidia could ever lose.\nGeForce RTX 3080\nCorrecting course\nImage used with permission by copyright holder\nAfter such a long and incredible streak of wins, perhaps it was inevitable that Nvidia would succumb to hubris and lose sight of what made Nvidia\u2019s great GPUs so great. Nvidia did not follow up the GTX 10 series with yet another GPU with a stunning increase in performance, but with the infamous RTX 20 series. Perhaps in a move to cut AMD out of the GPU market, Nvidia focused on introducing hardware accelerated ray tracing and A.I. upscaling instead of delivering better performance in general. If successful, Nvidia could make AMD GPUs irrelevant until the company finally made Radeon GPUs with built-in ray tracing.\nRTX 20-series was a bit of a flop. When the RTX 2080 and 2080 Ti launched in late 2018, there weren\u2019t even any games that supported ray tracing or deep learning super sampling (DLSS). But Nvidia priced RTX 20-series cards as if those features made all the difference. At $699, the 2080 had a nonsensical price, and the 2080 Ti\u2019s $1,199 price tag was even more insane. Nvidia wasn\u2019t even competing with itself anymore.\nThe performance improvement in existing titles was extremely disappointing, too; the RTX 2080 was only 11% faster than the GTX 1080, though at least the RTX 2080 Ti was around 30% faster than the GTX 1080 Ti.\nThe next two years were a course correction for Nvidia. The threat from AMD was starting to become pretty serious; the company had finally regained the process advantage by moving to TSMC\u2019s 7nm and the company launched the RX 5700 XT in mid-2019. Nvidia was able to head it off once again by launching new GPUs, this time the RTX 20 Super series with a focus on value, but the 5700 XT must have worried Nvidia. The RTX 2080 Ti was three times as large yet was only 50% faster, meaning AMD was achieving much higher performance per millimeter. If AMD made a larger GPU, it could be difficult to beat.\nBoth Nvidia and AMD planned for a big showdown in 2020. Nvidia recognized AMD\u2019s potential and pulled out all the stops: the new 8nm process from Samsung, the new Ampere architecture, and an emphasis on big GPUs. AMD meanwhile stayed on TSMC\u2019s 7nm process but introduced the new RDNA 2 architecture and would also be launching a big GPU, its first since RX Vega in 2017. The last time both companies launched brand-new flagships within the same year was 2013, nearly a decade ago. Though the pandemic threatened to ruin the plans of both companies, neither company was willing to delay the next generation and launched as planned.\nNvidia fired first with the RTX 30-series, led by the flagship RTX 3090, but most of the focus was on the RTX 3080 since at $699 it was far more affordable than the $1,499 3090. Instead of being a repeat of the RTX 20-series, the 3080 delivered a sizeable 30% bump in performance at 4K over the RTX 2080 Ti, though the power consumption was a little high. At lower resolutions, the performance gain of the 3080 was somewhat less, but since the 3080 was very capable at 4K, it was easy to overlook this. The 3080 also benefitted from a wider variety of games supporting ray tracing and DLSS, giving value to having an Nvidia GPU with those features.\nOf course, this wouldn\u2019t matter if the 3080 and the rest of the RTX 30-series couldn\u2019t stand up to AMD\u2019s new RX 6000 series, which launched two months later. At $649, the RX 6800 XT was AMD\u2019s answer to the RTX 3080. With nearly identical performance in most games and at most resolutions, the battle between the 3080 and the 6800 XT was reminiscent of the GTX 680 and the HD 7970. Each company had its advantages and disadvantages, with AMD leading in power efficiency and performance while Nvidia had better performance in ray tracing and support for other features like A.I. upscaling.\nThe excitement over a new episode in the GPU war quickly died out though, because it quickly came apparent that nobody could buy RTX 30 or RX 6000 or even any GPUs at all. The pandemic had seriously reduced supply while crypto increased demand and scalpers snatched up as many GPUs as they could. At the time of writing, the shortage has mostly ended, but most Nvidia GPUs are still selling for usually $100 or more over MSRP. Thankfully, higher-end GPUs like the RTX 3080 can be found closer to MSRP than lower-end 30 series cards, which keeps the 3080 a viable option.\nOn the whole, the RTX 3080 was a much-needed correction from Nvidia. Although the 3080 has marked the end of Nvidia\u2019s near total domination of the desktop GPU market, it\u2019s hard not to give the company credit for not losing to AMD. After all, the RX 6000 series is on a much better process and AMD has been extremely aggressive these past few years. And besides, it\u2019s good to finally see a close race between Nvidia and AMD where both sides are trying really hard to win.\nSo what\u2019s next?\nUnlike AMD, Nvidia always keeps its cards close to its chest and rarely ever reveals information on upcoming products. We can be pretty confident the upcoming RTX 40 series will launch sometime this year, but everything else is uncertain. One of the more interesting rumors is that Nvidia will utilize TSMC\u2019s 5nm for RTX 40 GPUs, and if this is true then that means Nvidia will have parity with AMD once again.\nBut I think that as long as RTX 40 isn\u2019t another RTX 20 and provides more low-end and mid-range options than RTX 30, Nvidia should have a good enough product next generation. I would really like for it to be so good that it makes the list of best Nvidia GPUs of all time, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\n\n\n\t\tEditors\u2019 Recommendations\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEven AMD is surprised by how fast it\u2019s gaining on Nvidia\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAMD takes lead over Nvidia, but how long will it last?\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAn AMD RX 9060 XT with 16GB would ruin Nvidia\u2019s second-hand market\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAMD RX 9060 XT might not be the Nvidia-beating GPU we first thought\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNvidia\u2019s RTX 5060 Ti might give AMD an unexpected edge\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tTopics\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAMD\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFeatures\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGPUs\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNvidia\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMatthew Connatser\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\tFormer Digital Trends Contributor\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\ttwitter\t\t\t\t\nEmail \n\n\n\t\t\t\tMatthew Connatser is a freelance writer who works on writing and updating PC guides at Digital Trends.

Most notably, Nvidia (NVDA) shed 6.3% after the chipmaker said its second-quarter revenue will likely come in at $6.7 billion \u2013 lower than the $8.1 billion it previously guided for \u2013 amid a 33% year-over-year decline in gaming revenue. The company also expects \"challenging market conditions\" to persist in Q3. NVDA will release its full earnings report on Aug. 24.Earnings from Palantir Technologies (PLTR) were also on Wall Street's radar. Shares plunged 14.2% after the data analytics firm reported a per-share loss of 1 cent in its second quarter, compared to the consensus estimate for earnings of 3 cents per share. PLTR also gave lower-than-anticipated full-year revenue guidance.\n\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance\nBe a smarter, better informed investor.\n\n\nSave up to 74%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for Kiplinger\u2019s Free E-Newsletters\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.\n\n\n\n\nSign up\n\n\n\n\nSign up for Kiplinger's FREE Investing Weekly e-letter for stock, ETF and mutual fund recommendations, and other investing advice.Not surprisingly, technology was the worst-performing sector today, giving back 0.9%. Meanwhile, the biggest gains were found in the materials (+0.6%) and real estate (+0.7%) sectors.As for the major indexes, the Nasdaq Composite (-0.1% at 12,644) and S&P 500 Index (-0.1% at 4,140) finished in negative territory, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 0.1% gain to end at 32,832.(Image credit: YCharts)Other news in the stock market today:The small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 1.0% to 1,941.U.S. crude futures gained 2.0% to settle at $90.76 per barrel.Gold futures rose 0.8% to $1,805.20 an ounce.Bitcoin soared 4.4% to $23,932.38. (Bitcoin trades 24 hours a day; prices reported here are as of 4 p.m.)Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) were notable gainers, with many suggesting retail traders on Reddit's WallStreetBets were driving the action in the two meme stocks. BBBY was up 63.5% at its intraday peak, before closing with a 39.8% gain. AMC shares popped 8.0% today.Signify Health (SGFY) jumped 11.0% after a report in The Wall Street Journal over the weekend said CVS Health (CVS, -0.3%) is looking to buy the healthcare platform. CVS plans to submit an offer for SGFY in the coming week, the article indicates, citing people familiar with the matter. \"Since the CVS investor day in December of last year, investors have been waiting for details on how the company plans to deploy capital in order to improve its care delivery model,\" says BofA Global Research analyst Michael Cherny, who has a Buy rating on CVS. \"SGFY used an over-arching tech platform that both allows for optimal efficiency for its clinicians but also to ensure the most appropriate types of evaluations in the home. While CVS does not participate in this market directly, building any additional services into the home in our view would be a positive step, even if it feels like there is more urgency on the primary care side.\"What the Inflation Reduction Act Means for InvestorsElectric vehicle (EV) stocks were a pocket of strength today after the Senate over the weekend passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The industry is poised to benefit from the spending bill, which aims to commit $369 billion toward green energy investments \u2013 including extending a tax credit for purchases of electric vehicles \u2013 and reduce carbon emissions by 40% by the end of this decade.The efforts to fight climate change are a major part of the roughly $430 billion bill. But as with all things in life, nothing is free. In order to pay for the measures, the plan proposes a 1% tax on stock buybacks and a 15% minimum tax on companies reporting more than $1 billion in revenue.6 Satisfying Food Stocks That Look Appetizing Right Now\"We find the potential tax on share buybacks to be particularly interesting,\" says Sonia Joao, chief operating officer of Houston-based RIA Robertson Wealth Management. \"Share buybacks have been a popular way for American companies, and particularly tech firms, to reward their shareholders. This may incentivize them to spend less on payouts and more on dividends or debt reduction. It's early, but we could see this having far-ranging implications for the U.S. market.\"While the bill still has to make it through the House before being signed into law by President Joe Biden, investors will want to keep an eye out for its potential impact to their portfolios. Here, we've put together a short guide detailing some of the best (and worst) stocks from the Inflation Reduction Act.

Down from the $200 you\u2019ll regularly pay, today\u2019s offer amounts to $30 in savings. This is only the third discount of the year and matches the 2022 low set back on Prime Day. NVIDIA Shield Android TV Pro arrives as one of the more high-end streaming media players on the market with plenty of notable features. First and foremost is onboard Plex support with hardware transcoding, allowing you to create a server just by plugging in a USB hard drive or connecting to a NAS. Of course, there\u2019s access to all of the usual streaming services on top of 4K HDR playback, Alexa support, and more. A\u00a0new update also rolled out\u00a0that brings low-latency playback, night listening, and more to the Android 11 experience.\n\nAlso on sale today, Amazon is currently offering the\u00a0NVIDIA Shield TV Stick for\u00a0$124.99 shipped. Normally fetching $150, you\u2019re looking at yet another rare chance to save as the lead deal, with today\u2019s offer matching our previous Prime Day mention for the 2022 low. This is also only the second price cut of the year. While not as capable as the Pro model above, the Stick version of\u00a0NVIDIA Shield\u00a0packs much of the same Android TV features with 4K HDR playback, too.\u00a0\nAlongside Google Assistant and Chromecast integration, you\u2019ll be able to enjoy a variety of the popular streaming services. Plus, a bundled voice remote lets you easily search content and even has a built-in locator to ensure it never gets lost. Check out\u00a0our hands-on review\u00a0for all of the details.\nNVIDIA Shield Android TV Pro features:\nNVIDIA Shield TV Pro is the ultimate streaming media player for the modern living room\u2014packed with features to make even the most demanding users proud.

These create huge amounts of de-identified data that Assuta is securely sharing with more than 20 startups through its innovation arm, RISE, launched last year working in collaboration with NVIDIA.\nOne of the startups, Aidoc, is helping Assuta alert imaging technicians with AI-based insights of possible bleeding in the brain and other critical conditions in a patient\u2019s scan within minutes. Another, Rhino Health, is using federated learning powered by NVIDIA FLARE to make AI development on diverse medical datasets from hospitals across the globe more accessible to Assuta\u2019s collaborators.\nBoth companies are members of NVIDIA Inception, a global program designed to support cutting-edge startups with go-to-market support, expertise and technology.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a hub to serve innovators with the infrastructure they need to develop, test and deploy new AI technology for image analysis and other data-heavy computations in radiology, pathology, genomics and more,\u201d said Daniel Rabina, director of innovation at RISE. \u201cWe want to make collaboration with companies, research institutes, hospitals and universities possible while maintaining patient data privacy.\u201d\nTo support AI development, testing and deployment, Assuta has installed NVIDIA DGX A100 systems on premises and adopted the NVIDIA Clara Holoscan platform, plus software libraries including MONAI for healthcare imaging and NVIDIA FLARE for federated learning.\nNVIDIA and RISE are collaborating on RISE with US, a program built to introduce selected Israeli entrepreneurs and early-stage startups working on digital and computational health solutions to the U.S. market. Applications to join the program are open until August 28.\nAidoc Flags Urgent Cases for Radiologist Review\nAidoc, which is New York-based with a research branch in Israel, has developed FDA-cleared AI solutions to flag acute conditions including brain hemorrhages, pulmonary embolisms and strokes from imaging scans.\nFounded in 2016 by a group of veterans from the Israel Defense Forces, the startup has deployed its AI to analyze millions of cases across more than 1,000 medical facilities, primarily in the U.S., Europe and Israel.\nIts algorithms integrate seamlessly with the PACS imaging workflow used by radiologists worldwide, working behind the scenes to analyze each imaging study and flag urgent findings \u2014 bringing potentially critical cases to the radiologist\u2019s attention for review.\nAidoc\u2019s tools can help address the growing shortage of radiologists globally by reducing the time a radiologist needs to spend on each case, enabling care for more patients. And by pushing potentially critical cases to the top of a radiologist\u2019s pile, the AI can help clinicians catch important findings sooner, improving patient outcomes.\nThe startup uses NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs in the cloud through AWS for AI training and inference. Adopting NVIDIA GPUs helped reduce model training time from days to a couple hours.\nImmediate Impact at Assuta Medical Centers\u00a0\nAssuta is a private chain of hospitals that provides elective care \u2014 typically dealing with routine screenings rather than emergency room patients \u2014 but it adopted Aidoc\u2019s solution to help imaging technicians spot critical cases that need urgent attention among its roughly 200,000 CT tests conducted annually.\nWhen a radiology scan isn\u2019t urgent, it may take a couple days for a doctor to review the case. Aidoc can shrink this time to minutes by identifying concerning cases as soon as the scans are captured by radiology staff. \nAt Assuta, urgent findings are typically found among cancer patients, or people who have recently undergone surgery and need follow-up scans. The healthcare organization is using Aidoc\u2019s AI tools to detect intracranial hemorrhages and two kinds of pulmonary embolism.\n\u201cWe saw the impact right away,\u201d said Dr. Michal Guindy, head of medical imaging and head of RISE at Assuta. \u201cJust a couple days after installing Aidoc at Assuta, a patient came in for a follow-up scan after a brain procedure and had an intracranial hemorrhage. Because Aidoc alerted the imaging technician to flag it for further review, our doctors were able to call the patient while they were on their way home and immediately redirect them to the hospital for treatment.\u201d\nRhino Health Fosters Collaboration With Federated Learning\nIn addition to deploying AI models in full-scale, real-world settings, Assuta is supporting innovators who are developing, testing or validating new medical AI solutions by sharing the healthcare organization\u2019s data, while also using federated learning through Rhino Health.\nAssuta has millions of radiology cases digitized \u2014 a desirable resource for researchers and startups looking for robust, diverse datasets to train or validate their AI models. But because of data privacy protection, it\u2019s important that patient information stays safely within the firewall of medical centers like Assuta.\n\u201cData diversity is necessary to develop AI models meant for the use of medical teams. Without optimal computing resources, it would be extremely difficult to use our data and make the magic happen,\u201d said Rabina. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need federated learning enabled by both NVIDIA and Rhino Health.\u201d\nFederated learning allows companies, healthcare institutions and universities to work together by training and validating AI models across multiple organizations\u2019 datasets while maintaining each organization\u2019s data privacy. Rhino Health provides a neutral platform \u2014 available through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite \u2014 that enables secure collaboration, powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs in the cloud and the NVIDIA FLARE federated learning framework.\nWith Rhino Health, Assuta aims to help its collaborators develop AI models across hospitals internationally, resulting in more generalizable algorithms that perform more accurately across different patient populations.\nRegister for NVIDIA GTC, running online Sept. 19-22, to hear more from leaders in healthcare AI.\nSubscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news and watch on demand as Assuta, Aidoc and Rhino Health speak at an GTC panel. \n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Growing up in Cuba, he always fiddled with electronics, and he fell deeper in love with technology when he began coding in college.\n\u201cRobots can assist humans with strenuous, high-precision, repetitive and sometimes hazardous tasks,\u201d Serrano-Mu\u00f1oz said. \u201cThey have the potential to improve our lives, and I hope my work advances robotics in a way that allows us to build a better present and achieve a better future.\u201d\nHe believes Omniverse is crucial to his doctoral studies in applied robotics.\n\u201cPerforming real-time, graphically realistic simulations of robotics environments wasn\u2019t possible before Omniverse,\u201d he said. \u201cThe platform opens the door to a new era of revolutionary changes in robotics, simulation and real-time collaboration.\u201d\nOmniverse links specialists of all kinds \u2014 engineers, designers, content creators \u2014 for the development of simulation systems, he added. Key for this is Universal Scene Description (USD), an open-source 3D scene description and extensible file framework serving as the common language for virtual worlds.\n\u201cUSD plays an important role in the process of authoring, composing and reading a hierarchically organized scene to create and manipulate its rendering elements and objects,\u201d Serrano-Mu\u00f1oz said.\nExtending Omniverse for Isaac Sim\nUsing NVIDIA Omniverse, the developer has created robot simulations for industrial use cases and a digital twin of Mondragon University\u2019s laboratory for robotics prototyping.\nA digital twin of a bench in Mondragon University\u2019s robotics lab, made with NVIDIA Omniverse.\nAnd while working on such projects, Serrano-Mu\u00f1oz wanted to integrate with Isaac Sim a tool he was already familiar with: Robot Operating System, or ROS, a set of software libraries for building robot applications. So, he created an Omniverse Extension to enable just that.\nThe extension lets users manipulate simulated robotic systems in the Omniverse-powered Isaac Sim application via ROS control interfaces. ROS MoveIt, a motion planning framework for robots, can be used in conjunction with Isaac Sim\u2019s dynamic control extension and PhysX capabilities, which bring physical accuracy to high-fidelity robotics simulations.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to develop code without leaving the Omniverse Kit,\u201d Serrano-Mu\u00f1oz said. \u201cOmniverse Extensions come with a system-wide integration API, installation, activation and reload mechanisms to augment the functionality of Omniverse Apps.\u201d\nThis particular extension for ROS, he added, boosts agile prototyping for robotics applications \u2014 which is further accelerated by his NVIDIA RTX 3080 Laptop GPU \u2014 making his workflow faster than ever.\nHear more from Serrano-Mu\u00f1oz about using digital twins for industrial robotics by watching his NVIDIA GTC session on demand. And watch his community spotlight livestream to learn more about his workflow:\n\nJoin In on the Creation\nCreators and developers across the world can download NVIDIA Omniverse for free, and enterprise teams can use the platform for their 3D projects.\nDevelopers like Serrano-Mu\u00f1oz will join NVIDIA at SIGGRAPH, a global computer graphics conference running Aug. 8-11. Watch the Omniverse community livestream at SIGGRAPH on Tuesday, Aug. 9, at noon PT to learn how Omniverse and other design and visualization technologies are driving breakthroughs in graphics and GPU-accelerated software.\nPlus, anyone can submit to the inaugural #ExtendOmniverse developer contest through Friday, Sept. 9, at 5 p.m. PT. Create an Omniverse Extension using Omniverse Code for a chance to win an NVIDIA RTX GPU.\nCheck out artwork from other \u201cOmnivores\u201d and submit projects in the gallery. Connect your workflows to Omniverse with software from Adobe, Autodesk, Epic Games, Maxon, Reallusion and more.\nFollow NVIDIA Omniverse on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and Medium for additional resources and inspiration. Check out the Omniverse forums, and join our Discord server and Twitch channel to chat with the community.\n\n\nCategories: Pro Graphics | RoboticsTags: 3D | Digital Twin | Meet the Omnivore | NVIDIA RTX | Omniverse | Open Source | Rendering | Simulation and Design | Universal Scene Description \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Editor\u2019s note: This post is a part of our Meet the Omnivore series, which features individual creators and developers who use NVIDIA Omniverse to accelerate their 3D workflows and create virtual worlds.\nImagine taking a selfie and using it to get a moving, talking, customizable 3D avatar of yourself in just seconds.\nA new extension for NVIDIA Omniverse, a design collaboration and world simulation platform, enables just that.\nCreated by developers at software startup in3D, the extension lets people instantly import 3D avatars of themselves into virtual environments using their smartphones. Omniverse Extensions are the core building blocks that let anyone create and extend functions of Omniverse Apps.\nThe in3D app can now bring people, in their digital forms, into Omniverse. It helps creators build engaging virtual worlds and use these avatars as heroes, actors or spectators in their stories. The app works on any phone with a camera, recreating a user\u2019s full geometry and texture based on a video selfie.\nThe avatars can even be added into 3D worlds with animations and a customizable wardrobe.\n\nIn3D is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a free, global program that nurtures cutting-edge startups.\nSimple and Scalable Avatar Creation\nCreating a photorealistic 3D avatar has traditionally taken up to several months, with costs reaching up to tens of thousands of dollars. Photogrammetry, a standard approach to creating 3D references of humans from images, is extremely costly, requires a digital studio and lacks scalability.\nWith in3D, the process of creating 3D avatars is simple and scalable. The app understands the geometry, texture, depth and various vectors of a person via a mobile scan \u2014 and uses this information to replicate lifelike detail and create predictive animations for avatars.\nDmitry Ulyanov, CEO of in3D, which is based in Tel Aviv, Israel, said the app captures even small details with centimeter-grade accuracy and automatically fixes lighting. This allows for precise head geometry from a single selfie, as well as estimation of a user\u2019s exact body shape.\n\nFor creators building 3D worlds, in3D software can save countless hours, increase productivity and result in substantial cost savings, Ulyanov said.\n\u201cManually creating one avatar can take up to months,\u201d he added. \u201cWith in3D\u2019s scanning app and software development kit, a user can scan and upload 21,000 people with a single GPU and mobile phone in the same amount of time.\u201d\nConnecting to Omniverse\nUlyanov said that using in3D\u2019s extension with NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) opens up many possibilities for avatar building, as users can easily customize imported avatars from in3D to engage and interact with their virtual worlds \u2014 in real time and at scale.\nIn3D uses Universal Scene Description (USD), an open-source, extensible file format, to seamlessly integrate its high-fidelity avatars into Omniverse. All avatar data is contained in a USD file, removing the need for complex shaders or embeddings. And bringing the avatars into Omniverse only requires a simple drag and drop.\nOnce imported into Omniverse via USD, the avatars can be used in apps like Omniverse Create and Audio2Face. Users have a complete toolset within Omniverse to support holistic content creation, whether animating avatars\u2019 bodies with the retargeting tool or crafting their facial expressions with Audio2Face.\n\nTo build the Omniverse Extension, in3D used Omniverse Kit and followed the development flow using the VSCode computer program. Being able to put a breakpoint anywhere in the code made VSCode an easy-to-use, convenient, out-of-the-box solution for connecting in3D to Omniverse, Ulyanov said.\n\u201cThe ability to centralize our SDK alongside other software for 3D developers is game changing,\u201d he said. \u201cWith our Omniverse Extension now available, we\u2019re looking to expand the base of developers who use our avatars.\u201d\n\u201cHaving the ability to upload our SDK and connect it with all the tools that 3D developers use has made in3D a tangible solution to deploy across all 3D development environments,\u201d said Sergei Sherman, chief marketing officer at in3D. \u201cThis was something we wouldn\u2019t have been able to achieve on our own in such a short amount of time.\u201d\nJoin In on the Creation\nCreators and developers across the world can download NVIDIA Omniverse for free, and enterprise teams can use the platform for their 3D projects.\nLearn how to connect and create virtual worlds with Omniverse at NVIDIA GTC, the design and simulation conference for the era of AI and the metaverse, running online Sept. 19-22. Registration is free and offers access to dozens of sessions and special events.\nDevelopers can use Omniverse Code to create their own Omniverse Extension for the inaugural #ExtendOmniverse contest by Friday, Sept. 9, at 5 p.m. PT, for a chance to win an NVIDIA RTX GPU. The winners will be announced in the NVIDIA Omniverse User Group at GTC.\nFind additional documentation and tutorials in the Omniverse Resource Center, which details how developers like Ulyanov can build custom USD-based applications and extensions for the platform.\nFollow NVIDIA Omniverse on Instagram, Medium, Twitter and YouTube for additional resources and inspiration.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia announced new details about its Grace CPU Superchip in advance of its Hot Chips 34 presentation next week, revealing that the chips come fabbed on the 4N process. Nvidia also shared more information about the architecture and data fabric, along with more performance and efficiency benchmarks. Nvidia hasn't made its official presentation at Hot Chips yet \u2014 we'll add the finer-grained details after the session \u2014 but the information shared today gives us the broad strokes as the Grace chips and servers work their way to market in the first half of 2023.\n\nAs a quick reminder, Nvidia's Grace CPU is the company's first CPU-only Arm chip designed for the data center and comes as two chips on one motherboard, totaling 144 cores, while the Grace Hopper Superchip combines a Hopper GPU and the Grace CPU on the same board.\n\nAmong the most important disclosures, Nvidia finally officially confirmed that the Grace CPUs use the TSMC 4N process. TSMC lists the \"N4\" 4nm process under its 5nm node family, describing it as an enhanced version of the 5nm node. Nvidia uses a specialized variant of this node, dubbed '4N,' that is optimized specifically for its GPUs and CPUs.(Image credit: Nvidia)These types of specialized nodes are becoming more common as Moore's Law wanes and shrinking the transistors becomes harder and more expensive with each new node. To enable custom process nodes like Nvidia's 4N, chip designers and foundries work hand-in-hand by using Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) to dial in custom power, performance, and area (PPA) characteristics for their specific products.\n\nNvidia has previously revealed that it uses off-the-shelf Arm Neoverse cores for its Grace CPUs, but the company still hasn't specified which specific version it uses. However, Nvidia has disclosed that Grace uses Arm v9 cores and supports SVE2, and the Neoverse N2 platform is Arm's first IP to support Arm v9 and extensions like SVE2. The N2 Perseus platform comes as a 5nm design (remember, N4 is in TSMC's 5nm family) and supports PCIe Gen 5.0, DDR5, HBM3, CCIX 2.0, and CXL 2.0. The Perseus design is optimized for performance-per-power (watt) and performance-per-area. Arm says that its next-gen cores, Poseidon, won't arrive on the market until 2024, making those cores a less likely candidate given Grace's early 2023 launch date.Nvidia Grace Hopper CPU ArchitectureNvidia's new Nvidia Scalable Coherency Fabric (SCF) is a mesh interconnect that seems very similar to the standard CMN-700 Coherent Mesh Network that is used with Arm Neoverse cores.\n\nThe Nvidia SCF provides 3.2 TB/s of bi-sectional bandwidth between the various Grace chip units, like the CPU cores, memory, and I/O, not to mention the NVLink-C2C interface that ties the chip to the other unit present on the motherboard, be it another Grace CPU or the Hopper GPU.\u00a0Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)The mesh supports 72+ cores, and each CPU has 117MB of total L3 cache. Nvidia says the first block diagram in the album above is a 'possible topology for illustrative purposes,' and its alignment doesn't entirely agree with the second diagram.\n\nThis diagram shows the chip with eight SCF Cache partitions (SCC) that appear to be L3 cache slices (we'll learn more details in the presentation) along with eight CPU units (these appear to be clusters of cores). The SCC and cores are connected to Cache Switch Nodes (CSN) in groups of two, with the CSN then residing on the SCF mesh fabric to provide an interface between the CPU cores and memory to the rest of the chip.\u00a0SCF also supports coherency across up to four sockets with Coherent NVLink.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia also shared this diagram, showing that each Grace CPU supports up to 68 PCIe lanes and up to four PCIe 5.0 x16 connections. Each x16 connection supports up to 128 GB/s of bidirectional throughput (the x16 links can be bifurcated to two x8 links). We also see 16 dual-channel LPDDR5X memory controllers (MC).\n\nHowever, this diagram is different than the first \u2014 it shows the L3 cache as two contiguous blocks connected to quad-core CPU clusters, which makes much more sense than the prior diagram and totals up to 72 cores in the chip. However, we don't see the separate SCF partitions or the CSN nodes from the first diagram, which lends a bit of confusion. We'll suss this out during the presentation and update as necessary.\n\nNvidia tells us that the Scalable Coherency Fabric (SCF) is its proprietary design, but Arm allows its partners to customize the CMN-700 mesh by adjusting core counts, cache sizes, and using different types of memory, such as DDR5 and HBM, and selecting various interfaces, like PCIe 5.0, CXL, and CCIX. That means it is possible Nvidia uses a highly-customized CMN-700 implementation for the on-die fabric.Nvidia Grace Hopper Extended GPU MemoryImage 1 of 3(Image credit: Nvidia )(Image credit: Nvidia )(Image credit: Nvidia)GPUs love memory throughput, so naturally, Nvidia has turned its eye to improving memory throughput not only within the chip but also between the CPU and GPU. The Grace CPU has 16 dual-channel LPDDR5X memory controllers, working out to 32 channels that support up to 512 GB of memory and up to 546 GB/s of throughput. Nvidia says it selected LPDDR5X over HBM2e due to multiple factors, like capacity and cost. Meanwhile, LPDDR5X provides 53% more bandwidth and 1/8th the power-per-GB compared to standard DDR5 memory, making it the better overall choice.\u00a0Nvidia is also introducing Extended GPU Memory (EGM), which allows any Hopper GPU on the NVLink network to access the LPDDR5X memory of any Grace CPU on the network, but at native NVLink performance.\u00a0Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Nvidia's goal is to provide a unified pool of memory that can be shared between the CPU and GPU, thus providing higher performance while simplifying the programming model. The Grace Hopper CPU+GPU chip supports unified memory with shared page tables, meaning the chips can share an address space and page tables with CUDA apps and allows using system allocators to allocate GPU memory. It also supports native atomics between the CPU and GPU.Nvidia NVLink-C2CImage 1 of 4(Image credit: Nvidia )(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia )(Image credit: Nvidia )CPU cores are the compute engine, but interconnects are the battleground that will define the future of computing. Moving data consumes more power than actually computing the data, so moving around data faster and more efficiently, or even avoiding data transfers, is a key goal.Nvidia's Grace CPU, which consists of two CPUs on a single board, and the Grace Hopper Superchip, which consists of one Grace CPU and one Hopper GPU on the same board, are designed to maximize data transfer between the units via a proprietary NVLink Chip-to-Chip (C2C) interconnect and to provide memory coherency to reduce or eliminate data transfers.Swipe to scroll horizontallyInterconnectPicojoules per Bit (pJ/b)NVLink-C2C1.3 pJ/bUCIe0.5 - 0.25 pJ/bInfinity Fabric~1.5 pJ/bTSMC CoWoS0.56 pJ/bFoverosSub-0.3 pJ/bEMIB0.3 pJ/bBunch of Wires (BoW)0.7 to 0.5 pJ/bOn-die0.1 pJ/bNvidia shared new details about its NVLink-C2C interconnect. As a reminder, this is a die-to-die and chip-to-chip interconnect that supports memory coherency, delivering up to 900 GB/s of throughput (7x the bandwidth of a PCIe 5.0 x16 link). This interface uses the NVLink protocol, and Nvidia crafted the interface using its SERDES and LINK design technologies with a focus on energy and area efficiency. The physical C2C interface runs across a standard PCB, so it doesn't use a specialized interposer. \n\nNVLink-C2C also supports industry-standard protocols like CXL and Arm's AMBA Coherent Hub Interface (CHI \u2014 key to the Neoverse CMN-700 mesh). It also supports several types of connections ranging from PCB-based interconnects to silicon interposers and wafer-scale implementations.\n\nPower efficiency is a key metric for all data fabrics, and today Nvidia shared that the link consumes 1.3 picojoules per bit (pJ/b) of data transferred. This is 5x the efficiency of the PCIe 5.0 interface, but it is more than twice the power of the UCIe interconnect that will come to market in the future (0.5 to 0.25 pJ/b). Packaging types vary and the C2C link provides Nvidia with a solid blend of performance and efficiency for its specific use case, but as you can see in the table above, more advanced options provide higher levels of power efficiency.Nvidia Grace CPU BenchmarksImage 1 of 3(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia shared more performance benchmarks, but as with all vendor-provided performance data, you should take these numbers with a grain of salt. These benchmarks also come with the added caveat that they are conducted pre-silicon, meaning they're emulated projections that haven't been tested with actual silicon yet and are \"subject to change.\" As such, sprinkle some extra salt.\u00a0Nvidia's new benchmark here is the score of 370 with a single Grace CPU in the SpecIntRate 2017 benchmark. This places the chips right at the range we would expect \u2014 Nvidia has already shared a multi-CPU benchmark, claiming a score of 740 for two Grace CPUs in the SpecIntRate2017 benchmark. Obviously, this suggests a linear scaling improvement with two chips.\u00a0AMD's current-gen EPYC Milan chips, the current performance leader in the data center, have posted SPEC results ranging from 382 to 424 apiece, meaning the highest-end x86 chips will still hold the lead. However, Nvidia's solution will have many other advantages, such as power efficiency and a more GPU-friendly design.Nvidia shared its memory throughput\u00a0benchmarks, showing that the Grace CPU can provide ~500 GB/s of throughput in CPU memory throughput tests. Nvidia also claims the chip can also push up to 506 GB/s of combined read/write throughput to an attached Hopper GPU, and clocked the CPU to GPU bandwidth at 429 GB/s during read throughput tests, and 407 GB/s with writes.\u00a0Grace Hopper is Arm System Ready(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia also announced that the Grace CPU Superchip will adhere to the necessary requirements to attain System Ready certification. This certification signifies that an Arm chip will 'just work' with operating systems and software, thus easing deployment. Grace will also support virtualization extensions, including nested virtualization and S-EL2 support. Nvidia also lists support for the following:RAS v1.1 Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) v4.1\u00a0Memory Partitioning and Monitoring (MPAM)\u00a0System Memory Management Unit (SMMU) v3.1Arm Server Base System Architecture (SBSA) to enable standards-compliant hardware and software interfaces. In addition, to enable standard boot flows on Grace CPU-based systems, Grace CPU has been designed to support Arm Server Base Boot Requirements (SBBR).For cache and bandwidth partitioning, as well as bandwidth monitoring, Grace CPU also supports Arm Memory Partitioning and Monitoring (MPAM). Grace CPU also includes Arm Performance Monitoring Units, allowing for the performance monitoring of the CPU cores as well as other subsystems in the system-on-a-chip (SoC) architecture. This enables standard tools, such as Linux perf, to be used for performance investigations.(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia's Grace CPU and Grace Hopper Superchip are on track for release in early 2023, with the Hopper variant geared for AI training, inference, and HPC, while the dual-CPU Grace systems are designed for HPC and cloud computing workloads.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more CPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\narm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (1)\n\n\n\nPaul AlcornSocial Links NavigationManaging Editor: News and Emerging TechPaul Alcorn is the Managing Editor: News and Emerging Tech for Tom's Hardware US.

It\u2019s one example Greenberg gives of how computer graphics are becoming part of every human enterprise.\nA Whole New Chapter\nExpanding the frontier, he\u2019s creating new tools for an architecture design course based on today\u2019s capabilities for building realistic 3D worlds and digital twins. It will define a holistic process so everyone from engineers to city planners can participate in a design.\nThe courseware is still at the concept stage, but his passion for it is palpable. \u201cThis is my next big project, and I\u2019m very excited about it,\u201d said the computer graphics professor of the work, which is sponsored by NVIDIA.\n\u201cNVIDIA is superb at the hardware and the software algorithms, and for a long time its biggest advantage is in how it fits them together,\u201d he said.\nGreenberg imagines a design process open enough to include urban planners concerned with affordable housing, environmental activists mindful of sustainable living and neighbors who want to know the impact a new structure might have on their access to sunlight.\n\u201cI want to put people from different disciplines in the same foxhole so they can see things from different points of view at the same time,\u201d said Greenberg, whose courses have spanned Cornell\u2019s architecture, art, computer science, engineering and business departments.\nTeaching With Omniverse\nA multidisciplinary approach has fueled Greenberg\u2019s work since 1968, when he started teaching at both Cornell\u2019s colleges of engineering and architecture. And he\u2019s always been rooted in the latest technology.\nToday, that means inspiring designers and construction experts to enter the virtual worlds built with photorealistic graphics, simulations and AI in NVIDIA Omniverse.\n\u201cOmniverse expands, to multiple domains, the work done with Universal Scene Description, developed by some of the brightest graphics people at places like Pixar \u2014 it\u2019s a superb environment for modern collaboration,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s a capability that couldn\u2019t have existed without the million-X advances in computing Greenberg has witnessed in his 54-year career.\nHe recalls his excitement in 1979 when he bought a VAX-11/780 minicomputer, his first system capable of a million instructions per second. In one of his many SIGGRAPH talks, he said designers would someday have personal workstations capable of 100 MIPS.\nSeeing Million-X Advances\nThe prediction proved almost embarrassingly conservative.\n\u201cNow I have a machine that\u2019s 1012 times more powerful than my first computer \u2014 I feel like a surfer riding a tidal wave, and that\u2019s one reason I\u2019m still teaching,\u201d he said.\nGreenberg with some of his students trying out the latest design tools.\nIt\u2019s a long way from the system at General Electric\u2019s Visual Simulation Laboratory in Syracuse, New York, where in the late 1960s he programmed on punch cards to help create one of the first videos generated solely with computer graphics. The 18-minute animation wowed audiences and took him and 14 of his architecture students two years to create.\nNASA used the same GE system to train astronauts how to dock the Apollo module with the lunar lander. And the space agency was one of the early adopters of digital twins, he notes, a fact that saved the lives of the Apollo 13 crew after a system malfunction two days into their trip to the moon.\nFrom Sketches to Digital Twins\nFor Greenberg, it all comes down to the power of computer graphics.\n\u201cI love to draw, 99% of intellectual intake comes through our eyes and my recent projects are about how to go from a sketch or idea to a digital twin,\u201d he said.\nAmong his few regrets, he said he\u2019ll miss attending SIGGRAPH in person this year.\n\u201cIt became an academic home for my closest friends and collaborators, a community of mavericks and the only place I found creative people with both huge imaginations and great technical skills, but it\u2019s hard to travel at my age,\u201d said the 88-year-old, whose pioneering continues in front of his computer screen.\n\u201cI have a whole bunch of stuff I\u2019m working on that I call techniques in search of a problem, like trying to model how the retina sees an image \u2014 I\u2019m just getting started on that one,\u201d he said.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nLearn More About Omniverse at SIGGRAPH\nAnyone can get started working on digital twins with Omniverse by taking a free, self-paced online course at the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Cameras have been deployed in factories for over a decade \u2014 so why, Franz Tschimben wondered, hasn\u2019t automated visual inspection yet become the worldwide standard?\nThis question motivated Tschimben and his colleagues to found Covision Quality, an AI-based visual-inspection software startup that uses NVIDIA technology to transform end-of-line defect detection for the manufacturing industry.\n\u201cThe simple answer is that these systems are hard to scale,\u201d said Tschimben, the northern Italy-based company\u2019s CEO. \u201cMaterial defects, like burrs, holes or scratches, have varying geometric shapes and colors that make identifying them cumbersome. That meant quality-control specialists had to program inspection systems by hand to fine-tune their defect parameters.\u201d\nCovision\u2019s software allows users to train AI models for visual inspection without needing to code. It quadruples accuracy for defect detection and reduces false-negative rates by up to 90% compared with traditional rule-based methods, according to Tschimben.\nThe software relies on unsupervised machine learning that\u2019s trained on NVIDIA RTX A5000 GPUs. This technique allows the AI in just one hour to teach itself, based on hundreds of example images, what qualifies as a defect for a specific customer. It removes the extensive labeling of thousands of images that\u2019s typically required for a supervised learning pipeline.\nThe startup is a member of NVIDIA Metropolis \u2014 a partner ecosystem centered on vision AI that includes a suite of GPU-accelerated software development kits, pretrained models and the TAO toolkit to supercharge a range of automation applications. Covision is also part of NVIDIA Inception, a free, global program that nurtures cutting-edge startups.\nIn June, Covision was chosen from hundreds of emerging companies as the winner of a startup award at Automate, a flagship conference on all things automation.\nReducing Pseudo-Scrap Rates\nIn manufacturing, the pseudo-scrap rate \u2014 or the frequency at which products are falsely identified as defective \u2014 is a key indicator of a visual-inspection system\u2019s efficiency.\nCovision\u2019s software, which is hardware agnostic, reduces pseudo-scrap rates by up to 90%, according to Tschimben.\nAs an item passes through a production line, a camera captures an image of it. Then, Covision\u2019s real-time AI model analyzes it. Finally, it sends the information to a simple user interface that displays image frames: green for good pieces and red for defective ones.\n\nFor GKN Powder Metallurgy, a global producer of 13 million metal parts each day, the above steps can occur in as quick as 200 milliseconds per piece \u2014 enabled by Covision software and NVIDIA GPUs deployed at the production line.\nTwo to six cameras usually inspect one production line at a factory, Tschimben said. And one NVIDIA A5000 GPU on premises can process the images from four production lines in real time.\n\u201cNVIDIA GPUs are robust and reliable,\u201d he added. \u201cThe TensorRT SDK and CUDA toolkit enable our developers to use the latest resources to build our platform, and the Metropolis program helps us with go-to-market strategy \u2014 NVIDIA is a one-stop solution for us.\u201d\nPlus, being an Inception member gives Covision access to free credits for NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute courses, which Tschimben said are \u201cvery helpful hands-on resources\u201d for the company\u2019s engineers to stay up to date on the latest NVIDIA tech.\nIncreasing Efficiency, Sustainability in Industrial Production\nIn addition to identifying defective pieces at production lines, Covision software offers a management panel that displays AI-based data analyses of improvements in a production site\u2019s quality of outputs over time \u2014 and more.\n\u201cIt can show, for example, which site out of a company\u2019s many across the world is producing the best metal pieces with the highest production-line uptime, or which production line within a factory needs attention at a given moment,\u201d Tschimben said.\n\nThis feature can help managers make high-level decisions to optimize factory efficiency, globally.\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a sustainability factor,\u201d Tschimben said. \u201cCompanies want to reduce waste. Our software reduces production inefficiencies, increasing sustainability and making the work more streamlined.\u201d\nReducing pseudo-scrap rates using Covision software means that companies can produce materials at higher efficiency and profitability levels, and ultimately waste less.\nCovision software is deployed at production sites across the U.S. and Europe for customers including Alupress Group and Aluflexpack, in addition to GKN Powder Metallurgy.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Metropolis and apply to join NVIDIA Inception.\nAttend NVIDIA GTC, running online Sept.19-22, to discover how vision AI and other groundbreaking technologies are shaping the world.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: CUDA | Customer Stories | GPU | Inception | Industrial and Manufacturing | Machine Learning | Metropolis | Smart Spaces | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And it must also narrow down relevant images from roughly 300 billion images on the site to roughly 50 for each person.\nThe last step \u2014 ranking the most relevant and engaging content for everyone using Pinterest \u2014 required a leap in acceleration to run heftier models, with minimal latency, for better predictions.\nPinterest has improved the accuracy of its recommender models powering people\u2019s home feeds and other areas, increasing engagement by as much as 16%.\nThe leap was enabled by switching from CPUs to NVIDIA GPUs, which could easily be applied next to other areas, including advertising images, according to Pinterest.\n\u201cNormally we would be happy with a 2% increase, and 16% is just a beginning for home feeds. We see additional gains \u2014 it opens a lot of doors for opportunities,\u201d said Pong Eksombatchai, a software engineer at Pinterest.\nTransformer models capable of better predictions are shaking up industries from retail to entertainment and advertising. But their leaps in performance gains of the past few years have come with a need to serve models that are some 100x bigger as their number of model parameters and computations skyrockets.\nHuge Inference Gains, Same Infrastructure Cost\nLike many, Pinterest engineers wanted to tap into state-of-the-art recommender models to increase engagement. But serving these massive models on CPUs presented a 100x increase in cost and latency. That wasn\u2019t going to maintain its magical user experience \u2014 fresh and more appealing images \u2014 occurring within a fraction of a second.\n\u201cIf that latency happened, then obviously our users wouldn\u2019t like that very much because they would have to wait forever,\u201d said Eksombatchai. \u201cWe are pretty close to the limit of what we can do on CPU basically.\u201d\nThe challenge was to serve these hundredfold larger recommender models within the same cost and latency constraints.\nWorking with NVIDIA, Pinterest engineers began architectural changes to optimize their inference pipeline and recommender models to enable the transition from CPU to GPU cloud instances. The technology transition began late last year and required major changes to how the company manages workloads. The result is a 100x gain in inference efficiency on the same IT budget, meeting their goals.\n\u201cWe are starting to use really, really big models now. And that is where the GPU comes in \u2014 to help make these models possible,\u201d Eksombatchai said.\nTapping Into cuCollections\u00a0\nSwitching from CPUs to GPUs required rethinking its inference systems architecture. Among other issues, engineers had to change how they send workloads to their inference servers. Fortunately, there are tools to assist in making the transition easier.\nThe Pinterest inference server built for CPUs had to be altered because it was set up to send smaller batch sizes to its servers. GPUs can handle much larger workloads, so it\u2019s necessary to set up larger batch requests to increase efficiency.\nOne area where this comes into play is with its embedding table lookup module. Embedding tables are used to track interactions between various context-specific features and interests of user profiles. They can track where you navigate, and what people Pin on Pinterest, share or numerous other actions, helping refine predictions on what users might like to click on next.\nThey are used to incrementally learn user preference based on context in order to make better content recommendations to those using Pinterest. Its embedding table lookup module required two computation steps repeated hundreds of times because of the number of features tracked.\nPinterest engineers greatly reduced this number of operations using a GPU-accelerated concurrent hash table from NVIDIA cuCollections. And they set up a custom consolidated embedding lookup module so they could merge requests into a single lookup. Better results were seen immediately.\n\u201cUsing cuCollections helped us to remove bottlenecks,\u201d said Eksombatchai.\nEnlisting CUDA Graphs\nPinterest relied on CUDA Graphs to eliminate what was remaining of the small batch operations, further optimizing its inference models.\nCUDA Graphs helps reduce the CPU interactions when launching on GPUs. They\u2019re\u00a0 designed to enable workloads to be defined as graphs rather than single operations. They provide a mechanism to launch multiple GPU operations through a single CPU operation, reducing CPU overheads.\nPinterest enlisted CUDA Graphs to represent the model inference process as a static graph of operation instead of as those individually scheduled. This enabled the computation to be handled as a single unit without any kernel launching overhead.\nThe company now supports CUDA Graph as a new backend of its model server. When a model is first loaded, the model server runs the model inference once to build the graph instance. This graph\u00a0 can then be run repeatedly in inference to show content on its app or site.\nImplementing CUDA Graphs helped Pinterest to significantly reduce inference latency of its recommender models, according to its engineers.\nGPUs have enabled Pinterest to do something that was impossible with CPUs on the same budget, and by doing this they can make changes that have a direct impact on various business metrics.\nLearn about Pinterest\u2019s GPU-driven inference and optimizations at its GTC session, Serving 100x Bigger Recommender Models, and in the Pinterest Engineering blog.\u00a0\u00a0\nRegister for GTC, running Sept. 19-22, for free to attend sessions with NVIDIA and dozens of industry leaders.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | CUDA | GPU | GTC 2022 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

You can read the full earning report by our Finance team here but what we are going to talk about is the fact that NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, has confirmed that their next-generation GPUs are inbound.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSNVIDIA confirmed that its price adjustment on existing graphics cards came in a bid to get rid of excess inventory to make room for the next generation of products. Jensen states that the next-generation graphics cards and the GPU architecture is going to be really exciting which you can read from the statement provided below:\n\nOur strategy is to reduce the sell-in -- reduce the sell-in this quarter, next quarter to let channel inventory correct. Obviously, we\u2019re off the highs, and the macro condition turned sharply worse. And so, our first strategy is to reduce sell-in in the next couple of quarters to correct channel inventory. We\u2019ve also instituted programs to price position our current products to prepare for next-generation products.\nAmpere is the most popular GPU we\u2019ve ever created. It is in the top 15 most popular gaming GPUs on Steam. And it remains the best GPUs in the world, and it will be very successful for some time. However, we do have exciting new next-generation coming and it\u2019s going to be layered on top of that. And so, we\u2019ve taken -- we\u2019ve done two things. We\u2019ve reduced sell-in to let channel inventory correct and we\u2019ve implemented programs with our partners to price position the products in the channel in preparation for our next generation.\nAll of this we anticipate were working towards a path to being in a good shape going into next year. Oka? So, that\u2019s what our game plan is.\nNVIDIA CEO - Jensen Huang (Q2 2023 Earnings Call)\n\nWhat's more important is the fact that Jensen also gave us a hint that we can hear more about the next-generation gaming GPU architecture by next month at GTC 2022. The next iteration of NVIDIA GTC is going to take place on 19th September and last till 22nd September while the CEO keynote is expected to take place on 20th September.\nIn Gaming, our partners and ecosystem are responding to a sudden slowdown in consumer demand and correcting channel inventory. Still, the fundamentals of gaming are strong. We\u2019ll get through this over the next few months and go into next year with our new architecture. I look forward to telling you more about it at GTC next month.\nI look forward to next month\u2019s GTC conference, where we will share new advances of RTX reinventing 3D graphics and gaming.\nNVIDIA CEO - Jensen Huang (Q2 2023 Earnings Call)\nSo it looks like we are more or less going to get an official to unveil next month in September. This will definitely not be a launch event for the next-generation GeForce RTX 40 series lineup but more so an announcement/unveil. We definitely look forward to what NVIDIA has in store for the gaming community.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n125\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n108\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n66\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n52\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n35\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1478\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Then in April 2020 Nvidia acquired the company for US $7 billion, and Kagan took over as CTO of that tech goliath\u2014his dream job.\n\n\tNvidia is headquartered in Santa Clara, Calif., but Kagan works out of the company\u2019s office in Israel.\n\n\tAt Mellanox, based in Yokneam Illit, Israel, Kagan had overseen the development of high-performance networking for computing and storage in cloud data centers. The company made networking equipment such as adapters, cables, and high-performance switches, as well as a new type of processor, the DPU. The company\u2019s high-speed \n\tInfiniBand products can be found in most of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers, and its high-speed Ethernet products are in most cloud data centers, Kagan says.\n\n\tThe IEEE senior member\u2019s work is now focused on integrating a wealth of Nvidia technologies to build accelerated computing platforms, whose foundation are three chips: the GPU, the CPU, and the DPU, or data-processing unit. The DPU can support the ability to offload, accelerate, and isolate data center workloads, reducing CPU and GPU workloads.\n\n\t\u201cAt Mellanox we worked on the data center interconnect, but at Nvidia we are connecting state-of-the-art computing to become a single unit of computing: the data center,\u201d Kagan says. Interconnects are used to link multiple servers and combine the entire data center into one, giant computing unit.\n\n\t\u201cI have access and an open door to Nvidia technologies,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes my life exciting and interesting. We are building the computing of the future.\u201d\nFrom Intel to Mellanox\n\tKagan was born in St. Petersburg, Russia\u2014then known as Leningrad. After he graduated high school in 1975, his family moved to Israel. As with many budding engineers, his curiosity led him to disassemble and reassemble things to figure out how they worked. And, with many engineers in the family, he says, pursuing an engineering career was an easy decision.\n\n\tHe attended the \n\tTechnion, Israel\u2019s Institute of Technology, because \u201cit was one of the best engineering universities in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cThe reason I picked electrical engineering is because it was considered to be the best faculty in the Technion.\u201d\n\n\tKagan graduated in 1980 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering. He joined \n\tIntel in Haifa, Israel, in 1983 as a design engineer and eventually relocated to the company\u2019s offices in Hillsboro, Ore., where he worked on the 80387 floating-point coprocessor. A year later, after returning to Israel, Kagan served as an architect of the i8060XP vector processor and then led and managed design of the Pentium MMX microprocessor.\n\n\tDuring his 16 years at Intel, he worked his way up to chief architect. In 1999 he was preparing to move his family to California, where he would lead a high-profile project for the company. Then a former coworker at Intel, Eyal Waldman, asked Kagan to join him and five other acquaintances to form Mellanox.\n\n            \n                About Michael Kagan\n            \n            \n        Employer: Nvidia, Tel Aviv\nTitle: CTO\nMember grade: Senior member\nAlma mater: Technion, Israel\u2019s Institute of Technology, Haifa\n\tKagan had been turning down offers to join startups nearly every week, he recalls, but Mellanox, with its team of cofounders and vision, drew him in. He says he saw it as a \u201ccompelling adventure, an opportunity to build a company with a culture based on the core values I grew up on: excellence, teamwork, and commitment.\u201d\n\n\tDuring his more than 21 years there, he said, he had no regrets.\n\n\t\u201cIt was one of the greatest decisions I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d he says. \u201cIt ended up benefiting all aspects of my life: professionally, financially\u2014everything.\u201d\n\n\tInfiniBand, the startup\u2019s breakout product, was designed for what today is known as cloud computing, Kagan says.\n\n\t\u201cWe took the goodies of InfiniBand and bolted them on top of the standard Ethernet,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a result, we became the vendor of the most advanced network for high-performance computing. More than half the machines at the top 500 computer companies use the Mellanox interconnect, now the Nvidia interconnect.\n\n\t\u201cMost of the cloud providers, such as \n\tFacebook, Azure, and Alibaba, use Nvidia\u2019s networking and compute technologies. No matter what you do on the Internet, you\u2019re most likely running through the chip that we designed.\u201d\n\n\tKagan says the partnership between Mellanox and Nvidia was \u201cnatural,\u201d as the two companies had been doing business together for nearly a decade.\n\n\t\u201cWe delivered quite a few innovative solutions as independent companies,\u201d he says.\nOne of Kagan\u2019s key priorities is Nvidia\u2019s Bluefield DPU. The data center infrastructure on a chip offloads, accelerates, and isolates a variety of networking, storage, and security services.NvidiaBlueField and Omniverse supercomputers\n\tAs CTO of Nvidia for the past two years, Kagan has shifted his focus from pure networking to the integration of multiple Nvidia technologies including building \n\tBlueField data-processing units and the Omniverse real-time graphics collaboration platform.\n\n\tHe says Nvidia\u2019s vision for the data center of the future is based on its three chips: CPU, DPU, and GPU.\n\n\t\u201cThese three pillars are connected with a very efficient and high-performance network that was originally developed at Mellanox and is being further developed at Nvidia,\u201d he says.\n\n\tDevelopment of the BlueField DPUs is now a key priority for Nvidia. It is a data center infrastructure on a chip, optimized for high-performance computing. It also offloads, accelerates, and isolates a variety of networking, storage, and security services.\n\n\t\u201cIn the data center, you have no control over who your clients are,\u201d Kagan says. \u201cIt may very well happen that a client is a bad guy who wants to penetrate his neighbors\u2019 or your infrastructure. You\u2019re better off isolating yourself and other customers from each other by having a segregated or different computing platform run the operating system, which is basically the infrastructure management, the resource management, and the provisioning.\u201d\n\n\tKagan is particularly excited about the Omniverse, a new Nvidia product that uses \n\tPixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description software for creating virtual worlds\u2014what has become known as the metaverse. Kagan describes the 3D platform as \u201ccreating a world by collecting data and making a physically accurate simulation of the world.\u201d\n\n\tCar manufacturers are using the Omniverse to test-drive autonomous vehicles. Instead of physically driving a car on different types of roads under various conditions, data about the virtual world can be generated to train the AI models.\n\n\t\u201cYou can create situations that the car has to handle in the real world but that you don\u2019t want it to meet in the real world, like a car crash,\u201d Kagan says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to crash the car to train the model, but you do need to have the model be able to handle hazardous conditions on the road.\u201d\nAccess to IEEE Information\n\tKagan joined IEEE in 1997. He says membership gives him access to information about technical topics that would otherwise be challenging to obtain.\n\t\n\t\u201cI enjoy this type of federated learning and being exposed to new things,\u201d he says.\n\t\n\tHe adds that he likes connecting with members who are working on similar projects, because he always learns something new.\n\t\n\t\u201cBeing connected to these people from more diverse communities helps a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cIt inspires you to do your job in a different way.\u201d\n\t\n\tThe Omniverse platform can generate millions of kilometers of synthetic driving data in orders of magnitude faster than actually driving the car.\n\n\tNvidia is investing heavily in technology for self-driving cars, Kagan says.\n\n\tThe company is also building what it calls the most powerful AI supercomputer for climate science: \n\tEarth-2, a digital twin of the planet. Earth-2 is designed to continuously run models to predict climate and weather events at both the regional and global levels.\n\n\tKagan says the climate modeling technology will enable people to try mitigation techniques for global warming and see what their impact is likely to be in 50 years.\n\n\tThe company is also working closely with the health care industry to develop AI-based technologies. Its supercomputers are helping to identify cancer by generating synthetic data to enable researchers to train their models to better identify tumors. Its AI and accelerated computing products also assist with drug discovery and genome research, Kagan says.\n\n\t\u201cWe are actually moving forward at a fairly nice pace,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the thing is that you always need to reinvent yourself and do the new thing faster and better, and basically win with what you have and not look for infinite resources. This is what commitment means.\u201d\nThis article has been updated from an earlier version.This article appears in the March 2023 print issue as \u201cMichael Kagan on the Future of High-Performance Computing.\u201dFrom Your Site ArticlesNvidia's Next GPU Shows That Transformers Are Transforming AI ... \u203aCan Earth's Digital Twins Help Us Navigate the Climate Crisis ... \u203aHow Researchers Use Nvidia's GPUs To Simulate Qubits - IEEE Spectrum \u203aRelated Articles Around the WebMetaverse: 'Train your robots in the virtual world' (CXOTalk interview ... \u203aNVIDIA Data Center Grooves to Tune of Millionfold Speedups ... \u203aNVIDIA Earth-2: Leveraging The Omniverse To Help Understand Climate Change \u203aieee member newsomniversecpunvidiametaversetelecommunicationsintelgputype:tiKathy PretzKathy Pretz is editor in chief for The Institute, which covers all aspects of IEEE, its members, and the technology they're involved in.

Plus, popular streamer WATCHHOLLIE shares how she uses OBS and a GeForce RTX 3080 GPU in a single-PC setup to elevate her livestreams.\nThe OBS release, available starting later today, offers livestreamers new features, including native integration of the AI-powered NVIDIA Broadcast virtual background and room echo removal effects, along with support for high-efficiency video coding (HEVC or H.265) and high-dynamic range (HDR).\nNVIDIA also worked with Google to enable live streaming of HEVC and HDR content to YouTube using the NVIDIA Encoder (NVENC) \u2014 dedicated hardware on GeForce RTX GPUs that handles video encoding without taking resources away from the game.\nOBS Bliss\nOBS 28.0 has launched with a host of updates and improvements \u2014 including two NVIDIA Broadcast features exclusive to GeForce RTX streamers.\n\nAI-powered virtual background enables streamers to remove or replace their backgrounds without the need for a physical green screen. Room echo removal eliminates unwanted echoes during streaming sessions. This can come handy when using a desktop mic or if in a room with a bit of echo. Both effects \u2014 as well as noise removal \u2014 are available within OBS as filters, giving users more flexibility to apply them per source.\nHEVC support in OBS 28.0 improves video compression by 15%. The implementation, built specifically for hardware-based HEVC encoders, enables users to record content and stream to supported platforms like YouTube with better quality.\nEncoder quality average on 200+ sequences of 1080p videos.\nThe update also enables recording and streaming in HDR, which offers a greater range of bright and dark colors on a display, adding a stunning vibrance and dramatic improvement in visual quality.\nGamers can now livestream with vibrant HDR colors in titles like Marvel\u2019s \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy.\u201d\nPreviously, users had to turn HDR off, since 10- or 12-bit HDR content would look washed out if it was recorded at 8-bit. With this update, users can keep HDR on and decide whether they want to capture or stream in SDR, or full HDR.\nAs HDR displays become more popular, and with Windows 11\u2019s new Auto HDR tool \u2014 which enables many games to be displayed in a virtual HDR mode \u2014 more users can benefit from this OBS update.\nTurn on HDR in Windows 11 to simultaneously game and stream in amazing visual fidelity.\nYouTube Live is one of the first platforms to support HEVC and HDR streaming. Streamers on the platform can give their audience higher quality streams, with only a few clicks.\nSetup is quick and easy. Open this NVENC OBS guide and navigate to the \u201cRecording and Streaming with HEVC and HDR\u201d section to find directions.\nGo Live With WATCHHOLLIE\nWhen WATCHHOLLIE started her channel, she had to learn a whole new way of creating content. Now, she\u2019s teaching the next generation of streamers and showcasing how NVIDIA broadcasting tech helps her workflow.\n\nTrained as a video editor, WATCHHOLLIE experimented with a YouTube channel before discovering Twitch as a way to get back into gaming. During the pandemic, Hollie used streaming as a way to stay in touch with friends.\n\u201cI was trapped in an 800-square-foot apartment, and I wanted to hang out with friends,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I started streaming every day.\u201d\nHer streams promote mental health awareness and inclusivity, establishing a safe place for members of the LGBTQ+ community like herself.\nHollie\u2019s first streams were simple, using OBS on a Mac with an external capture card to share console gameplay.\n\u201cI thought, \u2018I hope someone shows up,\u2019 and few people did,\u201d she said.\nShe kept at it between video-editing freelance work, asking friends to tune into her streams and provide advice.\nTo support her daily streaming schedule, Hollie built her first PC \u2014 initially with a GeForce RTX 2070 GPU and later upgrading to a GeForce RTX 3080 GPU. GeForce GPUs include NVENC as a discrete encoder that enables seamless gaming and streaming with maximum performance, even on a single-PC setup like WATCHOLLIE\u2019s. NVENC\u2019s advanced GPU encoding adds higher video quality for recorded videos, as well.\nStreamer WATCHHOLLIE.\nSoon, Hollie\u2019s channel reached Affiliate status, which opened up monetization opportunities. She began accepting fewer freelance-editing gigs, and even turned down a full-time job offer. \u201cI asked my mom what I should do, and she said, \u2018This is your chance, you should take it,\u2019\u201d WATCHHOLLIE said.\nSince achieving Partner status, she\u2019s worked on her channel full time. \u201cI\u2019m very happy, and I feel like I\u2019m making a difference with how I stream,\u201d she said.\nWATCHHOLLIE\u2019s now turned her attention to helping new streamers get started. She founded WatchUs, a diversity-focused team that teaches aspiring creators how to grow their business, develop brand partnerships and improve their streaming setup.\n\u201cWith WatchUs, I can help people and guide them through something that I didn\u2019t have or was too scared to ask about,\u201d she said.\nMore than 20 streamers were selected to join the team from 200+ applicants. They receive mentorship from coaches from all walks of life, about every facet of streaming. The group focuses on \u201ceducation, not ego,\u201d in WATCHHOLLIE\u2019s words, and the team plans to reopen applications soon.\nWhen asked what it takes to be a successful streamer, Hollie didn\u2019t hesitate to answer: \u201cStick to a schedule and play what you love. Don\u2019t wait for people to talk to you to be entertaining \u2014 be the entertainment first, and then people will want to talk to you.\u201d\nFollow and subscribe to WATCHHOLLIE\u2019s social media channels.\nStep Into the NVIDIA Studio\nJust as WATCHHOLLIE has grown in her creative journey, the NVIDIA Studio team wants to see all artists\u2019 personal growth. Amaze, or be amazed, as creatives share old and new works for the #CreatorJourneyChallenge across social media.

Once you have that, you have the snowball kind of effect.\u201d\n\n\nExplainer: what is IFC?\nIndustry Foundation Classes (IFC) is the data model specification designed to enable interoperability in the AEC industry. To learn more, read this AEC Special report.\n\n\nNvidia is also looking to extend USD to better support digital twins. The company is working on real-time streaming of IoT data so digital twins can be better synchronised to the physical world. Meanwhile, support for geospatial coordinates will enable city-scale and planetary-scale digital twins, says Nvidia.\nMeanwhile, to help extend the reach of Omniverse itself, Nvidia has expanded its range of Omniverse Connectors, a collection of USD-based plug-ins that connect 3D authoring tools to the Omniverse platform.\nNewly available in beta are Connectors for PTC Creo, Visual Components and SideFX Houdini. Nvidia has also announced the ongoing development of Connectors for Blender, Autodesk Alias and Autodesk Civil 3D, Siemens JT, SimScale, and Open Geospatial Consortium.\nFinally, Nvidia has made MDL, the material standard for physically accurate representation of 3D materials, \u2018fully open sourced\u2019. According to Nvidia, this means developers will now be able to bring support of MDL to any renderer or graphics APIs like OpenGL and Vulkan.\n\nWhat AEC Magazine thinks\nNvidia Omniverse is currently very focused on visualization. It\u2019s a powerful way to connect geometry and materials from disparate 3D authoring tools, but lacks the structured data that is so important for true BIM workflows.\nEncoding the IFC schema into USD could completely change the role Omniverse plays in AEC. At the moment, it\u2019s used predominantly for conceptual design, but bringing IFC into the fold \u2013 and the important underlying data that forms the leading open standard for BIM \u2013 Nvidia could carve out a more important role for Omniverse in detailed design authoring and even operations. What\u2019s more, with Nvidia currently working on real-time streaming of IoT data into Omniverse, all of this broadens the scope for creating true digital twins on Nvidia\u2019s continually evolving platform.\nRelated articles:Cesium for Unreal - geospatial content inside real-time engineNEWS: New look Revizto 3.0 unveiledAutodesk launches Construction CloudGraitec releases Opentree 2023NBS launches cloud-based collaborative specification platformCintoo Metaverse launches for immersive realityAllplan enhances viz workflow with LumionGraphisoft launches Archicad Studio for solo practitioners\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPrevious Post \n\nNext Post \n\n\n\nLeave a comment Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStay informed\nJoin the AEC community\nNewsletter \u2022 FREE digital magazine \u2022 print magazine\nGo\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLatest content \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAI and the future of arch viz\n\nFebruary 21, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWorkstation Special Report \u2013 Winter 2025\n\nFebruary 9, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMotif to take on Revit: exclusive interview\n\nFebruary 7, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAllplan acquires Manufacton to boost offsite\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nD5 Render 2.10 introduces real-time path tracing\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \u00a9 2008 - 2024 X3DMedia\r\n19 Leyden Street, London, E1 7LE, UK\r\nTel: +44(0)20 3355 7310                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Cookie Consent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.

Running thousands of NVIDIA GPUs on clusters of OCI bare metal compute instances and taking advantage of OCI\u2019s network bandwidth, Adept can train large-scale AI and ML models faster and more economically than before. As a result, Adept has been able to rapidly advance its general intelligence roadmap and develop its first product\u2014a rich language interface for the tools knowledge workers use every day to be productive and creative.\n\u00a0\nA Highly Scalable, Performant, and Cost-Effective Platform for AI Innovation\nWith OCI as its preferred cloud platform, Adept obtains the scale and high performance necessary to run massive AI models without excessive compute costs. This has enabled Adept to develop a highly flexible and dynamic natural-language interface for all software that significantly streamlines the tasks knowledge workers execute daily. As a result, users can ask their computer to perform tedious, difficult, or abstract functions, as well as use the interface to test creative ideas.\nTo fully support Adept with the compute capacity it required, Oracle and NVIDIA customized their offerings to ensure Adept had access to thousands of NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs needed to train its complex models. Adept, which recently closed a $65 million funding round, is training a giant AI model on OCI using NVIDIA\u2019s most powerful A100 GPUs connected with best-of-breed RoCE network powered by NVIDIA (NICs).\n\u201cAI continues to rapidly grow in scope but until now, AI models could only read and write text and images; they couldn\u2019t actually execute actions such as designing 3D parts or fetching and analyzing data,\u201d said David Luan, chief executive officer, Adept. \u201cWith the scalability and computing power of OCI and NVIDIA technology, we are training a neural network to use every software application, website, and API in existence\u2014building on the capabilities that software makers have already created. The universal AI teammate gives employees an \u2018extra set of hands\u2019 to create as fast as they think and reduce time spent on manual tasks. This in turn will help their organizations become more productive, and nimble in their decision making.\u201d\n\u201cAdept has exciting, bold ambitions for the future of AI, and we\u2019re honored that the company\u2019s team of AI and ML trailblazers recognized OCI\u2019s ability to support highly innovative and compute-heavy projects like Adept\u2019s universal AI assistant,\u201d said Karan Batta, vice president, product management, OCI. \u201cWith the combined computing power of OCI and NVIDIA, innovators like Adept are poised to unleash the full potential of AI as a technology that can transform how work is done and make every knowledge worker in the world much more productive.\u201d\n\u201cWith brilliant minds from DeepMind, OpenAI, and other AI and ML pioneers, Adept is building the next generation of user interfaces for software applications,\u201d said Kari Briski, vice president, AI and high-performance computing (HPC) software development kits, NVIDIA. \u201cBy working with Oracle to provide Adept with an industry-leading GPU engine and a wide range of AI and ML software tools, we\u2019re making innovative AI systems possible.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOCI Powers Next-Generation AI Models\nOCI\u2019s bare metal NVIDIA GPU instances offer startups like Adept an HPC platform for applications that rely on machine learning, image processing, and massively parallel HPC jobs. In addition, HPC on OCI provides the elasticity and consumption-based costs of the cloud, offering on-demand potential to scale tens of thousands of cores simultaneously. As a result, with HPC on OCI, customers like Adept gain access to powerful processors, fast and dense local storage, high-throughput ultra-low-latency RDMA cluster networks, and the tools to automate and run jobs seamlessly.\n\u00a0\nAdditional Resources\n\nLearn more about OCI\u2019s NVIDIA GPU-powered offerings for AI innovators\nLearn more about Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\nGet started with the OCI Cloud Adoption Framework\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrew Smith\nOracle\ndrew.j.smith@oracle.com\n415.336.1103\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Oracle\nOracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud.

Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeSean Hollister is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.PC sales abruptly tanked this quarter, so Nvidia, like Intel, is suddenly under the gun. What are you going to do about the billions of dollars of growth that just went up in smoke, investors tend to ask! But while that\u2019s an annoying situation for Nvidia during today\u2019s Q2 earnings, it\u2019s an intriguing one for gamers like you and me \u2014 because Nvidia tried to placate those investors by revealing that exciting things may be on the way.First: discounts! Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed what we\u2019ve suspected for months: Nvidia actually built too many gaming GPUs and is now being forced to sell them for less money. \u201cWe found ourselves with excess inventory,\u201d says Huang. \u201cOur strategy is to sell-in well below the current sell-through levels in the marketplace to give the channel an opportunity to correct.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve implemented programs with our partners to price-position the product in the channel in preparation for our next generation,\u201d he also said on the call.Here\u2019s what that sounds like to me: In order to sell as many RTX 3000 graphics cards and chips as it can before the RTX 4000 series begins to arrive this fall, it\u2019s cutting prices \u2014 to distributors anyhow.RelatedThe GPU shortage is overThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019ll see a too-good-to-be-true price on a graphics card or gaming laptop right away, because the final price is up to partners and retailers \u2014 but those parties have their own incentives to clear shelves, even if they disguise them as sales rather than across-the-board price cuts. Either way, the trend we\u2019re seeing is absolutely down, with some cards once again appearing at MSRP after years of commanding 2-3x their price on eBay.Nvidia is also trying to signal that the current-gen Ampere GPUs will live alongside next-gen ones \u2014 Huang says current-gen GPUs will \u201cbe layered on top\u201d of the \u201cexciting next generation\u201d of chips. He also hinted that there might be a place for extra GPUs in cloud data centers: \u201cwe hear quite broadly that GPU supply is in shortage in the cloud.\u201d So Nvidia may have other options than simply clearing inventory of its GPUs by pricing them low.Second, CFO Collette Kress intriguingly suggested that Nvidia may have something entirely different up its sleeves to improve its gaming revenue. Nvidia has \u201ca new segment of the market that we plan to reach with our gaming technology,\u201d she said on the call.Your guess is as good as mine. My mind immediately goes to how AMD seems to uniquely be powering a new generation of high-performance handheld gaming PCs, years after Nvidia mostly gave up on that idea (though it did become the Nintendo Switch). But that might be because the last post I wrote for The Verge was about one of those handheld consoles. It could just as easily be a gaming-focused take on the metaverse, for all I know.Nvidia repeatedly insisted during today\u2019s Q2 2022 earnings call that gaming demand hasn\u2019t actually fallen off a cliff despite the sudden drop in revenue, pointing out that GeForce sell-through is still up 70 percent since before the pandemic.See More: EntertainmentGamingNewsPC GamingTechMost PopularMost PopularAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsLeaked Apple meeting shows how dire the Siri situation really isThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

And the problem gets harder when multiple objects and characters need to interact in a virtual world. Simulating physics becomes just as important as simulating light. A robot in a virtual factory, for example, needs to have not only the same look, but also the same weight capacity and braking capability as its physical counterpart.\nIt\u2019s hard. But the opportunities are huge, affecting trillion-dollar industries as varied as transportation, healthcare, telecommunications and entertainment, in addition to product design. Ultimately, more content will be created in the virtual world than in the physical one.\nTo simplify and shorten this process, NVIDIA today released new research and a broad suite of tools that apply the power of neural graphics to the creation and animation of 3D objects and worlds.\nThese SDKs \u2014 including NeuralVDB, a ground-breaking update to industry standard OpenVDB, and Kaolin Wisp, a PyTorch library establishing a framework for neural fields research \u2014 ease the creative process for designers while making it easy for millions of users who aren\u2019t design professionals to create 3D content.\nNeural graphics is a new field intertwining AI and graphics to create an accelerated graphics pipeline that learns from data. Integrating AI enhances results, helps automate design choices and provides new, yet to be imagined opportunities for artists and creators. Neural graphics will redefine how virtual worlds are created, simulated and experienced by users.\nThese SDKs and research contribute to each stage of the content creation pipeline, including:\n\n3D Content Creation\n\nKaolin Wisp \u2013 an addition to Kaolin, a PyTorch library enabling faster 3D deep learning research by reducing the time needed to test and implement new techniques from weeks to days. Kaolin Wisp is a research-oriented library for neural fields, establishing a common suite of tools and a framework to accelerate new research in neural fields.\nInstant Neural Graphics Primitives \u2013 a new approach to capturing the shape of real-world objects, and the inspiration behind NVIDIA Instant NeRF, an inverse rendering model that turns a collection of still images into a digital 3D scene. This technique and associated GitHub code accelerate the process by up to 1,000x.\n3D MoMa \u2013 a new inverse rendering pipeline that allows users to quickly import a 2D object into a graphics engine to create a 3D object that can be modified with realistic materials, lighting and physics.\nGauGAN360 \u2013 the next evolution of NVIDIA GauGAN, an AI model that turns rough doodles into photorealistic masterpieces. GauGAN360 generates 8K, 360-degree panoramas that can be ported into Omniverse scenes.\nOmniverse Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) \u2013 a new collection of cloud APIs, microservices and tools to create, customize and deploy digital human applications. ACE is built on NVIDIA\u2019s Unified Compute Framework, allowing developers to seamlessly integrate core NVIDIA AI technologies into their avatar applications.\n\nPhysics and Animation\n\nNeuralVDB \u2013 a groundbreaking improvement on OpenVDB, the current industry standard for volumetric data storage. Using machine learning, NeuralVDB introduces compact neural representations, dramatically reducing memory footprint to allow for higher-resolution 3D data.\nOmniverse Audio2Face \u2013 an AI technology that generates expressive facial animation from a single audio source. It\u2019s useful for interactive real-time applications and as a traditional facial animation authoring tool.\nASE: Animation Skills Embedding \u2013 an approach enabling physically simulated characters to act in a more responsive and life-like manner in unfamiliar situations. It uses deep learning to teach characters how to respond to new tasks and actions.\nTAO Toolkit \u2013 a framework to enable users to create an accurate, high-performance pose estimation model, which can evaluate what a person might be doing in a scene using computer vision much more quickly than current methods.\n\nExperience\n\nImage Features Eye Tracking \u2013 a research model linking the quality of pixel rendering to a user\u2019s reaction time. By predicting the best combination of rendering quality, display properties and viewing conditions for the least latency, It will allow for better performance in fast-paced, interactive computer graphics applications such as competitive gaming.\nHolographic Glasses for Virtual Reality \u2013 a collaboration with Stanford University on a new VR glasses design that delivers full-color 3D holographic images in a groundbreaking 2.5-mm-thick optical stack.\n\nJoin NVIDIA at SIGGRAPH to see more of the latest research and technology breakthroughs in graphics, AI and virtual worlds.

I guess because I always like to think of my PC as a complete unit. I mean, my PC is a total unit as it's jammed right into my chonky desk and therefore built like a tank on legs, but to me it's a single device with a bunch of discrete parts inside it to make up the whole.To Nvidia, however, \"GeForce is essentially a game console inside your PC.\" At least that's how CEO, Jen-Hsun Huang sees it.\u00a0That's fine on the one hand, where it sees its own product as the most important piece of the gaming PC puzzle, and the component which has the most bearing on just how slick a gaming experience you're going to get. But where I feel uncomfortable is when Huang is talking about the fact that Nvidia's targets are for the average price of a GeForce graphics card to be the same as a current gen games console.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nAmidst a barren GPU market and talk of 'supply constraints', Nvidia's end-of-year earnings call gives a glimmer of hope for RTX 50-series graphics card stocks this quarter\n\n\n\n\nI'm as excited as the next guy for AMD's 9070-series launch but the lack of reference cards has me worried about how real its MSRP will be\n\n\n\n\"We\u2019ve always believed that the ASP of GeForce should drift towards the average selling price of a game console,\" says Huang in the recent Q2 2023 earnings call. \"And so it should be something along the lines of $500 or so roughly at this time.\"If people are willing to spend that much on an Xbox then surely they'll pay that for a single graphics card to stick into their PC? I guess that's the theory, and honestly, he's probably right\u2014if the past couple of years have taught us anything it's that people are prepared to pay a ridiculous amount of money for a GPU if they really want it.\u00a0But if we're looking at the mainstream, biggest selling graphics cards, I don't want them to be priced at a level where they can't compete with Microsoft or Sony's game boxes. But pricing is going that way, though fingers crossed when Nvidia unveils the RTX 40-series GPUs there will eventually be some worthwhile ~$300 cards that offer more than the previous generation.Screen queens(Image credit: Future)Best gaming monitor: Pixel-perfect panels for your PC\nBest high refresh rate monitor: Screaming quick screens\nBest 4K monitor for gaming: When only high-res will do\nBest 4K TV for gaming: Big-screen 4K PC gamingTo be completely fair to Jen-Hsun, the above quote is in reference to a question on whether the average selling price (ASP) across the Nvidia GeForce GPU stack would remain the same as it has over the last couple of years, or whether it would go down \"because of the absence of that crypto tightening dynamic?\"The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\"I would say that without crypto dynamic,\" responds Huang, \"the mix would go down. However, the overall trend long term, the ASP is drifting up.\"That's when he goes on to say Nvidia's always felt it should stick its ASP at the same level as a whole games console. With console prices rising on the whole, and Sony just now announcing a spike in the cost of its PlayStation 5, Jen-Hsun's only going to be focusing on an ever rising target price.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nXbox\nNvidia\n\n\nDave JamesSocial Links NavigationEditor-in-Chief, HardwareDave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the Colecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!).

Now, it\u2019s simulating operations in the metaverse with Omniverse.\t\t\t\n\n\nAugust 16, 2022 by Rick Merritt \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  In the fast-paced field of making the world\u2019s tech devices, Pegatron Corp. initially harnessed AI to gain an edge. Now, it\u2019s on the cusp of creating digital twins to further streamline its efficiency.\nWhether or not they\u2019re familiar with the name, most people have probably used smartphones, tablets, Wi-Fi routers or other products that Taiwan-based Pegatron makes in nearly a dozen factories across seven countries. Last year, it made more than 10 million notebook computers.\nAndrew Hsiao, associate vice president of Pegatron\u2019s software R&D division, is leading the company\u2019s move into machine learning and the 3D internet known as the metaverse.\nBuilding an AI Platform\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been collecting factory data since 2012 to find patterns and insights that enhance operations,\u201d said Hsiao, a veteran tech manager who\u2019s been with the company for 14 years, since it spun out of ASUS, one of the world\u2019s largest PC makers.\nIn 2016, Pegatron\u2019s COO, Denese Yao, launched a task force to apply new technology to improve operations. Hsiao\u2019s team of AI experts collaborated with factory workers to find use cases for AI. One of their first pilot projects used deep learning to detect anomalies in products as they came down the line.\nIt got solid results using modified versions of neural network models like ResNet, so they stepped on the gas.\nToday, Pegatron uses Cambrian, an AI platform it built for automated inspection, deployed in most of its factories. It maintains hundreds of AI models, trained and running in production on NVIDIA GPUs.\nFewer Defects, More Consistency\nThe new platform catches up to 60% more defects with 30% fewer variations than human inspectors, and factory employees appreciate it.\n\u201cManual inspection is a boring, repetitive job, so it\u2019s not surprising employees don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re seeing employees motivated to learn about the new technology, so it\u2019s empowering people to do more value-added work.\u201d\nThe system may also improve throughput as factories adjust workflows on assembly and packing stations to account for faster inspection lines.\nModels Deployed 50x Faster\nPegatron\u2019s system uses NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs to deploy AI models up to 50x faster than when it trained them on workstations, cutting weeks of work down to a few hours.\n\u201cWith our unified platform based on DGX, we have our data lake, datasets and training all in one place, so we can deploy a model in one click,\u201d Hsiao said.\nUsing the Multi-Instance GPU capability in A100 GPUs, Pegatron cut developers\u2019 wait time for access to an accelerator from nearly an hour to 30 seconds. \u201cThat lets us dynamically schedule jobs like AI inference and lightweight model training,\u201d he said.\nAs part of its AI inference work, the system analyzes more than 10 million images a day using NVIDIA A40 and other GPUs.\nTriton, NGC Simplify AI Jobs\nPegatron uses NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, open-source software that helps deploy, run and scale AI models across all types of processors, and frameworks. It works hand-in-hand with NVIDIA TensorRT, software that simplifies neural networks to reduce latency.\n\u201cTriton and TensorRT make it easy to serve multiple clients and convert jobs to the most cost-effective precision levels,\u201d he said.\nHsiao\u2019s team optimizes pretrained AI models it downloads in integrated Kubernetes containers from the NVIDIA NGC hub for GPU-optimized software.\n\u201cNGC is very helpful because we get with one click the deep learning frameworks and all the other software components we need, stuff that used to take us a lot of time to pull together,\u201d he said.\nNext Step: Digital Twins\nTaking another step in smarter manufacturing, Pegatron is piloting NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for developing digital twins\nIt has two use cases so far. First, testing Omniverse Replicator to generate synthetic data of what products coming down the inspection line might look like under different lighting conditions or orientations. This information will make its perception models smarter.\nSecond, it\u2019s creating digital twins of inspection machines. That lets remote workers manage them remotely, have better insight into predictive maintenance and simulate software updates before deploying them to a physical machine.\n\u201cToday, when a system goes down, we can only check logs that might be incomplete, but with Omniverse, we can replay what happened to understand how to fix it, or, run simulations to predict how it will behave in the future,\u201d he said.\nA Pegatron engineer monitors an inspection machine remotely with Omniverse.\nWhat\u2019s more, industrial engineers who care about throughput, automation engineers responsible for downtime, and equipment engineers who handle maintenance can work together on the same virtual system at the same time, even when logging in from different countries.\nVision of a Virtual Factory\nIf all goes well, Pegatron could have Omniverse available on its inspection machines before the end of the year.\nMeanwhile, Hsiao is looking for partners who can help build virtual versions of a whole production line in Omniverse. Longer term, his vision is to create a digital twin of an entire factory.\n\u201cIn my opinion, the greatest impact will come from building a full virtual factory so we can try out things like new ways to route products through the plant,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you just build it out without a simulation first, your mistakes are very costly.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | Digital Twin | Industrial and Manufacturing | Machine Learning | Metaverse | NGC | NVIDIA Triton | Omniverse | Open Source | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

NVIDIA is helping one such company enhance its capabilities in virtual production with RTX technology and real-time rendering.\nVersatile Media is an international media company, with global headquarters in Hangzhou, China and its North American arm in Vancouver, Canada. The company is building a new film studio in South Burnaby, a suburb of Vancouver that\u2019s home to renowned soundstage studios.\nThe new studio will total 44,000 square feet and include multiple soundstages that are 40 feet high. It will also house Versatile\u2019s first permanent virtual production LED volume in Canada, which is promised to be one of the largest feature-rich LED stages in North America.\nLED volumes are 3D stages that use LED panels as walls, floors or ceilings to quickly surround the cast and crew with projected and immersive background scenery. Versatile Media\u2019s LED volume will have content created and rendered in Unreal Engine, and the display systems will be powered by NVIDIA RTX A6000 graphics.\nWith NVIDIA RTX technology behind their real-time graphics and virtual sets, the team at Versatile Media can accelerate their creative workflows and enhance virtual productions for upcoming projects in the studio.\nAll images courtesy of Versatile Media.\nRTX Technology Behind the Screens\nTo bring a movie or TV show to life, the traditional creative process consists of three phases: pre-production, production and post-production. With the latest technologies, studios and creatives can merge those three phases into one: virtual production.\nIn fact, Versatile\u2019s latest project was created specifically to highlight its commitment to the script-to-screen virtual production workflow. New Air, a sci-fi short, was produced in 10 days, with four of those days in principal photography on the LED stages. The production used over 60 NVIDIA GPUs to keep up with the filming requirements.\nVersatile Media is bringing innovation to virtual production with its new purpose-built LED panels, as well as full lighting and color-grading controls across the entire volume. The team is also using intelligent focus-pulling, which provides physically accurate lensing between the physical and virtual worlds.\nFilming \u201cNew Air\u201d on Versatile Media\u2019s Virtual Production stage.\nIts Vancouver LED volume will consist of 12,000 LED panels, creating a 270-degree cylindrical volume that spans nearly 85 feet of diameter, with a connected, flat, 34-foot-high ceiling.\nAnd with NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs powering and synchronizing the graphics and displays, Versatile Media experiences many benefits, including:\n\nreal-time rendering and physically based simulation\nlarge GPU memory and bandwidth to support real-time rendering, even with massive datasets with complex geometry and high-resolution textures\nsynchronization across multiple cluster nodes running VX rDisplay, Versatile\u2019s custom cluster communication and synchronization tool. This avoids tearing between LED seams and ensures the camera only captures the correctly rendered frames on the LED wall.\nand, an enhanced workflow with a virtual art department (VAD), which optimizes creativity, time and efficiency by enabling remote production and collaboration with the artists on set.\n\nUsing NVIDIA RTX, teams can film, composite and render high-quality visuals in-camera in real time, rather than waiting months for a post-production crew to render and composite the results. The new stage will enable Versatile to provide full-cycle, virtual-production pipeline services, including virtual location scouting, pre-visualization, techviz and a VAD.\n\nVirtual Production Innovations Continue\nVersatile Media is expanding globally to include a 12-acre film base near Hangzhou, China, that will house five LED stages in addition to performance stages and an R&D center.\nThe company collaborated with Absen to create two custom LED panels that can support filming up to 120 frames per second, as well as multiple cameras filming with 8K in-camera resolution.\nA key innovation of Versatile\u2019s stage tech is to allow for full-resolution, real-time rendering with no latency, bridging seamlessly between the virtual and physical worlds. Versatile\u2019s R&D team further worked to resolve the moir\u00e9 effect completely, allowing the panels to be filmed from any angle while in focus and up to six feet away.\nVersatile is also diving head-first into AI technology with a new facial system that provides photorealistic results. Additionally, the company is developing a real-time system that captures both cloth and muscle movement. Versatile even has a new AI system that will motion capture hands and fingers, which has been notoriously difficult to do in the past.\nLearn more about innovations at Versatile Media by watching the video below:\n\nVirtual production is the way of the future \u2014 learn more about it at SIGGRAPH.\nWatch NVIDIA\u2019s special address at the trade show to see the latest technologies in graphics, AI and virtual worlds.\nLearn more about virtual production workflows and see how technologies like NVIDIA Omniverse, the real-time collaboration and simulation platform, can help teams create at the speed of imagination.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: Media and Entertainment | NVIDIA RTX | Rendering \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Legendary studio Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) is tapping into the power of AI to take its skies to new heights with NVIDIA AI-enabled DeepSearch and Omniverse Enterprise.\nCapturing photorealistic details of a sky can be tricky. At SIGGRAPH today, ILM showcased how its team, with the NVIDIA DeepSearch tool, used natural language to rapidly search through a massive asset library and create a captivating sky dome.\nThe video shows how Omniverse Enterprise can provide filmmakers with the ultimate flexibility to develop the ideal look and lighting to further their stories. This helps artists save time, enhance productivity and accelerate creativity for virtual production.\nAfter narrowing down their search results, the ILM team auditions the remaining sky domes in virtual reality to assess whether the asset will be a perfect match for the shot. By using VR, ILM can approximate what the skies will look like on a virtual production set.\n\nThe Sky\u2019s the Limit With AI\nAn extensive library with thousands of references and 3D assets offers advantages, but it also presents some challenges without an efficient way to search through all the data.\nTypically, users set up folders or tag items with keywords, which can be incredibly time consuming. This is especially true for a studio like ILM, which has over 40 years\u2019 worth of material in its reference library, including photography, matte paintings, backdrops and other materials that have been captured over the decades.\nWith hundreds of thousands of untagged pieces of content, it\u2019s impractical for the ILM team to manually search through them on a production schedule.\nOmniverse DeepSearch, however, lets ILM search intuitively through untagged assets using text or a 2D image. DeepSearch uses AI to categorize and find images automatically \u2014 this results in massive time savings for the creative team, removing the need to manually tag each asset.\nAll images courtesy of Industrial Light & Magic.\n\u201cWith Omniverse DeepSearch, we have the ability to search through data in real time, which is key for production,\u201d said Landis Fields, real time principal creative at ILM. \u201cAnd being able to search through assets with natural language allows for our creative teams to easily find what they\u2019re looking for, helping them achieve the final look and feel of a scene much more efficiently than before.\u201d\nDeepSearch also works on USD files, so the ILM team can review search results and bring images into the 3D space in Omniverse Enterprise. The artists could then interact with the 3D environment using a VR headset.\nWith NVIDIA DeepSearch and Omniverse Enterprise, ILM has the potential to accelerate creative pipelines, lower costs and enhance production workflows to create captivating content for virtual productions.\nJoin NVIDIA at SIGGRAPH to learn more about the latest Omniverse announcements, watch the company\u2019s special address on demand and see the global premiere of NVIDIA\u2019s documentary, The Art of Collaboration: NVIDIA, Omniverse, and GTC, on Wednesday, Aug. 10, at 10 a.m. PT.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Omniverse | Omniverse Enterprise | SIGGRAPH 2022 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

New features and improvements to apps including Create, Machinima, Audio2Face and Nucleus will help 3D artists build virtual worlds, digital twins and avatars for the metaverse.\nEach month, NVIDIA Studio Driver releases provide artists, creators and 3D developers with the best performance and reliability when working with creative applications. Available now, the August NVIDIA Studio Driver gives creators peak reliability for using Omniverse and their favorite creative apps.\nPlus, this week\u2019s featured In the NVIDIA Studio artist, Simon Lavit, exhibits his mastery of Omniverse as the winner of the #MadeInMachinima contest. The 3D artist showcases the creative workflow for his victorious short film, Painting the Astronaut.\nOmniverse Expands\nNVIDIA Omniverse \u2014 an open platform based on Universal Scene Description (USD) for building and connecting virtual worlds \u2014 just received a significant upgrade.\n\nOmniverse Apps \u2014 including Create 2022.2 \u2014 received a major PhysX update with soft-body simulation, particle-cloth simulation and soft-contact models, delivering more realism to physically accurate virtual worlds. Added OmniLive workflows enable artists more freedom through a new collaboration interface for non-destructive USD workflows.\nOmniverse users can now add animations and emotions with the Audio2Face app.\nAudio2Face 2022.1 is now available in beta, including major updates that enable AI-powered emotion control and full facial animation, delivering more realism than ever. Users can now direct emotion over time, as well as mix key emotions like joy, amazement, anger and sadness. The AI can also direct eye, teeth and tongue motion, in addition to the avatar\u2019s skin, providing an even more complete facial-animation solution.\n\nLearn additional details on these updates and more.\nWinning the #MadeInMachinima Contest\nSince he first held a pen, Simon Lavit has been an artist. Now, Lavit adds Omniverse Machinima to the list of creative tools he\u2019s mastered, as the winner of the #MadeInMachinima contest.\nHis entry, Painting the Astronaut, was selected by an esteemed panel of judges that included numerous creative experts.\nPowered by a GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, Lavit\u2019s creative workflow showcases the breadth and interoperability of Omniverse, its Apps and Connectors. He used lighting and scene setting to establish the short film\u2019s changing mood, helping audiences understand the story\u2019s progression. Its introduction, for example, is bright and clear. The film then gets darker, conveying the idea of the unknown as the character starts his journey.\nThe lighting for \u201cPainting the Astronaut\u201d helps guide the story, with 3D assets from the Omniverse library.\nLavit storyboarded on paper before starting his digital process with the Machinima and Omniverse Create apps. He quickly turned to NVIDIA\u2019s built-in 3D asset library, filled with free content from Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord, Mechwarrior 5: Mercenaries, Squad and more \u2013 to populate the scene.\nThe 3D model for the spaceship was created in Autodesk Maya within Omniverse.\nThen, Lavit used Autodesk Maya to create 3D models for some of his hero assets \u2014 like the protagonist Sol\u2019s spaceship. The Maya Omniverse Connector allowed him to visualize scenes within Omniverse Create. He also benefited from RTX-accelerated ray tracing and AI denoising in Maya, resulting in highly interactive and photorealistic renders.\nNext, Lavit textured the models in Adobe Substance 3D, which also has an Omniverse Connector. Substance 3D uses NVIDIA Iray rendering, including for textures and substances. It also features RTX-accelerated light- and ambient-occlusion baking, which optimizes assets in seconds.\n\nLavit then returned to Machinima for final layout, animation and render. The result was composited using Adobe After Effects, with an extra layer of effects and music. What turned into the contest-winning piece of art ultimately was \u201ca pretty simple workflow to keep the complexity to a minimum,\u201d Lavit said.\n\u201dPainting the Astronaut\u201d netted Lavit a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti-powered ASUS ProArt StudioBook 16.\nTo power his future creativity from anywhere, Lavit won an ASUS ProArt StudioBook 16. This NVIDIA Studio laptop packs top-of-the-line technology into a device that enables users to work on the go with world-class power from a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU and beautiful 4K display.\n3D Artist and Omniverse #MadeInMachinima contest winner Simon Lavit.\nLavit, born in France and now based in the U.S., sees every project as an adventure. Living in a different country from where he was born changed his vision of art, he said. Lavit regularly finds inspiration from the French graphic novel series, The Incal, which is written by Alejandro Jodorowsky and illustrated by renowned cartoonist Jean Giraud, aka M\u0153bius.\nMade the Grade\nThe next generation of creative professionals is heading back to campus. Choosing the right NVIDIA Studio laptop can be tricky, but students can use this guide to find the perfect tool to power their creativity \u2014 like the Lenovo Slim 7i Pro X, an NVIDIA Studio laptop now available with a GeForce RTX 3050 Laptop GPU.\nWhile the #MadeInMachinima contest has wrapped, creators can graduate to an NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU in the #ExtendOmniverse contest, running through Friday, Sept. 9, at 5 p.m. PT. Perform something akin to magic by making your own NVIDIA Omniverse Extension for a chance to win an RTX A6000 or GeForce RTX 3090 Ti GPU. Winners will be announced in September at GTC.\nFollow NVIDIA Omniverse on Instagram, Medium, Twitter and YouTube for additional resources and inspiration.

Around 16,000 of them are run by FamilyMart. Telexistence aims to save time for these stores by offloading repetitive tasks like refilling shelves of beverages to a robot, allowing retail staff to tackle more complex tasks like interacting with customers.\nIt\u2019s just one example of what can be done by Telexistence\u2019s robots, which run on the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI and robotics platform. The company is also developing AI-based systems for warehouse logistics with robots that sort and pick packages.\n\u201cWe want to deploy robots to industries that support humans\u2019 everyday life,\u201d said Jin Tomioka, CEO of Telexistence. \u201cThe first space we\u2019re tackling this is through convenience stores \u2014 a huge network that supports daily life, especially in Japan, but is facing a labor shortage.\u201d\nThe company, founded in 2017, next plans to expand to convenience stores in the U.S., which is also plagued with a labor shortage in the retail industry \u2014 and where more than half of consumers say they visit one of the country\u2019s 150,000 convenience stores at least once a month.\n\nTelexistence Robots Stock Up at FamilyMart\nTelexistence will begin deploying its restocking robots, called TX SCARA, to 300 FamilyMart stores in August \u2014 and aims to bring the autonomous machines to additional FamilyMart locations, as well as other major convenience store chains, in the coming years.\n\u201cStaff members spend a lot of time in the back room of the store, restocking shelves, instead of out with customers,\u201d said Tomioka. \u201cRobotics-as-a-service can allow staff to spend more time with customers.\u201d\nTX SCARA runs on a track and includes multiple cameras to scan each shelf, using AI to\u00a0 identify drinks that are running low and plan a path to restock them. The AI system can successfully restock beverages automatically more than 98% of the time.\nIn the rare cases that the robot misjudges the placement of the beverage or a drink topples over, there\u2019s no need for the retail staff to drop their task to get the robot back up and running. Instead, Telexistence has remote operators on standby, who can quickly address the situation by taking manual control through a VR system that uses NVIDIA GPUs for video streaming.\nTelexistence estimates that a busy convenience store needs to restock more than 1,000 beverages a day. TX SCARA\u2019s cloud system maintains a database of product sales based on the name, date, time and number of items stocked by the robots during operation. This allows the AI to prioritize which items to restock first based on past sales data.\n\nAchieving Edge AI With NVIDIA Jetson\u00a0\nTX SCARA has multiple AI models under the hood. An object-detection model identifies the types of drinks in a store to determine which one belongs on which shelf. It\u2019s combined with another model that helps detect the movement of the robot\u2019s arm, so it can pick up a drink and accurately place it on the shelf between other products. A third is for anomaly detection: recognizing if a drink has fallen over or off the shelf. One more detects which drinks are running low in each display area.\nThe Telexistence team used custom pre-trained neural networks as their base models, adding synthetic and annotated real-world data to fine-tune the neural networks for their application. Using a simulation environment to create more than 80,000 synthetic images helped the team augment their dataset so the robot could learn to detect drinks in any color, texture or lighting environment.\nFor AI model training, the team relied on an NVIDIA DGX Station. The robot itself uses two NVIDIA Jetson embedded modules: the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier for AI processing at the edge, and the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 module to transmit video streaming data.\nOn the software side, the team uses the NVIDIA JetPack SDK for edge AI and the NVIDIA TensorRT SDK for high-performance inference.\n\u201cWithout TensorRT, our models wouldn\u2019t run fast enough to detect objects in the store efficiently,\u201d said Pavel Savkin, chief robotics automation officer at Telexistence.\nTelexistence further optimized its AI models using half-precision (FP16) instead of single-precision floating-point format (FP32).\nLearn more about the latest in AI and robotics at NVIDIA GTC, running online Sept. 19-22.

But this surge has also led fraudsters to use the opportunity to scam retailers and customers, according to David Sutton, director of analytical technology at fintech company Featurespace.\nThe company, headquartered in the U.K., has developed AI-powered technology to increase the speed and accuracy of fraud detection and prevention. Called ARIC Risk Hub, the platform uses deep learning models trained using NVIDIA GPUs to distinguish between valid and fraudulent transactional behavior.\n\u201cOnline transactions are a prime target for criminals, as they don\u2019t need to have the physical card to transact,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cWith compromised card details readily available through the dark web, fraudsters can target large volumes of cards to commit fraud with very little effort.\u201d\nARIC Risk Hub builds complex behavioral profiles of what it calls \u201cgenuine\u201d customers by converging transaction and third-party data from across their lifecycle within a financial institution.\nFraud prevention has traditionally been limited by delays in detection \u2014 with customers being notified only after money had already left their bank accounts. But ARIC Risk Hub in less than 30 milliseconds determines anomalies in even the slightest changes in a customer\u2019s behavior. It compares each financial event of a customer to their profile using AI-powered adaptive behavioral analytics.\nThe technology is deployed across 70 major financial institutions globally \u2014 and some have reported that it\u2019s blocked 75% of its fraud attacks, Sutton said.\nARIC Risk Hub helps these institutions identify criminal behavior in near-real time \u2014 reducing their financial losses and operational costs, and protecting more than 500 million consumers from fraud and financial crime.\nFeaturespace is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a free, global program that nurtures cutting-edge startups.\n100x Model Training Acceleration With NVIDIA GPUs\nFeaturespace got its start over a decade ago as a machine learning consultancy. It was rooted in the research of University of Cambridge professor Bill Fitzgerald, who was looking to make a commercial impact with adaptive behavioral analytics, a technology he created.\nApplied to the financial services industry, the technology quickly took flight.\n\u201cWith this technology, you could build a deep learning model that learns from and understands what sorts of actions a person normally takes so that it can look for changes in those actions,\u201d said Sutton.\nIn the past, it would take weeks for Featurespace to set up and train different deep learning models. With NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, the company has seen up to a 100x speedup in model training, Sutton said.\n\u201cCompared to when we used CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs give us a really quick research-to-impact loop,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s electrifying to work with something that can have an impact that quickly.\u201d\nIn the time that they used to run just 10 trials, Featurespace\u2019s researchers and data scientists can now run thousands of tests, which bolsters the statistical confidence of their results, enabling them to deploy only the best, tried-and-tested models.\nSutton said even a 1% increase in fraud detection discovered using the deep learning model could save large enterprises $20 million a year.\nFeaturespace typically uses recurrent neural-network architectures on data from streams of transactions. This model pipeline allows an individual\u2019s new actions to be assessed via behavioral context learned from their past actions.\nFinancial Fortifications for All\nFeaturespace\u2019s deep learning models have prevented all sorts of fraud, including those that involve credit cards, payments, applications and money laundering.\nThe ARIC Risk Hub interface is customizable, so customers can select the most suitable subset of components for their specific needs. Users can then change analytics settings or review suspicious cases. If upon review a case is deemed to be a false positive, the deep learning model learns from its errors, increasing future accuracy.\nFeaturespace technology has been making a splash for payment processing companies like TSYS and Worldpay \u2014 as well as large banks including Danske Bank, HSBC and NatWest.\nAs Sutton put it, \u201cFeaturespace is using AI to make the world a safer place to transact.\u201d\n\u201cOur work is what brings a lot of people at Featurespace into the office every morning,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re able to reduce the amount of money laundering in the world, for example, you can turn crime into something that doesn\u2019t pay as much, making it a less profitable industry to be in.\u201d\nFeaturespace will host sessions on preventing fraud, money laundering and cryptocrime at Money 20/20, a fintech conference running Oct. 23-26 in Las Vegas.\nRegister free for NVIDIA GTC, running online Sept. 19-22, to learn more about the latest technology breakthroughs for the era of AI and the metaverse.\nSubscribe to NVIDIA financial services news.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Banking | Customer Stories | Financial Services | GPU | Inception \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  3D content creators are clamoring for NVIDIA Instant NeRF, an inverse rendering tool that turns a set of static images into a realistic 3D scene.\nSince its debut earlier this year, tens of thousands of developers around the world have downloaded the source code and used it to render spectacular scenes, sharing eye-catching results on social media.\nThe research behind Instant NeRF is being honored as a best paper at SIGGRAPH \u2014 which runs Aug. 8-11 in Vancouver and online \u2014 for its contribution to the future of computer graphics research. One of just five papers selected for this award, it\u2019s among 17 papers and workshops with NVIDIA authors that are being presented at the conference, covering topics spanning neural rendering, 3D simulation, holography and more.\nNVIDIA recently held an Instant NeRF sweepstakes, asking developers to share 3D scenes created with the software for a chance to win a high-end NVIDIA GPU. Hundreds participated, posting 3D scenes of landmarks like Stonehenge, their backyards and even their pets.\nAmong the creators using Instant NeRF are:\nThrough the Looking Glass: Karen X. Cheng and James Perlman\nSan Francisco-based creative director Karen X. Cheng is working with software engineer James Perlman to render 3D scenes that test the boundaries of what Instant NeRF can create.\nThe duo has used Instant NeRF to create scenes that explore reflections within a mirror (shown above) and handle complex environments with multiple people \u2014 like a group enjoying ramen at a restaurant.\n\u201cThe algorithm itself is groundbreaking \u2014 the fact that you can render a physical scene with higher fidelity than normal photogrammetry techniques is just astounding,\u201d Perlman said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible how accurately you can reconstruct lighting, color differences or other tiny details.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt even makes mistakes look artistic,\u201d said Cheng. \u201cWe really lean into that, and play with training a scene less sometimes, experimenting with 1,000, or 5,000 or 50,000 iterations. Sometimes I\u2019ll prefer the ones trained less because the edges are softer and you get an oil-painting effect.\u201d\nUsing prior tools, it would take them three or four days to train a \u201cdecent-quality\u201d scene. With Instant NeRF, the pair can churn out about 20 a day, using an NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU to render, train and preview their 3D scenes.\nWith rapid rendering comes faster iteration.\n\u201cBeing able to render quickly is very necessary for the creative process. We\u2019d meet up and shoot 15 or 20 different versions, run them overnight and then see what\u2019s working,\u201d said Cheng. \u201cEverything we\u2019ve published has been shot and reshot a dozen times, which is only possible when you can run several scenes a day.\u201d\nPreserving Moments in Time: Hugues Bruy\u00e8re\nHugues Bruy\u00e8re, partner and chief of innovation at Dpt., a Montreal-based creative studio, uses Instant NeRF daily.\n\u201c3D captures have always been of strong interest to me because I can go back to those volumetric reconstructions and move in them, adding an extra dimension of meaning to them,\u201d he said.\nBruy\u00e8re rendered 3D scenes with Instant NeRF using the data he\u2019d previously captured for traditional photogrammetry relying on mirrorless digital cameras, smartphones, 360 cameras and drones. He uses an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU to render his Instant NeRF scenes.\nBruy\u00e8re believes Instant NeRF could be a powerful tool to help preserve and share cultural artifacts through online libraries, museums, virtual-reality experiences and heritage-conservation projects.\n\u201cThe aspect of capturing itself is being democratized, as camera and software solutions become cheaper,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a few months or years, people will be able to capture objects, places, moments and memories and have them volumetrically rendered in real time, shareable and preserved forever.\u201d\nUsing pictures taken with a smartphone, Bruy\u00e8re created an Instant NeRF render of an ancient marble statue of Zeus from an exhibition at Toronto\u2019s Royal Ontario Museum.\n\nStepping Into Remote Scenes: Jonathan Stephens\nJonathan Stephens, chief evangelist for spatial computing company EveryPoint, has been exploring Instant NeRF for both creative and practical applications.\nEveryPoint reconstructs 3D scenes such as stockpiles, railyards and quarries to help businesses manage their resources. With Instant NeRF, Stephens can capture a scene more completely, allowing clients to freely explore a scene. He uses an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 GPU to run scenes rendered with Instant NeRF.\n\n\u201cWhat I really like about Instant NeRF is that you quickly know if your render is working,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cWith a large photogrammetry set, you could be waiting hours or days.

Fast forward to today and Germany\u2019s Fraunhofer Society \u2014 Europe\u2019s largest R&D organization \u2014 is setting its sights on the applied research of key technologies, from AI to cybersecurity to medicine.\nIts Fraunhofer IML unit is aiming to push the boundaries of logistics and robotics. The German researchers are harnessing NVIDIA Isaac Sim to make advances in robot design through simulation.\nLike many \u2014 including BMW, Amazon and Siemens \u2014 Fraunhofer IML relies on NVIDIA Omniverse. It\u2019s using it to make gains in applied research in logistics for fulfillment and manufacturing.\nFraunhofer\u2019s newest innovation, dubbed O3dyn, uses NVIDIA simulation and robotics technologies to create an indoor-outdoor autonomous mobile robot (AMR).\nIts goal is to enable the jump from automated guided vehicles to fast-moving AMRs that aren\u2019t even yet available on the market.\nThis level of automation advancement promises a massive uptick in logistics acceleration.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at how we can go as fast and as safely as possible in logistics scenarios,\u201d said Julian Esser, a robotics and AI researcher at Fraunhofer IML.\nFrom MP3s to AMRs\nFraunhofer IML\u2019s parent organization, based in Dortmund, near the country\u2019s center, has more than 30,000 employees and is involved in hundreds of research projects. In the 1990s, it was responsible for the development of the MP3 file format, which led to the digital music revolution.\nSeeking to send the automated guided vehicle along the same path as the compact disc, Fraunhofer in 2013 launched a breakthrough robot now widely used by BMW in its assembly plants and others.\nThis robot, known as the STR, is a workhorse for industrial manufacturing. It\u2019s used for moving goods for the production lines. Fraunhofer IML\u2019s AI work benefits the STR and other updates to this robotics platform, such as the O3dyn.\nFraunhofer IML is aiming to create AMRs that deliver a new state of the art. The O3dyn relies on the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI and robotics platform for a multitude of camera and sensor inputs to help navigate.\nAdvancing speed and agility, it\u2019s capable of going up to 30 miles per hour and has wheels assisted by AI for any direction of movement to maneuver tight situations.\n\u201cThe omnidirectional dynamics is very unique, and there\u2019s nothing like this that we know of in the market,\u201d said S\u00f6ren Kerner, head of AI and autonomous systems at Fraunhofer IML.\nFraunhofer IML gave a sneak peek at its latest development on this pallet-moving robot at NVIDIA GTC.\n\nBridging Sim to Real\nUsing Isaac Sim, Fraunhofer IML\u2019s latest research strives to develop and validate these AMRs in simulation by closing the sim-to-real gap. The researchers rely on Isaac Sim for virtual development of its highly dynamic autonomous mobile robot by exercising the robot in photorealistic, physically accurate 3D worlds.\nThis enables Fraunhofer to import into the virtual environment its robot\u2019s more than 5,400 parts from computer-aided design software. It can then rig them with physically accurate specifications with Omniverse PhysX.\nThe result is that the virtual robot version can move as swiftly in simulation as the physical robot in the real world. Harnessing the virtual environment allows Fraunhofer to accelerate development, safely increase accuracy for real-world deployment and scale up faster.\nMinimizing the sim-to-real gap makes simulation become a digital reality for robots. It\u2019s a concept Fraunhofer refers to as simulation-based AI.\nTo make faster gains, Fraunhofer is releasing the AMR simulation model into open source so developers can make improvements.\n\u201cThis is important for the future of logistics,\u201d said Kerner. \u201cWe want to have as many people as possible work on the localization, navigation and AI of these kinds of dynamic robots in simulation.\u201d\nLearn more by watching Fraunhofer\u2019s GTC session: \u201cTowards a Digital Reality in Logistics Automation: Optimization of Sim-to-Real.\u201d\nRegister for the upcoming GTC, running Sept. 19-22, and explore the robotics-related sessions.\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | RoboticsTags: Embedded Computing | GTC 2022 | Jetson | NVIDIA in Europe \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The performance can be applied in real time to animate an avatar, character or painting.\nAnd with 3D body-pose estimation software, creators can capture full-body movements like walking, dancing and performing martial arts \u2014 bringing virtual characters to life with AI.\nFor individuals without 3D experience, these tools make it easy to animate creative projects, even using smartphone footage. Professionals can take it a step further, combining the pose estimation and Vid2Vid Cameo software to transfer their own movements to virtual characters for live streams or animation projects.\nAnd creative studios can harness AI-powered performance capture for concept design or previsualization \u2014 to quickly convey an idea of how certain movements look on a digital character.\nNVIDIA Demonstrates Performance Capture With Vid2Vid Cameo\nNVIDIA Vid2Vid Cameo, available through a demo on the NVIDIA AI Playground, needs just two elements to generate a talking-head video: a still image of the avatar or painting to be animated, plus footage of the original performer speaking, singing or moving their head.\nBased on generative adversarial networks, or GANs, the model maps facial movements to capture real-time motion, transferring that motion to the virtual character. Trained on 180,000 videos, the network learned to identify 20 key points to model facial motion \u2014 encoding the location of the eyes, mouth, nose, eyebrows and more.\nThese points are extracted from the video stream of the performer and applied to the avatar or digital character. See how it works in the demo below, which transfers a performance of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s \u201cSonnet \u2014 to Science\u201d to a portrait of the writer by artist Gary Kelley.\n\nVisual Platforms Integrate Vid2Vid Cameo, Pose Estimation by NVIDIA\nWhile Vid2Vid Cameo captures detailed facial expressions, pose estimation AI tracks movement of the whole body \u2014 a key capability for creators working with virtual characters that perform complex motions or move around a digital scene.\nPose Tracker is a convolutional neural network model available as an Extension in the NVIDIA Omniverse 3D design collaboration and world simulation platform. It allows users to upload footage or stream live video as a motion source to animate a character in real time. Creators can download NVIDIA Omniverse for free and get started with step-by-step tutorials.\nCompanies that have integrated NVIDIA AI for performance capture into their products include:\n\nDerivative, maker of TouchDesigner, a node-based real-time visual development platform, has implemented Vid2Vid Cameo as a way to provide easy-to-use facial tracking.\nNotch, a company offering a real-time graphics tool for 3D, visual effects and live-events visuals, uses body-pose estimation AI from NVIDIA to help artists simplify stage setups. Instead of relying on custom hardware-tracking systems, Notch users can work with standard camera equipment to control 3D character animation in real time.\nPixotope, a leading virtual production company, uses NVIDIA AI-powered real-time talent tracking to drive interactive elements for live productions. The Norway-based company shared its work enabling interaction between real and virtual elements on screen at the most recent NVIDIA GTC.\n\nLearn more about NVIDIA\u2019s latest advances in AI, digital humans and virtual worlds at SIGGRAPH, the world\u2019s largest gathering of computer graphics experts, running through Thursday, Aug. 11.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Pro Graphics | ResearchTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA Research | SIGGRAPH 2022 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

By reducing memory footprint by up to 100x, it allows creators, developers and researchers to interact with extremely large and complex datasets in real time.\n\nOver the past decade, OpenVDB has earned Academy Awards as a core technology used throughout the visual-effects industry. It has since grown beyond entertainment to industrial and scientific use cases where sparse volumetric data is prevalent, such as industrial design and robotics.\nLast year, NVIDIA introduced NanoVDB, which added GPU support to OpenVDB. This delivered an order-of-magnitude speedup, enabling faster performance and easier development \u2014 and opening the door to real-time simulation and rendering.\nNeuralVDB builds on the GPU acceleration of NanoVDB by adding machine learning to introduce compact neural representations that dramatically reduce its memory footprint. This allows 3D data to be represented at even higher resolution and at a much larger scale than OpenVDB. The result is that users can easily handle massive volumetric datasets on devices like individual workstations and even laptops.\nNeuralVDB offers a significant efficiency improvement over OpenVDB by compressing a volume\u2019s memory footprint up to 100x compared to NanoVDB. This allows users to transmit and share large, complex volumetric datasets much more efficiently.\nTo accelerate training up to 2x, NeuralVDB allows the weights of a frame to be used for the subsequent one. NeuralVDB also enables users to achieve temporal coherency, or smooth encoding, by using the network results from the previous frame.\nHitting this trifecta of dramatically reducing memory requirements, accelerating training and enabling temporal coherency allows NeuralVDB to unlock new possibilities for scientific and industrial use cases, including massive, complex volume datasets for AI-enabled medical imaging, large-scale digital twin simulations and more.\nLearn more about NeuralVDB.\nWatch the NVIDIA special address at SIGGRAPH on demand, and join NVIDIA at the conference through Thursday, Aug. 11, to see more of the latest technology breakthroughs in graphics, AI and virtual worlds.\n\n\nCategories: ResearchTags: 3D | Artificial Intelligence | GPU | NVIDIA Research | Rendering | SIGGRAPH 2022 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Together they create a platform that\u2019s already running AI, data analytics and high performance computing jobs inside cloud service providers, supercomputing centers, corporate data centers and autonomous systems.\nInside NVIDIA\u2019s First Server CPU\nData centers require flexible clusters of CPUs, GPUs and other accelerators sharing massive pools of memory to deliver the energy-efficient performance today\u2019s workloads demand.\nTo meet that need, Jonathon Evans, a distinguished engineer and 15-year veteran at NVIDIA, will describe the NVIDIA NVLink-C2C. It connects CPUs and GPUs at 900 gigabytes per second with 5x the energy efficiency of the existing PCIe Gen 5 standard, thanks to data transfers that consume just 1.3 picojoules per bit.\nNVLink-C2C connects two CPU chips to create the NVIDIA Grace CPU with 144 Arm Neoverse cores. It\u2019s a processor built to solve the world\u2019s largest computing problems.\nFor maximum efficiency, the Grace CPU uses LPDDR5X memory. It enables a terabyte per second of memory bandwidth while keeping power consumption for the entire complex to 500 watts.\nOne Link, Many Uses\nNVLink-C2C also links Grace CPU and Hopper GPU chips as memory-sharing peers in the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip, delivering maximum acceleration for performance-hungry jobs such as AI training.\nAnyone can build custom chiplets using NVLink-C2C to coherently connect to NVIDIA GPUs, CPUs, DPUs and SoCs, expanding this new class of integrated products. The interconnect will support AMBA CHI and CXL protocols used by Arm and x86 processors, respectively.\nFirst memory benchmarks for Grace and Grace Hopper.\nTo scale at the system level, the new NVIDIA NVSwitch connects multiple servers into one AI supercomputer. It uses NVLink, interconnects running at 900 gigabytes per second, more than 7x the bandwidth of PCIe Gen 5.\nNVSwitch lets users link 32 NVIDIA DGX H100 systems into an AI supercomputer that delivers an exaflop of peak AI performance.\nAlexander Ishii and Ryan Wells, both veteran NVIDIA engineers, will describe how the switch lets users build systems with up to 256 GPUs to tackle demanding workloads like training AI models that have more than 1 trillion parameters.\nThe switch includes engines that speed data transfers using the NVIDIA Scalable Hierarchical Aggregation Reduction Protocol. SHARP is an in-network computing capability that debuted on NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networks. It can double data throughput on communications-intensive AI applications.\nNVSwitch systems enable exaflop-class AI supercomputers.\nJack Choquette, a senior distinguished engineer with 14 years at the company, will provide a detailed tour of the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU, aka Hopper.\nIn addition to using the new interconnects to scale to new heights, it packs many advanced features that boost the accelerator\u2019s performance, efficiency and security.\nHopper\u2019s new Transformer Engine and upgraded Tensor Cores deliver a 30x speedup compared to the prior generation on AI inference with the world\u2019s largest neural network models. And it employs the world\u2019s first HBM3 memory system to deliver a whopping 3 terabytes of memory bandwidth, NVIDIA\u2019s biggest generational increase ever.\nAmong other new features:\n\nHopper adds virtualization support for multi-tenant, multi-user configurations.\nNew DPX instructions speed recurring loops for select mapping, DNA and protein-analysis applications.\nHopper packs support for enhanced security with confidential computing.\n\nChoquette, one of the lead chip designers on the Nintendo64 console early in his career, will also describe parallel computing techniques underlying some of Hopper\u2019s advances.\nMichael Ditty, chief architect for Orin and a 17-year tenure at the company, will provide new performance specs for NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin, an engine for edge AI, robotics and advanced autonomous machines.\nIt integrates 12 Arm Cortex-A78 cores and an NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPU to deliver up to 275 trillion operations per second on AI inference jobs. That\u2019s up to 8x greater performance at 2.3x higher energy efficiency than the prior generation.\nThe latest production module packs up to 32 gigabytes of memory and is part of a compatible family that scales down to pocket-sized 5W Jetson Nano developer kits.\nPerformance benchmarks for NVIDIA Orin\nAll the new chips support the NVIDIA software stack that accelerates more than 700 applications and is used by 2.5 million developers.\nBased on the CUDA programming model, it includes dozens of NVIDIA SDKs for vertical markets like automotive (DRIVE) and healthcare (Clara), as well as technologies such as recommendation systems (Merlin) and conversational AI (Riva).\nThe NVIDIA AI platform is available from major cloud services and system makers.\nFor more details, read technical blogs on Grace and NVLink written by Hot Chips speakers.\n\n\nCategories: HardwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | Events | GPU | GPU Computing | Hardware | High-Performance Computing | Jetson | Machine Learning | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | NVLink | Parallel Computing | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But NVIDIA\u2019s latest portable computers tackle the problem head-on with some clever technology: Advanced Optimus.\nTo help get a better grounding in the tech, Den of Geek talked with NVIDIA\u2019s Director of Product Management Vijay Sharma, whose work has touched all aspects of the company\u2019s hardware from G-SYNC to GPUs.\u00a0\nThe TL;DR of the tech is that it allows gaming laptops to automatically and intelligently switch between graphics outputs, giving you the best possible frame rate, the lowest possible input latency, and maximum battery life. But there\u2019s a lot more to it than that.\n\n\nAd\n\n\n\n \n\nAd \u2013 content continues below\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Does Advanced Optimus Work?\nWhen it comes to Advanced Optimus, there are a lot of moving parts, Sharma explains, as it needs various panel makers, chip manufacturers, OEM developers, and laptop designers to all work together. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of players that have to dance to the music together to make this work,\u201d he says.\nTo start with the basics, your gaming laptop comes with two GPUs: one basic unit, built into the processor for low-powered tasks like editing spreadsheets (the Integrated Graphics Processor, iGPU), and a high-powered one for heavy workloads, like pushing high frame rates in Fortnite, the discrete GPU, or dGPU for short. The dGPU is overkill for simple tasks like email and spreadsheets, and running the dGPU for light workloads would drain your battery for no reason since nobody cares about frame rate when you\u2019re just checking emails, after all.\nNow, in the bad old days of gaming laptops, you would have to physically switch between these two GPUs. Which is to say you\u2019d have to reboot if you wanted to take a break from work to play a couple of rounds of Valorant, and you may even have had to fiddle with BIOS settings to make said switch.\nThis all changed with NVIDIA Optimus, the solution now known as MS Hybrid. NVIDIA found a way to detect if the computer has a graphically intense workload or not, and to automatically switch which GPU was active based on that workload. It was a clever optimization that guaranteed the user better battery life or extra performance.\u00a0\nBut there was a catch with Optimus: the iGPU was typically hardwired to the laptop panel. This meant when rendering frames on the dGPU an additional step was necessary to get the image to the screen. This additional step comes with some time and computing costs.\u00a0\nWhile Optimus was still an improvement over manually rebooting to switch GPUs, the additional step increased latency and decreased framerate. In competitive games like Fortnite and Valorant, latency and framerate can be the difference between winning and losing a match. ,\u00a0\n\n\nAd\n\n\n\n \n\nAd \u2013 content continues below\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to keep latency low and framerates high while automatically switching between iGPU and dGPU? The solution is Advanced Optimus. Here, a hardware switch called a MUX is installed on the mainboard and connected to the laptop display. Combine this hardware switch with the same clever programming from NVIDIA, and you\u2019ve got a system that automatically detects the intensity of a workload and automatically switches which GPU is connected to the display.\u00a0\n\n\n\nJoin our mailing list\nGet the best of Den of Geek delivered right to your inbox!\n\n\n \n\n\n\u201cWe looked at a number of games, and with DOTA 2 you see a 27% improvement in frames per second versus MS Hybrid,\u201d Sharma explains. \u201cThe FPS improvements with Advanced Optimus give you a sense of the FPS bottleneck. With Battlefield V FPS improvement was 20%, Wolfenstein it was 20%, Hitman 3 was 20%.\u201d\n\nLatency improvements are significant too. \u201cThe latency figures vary as well, depending on the game, on the order of 15-25%,\u201d he says. This is, of course, better still when played with NVIDIA Reflex-enabled games. NVIDIA takes gaming and performance seriously, and Reflex is their suite of technologies designed to reduce latency and increase performance in order to deliver the best gaming experiences.\n\nFor Advanced Optimus, allowing a direct connection to the display also ensures support for advanced display technologies like NVIDIA G-SYNC, an intelligent technology that removes visual tearing and provides smooth framerates by syncing the display refresh rate to the same rate that the dGPU renders frames.\u00a0\nAnd, of course, there are the all-important battery gains. There shouldn\u2019t be any difference between original MS-Hybrid and Advanced Optimus, Sharma tells me, but \u201cversus a system where you are needing to reboot and set the MUX manually, you\u2019ll get better battery life.\u201d\u00a0\nOur Experiences with Advanced Optimus\nAfter a grounding in the technology, I had to give it a go myself. Can I live the dream and use one laptop for work and play even if I forget to take the charger with me?\n\n\nAd\n\n\n\n \n\nAd \u2013 content continues below\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a laptop provided by NVIDIA \u2014 a Core i7, RTX 3080-toting beast that easily eclipses my own gaming desktop \u2014 I jumped into a mix of work and play, ignoring my natural instinct to return to the safety of the plug socket.\u00a0\nObviously I started with \u201cplay.\u201d I booted up Fortnite without the charger in reach. Thanks to NVIDIA\u2019s clever software, graphical settings quickly adjusted, foregoing niceties such as ray tracing which I have on when plugged in, leaning on the clever DLSS tech to upscale to 2K, and sensibly capping my framerate to 60 FPS (though you can overrule this if you know that you\u2019ll be at a charger soon).\u00a0\nFortnite itself only occasionally dropped below that 60 FPS mark and still looked pretty splendid to my eyes. It was still working the NVIDIA Reflex technology that minimizes system latency to ensure I got the drop on my opponents, though I ultimately did pretty poorly over the course of two matches \u2014 you can\u2019t win \u2018em all.\nAfter a solid 25-minute session, I decided it was time to do some actual work and give the hardware GPU a break. I found that I\u2019d used around a third of the laptop\u2019s 99WH battery for that, which is par for the course with gaming laptops going all out, and Windows wasn\u2019t initially optimistic that I\u2019d last much longer than 90 minutes more.\u00a0\n\nBut despite that tantalizing prospect of knocking off work early for the day, it adapted and accepted that my less intense Google Docs usage is indeed less taxing on the battery than my middling Fortnite gunplay. I got the usual three-to-four hours of additional, more mundane use, while the RTX 3080 enjoyed a well-earned rest.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that you can be more aggressive with the battery life savings if you choose.

What are some of the key tools and frameworks used in AI? How do I learn more about ethics in AI?\nEveryone has questions, but the most common questions in AI always return to this: how do I get involved?\nCutting through the hype to share fundamental principles for building a career in AI, a group of AI professionals gathered at NVIDIA\u2019s GTC conference in the spring offered what may be the best place to start.\nEach panelist, in a conversation with NVIDIA\u2019s Louis Stewart, head of strategic initiatives for the developer ecosystem, came to the industry from very different places.\nWatch the session on demand.\nBut the speakers \u2014 Katie Kallot, NVIDIA\u2019s former head of global developer relations and emerging areas; David Ajoku, founder of startup aware.ai; Sheila Beladinejad, CEO of Canada Tech; and Teemu Roos, professor at the University of Helsinki\u00a0 \u2014 returned again and again to four basic principles.\n1) Start With Networking and Mentorship\nThe best way to start, Ajoku explained, is to find people who are where you want to be in five years.\nAnd don\u2019t just look for them online \u2014 on Twitter and LinkedIn. Look for opportunities to connect with others in your community and at professional events who are going where you want to be.\n\u201cYou want to find people you admire, find people who walk the path you want to be on over the next five years,\u201d Ajoku said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t just come to you; you have to go get it.\u201d\nAt the same time, be generous about sharing what you know with others. \u201cYou want to find people who will teach, and in teaching, you will learn,\u201d he added.\nBut the best place to start is knowing that reaching out is okay.\n\u201cWhen I started my career in computer science, I didn\u2019t even know I should be seeking a mentor,\u201d Beladinejad said, echoing remarks from the other panelists.\n\u201cI learned not to be shy, to ask for support and seek help whenever you get stuck on something \u2014 always have the confidence to approach your professors and classmates,\u201d she added.\n2) Get Experience\nKallot explained that the best way to learn is by doing.\nShe got a degree in political science and learned about technology \u2014 including how to code \u2014 while working in the industry.\nShe started out as a sales and marketing analyst, then leaped to a product manager role.\n\u201cI had to learn everything about AI in three months, and at the same time I had to learn to use the product, I had to learn to code,\u201d she said.\nThe best experience, explained Roos, is to surround yourself with people on the same learning journey, whether they\u2019re learning online or in person.\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it alone. If you can, grab your friends, grab your colleagues, maybe start a study group and create a curriculum,\u201d he said. \u201cMeet once a week, twice a week \u2014 it\u2019s much more fun that way.\u201d\n3) Develop Soft Skills\nYou\u2019ll also need the communications skills to explain what you\u2019re learning, and doing, in AI as you progress.\n\u201cPractice talking about technical topics to non-technical audiences,\u201d Stewart said.\nAjoku recommended learning and practicing public speaking.\nAjoku took an acting class at Carnegie Mellon University. Similarly, Roos took an improv comedy class.\nOthers on the panel learned to perform, publicly, through dance and sports.\n\u201cThe more you\u2019re cross-trained, the more comfortable you\u2019re going to be and the better you\u2019re going to be able to express yourself in any environment,\u201d Stewart said.\n4) Define Your Why\u00a0\nThe most important element, however, comes from within, the panelists said.\nThey urged listeners to find a reason, something that drives them to stay motivated on their journey.\nFor some, it\u2019s environmental issues. Others are driven by a desire to make technology more accessible. Or to help make the industry more inclusive, panelists said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s helpful for anyone if you have a topic that you\u2019re passionate about,\u201d Beladinejad said. \u201cThat would help keep you going, keep your motivation up.\u201d\nWhatever you do, \u201cdo it with passion,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cDo it with purpose.\u201d\nBurning Questions\nThroughout the conversation, thousands of virtual attendees submitted more than 350 questions about how to get started in their AI careers.\nAmong them:\nWhat\u2019s the best way to learn about deep learning?\u00a0\nThe NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute offers a huge variety of hands-on courses.\nEven more resources for new and experienced developers alike are available through the NVIDIA Developer program, which includes resources for those pursuing higher education and research.\nMassive open online courses \u2014 or MOOCs \u2014 have made learning about technical subjects more accessible than ever. One panelist suggested looking for classes taught by Stanford Professor Andrew Ng on Coursera.\n\u201cThere are many MOOC courses out there, YouTube videos and books \u2014 I highly recommend finding a study buddy as well,\u201d another wrote.\n\u201cJoin technical and professional networks \u2026 get some experience through volunteering, participating in a Kaggle competition, etc.\u201d\nWhat are some of the most prevalent tools and frameworks used in machine learning and AI in industry? Which ones are crucial to landing a first job or internship in the field?\n\nThe best way to figure out which technologies you want to start with, one panelist suggested, is to think about what you want to do.\nAnother suggested, however, that learning Python isn\u2019t a bad place to begin.\n\u201cA lot of today\u2019s AI tools are based on Python,\u201d they wrote. \u201cYou can\u2019t go wrong by mastering Python.\u201d\n\u201cThe technology is evolving rapidly, so many of today\u2019s AI developers are constantly learning new things. Having software fundamentals like data structures and common languages like Python and C++ will help set you up to \u2018learn on the job,\u2019\u201d another added.\nWhat\u2019s the best way to start getting experience in the field? Do personal projects count as experience?\u00a0\nStudent clubs, online developer communities, volunteering and personal projects are all a great way to gain hands-on experience, panelists wrote.\nAnd definitely include personal projects on your resume, another added.\nIs there an age limit for getting involved in AI?\u00a0\nAge isn\u2019t at all a barrier, whether you\u2019re just starting out or transitioning from another field, panelists wrote.\nBuild a portfolio for yourself so you can better demonstrate your skills and abilities \u2014 that\u2019s what should count.\nEmployers should be able to easily realize your potential and skills.\nI want to build a tech startup with some form of AI as the engine driving the solution to solve an as-yet-to-be-determined problem. What pointers do you have for entrepreneurs?\u00a0\nEntrepreneurs should apply to be a part of NVIDIA Inception.\nThe program provides free benefits, such as technical support, go-to-market support, preferred pricing on hardware and access to its VC alliance for funding.\nWhich programming language is best for AI?\nPython is widely used in deep learning, machine learning and data science. The programming language is at the center of a thriving ecosystem of deep learning frameworks and developer tools. It\u2019s predominantly used for training complex models and for real-time inference for web-based services.\nC/C++ is a popular programming language for self-driving cars which is used for deploying models for real-time inference.\nThose getting started, though, will want to make sure they\u2019re familiar with a broad array of tools, not just Python.\nThe NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute\u2019s beginner self-paced courses can be one of the best ways to get oriented.\nLearn More From GTC Sessions\nAt NVIDIA GTC, a global conference on AI and the metaverse, professionals spoke about how they got started in their careers.\nWatch the on-demand GTC sessions How to Be a Deep Learning Engineer and 5 Paths to a Career in AI.\nLearn the AI essentials from NVIDIA fast: check out the \u201cgetting started\u201d resources to explore the fundamentals of today\u2019s hottest technologies on our learning series page.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | How ToTags: Artificial Intelligence | Deep Learning Institute | Developer Program | GTC | Inception \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In a recent post the company explains why it believes the protocol, originally invented by Pixar, fits the needs of the coming metaverse.\n\nThough the word metaverse is presently being used as a catchall for pretty much any multi-user application these days, the truth is that the vast majority of such platforms are islands unto themselves that have no connectivity to virtual spaces, people, or objects on other platforms. The \u2018real\u2019 metaverse, most seem to agree, must have at least some elements of interoperability, allowing users to seamlessly move from one virtual space to the next, much like we do today on the web.\nTo that end, Nvidia is pushing Universal Scene Description (USD) as the \u201cHTML of the metaverse,\u201d\u00a0the company described in a recent post.\nMuch like HTML forms a description of a webpage\u2014which can be hosted anywhere on the internet\u2014and is retrieved and rendered locally by a web browser, USD is a protocol for describing complex virtual scenes which can be retrieved and rendered to varying degrees depending upon local hardware capabilities. With a \u2018USD browser\u2019 of sorts, Nvidia is suggesting that USD could be the common method by which virtual spaces are defined in a way that\u2019s easy for anyone to decipher and render.\n\u201cThe most fundamental standard needed to create the metaverse is the description of a virtual world. At Nvidia, we believe the first version of that standard already exists. It is Universal Scene Description (USD)\u2014an open and extensible ecosystem for describing, composing, simulating, and collaborating within 3D worlds, originally invented by Pixar Animation Studios,\u201d writes Nvidia\u2019s\u00a0Rev Lebaredian and\u00a0Michael Kass.\n\u201c[USD] includes features necessary for scaling to large data sets like lazy loading and efficient retrieval of time-sampled data. It is tremendously extensible, allowing users to customize data schemas, input and output formats, and methods for finding assets. In short, USD covers the very broad range of requirements that Pixar found necessary to make its feature films.\u201d\nIndeed, CGI pioneer Pixar created USD to make collaboration on complex 3D animation projects easier. The company open-sourced the protocol back in 2015.\nUSD is more than just a file format for 3D geometry. Not only can USD describe a complex scene with various objects, textures, and lighting, it can also include references to assets hosted elsewhere, property inheritance, and layering functionality which allows non-destructive editing of a single scene with efficient asset re-use.\nSEE ALSO'Assetto Corsa EVO' Launches on PC VR Headsets in Early Access, But You May Want to Wait\nWhile Nvidia thinks USD is the right starting point for an interoperable platform, the company also acknowledges that \u201cUSD will need to evolve to meet the needs of the metaverse.\u201d\nOn that front the company laid out a fairly extensive roadmap of features that it\u2019s working on for USD to successfully serve as the foundation of the metaverse:\n\nIn the short term, NVIDIA is developing:\n\nglTF interoperability: A glTF file format plugin will allow glTF assets to be referenced directly by USD scenes. This means that users who are already using glTF can take advantage of the composition and collaboration features of USD without having to alter their existing assets.\nGeospatial schema (WGS84): NVIDIA is developing a geospatial schema and runtime behavior in USD to support the WGS84 standard for geospatial coordinates. This will facilitate full-fidelity digital twin models that need to incorporate the curvature of the earth\u2019s surface.\nInternational character (UTF-8) support: NVIDIA is working with Pixar to add support for UTF-8 identifiers to USD, allowing for full interchange of content from all over the world.\nUSD compatibility testing and certification suite: To further accelerate USD development and adoption, NVIDIA is building an open source suite for USD compatibility testing and certification. Developers will be able to test their builds of USD and certify that their custom USD components produce an expected result.\n\nIn the longer term, NVIDIA is working with partners to fill some of the larger remaining gaps in USD:\n\nHigh-speed incremental updates: USD was not designed for high-speed dynamic scene updates, but digital twin simulations will require this. NVIDIA is developing additional libraries on top of USD that enable much higher update rates to support real-time simulation.\nReal-time proceduralism: USD as it currently exists is almost entirely declarative. Properties and values in the USD representation, for the most part, describe facts about the virtual world. NVIDIA has begun to augment this with a procedural graph-based execution engine called OmniGraph.\nCompatibility with browsers: Today, USD is C++/Python based, but web browsers are not. To be accessible by everyone, everywhere, virtual worlds will need to be capable of running inside web browsers. NVIDIA will be working to ensure that proper WebAssembly builds with JavaScript bindings are available to make USD an attractive development option when running inside of a browser is the best approach.\nReal-time streaming of IoT data: Industrial virtual worlds and live digital twins require real-time streaming of IoT data. NVIDIA is working on building USD connections to IoT data streaming protocols.\n\n\nNvidia isn\u2019t alone in its belief that USD has an important role to play in the coming metaverse. The idea has also taken hold to some extent at the newly formed Metaverse Standards Forum\u2014of which Nvidia and thousands of other companies are members\u2014which has also pointed to USD as a promising foundation for interoperable virtual spaces and experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for Signing Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease correct the marked field(s) below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1,true,6,Contact Email,2\n\n\n\nRoad to VR - Daily Roundup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article may contain affiliate links.

Practically the most common 3D format is FBX, not glTF or USD, so we will see how the adoption will work. But this is more of a concern of devs and content creators, not users.\nThe real nightmare will be the HTTP of the Metaverse \u2013 the protocols.\nAnd I\u2019m not talking about technical challenge. We already did it in web 1.0 and then it was ruined with web 2.0\nI\u2019m talking about \u201cpolitics\u201d.\nIf a web browser was invented in 2010, we\u2026 wouldn\u2019t have web browsers or websites, because the idea to freely browse unmoderated, uncurrated web is completely illegal according to ToS of iOS, Google play or basically any modern walled garden ecosystem controlled by big corporation, because 1. it\u2019s bad for monetization (\u201ctax\u201d avoidance), 2. it\u2019s bad for content control (and they are all control freaks) + the online lynch mobs literally demand censorship.\nSo why would they ever think about allowing such thing? There will be some basic multiplatform support and content migrations, but they will never allow the actual idea of metaverse to come to fruition. They will only use it as a buzzword.\nAnd real users also don\u2019t want decentralized/federated open platforms. Centralized ones are superior for exposure, because you target the whole thing with low effort, without fragmentation problems, which means more likes/follows/subs -> satisfaction -> adoption rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristian Schildwaechter\n\n\n\nFBX is a undocumented, proprietary format owned by Autodesk that can be used via the FBX Extension SDK, another proprietary blob owned by Autodesk that other programs can use to import or export it. It has become a sort of standard format for mesh objects through historic support by commercial apps, but both its closed management in contrast to e.g. the open gITF from Khronos Group (OpenGL, WebGL, Vulkan, OpenXR and many more) and its limited scope make it unsuitable as the \u201cHTML for the metaverse\u201d.\nUSD was designed to enable not only the exchange but also non-destructive collaboration on the same data with mechanisms to extend it, and e.g. allows to only load and render parts of the scene, which makes it very useful for complex virtual worlds. All that complexity and extendability makes it a beast which will need to be optimized to be usable in lightweight clients like web browsers, but the fact that Apple and Adobe picked a compressed version called USDz as the base for their AR development should help with adaption.\nAs for the \u201cnightmare\u201d: this is a wild mashup of rather unrelated issues of technology, competing standards and politics. Moderation is usually related to country policies, for example you will find no country that allows freely posting child pornography, planing acts of terrorism or conspiring to commit murder online, making the idea of an \u201cunmoderated, uncurated web\u201d legally impossible, no matter the TOS, and mostly a straw man argument. Companies tend to overshoot and set much stricter limits than legally required, often to cover their backs from becoming liable for their users activities.\nThis has nothing to do with the technology, this is a side effect of humans living in societies with parts of them consistently behaving like a*holes. There is no wild conspiracy completely limiting your net access to ensure monetization, you can take any browser on iOS, all of which are forced to used Apple\u2019s WebKit/Safari engine on the very locked down iOS platform, and still use the very secure, built-in HTTPS implementation to go on the dark web and order all of the assault weapons you want. Apple will not stop you, your real danger comes from FBI agents posing as drug/arms sellers.\nThe technical mishaps of web \u201cprotocols\u201d (markup actually, the protocols weren\u2019t really problem) came first from companies adding proprietary, incompatible extensions to the still primitive HTML 1/2 and later when the W3C tried to force HTML 3 into a more formal and strict description with HTML 3.2, compared to the flexible mess that everybody was actually using, causing xhtml to be mostly scrapped and HTML5 being driven by the WHATWG industry group, which has solved most of the compatibility issues we had in the past.\nSo companies can successfully come together and create interoperability standards in an iterative process, enabling the WWW or a metaverse, but there will always be a human factor that will set limits to what you are allowed to do with the results, at least in public. There will never be an \u201canything goes\u201d, because there is way too much \u201canything\u201d that we want to avoid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Werewolf\n\n\n\nTotally agree about FBX not being a workable standard. As you note, it\u2019s undocumented, proprietary and you have to go through AutoDesk\u2019s libraries to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeopsys\n\n\n\nYou obviously talk about stuff you have very low knowledge about.\nFbx is only an interchange file format primarily dedicated to animation workflows and used in game industry only, it belongs to Autodesk and will never be a standard.\nUSD is a full data mangement + agnostic + extremely efficient cache system for game and animation/vfx industries, and it\u2019s opensource.\nIf one CG format will rule them all, it\u2019s very likely USD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTill Eulenspiegel\n\n\n\nUSD won\u2019t be of much use in the metaverse due to inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmcnbns\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s right. We need to be moving toward the BTC standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBen Outram\n\n\n\nUSD is a 3D file format for the new internet \u2013 it\u2019s super flexible and allows components to be kept in folders outside of the file itself, so they can be reused.  It will become the standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Werewolf\n\n\n\nUhm\u2026 VRML? It\u2019s been around since forever.\nAlso, why is a protocol bound to a language? The implementation might be, but if we\u2019re talking implementation, then it should be language independent. Remember, a LOT of Unity programming is done in C# and MacOS devs will need ObjectiveC or Swift support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Jakobs\n\n\n\nWhy does MacOS need objectiveC ir swift if unity has C#, I think C# is an excellent choice for multiplatform development, just like Razor is getting more popular for webdevelopment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristian Schildwaechter\n\n\n\nMany of the major programming languages over time have adapted features from each other, leading to basically feature parity. So you could replace Swift with C# on MacOS or C# with Swift on .NET. It just wouldn\u2019t make a lot of sense to rip out the foundation just to replace it with something very similar.\nFor a long time Unity supported not only C#, but also UnityScript and Boo. UnityScript was a variant of ECMAScript/JavaScript, Boo a variant of Python, both adding strong type support to work with the .NET foundation Unity is build on. AFAIR those were kicked out with Unity 5, because they were too different for JavaScript or Python programmers to be directly usable, meaning only a few developers used them, while causing lots of trouble because features available in C# remained unusable due to having to keep everything compatible.\nSo the choice of language is often mostly due to historic reasons. In 1984 Objective-C introduced the elegant object messaging from SmallTalk to C with a very thin wrapper, allowing to easily transition existing C code bases. Nothing even close to that existed back then,  which is why Steve Jobs\u2019 NeXT Computers picked it for their MachOS/Unix based NeXTSTEP OS in the late 80s. NeXTSTEP became the design template for the Java standard libraries in the mid 90s, with the Java platform itself becoming the template for the C# and .NET framework Microsoft introduced in 2000.\nMeanwhile Apple had acquired NeXT in a sort of reverse takeover, with Apple effectively paying NeXT USD 400mn for taking over Apple and turning NeXTSTEP into todays MacOS (X), iOS and what now seems to be called realityOS. Which is why iPhones today and Apple XR/AR HMDs next year will still run on a (revolutionary) platform from the mid 80s, with Apple modernizing Objective-C with the mostly compatible Swift that removes some crud, similar to Koplin updating Java for Android or Google\u2019s recently announced Carbon that is compatible to the C++ dungheap it is supposed to replace.\nSwift, Koplin and Carbon are similar enough that it is a valid question to ask why the hell we get three new language successors instead of finally one for all platforms. But they are all slightly different to work seamlessly with the existing codebase of their predecessors, and adapting all the existing code is simply unrealistic (expensive). If all we needed was a better language for OS development, Rust would have worked fine and nobody would need Objective-C, Swift, Java, Koplin, C++, Carbon or C# anymore, with C# only escaping a revamp so far due to being the youngest at only 22 years.\nWith our economies still running on lots of code written in the 1960s, long term maintainability and compatibility is a much more important factor for language choice, with radical changes only being made every few decades. And with declarative languages like HTML, VRML and USD (actually a framework) that isn\u2019t really a problem, because you can still create  bindings for whatever language you prefer, be it Swift or C#. This usually only becomes a problem when you try this with huge frameworks like .NET or Qt, often resulting in a very crude mix of syntax and procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalter Sharrow\n\n\n\nDid anyone watch \u201cReady Player One\u201d and actually think that mismatch slamfest of random game elements was a good idea? Games are more then just shoot this and that. There\u2019s narratives that wouldn\u2019t work well with some idiot showing up dressed as Mario or Master Chief. You don\u2019t double jump and butt slam your way through Call of Duty. \nAre people just looking for a way to move between game worlds without leaving VR? Because if that\u2019s their issue, I can\u2019t help but to notice I can operate all of my Quest titles in their VR interface just fine. \nNothing about this \u201cMetaverse\u201d crap makes ANY sense! It\u2019s just a buzzword, with as much relevance and usefulness as the word \u201cSynergy\u201d. If people are just looking for easier to use 3D formats, there\u2019s plenty of those. Are they trying to load up game code over the internet? I can download full games using Steam, right now! We\u2019ve had web-based games using JAVA and what-not for over 20 years now. \nWhat is really trying to be accomplished here? Player match making? Game downloads? More player character design choices? \nAlot of this sounds alot like VRML, which has existed since the early 2000\u2019s, but never really found any great use. 3D worlds aren\u2019t like 2D webpages. They harder to make and don\u2019t translate well between devices. The number of 3D editors is much smaller then photoshop users, and rarely still are coders. \nThis all smacks of nebulous fantasies by people who know nothing of games, 3D design, VR, or even computers in general.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTonyVT SkarredGhost\n\n\n\nThanks for the explanation. It was unclear to me why they defined USD the HTML of the metaverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndavid vincent\n\n\n\nAn open-source and versatile protocol, that\u2019s exactly what we need for the future metaverse.

This will, in turn, empower industrial metaverse applications used in\u00a0architecture,\u00a0engineering,\u00a0manufacturing,\u00a0scientific computing,\u00a0robotics\u00a0and\u00a0industrial digital twins.\n\u201cWorking with our community of partners, we\u2019re investing in USD so that it can serve as the foundation for architecture, manufacturing, robotics, engineering and many more domains,\u201d Rev said.\nOn its strategy to evolve USD, the company stated that international character support will allow those who speak different languages to participate in USD. Support for geospatial coordinates will enable city-scale and planetary-scale digital twins. Also, real-time streaming of IoT data will enable the development of digital twins.\nNVIDIA mulls roping in hundreds of engineering and product leads across the USD ecosystem to work on USD development priorities.\nUSD plugins\nNVIDIA also announced investing in building USD plugins from popular 3D software ecosystems to\u00a0NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122, a platform for connecting and creating virtual worlds based on Universal Scene Description. \n\u201cSiemens and NVIDIA are coming together to enable the industrial metaverse where the future of design, engineering and collaboration will occur,\u201d said Dirk Didascalou, chief technology officer of Siemens Digital Industries. \u201cWe are excited to support USD in the Siemens Xcelerator platform and plan to collaborate with NVIDIA on the next generation of the format.\u201d\nLanguage of metaverse \nMetaverse has already established its presence in media, gaming, robotics, industrial automation, retail and grocery, with innovators adopting USD as their metaverse language of choice, including Kroger and Volvo Cars.\n\u201cThe promise of USD is immense. At Volvo, we immediately understood the value of the open, extensible, interoperable 3D scene description for our metaverse projects. Being able to maintain assets as a single source of truth and bring them from virtual world to virtual world will be seamless in 3D internet consumer applications,\u201d said Mattias Wikenmalm, senior expert of visualization at Volvo Cars.\nOn-demand tutorials\nTo make people understand the USD concept and how it exchanges 3D computer graphics, NVIDIA is providing hundreds of on-demand tutorials, documentation and developer tools.\n\u201cUSD is a cornerstone of Pixar\u2019s pipeline, and it\u2019s seeing rapidly growing momentum as an open-source framework across not only VFX and animation, but now industrial, design and scientific applications,\u201d said Steve May, chief technology officer at Pixar Animation Studios. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like the article, Please share on social media \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTag:\n\nFuture Technologies, Metaverse \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPriya Chadha\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFormer Employee of Geospatial World.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBentley Systems Acquires 3D Geospatial Company Cesium\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t09/09/2024\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIs the Metaverse a Bubble?\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t08/08/2024\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTransforming India\u2019s Defence with Human Machine Integration\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t06/12/2024\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI & Satellite Innovation Pushing Next-gen Space Technology\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t05/20/2024\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPower of Evolving Technologies in Revolutionizing Geospatial Data\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t05/16/2024\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew Age Technologies to Strengthen Geospatial Insights\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t05/14/2024\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAbout Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOur People\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDownload Media Kit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDownload Logo Suite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook-f\n \n\n\n\nTwitter\n \n\n\n\nYoutube\n \n\n\n\nLinkedin\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a9 Geospatial Media and Communications.

According to new reports, Nvidia is working with board partners to reduce the price of its cards even further this month as the arrival of the RTX 4000 series, aka Ada Lovelace, draws ever closer. \nThe current graphics card market is a total contrast to the shambolic state that gamers had to endure since Ampere launched almost two years ago. The chip crisis and unprecedented demand from both gamers and miners combined to push up selling prices, which at one point were 200% above MSRP.\nThings have changed drastically over the last couple of months, of course, helped in no small measure by the crypto crash. With Lovelace expected to arrive in September or October, Nvidia is dropping prices as it tries to clear out an excess of GPU stock, a problem that's especially apparent in higher-end models such as the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090. Cards have now fallen below MSRP in many countries, and their prices keep on dropping.\n\nClick to expand\nAccording to reports from two Chinese sources (via VideoCardz), Nvidia will be working with partners to further reduce the prices of their graphics cards. Zol writes that the company is taking \"aggressive actions\" to cut prices at the end of August, and it wants the discounts to be deeper than AMD's, which is expected to take similar actions.\nOnce again, the RTX 3090 and 3090 Ti are said to be receiving some of the biggest price drops; Nvidia previously knocked $400 off the latter card's $1,999 MSRP (Founders Edition). That makes sense as team green is thought to have so many excess GPUs that it is restarting production of the RTX 3080 12GB. The card, which Nvidia stopped producing as it tried to shift more 10GB variants, sports defective GA102 GPUs unsuitable for use in the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3090s. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\n AMD board partner says Radeon RX 9070 GPU supply will stabilize after April \n\n\n\nWith AMD also set to drop the prices of its cards, gamers are now facing the dilemma of whether to buy now, wait for the current generation to get even cheaper, or splash out on an RTX 4000/Radeon RX 7000 card when they arrive. Given that the RTX 4070's performance is said to match the RTX 3090 Ti, it's not an easy decision to make.\n\n\n\n\n 46 comments\n \n640 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 GPUs \"unprecedented\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 specs and official performance benchmarks leaked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

Researchers at Stanford University and NVIDIA have used GANs (Generative Antagonist Networks) to create realistic 3D renderings. Their study titled \"Efficient Geometry-aware 3D Generative Adversarial Networks\" has been published on Arxiv and shared on the Github platform.\nUnsupervised generation of high-quality 3D images using only collections of single-view 2D photographs has long been a challenge. Existing 3D GANs are either computationally intensive or make approximations that are inconsistent in 3D, limiting the quality and resolution of the generated images.\nIn this study, Stanford and Nvidia researchers improved the computational efficiency and image quality of 3D GANs without relying too heavily on these approximations. Training a GAN with neural rendering is expensive, they chose to introduce a hybrid explicit-implicit expressive network architecture that, in combination with other design choices, not only synthesizes coherent multi-view high-resolution images in real time, but also produces high-quality 3D geometry.\nThis representation combines an explicit backbone, which produces features aligned in three orthogonal planes, with a small implicit decoder. Compared to a typical multilayer perceptron representation, it is more than seven times faster and uses less than one-sixteenth more memory.\nBy decoupling feature generation and neural rendering, their framework can take advantage of state-of-the-art 2D CNN generators, such as StyleGAN2, and inherit their efficiency and expressiveness.\nResults of the study\nAlthough the resulting shapes show significant improvements over those generated by previous 3D-compatible GANs, they may still contain artifacts and miss finer details, such as teeth and require some improvements.\nHowever, by combining an efficient explicit-implicit neural representation with an expressive pose-sensitive convolutional generator and a dual discriminator, this approach could enable significant advances towards 3D-supported photorealistic image synthesis and high-quality unsupervised shape generation.\nThis can enable rapid prototyping of 3D models, more controllable image synthesis and new techniques for shape reconstruction from temporal data.\nArticle source:\nEfficient Geometry-aware 3D Generative Adversarial Networks ArXiv:2112.07945v2\nAUTHORS:\nEric R.

Tomahawk5 also brings the company up to speed with rival Nvidia, which debuted its own 51.2Tbps Ethernet switch at GTC this spring.\nUsing the ASIC, the company expects OEMs, to which Tomahawk5 is already sampling, will begin shipping switches with 64, 800Gbps ports or 128, 400Gbps, or 256 200Gbps ports by early next year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every two years we've been doubling the bandwidth of the silicon,\" Pete Del Vecchio, Product Line Manager, told The Register. \"Since 2010, we now have an 8x increase as far as the bandwidth, and every generation we also improved the energy efficiency. So now, we're about 95 percent more efficient than we were 12 years ago.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it should be noted that like the 25.6Tbps Tomahawk4 it replaces, Broadcom's latest chip is still stuck on a 100Gbps PAM4 serializer/deserializers (SerDes). This effectively caps the per-port throughput at 800Gbps when using QSFP-DD optical plugables. So while Broadcom has managed to double the capacity of its switch silicon, it hasn't actually doubled the port speeds. Not that customers are clamoring for more speed just yet.\nAccording to Broadcom execs, adoption of 400Gbps modules is still in its infancy, even among performance-hungry hyperscalers, making up just 15 percent of the total Ethernet market by revenue. By 2026, Broadcom expects 400G ports to exceed 50 percent of Ethernet revenues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese figures roughly align with the findings of a recent Dell'Oro Group report, though analysts put market penetration for 400Gbps switching at closer to 10 percent. In the first quarter of 2021, the group reported that shipments of 400Gbps switches had exceeded 800,000 ports, with that number is expected to continue to ramp over the next year, propelled by strong demand from cloud providers.\n\nThe silicon goldrush is coming, but chip demand is evaporating\nWhy you should start paying attention to CXL now\nJuniper says 400G network kit in demand, supply chain worries easing\nSpirent ships test kit for 400 and 800Gbps Ethernet\n\nHowever, the Tomahawk5 claims more than twice the switching capacity. Improvements to the chip's architecture, including a move to a 5nm manufacturing process enables the monolithic switch chip to achieve significant power savings.\nAccording to Broadcom, the chip consumes less than a watt per 100Gb of capacity. This means that at full tilt, the chip uses less than 500W, which Broadcom says will allow OEMs to continue air cooling switches powered by the chip.\n\"Doubling the bandwidth actually gives you a 6x reduction as far as cost, power, and complexity,\" Del Vecchio said, comparing the chip against the previous-gen Tomahawk4.\nThe ASIC also features a number of features tailored toward hyperscape HPC workloads including network virtualization and segmentation, single-pass VxLAN routing and bridging, as well as \"Cognative Routing\" capabilities designed to reduce job completion times by avoiding congestion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The traffic characteristics that you have for AI/ML do tend to be different from what you would have for standard compute and storage traffic,\" Del Vecchio explained, adding that by routing around potential sources of congestion, the switch can reduce latency and improve performance for AI/ML workloads.\nPut together, Broadcom says Tomahawk5 is the highest performance single switch ASIC available on the market, but that claim isn't without caveats. At GTC this spring, Nvidia showed off its 51.2Tbps Spectrum-4 Ethernet switch.\nSpectrum-4 is based on technology obtained with the acquisition of Mellanox in 2019, and the switch boasts many of the same capabilities offered by Broadcom's Tomahawk5, including support for up to 64 800Gbps ports on a single chassis. The switch as well as Nvidia's BlueField-3 DPUs are slated to begin shipping later this year.\nSo while Broadcom can claim it has beaten Nvidia to market with a 51.2Tbps ASIC \u2013 it is technically sampling \u2013 those chips still need to be integrated into OEM chassis before they ever make their debut in the datacenter. This casts some doubt as to which will arrive in customers' hands first, especially given the current state of the supply chain. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Broadcom\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Datacenter\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Ethernet\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Broadcom\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Datacenter\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Ethernet\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Network\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Public Cloud\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Black Hole\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Broadband\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Cellular network\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Disaster recovery\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Email\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Ericsson\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Firewall\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                IETF\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                InfiniBand\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                IPv4\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                IPv6\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Network interface card\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Network switch\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Open Compute Project\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                PUE\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Radio Access Network\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Router\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                SmartNIC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Software defined data center\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Software-defined network\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Streaming video\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Submarine cable\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Systems Approach\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                VPN\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                World Wide Web\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                Cloud Computing\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Semiconductor\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n                    COMMENTS\n            \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Broadcom\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Datacenter\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Ethernet\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Broadcom\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Datacenter\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Ethernet\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Network\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Public Cloud\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Black Hole\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Broadband\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Cellular network\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Disaster recovery\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Email\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Ericsson\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Firewall\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                IETF\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                InfiniBand\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                IPv4\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                IPv6\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Network interface card\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Network switch\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Open Compute Project\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                PUE\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Radio Access Network\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Router\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                SmartNIC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Software defined data center\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Software-defined network\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Streaming video\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Submarine cable\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Systems Approach\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                VPN\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                World Wide Web\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                Cloud Computing\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Semiconductor\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBroadcom has won. 70 percent of large VMware customers bought its biggest bundle\nNow working with seven hyperscalers for custom AI silicon.

Nvidia; screenshot by Stephen Shankland/CNET   What's happening Nvidia announced technology to let metaverse developers create lifelike avatars that can give an animated human face to the computers that people will interact with online. Why it matters The metaverse needs new computing tools if it's to live up to its potential of new 3D realms for working, learning, socializing and goofing off, and Nvidia's technology could also eventually give humans a new look online, not just bots. You're probably used to interacting by voice with digital assistants like Alexa and Siri. Now, Nvidia thinks those voices should have digital faces.On Tuesday, the chip giant unveiled its Avatar Cloud Engine, a tool for building 3D models of speaking humans that Nvidia hopes will be the way we interact with computers and, perhaps, with other people in the metaverse.The tool draws on Nvidia's experience with 3D graphics and artificial intelligence technology, which has revolutionized how computers understand and communicate with natural language. Company Chief Executive Jensen Huang unveiled ACE in conjunction with the\u00a0Siggraph computer graphics conference\u00a0in Vancouver.Advanced avatars such as those ACE could make possible are the next step in computer interaction. In the 3D digital realms that metaverse advocates like Meta and Nvidia hope we'll all inhabit, a human-looking face could help us manage our investments, tour an apartment building or learn how to knit.\"These robots are \u2026 necessary for us as we create virtual worlds that become indistinguishable from the real one,\" Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia's vice president of simulation technology, said in a media briefing. The avatars are \"on a path to pass the Turing test,\" meaning that humans won't be able to tell if they're talking to a human or a bot, he said.To get to that future, though, Nvidia will face plenty of challenges. Chief among them is the \"uncanny valley,\" in which digital representations of humans are a hackle-raising blend of real and artificial. To human brains accustomed to the real thing, not-quite-real simulations can come across as creepy, not convincing.\n    Metaverse visions\n   Making the MetaverseThe Metaverse Will Be a Multi-Platform MessPeople Are Paying Millions For Land in the Metaverse. Here's WhyAnother question is whether the metaverse will live up to today's hype. Nvidia sees the metaverse as a visually rich 3D successor to the web, and Facebook believes in the metaverse so strongly that it renamed itself Meta. So far, however, only 23% percent of US adults are familiar with the metaverse, and the number is even lower elsewhere, according to analyst firm Forrester.Still, avatar technology could be central to how we'll present ourselves online, not just how we chat with bots. Today's grid of faces in a Zoom videoconference could become photorealistic 3D versions of ourselves seated around a virtual conference table in the metaverse. When it's time for something less serious, computers scanning our faces could apply our expressions instantly to the online personas others see, such as a cartoon character.Nvidia sees avatars not just as animated faces but also as full-fledged robots that perceive what's going on, draw on their own knowledge, and act accordingly. Those smarts will make them richly interactive agents in the metaverse, Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in his Siggraph speech.\"Avatars will populate virtual worlds to help us create and build things, to be the brand ambassador and customer service agent, help you find something on a website, take your order at a drive-through, or recommend a retirement or insurance plan,\" Huang said.     Graphics chip designer Nvidia hopes its hardware and software will let people create lifelike, animated avatars. NvidiaTo improve its avatars, Nvidia developed AI technology called Audio2Face that matches the avatar's expression to the words it's saying. A related Audio2Emotion tool changes facial expression according to its assessment of the feelings in the words, with control to let developers dial up the emotion or present a calm avatar.It's all built on a 3D framework including the human skeleton and muscles, said Simon Yuen, senior director of avatar technology. Nvidia lets people drag a photo into the avatar model, which then creates a 3D model of that person on the fly. Nvidia also offers controls to create hair strand by strand, complete with the ability to cut and style it.Nvidia has a lot riding on the technology. If the metaverse catches on, it could mean a big new market for 3D graphics processing coming at a time when its other businesses are threatened.On Monday,\u00a0Nvidia warned of worse than expected quarterly profits\u00a0as consumers' economic worries tanked sales of video game hardware. The\u00a0AI chips that Nvidia sells to data center customers\u00a0didn't fare as well as hoped, either. No wonder Nvidia wants to see us all chatting with avatars in the metaverse.The metaverse is \"the next evolution of the internet,\" Huang said. \"The metaverse is the internet in 3D, a network of connected, persistent, virtual worlds. The metaverse will extend 2D web pages into 3D spaces and worlds. Hyperlinking will evolve into hyperjumping between 3D worlds,\" he predicted.One sticky problem with that vision is that there\u00a0isn't yet a standard for developers to create metaverse realms the way they create web pages with the HTML standard. To solve that problem, Nvidia is backing and extending a format called Universal Scene Description originally created at movie animation studio Pixar.Nvidia is working hard to beef up USD so it can handle complex, changing 3D worlds, not just the series of preplanned scenes that make up frames in a Pixar movie. Among Nvidia's other allies are Apple, Adobe, Epic Games, Autodesk, BMW, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Industrial Light and Magic, and Dreamworks.Analyst firm ABI Research likes USD, too, saying Nvidia's Omniverse product for powering 3D realms has helped prove its worth and that other contenders haven't emerged despite lots of metaverse development.\u00a0\"In the absence of a preexisting alternative, ABI Research agrees with Nvidia's position to make USD a core metaverse standard -- both on its technical merits and to accelerate the momentum around the buildup to the metaverse,\" ABI said in a statement.    \n    Computing Guides\n   \n      Laptops\n     \n  \n          Best Laptop\n        \n          Best Chromebook\n        \n          Best Budget Laptop\n        \n          Best Cheap Gaming Laptop\n        \n          Best 2-in-1 Laptop\n        \n          Best Windows Laptop\n        \n          Best Macbook\n        \n          Best Gaming Laptop\n        \n          Best Macbook Deals\n        \n      Desktops & Monitors\n     \n  \n          Best Desktop PC\n        \n          Best Gaming PC\n        \n          Best Monitor Under 200\n        \n          Best Desktop Deals\n        \n          Best Monitors\n        \n          M2 Mac Mini Review\n        \n      Computer Accessories\n     \n  \n          Best PC Speakers\n        \n          Best Printer\n        \n          Best External Hard Drive SSD\n        \n          Best USB C Hub Docking Station\n        \n          Best Keyboard\n        \n          Best Webcams\n        \n          Best Mouse\n        \n          Best Laptop Backpack\n        \n      Photography\n     \n  \n          Best Camera to Buy\n        \n          Best Vlogging Camera\n        \n          Best Tripod\n        \n          Best Waterproof Camera\n        \n          Best Action Camera\n        \n          Best Camera Bag and Backpack\n        \n          Best Drone\n        \n      Tablets & E-Readers\n     \n  \n          Best E-Ink Tablets\n        \n          Best iPad Deals\n        \n          Best iPad\n        \n          Best E-Reader\n        \n          Best Tablet\n        \n          Best Android Tablet\n        \n      3D Printers\n     \n  \n          Best 3D Printer\n        \n          Best Budget 3D Printer\n        \n          Best 3D Printing Filament\n        \n          Best 3D Printer Deals\n                          Your guideto a better future DealsReviewsBest ProductsGift GuideCouponsVideosSoftware Downloads About CNET Press Room Newsletters Licensing Sitemap Careers Accessibility Cookie Settings Privacy Policy  Terms of Use Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information instagram youtube tiktok facebook x flipboard  US France Germany Japan Korea \n  \u00a9 2025 CNET, a Ziff Davis company.\n  All rights reserved.\n   \n\n\n"

No tagging required.\nThis might be a game-changing approach for many VFX, animation and videogame studios. Their artists won\u2019t have to spend time on sorting and tagging assets. This will also allow companies to re-use assets created in the past over many years by different teams, but that had never been tagged and sorted in a coherent manner, and were therefore useless.\nAs explained above, DeepSearch is now available in Omniverse Enterprise, a collaboration and simulation platform that you can try for free.\r\nNVIDIA also provides a practical example of how DeepSearch can be used. In the video below, ILM explains that thanks to DeepSearch, they can re-use their vast collection of photos of sky and terrain shot all over the world. And since DeepSearch allows users to use natural language, search requests such as \u201cgloomy moody sky\u201d can provide meaningful results.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lniYx78Bx48\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nShare on LinkedIn\nCopy the link\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUBJECTS: \n\n\n\nasset management  Deepsearch  NVIDIA  Omniverse  SIGGRAPH 2022 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Beno\u00eet Rogez \n\n\n\nEditor specialising in 3D and 2D/VFX/real time 3D/XR animation, trained as an engineer.

No problemNo green screen? No problemby  Jess WeatherbedAug 31, 2022, 1:00 PM UTCLinkFacebookThreadsImage: OBSJess Weatherbed is a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture. Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.Popular open-source streaming software OBS Studio is getting some new features, including AI-powered virtual backgrounds from Nvidia Broadcast that allow you to change your virtual environment without using a green screen.The feature is far from perfect and won\u2019t replace the quality of a physical green screen, but we can attest that it does a decent job. There\u2019s a bit of flickering and feathering when you move, but for streamers who scale down their webcams to a small corner of their broadcast, these problems won\u2019t be very noticeable. The quality can also be improved further with strong lighting and a clear background environment.Those who use an Nvidia RTX graphics card could probably already have the software installedStreamers often use the OBS broadcasting software on services like Twitch or YouTube. Previously, it was possible to use a virtual green screen in OBS via plugins, but Nvidia Broadcast will make the feature much more accessible. Those who use an Nvidia RTX graphics card could probably already have the software installed, and Nvidia Broadcast also integrates with lots of popular streaming hardware and applications.For example, Corsair integrated Nvidia Broadcast tools into its iCue and Elgato software back in July 2022, allowing those who rely on Corsair or Elgato hardware to utilize certain features such as its impressive background noise suppression. The Elgato Camera Hub also got access to Virtual Backgrounds at this time, allowing streamers to access Nvidia Broadcast tools without going to the app directly.Room echo removal is also being introduced to OBS to help cut back unwanted echoes during your streaming sessionsVirtual Backgrounds is the only Nvidia -specific feature added to the latest version of OBS (version 28.0) but there are other non-Nvidia Broadcast features coming to the service, such as support for high-efficiency video coding (HEVC or H.265) and high-dynamic range (HDR). This should improve video compression by around 15% (at least, according to OBS) and allow for higher quality streaming to supported services. No doubt some third-party testing will check how beneficial this feature actually is for real-world performance.Room echo removal is also being introduced to OBS to help cut back unwanted echoes during your streaming sessions, though it should be noted that this isn\u2019t listed as Nvidia Broadcast background noise suppression, and as such will likely be a direct OBS feature rather than a third-party integration.Version 28.0 of the app has been in beta since early August, but will be available for public download some time today.See More: CreatorsEntertainmentNewsNvidiaStreamingTechTwitchYouTubeMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
