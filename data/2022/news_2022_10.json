Not only has the company been working to position itself for key growth markets but those markets continue to show strength. The company is a US-based semiconductor company servicing the automotive and industrial community with power modules and management systems, signal control devices, motor control, IoT connectivity and timing, logic and memory solutions. Perhaps most importantly, for the times and the supply chain, it has numerous manufacturing locations in North America, the US specifically, and the EU that induce wafer fabrication and custom foundry services. That's a big selling point and sets the company apart from names like NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) in a world where semiconductor companies are desperately working to domesticate their own foundry operations. onsemi Has Strong Quarter, Shares Pull Back onsemi had a great fiscal Q3 in which revenue and adjusted margins all hit record highs. The company reported $2.2 billion in net revenue for a gain of 26.4% over last year and beat the consensus by a strong 370 basis points. The gains were driven by a double-digit gain in all 3 operating segments and leg by the ISG segment. ISG revenue grew by 10% sequentially and 45% YOY to outpace ASG and PSG by wide margins. The ASG and PSG segments both grew by 20% and 25% respectively last year and put in solid gains of their own. \"onsemi has delivered another quarter of record results stemming from continued growth in our focus markets of automotive and industrial. We remain confident in our long-term outlook as we continue to win where semiconductor content growth is accelerating for vehicle electrification, energy infrastructure, advanced safety and factory automation. We have taken a proactive and deliberate approach over the last several quarters to make the structural changes required to strengthen our business, and we are in a better position than ever to navigate the current uncertainty in the market,\" said Hassane El-Khoury, president and CEO of onsemi.The company delivered impressive results on the bottom line as well. The GAAP gross margin and EPS are slightly down from the prior year due to restructuring costs and non-cash impairments to goodwill and intangible assets but the adjusted margins are what counts. The adjusted operating margin came in at 35.4% which is up about 1,100 basis points from last year and beat the consensus estimates by quadruple digits as well. The adjusted $1.45 in EPS, which is also impacted by a lower share count, is up from last year's $0.87 and beat the industry estimate by $0.14. The takeaway is that FCF and LTM FCF both hit records as well and are helping the company to maintain a fortress balance sheet. The Analysts Are Supporting onsemi Share PricesThe analysts have not only been supporting onsemi share prices over the past year but they have been driving them higher. The Marketbeat.com consensus of 29 analysts is a steady, Moderate Buy that has been in place for well over a year and comes with an uptrending price target. The price target implies about 8% of upside for the stock based on the pre-release closing price and it is up almost 50% in the last year. Most of onsemi's analysts' calls tend to come out after it releases results so it is very possible this trend will continue. \n\n\n\nThe Technical Outlook: onsemi Could Spring To A New High The $73 consensus price target would put the stock very near a new all-time high and it could be exceeded over the next few months. The price action is down following the Q3 results but still above key support at the 30-day moving average. Assuming the market uses this as an entry point, the stock could easily move higher from here. The indicators are in line with upward movement as well and could lead the market up to the $97 level or higher. A move to a new high would be bullish, particularly if it is accompanied by some bullish commentary from the analysts, and it may trigger another wave of buying. If not, this stock will most likely stay range bound in the current range of $60 to $75, give or take. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWavy Line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWavy Line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Hughes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Want to be an Entrepreneur Leadership Network contributor?\n                \n  Apply now to join.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Editor's Pick                  \n\nRed Arrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Agents Can Help Businesses Be '10 Times More Productive,' According to a Nvidia VP.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Analyzing tech stocks through the prism of cultural change.Follow AuthorOct 25, 2022, 12:20pm EDTShareSaveCommentThis article is more than 2 years old.(Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nThere is a new battlefront in the cold war between the United States and China, and it is a big problem for technology investors.\n\nA filing from Nvidia (NVDA) in September revealed that the Biden Administration has banned sales in China of the company\u2019s high-end computer chips, a business worth billions. Shares plummeted.\n\n\nThe risk to tech share valuations is real. It is time to protect investments.\n\nThe goal of Washington policymakers is clear.\n\nThe Biden Administration sees China as a growing military threat and officials are determined to do everything possible to undermine that emergence. This strategy now includes weaponizing the dominant position of America-based technology firms like Nvidia. While nationalizing key intellectual property is a short term fix, in the absence of financial offsets, the longer-term impact to American innovators, and their stakeholders will be catastrophic.\n\nNvidia is a dynamic business. Under the leadership of Jensen Huang, chief executive officer, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company built a completely new microchip business out of the graphics processing units it originally designed for use in Xbox and PlayStation game consoles. Years of research, software development, and billions of dollars allowed GPUs to become the backbone of the artificial intelligence movement. The transformation of Nvidia, and the emergence of AI is a true American success story.\nHuang, rightfully sees broad uses cases for the Nvidia AI platform.\nHealthcare and telecommunication companies are currently using AI to design new drugs, and speed up digital networks. Climate researchers are even using Nvidia gear to tackle climate change.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nGPUs and AI systems are being quickly adopted by the world\u2019s largest cloud computing businesses. Their hyperscale data centers have become a key market for Nvidia, especially in Asia.\nBig Chinese companies such as Alibaba (BABA) have committed to use Nvidia\u2019s A100, and the next-generation H100 AI GPUs. The Asian eCommerce giant is in the process of using GPUs to remake its entire high performance computing platform, according to a report in August from Bloomberg.\n\nUnfortunately, the Biden Administration believes the A100 and H100 chips might also be used to build next-generation military devices. A September filing from Nvidia with the Securities and Exchange Commission says the sale of those processors to companies in China and Hong Kong are being specifically targeted. That business would have been worth $400 million alone in the current fiscal quarter.\n\n\nLosing that revenue will definitely hurt Nvidia shareholders. However, the bigger concern for tech investors is the White House might nationalize many other geopolitical strategic markets. This could range from biotechnology to materials science, and everything in between.\nThe policy is dangerous.\nTechnologies developed in the United States do not belong to the American people. They are owned by the shareholders of the companies that build them. Moreover, Nvidia is not selling weapons to China. The company is selling microchips to hyperscale data centers, and high-performance computing operators, presumably to process data. When the government unilaterally collapses a market for political leverage the process destroys shareholder value, and the incentive for American companies to invest in cutting-edge technologies.\nIt has been a rough ride in 2022 for Nvidia shareholders. The stock is down 55%, making it among the worst performing issues within the Nasdaq Composite Index. Shares may bounce this week ahead of the GTC developer conference starting on Tuesday, though. Huang is expected to talk about potential new markets for Nvidia\u2019s breakthrough H100 GPUs.\nAt a of $131.98, Nvidia shares trade at 29.4x forward earnings and 10.8x sales. Those ratios are significantly below historical levels marks, yet investors should still exercise caution. This is a different era. The cold war between the U.S. and emergent China means that geopolitics matter more than ever.\nBullish investors should expect substantial selling pressure on any near term rally into the $150 area. The longer-term support level is $126, the 200-week moving average. A decline below that level would put a whole new coloration on this bear market and thus is an absolute no-go zone.\nSafety is for suckers.

And if you've got a strong appetite for risk and a very short outlook, a host of new ETFs will allow you to make outsize bets, up or down, on some of the market's most meme-worthy stocks.Single-stock ETFs use derivatives to give you a leveraged or inverse position in stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Coinbase (COIN), Nvidia (NVDA), PayPal (PYPL), Tesla (TSLA) \u2013 even Nike (NKE) and Pfizer (PFE). A leveraged bet means your returns will be amplified beyond the underlying stock's performance; an inverse bet generally means you're expecting the underlying share price to fall.Should You Buy the Mobileye Self-Driving Car IPO?For example, the TSLA Bear Daily ETF (TSLQ, $38) from AXS Investments, an inverse ETF, will gain 5% on a day when Tesla shares drop 5%; Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 1.5X Shares (TSLL, $26) would deliver a 7.5% loss that day (or a 7.5% gain on a day Tesla stock is up 5%).\u00a0\n\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance\nBe a smarter, better informed investor.\n\n\nSave up to 74%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for Kiplinger\u2019s Free E-Newsletters\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.\n\n\n\n\nSign up\n\n\n\n\nMany of the new funds come with pricey expense ratios. Single-stock offerings from AXS and GraniteShares have a 1.15% expense ratio; Direxion has rolled out single-stock ETFs that charge 0.97%.\u00a0ETF analyst Aniket Ullal, of investment research firm CFRA, counts 16 single-stock ETFs so far, with collective assets of about $116 million. \"You're going to see a proliferation of these products, but only a handful will be successful,\" he predicts.Keep an Eye on the CalendarThe key to remember is that these funds are rebalanced daily, and they work best for traders with a similar time horizon.\u00a0\"These are very clearly tools for day traders \u2013 and I mean literally a day,\" says Dave Nadig, a financial futurist with investment research firm VettaFi.With these ETFs, the arithmetic of compounding simply doesn't work for someone expecting to earn the indicated daily return over a longer period, especially in a volatile or choppy market. In that scenario, for example, it would not be unusual to see a stock price finish flat after bouncing around over the course of a month or more while the ETF tracking the stock finishes down sharply over the period.\u00a019 Best Stocks to Buy Now for High Upside Potential\"I scratch my head and ask why any individual investor would need something like this, when realistically there's a high probability they could lose a lot of money,\" says Eric Diton, president of The Wealth Alliance, an investment advisory firm. \"There's enough octane in the stock market as is.\"Approval of the new securities from regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission in July came with reservations and caveats. \"I have expressed concern about leveraged and inverse ETFs before,\" said commissioner Caroline Crenshaw. \"I worry that these single-stock ETFs pose yet another, perhaps greater, risk for investors and the markets.\"The concept behind these securities isn't entirely new. Leveraged and inverse ETFs that track stock indexes have been around for years, as have single-stock ETFs in Europe.\u00a0For the narrow segment of high-conviction traders who monitor their portfolios daily and want to risk concentrated bets \u2013 let's say you believe an upcoming earnings report could be explosive for a particular stock, for instance \u2013 the ETFs provide convenience and even some downside protection. For example, traders using margin loans to effect the same kind of leverage risk losing more than the cost of their investment if the market moves against them.\u00a0\"With single-stock ETFs, you cannot lose more than you invest,\" says AXS CEO Greg Bassuk.\u00a0\"My view is that these ETFs have a place in the market,\" says CFRA's Ullal. \"But they need to be accompanied by a lot of investor education, a lot of disclosure and, hopefully, some responsible marketing on the part of the issuers.\"\u00a065 Best Dividend Stocks You Can Count On in 2022\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Kiplinger Today newsletter \u2014 freeProfit and prosper with the best of Kiplinger's advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and much more.

Enter colorful team-based battles, starring a diverse cast of characters, each with their own abilities. Travel the world, build a team, and contest a new range of objectives in new game modes. Overwatch 2 is an entirely new, fresh multiplayer experience, now designed around 5v5 combat. Download and play for free on Battle.net now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex launches today with Overwatch 2, reducing system latency by up to 60%, providing faster target acquisition, quicker reaction times, and the best aim precision. It only takes a single click to enable in Overwatch 2 in the OPTIONS --> VIDEO menu. \u00a0\nAnd because our new GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards and Reflex are #BeyondFast, Blizzard increased Overwatch 2\u2019s frame rate cap to 600 FPS, from the 400 FPS of Overwatch, ensuring competitive gamers and esports pros can get the ultimate experience when using our new, beyond fast GPUs. System latency on a GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU is as low as 8 milliseconds, and frame rates 500+ FPS at 1440p.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a NVIDIA Reflex gaming monitor and mouse, you can measure your own system\u2019s latency quickly and easily via GeForce Experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOverwatch 2 absolutely shines on the highest \u2018Epic\u2019 setting with a GeForce RTX 4080, and even in a climactic team fight, the game has never been smoother or more responsive\u201d -John Lafleur, Technical Director, Overwatch\nWith your frame rates boosted to the stratosphere, and your system latency virtually undetectable, your next step towards top tier competitiveness is upgrading your gaming monitor. NVIDIA G-SYNC esports displays are specifically designed for high frame rate gaming in competitive titles, improving image clarity and reducing motion blur, and eliminating tearing. If you\u2019re a competitive gamer or esports pro, these are the very best monitors for upping your game.\nThis fall, G-SYNC esports displays will get even better with the launch of new 27\u201d 1440p, 360Hz models from ASUS. Our research found that 1440p 27\u201d displays can improve aiming by up to 3% over traditional 1080p 24\u201d displays, when aiming at small targets, such as an enemy\u2019s head.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorOct 07, 2022, 06:02pm EDTShareSaveCommentThis article is more than 2 years old.Omniverse is not a toy; it enables digital twins of the real world as it exists, or as it will become. \nA few weeks ago I read an article on another media platform that asserted the need for the metaverse to embrace users beyond the creative teams of game developers and entertainment studios. Specifically teams of designers, engineers, marketeers, and manufacturing can collaborate throughout the design and implementation process in a virtual 3D world. Unfortunately, the author focussed on the lack of a strategy to do so at Apple\nAAPL\n and Meta, instead of pointing to NVIDIA\nNVDA\n\nDIA\n as the poster child of already doing exactly that. While other metaverse implementations may be entertaining, NVIDIA\u2019s omniverse digital twins creates comprehensive and photo-realistic design platforms for professional teams to enable better designs with fewer costly mistakes in less time.\n\n Rimac Nevera 3D Car Configurator was developed and configured on the NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud.NVIDIA\nUnlike Apple and Meta, NVIDIA Omniverse Connects the Virtual and the Physical Worlds\nWhile artistic talent can use a metaverse to create and host a 3D communication and interaction platform (aka, a game), the environment envisioned by these companies do not extend to the real world. They are not populated with objects based on high-res volumetric design and material specifications. They are rendered, but not simulated. They aren\u2019t real.\n\n\nThese platforms are designed to inform, entertain, and socialize its users to maximize the amount of time they spend in the virtual world. More time translates into more revenue from advertising and services for the platform or game provider. But you cannot hand off a virtual dragon to the biology department and say \u201cOk, this is done. Go build one.\u201d With Omniverse, you can. Ok, perhaps not a dragon, but an aircraft engine? A working model for a heart to be used guide a catheter and stent? Sure.\n\nI heard an interesting comment at GTC from Rev Lebaredian, head of NVIDIA Omniverse, to the effect that the initial market for Omniverse was expected to be the content creation community; creators of games, animation, etc. But it turns out that companies like Amazon\nAMZN\n, AT&T, BMW, Ericsson, Foxconn, GM, Kroger\nKR\n, Lowe\u2019s, Mattel, Pepsico, Siemens, Sony, Universal Robots, and Valeo are using Omniverse to model reality (as digital twins) in the metaverse to improve operations and designs. \u201cIts happening a lot faster that I had thought,\u201d, says Mr. Lebaredian. \u201cCompanies that have figured this out will have superpowers and blow past the rest of the field.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe technology is finally reaching critical mass of users, connections, and applications where people around the world are doing real work in the un-real world. While the creative sector provided the initial impetus for virtual worlds using animation, industrial concerns are realizing tremendous benefits from the engineering simulation available on the NVIDIA Omniverse. As the video above shows, BMW is using Omniverse to imagine and analyze factories before they are built.\n\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\nConclusions\nThe metaverse is hardly just a game. In fact, Meta has said the future will require 500 times today\u2019s computing capacity. Some estimate that the infrastructure needed for the metaverse will amount to some $13-$16T by the end of this decade. NVIDIA plans to own the part of that infrastructure where reality and virtuality intersect.\nWith Omniverse, being able to assess different possible futures becomes not only possible, it will become main-stream.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Disclosures: This article expresses the opinions of the authors, and is not to be taken as advice to purchase from nor invest in the companies mentioned.

Price Target $52) or\u00a0Western Digital Corp\u00a0WDC (Neutral; Price Target $40), but he believes YMTC already has the equipment to ramp wafers through 2023E.\nWhile he believes MU is positioned well with new roadmap ramps, near-term headwinds remain into 2023E with softening demand for PC and handsets and a deteriorating pricing environment for DRAM and NAND as the industry remains modestly oversupplied.\u00a0\nWDC has executed well overall, but he sees NAND trending even softer into 2H22 and 2023E as demand paused for PCs and handsets with inventory correction.\u00a0\nHe also sees emerging entrants into the NAND landscape, such as YMTC, bringing on capacity in 2023E and beyond, with NAND oversupply likely to continue, impacting pricing and margins.\u00a0\u00a0\nThere could be expanded restrictions from AI or GPUs to include compute, CPU, and data center, an increased negative to\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices, Inc\u00a0AMD (Buy; Price Target $125) or\u00a0NVIDIA Corp\u00a0NVDA (Buy; Price Target $205).\nThe restrictions on >128L NAND and <18nm DRAM memory equipment sales and the possible addition of YMTC to the entity list could be harmful to WFE, with 2023E WFE downside to as low as <$80 billion.\u00a0\nHe believes AMD is well positioned and has a significant opportunity to gain server share targets and upcoming game console launches.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile NVDA's valuations were steep, he believes improving PCs, AI deep learning and inferencing markets, gaming trends, automotive, and data center position it for upside to estimates.\u00a0\nNVDA is also well positioned for the growing machine learning, deep learning, and AI markets driving 10-11x performance versus CPUs, in his view.\u00a0\nHis NVDA price target reflects its >90% market share in critical high-margin Data Center AI.\u00a0\nPrice Action:\u00a0MU shares traded higher by 0.91% at $54.45 on the last check Wednesday.\n\nAMDAdvanced Micro Devices Inc$103.83-0.73%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum11.93Growth82.27Quality87.35Value13.53Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewMUMicron Technology Inc$102.50-0.59%NVDANVIDIA Corp$116.81-2.28%WDCWestern Digital Corp$44.39-0.81%Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

However, it has opened doors for the best bargain stocks to buy. Fundamentally, all eyes point to the Federal Reserve. In order to mitigate the excesses of monetary stimulus that occurred in the early phase of the coronavirus pandemic, the Fed committed to a hawkish policy. Unfortunately, the subsequent rise of borrowing costs reduces business sentiment.  Essentially, companies will seek fewer financing measures to support expansion. In turn, fewer dollars will end up chasing more goods, which is deflationary across the board. Unfortunately, this dynamic clouds equities, particularly those driven toward growth. At the same time, astute investors can use this time to target the best bargain stocks to buy. What\u2019s going on in the market is simply a reassessment. Now that companies will likely not grow as much based on the new monetary paradigm, they received a fundamental downgrade. However, this downgrading can sometimes be too aggressive based on the impacted companies\u2019 financial resilience or fundamental relevance. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips That\u2019s where potential upside prospects arise from the best bargain stocks to buy. Below are a few compelling ideas.  ACNAccenture$258.16 CSCOCisco$40.99 FIVEFive Below$136.23 KMIKinder Morgan$17.44 PAYCPaycom$317.62 NFLXNetflix$242.04 NVDANvidia$116.81  Accenture (ACN)   A photo of the Accenture (ACN) logo in silver and white on a silver, reflective wall outside a building.   Source: Tada Images/ShutterStock.com Accenture (NYSE:ACN) specializes in information technology services and consulting. Given the dour market environment, particularly rising fears of a global recession, the consultation business isn\u2019t exactly thriving. Since the start of this year, ACN plunged 38%, making it a risky venture. Nevertheless, Accenture belongs on this list of best bargain stocks to buy because Wall Street appears to be discounting its myriad of financial strengths. Per Gurufocus.com, ACN rates as modestly undervalued based on its proprietary calculations. On the top line, Accenture features a three-year revenue growth rate of 13%, ranked better than 65% of the competition.  On the bottom line, the company features an operating margin of 15%, far higher than the industry median of 2.8%. In addition, Accenture has a return on equity of 33%, reflecting a high-quality business. Plus, as a nice bonus, the company pays a dividend of nearly 1.8%. While not much, it exceeds the technology sector\u2019s average yield of 1.37%. Cisco (CSCO)   the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall   Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Hardly the most exciting name among the best bargain stocks to buy, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) nevertheless deserves a close look. Per its corporate profile, Cisco develops, manufactures, and sells networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment and other high-technology services and products. The company enjoys relevance in burgeoning fields, such as the Internet of Things and domain security.   Story Continues Despite representing a pertinent business profile, Wall Street carries a dim view on CSCO. On a year-to-date basis, the stock fell over 36%, reflecting on paper substantial risks. Still, it appears that investors at large ignore Cisco\u2019s robust financials. Per Gurufocus.com, CSCO is modestly undervalued.One of the key factors to consider is the company\u2019s return on equity. Standing at 29%, this metric ranks better than over 94% of the competition. Fundamentally, this stat means that Cisco is highly efficient in converting equity financing into profits.\u00a0As well, investors of best bargain stocks to buy should note that Cisco features a forward yield of 3.78%. That\u2019s not something to ignore in this day and age.Five Below (FIVE)  storefront of a five below  Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWithout getting into any political discussions, when I see Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) and its performance in the chart, I can\u2019t help but think about President Joe Biden and his famous quip: \u201cCome on, man!\u201d Per its corporate profile, Five Below is an American chain of specialty discount stores that sells products that are less than $5, plus a small assortment of products from $6 to $25.Under the present circumstances where the American public anticipates higher inflation, a discount retailer like Five Below makes perfect sense. Under a theoretical deflationary environment, Five Below would still make perfect sense. How so? If the Fed ends up generating deflation, that would almost certainly mean mass-scale job losses. So, while purchasing power would increase, it would likely increase for the wrong reasons.Anyways, we don\u2019t need to spend too much time in theoretical speculations. Instead, Gurufocus.com rates FIVE as significantly undervalued. Investors simply need to consider its excellent income statement-related performances. Its three-year revenue growth rate substantially runs past most of the competition. As well, the company has a return on equity of 22%, rating better than nearly 82% of the competition.Kinder Morgan (KMI)  Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.  Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comOne of the largest energy infrastructure companies in the U.S., Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is one of the best bargain stocks to buy based on its pertinence to both the American economy and national security. Per its corporate profile, Kinder Morgan owns an interest in or operates approximately 83,000 miles of pipelines and 143 terminals. In other words, it\u2019s a midstream player.As the connection between upstream (exploration and production) and downstream (refining and marketing), midstream players like Kinder Morgan benefit from inelastic demand at the baseline of consumption. In other words, irrespective of wider economic conditions, people need to get from point A to point B. Therefore, Kinder is a vital cog to the kinesis of the U.S. economy. In turn, it\u2019s also important to national security since lack of infrastructure can lead to chaos.Financially, Gurufocus.com rates KMI as modestly undervalued. Its key strength centers on consistent profitability. In fact, the company features 10 years of consecutive profits, providing confidence in uncertain times. As well, Kinder offers a forward yield of 6.46%.Paycom (PAYC)  calculator, pen, paper and a binder that says \"payroll\" on the side  Source: ShutterstockBased in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Paycom (NYSE:PAYC) is an American online payroll and human resource technology provider. Fundamentally, the company derives its value by allowing its enterprise-level clients to enjoy online payroll services and HR software solutions. During the work-from-home pivot at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, PAYC quickly skyrocketed due to obvious relevance.Nowadays, Wall Street has soured on the concept. Since the start of this year, PAYC dipped 26%. Because of global recession fears, many companies believe that layoffs will be necessary. Logically, a reduced workforce doesn\u2019t spell a bright future for Paycom. However, the discount in its share price could be overdone. After all, it\u2019s not like every company will reduce payroll by 100%.In addition, Gurufocus.com rates PAYC as significantly undervalued. On both the top and bottom lines, Paycom features strong performance metrics. At the same time, Paycom also enjoys a robust balance sheet. With a cash-to-debt ratio of 9.62x, which is \u00a0better than 63% of the industry, Paycom can weather the coming storm.Netflix (NFLX)  An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed across  Source: xalien / ShutterstockThe volatility directed at streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) should not surprise anyone. During the onset of the pandemic, NFLX soared as the underlying business benefitted from a hostage audience (quite literally). Now that government agencies reduced or outright eliminated mobility restrictions, Netflix suffered significant subscriber losses.Still, NFLX represents one of the best bargain stocks to buy, in part because management is fighting back. In early November, Netflix will launch its advertisement-drive subscription tier, which should help bring subscribers back. As well, the company still provides compelling content that resonates with fans. This brand cachet is probably not going away anytime soon.Financially, Gurufocus.com rates NFLX as significantly undervalued. Anchored by a reasonably solid balance sheet, Netflix also commands double-digit three-year revenue growth rates that rank among the top echelon of the industry. Finally, Netflix features a return on equity of 31.2%, ranked better than 93% of the competition.Nvidia (NVDA)  Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green trees  Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comEasily one of the hardest-hit sectors during the Covid-19 crisis was the semiconductor space. Facing severe supply chain disruptions, companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) struggled to feed demand efficiently. Now that consumer sentiment shifted in the wrong direction, the sector may suffer an inventory glut problem.To be fair, it\u2019s not time to hit the panic button. For instance, in the fiscal year ended January 2020, Nvidia\u2019s days inventory hit over 112. One year later, it slipped to 81.5. Now, on a trailing-12-month basis, we\u2019re looking at nearly 87. Further, other elements such as sharply reduced demand for cryptocurrency-mining graphics processing units don\u2019t help.However, NVDA still qualifies as one of the best bargain stocks to buy. For one thing, market segments like cryptos will likely pick back up again at some point. Moreover, Nvidia\u2019s business rates as significantly undervalued. Broadly speaking, the company enjoys robust strengths across the board. As well, Nvidia is a high-quality name, with a return on equity of nearly 32% that beats out 89% of semiconductor firms.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The collaboration aims to bring the full NVIDIA accelerated computing stack \u2014 from GPUs to systems to software \u2014 to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).\nOCI is adding tens of thousands more NVIDIA GPUs, including the A100 and upcoming H100, to its capacity. Combined with OCI\u2019s AI cloud infrastructure of bare metal, cluster networking, and storage, this provides enterprises a broad, easily accessible portfolio of options for AI training and deep learning inference at scale.\n\u201cTo drive long-term success in today\u2019s business environment, organizations need answers and insight faster than ever,\u201d said Safra Catz, CEO, Oracle. \u201cOur expanded alliance with NVIDIA will deliver the best of both companies\u2019 expertise to help customers across industries \u2014 from healthcare and manufacturing to telecommunications and financial services \u2014 overcome the multitude of challenges they face.\u201d\n\u201cAccelerated computing and AI are key to tackling rising costs in every aspect of operating businesses,\u201d said Jensen Huang, CEO and founder, NVIDIA. \u201cEnterprises are increasingly turning to cloud-first AI strategies that enable fast development and scalable deployment. Our partnership with Oracle will put NVIDIA AI within easy reach for thousands of companies.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nNVIDIA AI Coming to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\nNVIDIA and Oracle have been serving enterprises together for years with accelerated computing instances and software available via OCI. With the full NVIDIA AI platform available on OCI instances, the extended partnership is designed to accelerate AI-powered innovation for a broad range of industries to better serve customers and support sales.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise, the globally adopted software of the NVIDIA AI platform, includes essential processing engines for each step of the AI workflow, from data processing and AI model training to simulation and large-scale deployment. NVIDIA AI enables organizations to develop predictive models to automate business processes and gain rapid business insights with applications such as conversational AI, recommender systems, computer vision and more. The parties plan to make an upcoming release of NVIDIA AI Enterprise available on OCI, providing customers with easy access to NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated, secure and scalable platform for end-to-end AI development and deployment.\nAdditionally, Oracle is now offering early access to NVIDIA RAPIDS acceleration for Apache Spark data processing on the OCI Data Flow fully managed Apache Spark service. Data processing is one of the top cloud computing workloads. To support this demand, OCI Data Science plans to offer support for OCI bare-metal shapes, including BM.GPU.GM4.8 with NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, across managed notebook sessions, jobs and model deployment.\nNVIDIA Clara\u2122, a healthcare AI and HPC application framework for medical imaging, genomics, natural language processing and drug discovery, is also coming soon. Oracle and NVIDIA are additionally collaborating on new AI-accelerated Oracle Cerner offerings for healthcare, which span analytics, clinical solutions, operations, patient management systems and more.\nOracle and NVIDIA CEOs to Discuss Driving Business Success at Oracle CloudWorld\nTune in to the Oracle CloudWorld keynote today at 9 a.m. PT, or watch on-demand to see Huang will join Catz to discuss the expanded partnership.\nAbout Oracle CloudWorld\r\nOracle CloudWorld is Oracle\u2019s largest global celebration of customers and partners.

In a tight, closely competitive competition between it and AMD, software has always been one of the key differentiators. In the last hardware generation, Nvidia added a new piece of software that I casually dismissed - but as the 3000 series generation drew to a close, I finally tried it - and found myself hooked on it.\r\n\n\r\nI\u2019m talking about Nvidia Reflex, a little bonus software option that uses your fancy high-end graphics hardware and various clever methods to reduce the input lag between your input devices - primarily keyboard and mouse, of course, but this\u2019d also work with controllers - in turn theoretically making you more deadly in-game.\r\n\n\n\n\n[Sponsored] Nvidia Reflex - PC vs PlayStation 5 Input Lag - Lowering Latency For Better Gaming\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\r\nWhen the 30-series first launched, I dabbled with Reflex but never really paid it too much attention. I was more interested in improved versions of the frame-rate boosting DLSS, and how it\u2019d let me crank up the visual fidelity and real-time lighting in newer games like Cyberpunk 2077. But recently, I returned to Reflex  - and in that return, I realized what an impressive tool it is.\r\n\n\r\nWe talk a lot about frame rate and network latency in games, but we don\u2019t nearly as often talk about system latency. I\u2019ve always been aware of it - in my competitive RTS days, I refused to use a wireless mouse, superstitious that doing so invited more lag. I\u2019ve read in-depth articles about which arcade sticks induce the fastest on-screen response time. But that was about the limit. You\u2019d get the best peripherals available and that was it; there were no other steps to limit or offset it. Which is where Nvidia Reflex comes in.\r\n\n\r\nNvidia has a single app to thank for my conversion to a fan of the tool - a little Overwatch test map designed strictly to demonstrate what Reflex does for you in real time. Basically: you\u2019re locked in place, with a sniper rifle, and another character repeatedly dashes through a distant doorway. You try to click the mouse to fire as they dash past - first with Reflex off, and then you turn it on. The difference is night-and-day. Some testing has even shown that Reflex is as good as using the in-game frame limiter - which means you can have that sweet, unlocked frame rate while keeping lag minimal. \r\n\n\r\nI knew this was what Reflex did, of course, both from mild experimentation and from Nvidia\u2019s 2021 marketing blitz. But it wasn\u2019t until I sat down with Overwatchl that I realized just how useful the tool would be for even a mid-tier scrub like me. When I saw Nvidia\u2019s marketing, I thought, you know - at my level of play, what difference would a couple of milliseconds make? I\u2019m not in the Overwatch League. But then\u2026 I tried it.\r\n\n\r\nAnd I guess you need to try it to believe it. I went from making like one headshot in twelve to doing nine or ten. It\u2019s a big difference. The main thing I couldn\u2019t believe is how big an improvement it made to me, with my average reactions and out-of-practice FPS skills. \r\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Powered Low Latency Overwatch SLO-MO Video\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\r\nThe result is that if Reflex is available in a game, I\u2019m turning it on. It\u2019s in Overwatch 2, but is also available in a range of other games including Rainbow Six Siege & Extraction, Fortnite, Apex Legends, and a range of Call of Duty games. There\u2019s even some less twitch-intensive campaign-focused games in the mix like Deathloop, and some non-shooters like God of War and iRacing. I can see a case for this lag reduction in a lot of games, in fact - I salivate at the idea this could come to Street Fighter 6 (Capcom, Nvidia - make it happen). \r\n\n\r\nAMD has its own lag-reduction technology too, but in the testing and reading I\u2019ve done, it doesn\u2019t appear to be as impressive as Nvidia\u2019s. But furthermore, one thing that keeps driving Nvidia forward is how their various technologies are meshing and interacting.\r\n\n\r\nFor Reflex, this is best demonstrated in Cyberpunk 2077, where on the new 4000-series GPUs, starting with the RTX 4090, you can run the game at well over 120fps on maxed-out settings thanks to DLSS 3, a new upgrade to that separate piece of technology. The catch? By generating extra frames, which is what DLSS 3 does, it induces extra lag. Nvidia\u2019s solution is so simple as to be elegant - Cyberpunk 2077 compatibility with Reflex. DLSS 3 Raises your frame rate at the cost of extra latency - but then Reflex reduces latency, offsetting the \u2018damage\u2019 DLSS 3 does. The result is a game that feels the same or better, but with that sky-high frame rate and mega settings.\r\n\n\r\nIn this sense, one can see how a combination of DLSS 3 and Reflex can form something of a killer app for the GeForce RTX technology. You can see how it might be the future of maximizing settings and visuals without hurting the rest of your experience. But even without that, I\u2019ve been thrilled and impressed with Reflex in shooters as a raw latency reduction tool. It\u2019s not just for top-rank esports nerds! I only wish I\u2019d started using it sooner. \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            Blizzard is working with, uh, Blizzard to celebrate World of Warcraft's 20th anniversary with some Overwatch 2 skins\n          \n\n\n\n            First F1, the World Cup, and golf \u2013 now esports: gaming\u2019s biggest ever sports-washing tournament starts today\n          \n\n\n\n            Activision Blizzard is hiring senior staff for a brand-new game\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAlex Donaldson: Alex has been writing about video games for decades, first getting his start as an enthusiast blogger before 'going pro' in the mid-2000s.

Moreover, the stock is expected to witness a further decline amid sky-high inflation, supply chain issues, weakening demand, and increasing export restrictions. Despite slowing growth, NVDA continues to remain highly profitable. So, let\u2019s find out if this stock is a buy or sell in the fourth quarter\u2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Mangeet Kaur Bouns Oct 26, 2022  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular Stories\n\n\u2022 Has the Next Bear Market Already Arrived?\n\u2022 How Low Will Stocks Go?\n\u2022 Why is Stock Market Outlook So Uncertain?\n\u2022 Trump or the Fed More Important to Stock Investors?\n\u2022 Investors in \u201cWait and See\u201d Mode\nView All Top stories\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) offers graphics, computing, and networking solutions in the United States, Taiwan, China, and internationally. The company operates through two segments: Graphics and Compute & Networking. It sells its products to original equipment and device manufacturers, independent software vendors, internet and cloud service providers, mapping companies, and other ecosystem participants.\nThe company reported disappointing fiscal 2023 second-quarter results and provided a weak outlook for the third quarter. Its revenue is expected to be $5.90 billion, plus or minus $118 million, which accounts for a nearly 12% sequential decline. Gaming and Professional Visualization revenue is expected to decline sequentially as OEMs and channel partners reduce inventory levels to align with slowing demand.\nMoreover, increasing export regulations are impacting NVDA. On October 7, new export restrictions were imposed on U.S. chipmakers, including NVDA, to prevent American technology from advancing China\u2019s military power. The rules will require the companies to obtain a license from the Commerce Department to export advanced chips and chip-manufacturing equipment to Chinese entities.\nFurthermore, last month, the U.S. government blocked NVDA from exporting two of its top computing chips, A100 and H100 graphic processing units, for artificial intelligence (AI) work to China. The company stated that the ban is expected to impact its revenue by $400 million in the current quarter.\n\n\nThe stock has plunged 33.4% over the past six months and 56% year-to-date to close the last trading session at $132.61. It is currently trading 61.7% below its 52-week high of $346.47, which it hit on November 22, 2021.\nHere\u2019s what could influence NVDA\u2019s performance in the upcoming months:\nDeteriorating Financials\nNVDA\u2019s non-GAAP gross profit declined 29.1% year-over-year to $3.07 billion for the fiscal 2023 second quarter ended July 31, 2022. Its non-GAAP operating expenses increased 38.1% year-over-year to $1.75 billion.\n10 STOCKS TO SELL NOW!The company\u2019s non-GAAP net income fell 50.7% year-over-year to $1.29 billion. In addition, its non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.51, down 51% year-over-year.\nUnfavorable Analyst Estimates\nAnalysts expect NVDA\u2019s revenue for the fiscal 2023 third quarter (ending October 2022) to decline 17.7% year-over-year to $5.85 billion. The consensus earnings per share estimate of $0.71 for the current quarter indicates a decline of 39.5% from the prior-year period. Likewise, the company\u2019s EPS for the ongoing year (ending January 2023) is expected to come in at $3.36, down 24.3% year-over-year.\nIn addition, analysts expect the company\u2019s revenue and EPS for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ending April 2023) to decline 19.1% and 32.9% year-over-year to $6.70 billion and $0.91, respectively.\n\n\nStretched Valuation\nIn terms of forward non-GAAP P/E, NVDA is currently trading at 30.42x, 84.7% higher than the industry average of 16.47x.

Also, its forward EV/EBITDA of 49.45x is 320.4% higher than the industry average of 11.76x.\nIn addition, in terms of forward Price/Sales, the stock is currently trading at 12.21x, 387.3% higher than the industry average of 2.51x. Its forward Price/Cash Flow multiple of 44.68 is 168.9% higher than the industry average of 16.62.\nHigh Profitability\nNVDA\u2019s trailing-12-month gross profit margin of 60.45% is 20.1% higher than the 50.35% industry average. Its trailing-12-month EBITDA margin of 35.91% is 196% higher than the 12.13% industry average. Likewise, the stock\u2019s trailing-12-month net income margin of 26.03% compares to the industry average of 3.71%.\nFurthermore, NVDA\u2019s trailing-12-month ROCE, ROTC, and ROTA of 34.41%, 16.81%, and 17.81% compare to the industry averages of 6.51%, 3.80%, and 2.25%, respectively.\nPOWR Ratings Reflect Bleak Prospects\nNVDA has an overall D rating, equating to Sell in our POWR Ratings system.

The updates simplify repetitive tasks and make advanced effects accessible.\nCreators equipped with GeForce RTX GPUs, especially those part of the new RTX 40 Series, are primed to benefit from remarkable GPU acceleration of AI features in Adobe Creative Cloud.\nAdobe Premiere Pro\nAdobe Premiere Pro is getting RTX acceleration for AI features, resulting in significant performance boosts on AI effects. For example, the Unsharp Mask filter will see an increase of 4.5x, and the Posterize Time effect of over 2x compared to running them on a CPU (performance measured on RTX 3090 Ti and Intel i9 12900K).\n\nAdobe Photoshop\nThe new beta Photo Restoration feature uses AI-powered neural filters to process imagery, add tone and minimize the effects of film grain. Photo Restoration can be applied to a single image or batches of imagery to quickly and conveniently improve the picture quality of an artist\u2019s portfolio.\nPhoto Restoration adds tone and minimizes the effects of film grain in Adobe Photoshop.\nPhotoshop\u2019s AI-powered Object Selection Tool allows artists to apply a selection to a particular object within an image. The user can manipulate the selected object, add filters and fine-tune details.\nThe AI-powered Object Selection Tool in Adobe Photoshop saves artists the trouble of tedious masking.\nThis saves the huge amount of time it takes artists to mask imagery \u2014 and in beta on the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is 3x faster than the Intel UHD Graphics 700 and 4x faster than the Apple M1 Ultra.\nAdobe Photoshop Lightroom Classic\nThe latest version of Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Classic makes it easy for users to create stunning final\u00a0 images with powerful new AI-powered masking tools.\n\nWith just a few clicks, these AI masks can identify and mask key elements within an image, including the main subject, sky and background, and can even select individuals within an image and apply masks to adjust specific areas, such as hair, face, eyes or lips.\nAdobe Substance 3D\nSubstance 3D Modeler is now available in general release. Modeler can help create concept art \u2014 it\u2019s perfect for sketching and prototyping, blocking out game levels, crafting detailed characters and props, or sculpting an entire scene in a single app. Its ability to switch between desktop and virtual reality is especially useful, depending on project needs and the artist\u2019s preferred style of working.\nThe ability to switch between desktop and virtual reality is especially useful in Adobe Substance 3D Modeler.\nSubstance 3D Sampler added its photogrammetry feature, currently in private beta, which automatically converts photos of real-world objects into textured 3D models without the need to fiddle with sliders or tweak values. With a few clicks, the artist can now create 3D assets. This feature serves as a bridge for 2D artists looking to make the leap to 3D.\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud and Substance 3D\nThese advancements join the existing lineup of GPU-accelerated and AI-enhanced Adobe apps, with features that continue to evolve and improve:\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/In_the_NVIDIA_Studio-Moving_Elements.mp4\n\u00a0\n\nAdobe Camera RAW \u2014 AI-powered Select Objects and Select People masking tools\nAfter Effects \u2014 Improved AI-powered Scene Edit Detection and H.264 rendering for faster exports with hardware-accelerated output\nIllustrator \u2014 Substance 3D materials plugin for faster access to assets and direct export of Universal Scene Description (USD) files\nLightroom Classic \u2014 AI-powered Select Background and Select Sky masking tools\nPhotoshop \u2014 Substance 3D materials plugin\nPhotoshop Elements \u2014 AI-powered Moving Elements add motion to a still image\nPremiere Elements \u2014 AI-powered Artistic Effects transform clips with effects inspired by famous works of art or popular art styles\nPremiere Pro \u2014 Adds Auto Color to apply intelligent color corrections to video clips such as exposure, white balance and contrast that enhance footage,\u00a0 GPU-accelerated Lumetri scopes and faster Motion Graphics Templates\nSubstance 3D Painter \u2014 SBSAR Exports for faster exports and custom textures that are easy to plug and play, plus new options to apply blending modes and opacity\n\nTry these features on an NVIDIA Studio system equipped with a GeForce RTX GPU, and experience the ease and speed of RTX-accelerated creation.\nOctober NVIDIA Studio Driver\u00a0\nThis NVIDIA Studio Driver provides optimal support for the latest new creative applications including Topaz Sharpen AI and DXO Photo.

She has a fascination with AI \u2014 both the technology it\u2019s built on and its ever-expanding role in content creation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting debate where the \u2018art\u2019 starts when it comes to AI,\u201d said Natter. \u201cAfter almost a year of playing with AI, I\u2019ve been working on developing my own style and figuring out how I can make it mine.\u201d\nAI meets RTX-accelerated Photoshop Neural Filters.\nIn the image above, Natter applied Photoshop Neural Filters, which were accelerated by her GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. \u201cIt\u2019s always a good idea to use your own art for filters, so you can give everything a unique touch. So if you ask me if this is my art or not, it 100% is!\u201d said the artist.\nNatter has a strong passion for photogrammetry, she said, as virtually anything can be preserved in 3D. Photogrammetry features have the potential to save 3D artists countless hours. \u201cI create hyperrealistic 3D models of real-life objects which I could not have done by hand,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, maybe I could\u2019ve, but it would\u2019ve taken forever.\u201d\nThe artist even scanned her sweet pup Szikra to create a virtual 3D copy of her that will last forever.\nSzikra is forever memorialized in 3D, thanks to the beta photogrammetry feature in Sampler.\nTo test the private beta photogrammetry feature in Substance 3D Sampler, Natter created this realistic tree model with a single series of images.\n2D to 3D made easy with Substance 3D Sampler.\nNatter captured a video of a tree in a nearby park in her home country of Germany. The artist then uploaded the footage to Adobe After Effects, exporting the frames into an image sequence. After Effects contains over 30 features accelerated by RTX GPUs, which improved Natter\u2019s workflow.\nOnce she was happy with the 3D image quality, Natter dropped the model from Substance 3D Sampler into Substance 3D Stager. The artist then applied true-to-life materials and textures to the scene and color matched the details to the scanned model with the Stager color picker.\nSelecting areas to apply textures in Adobe Substance 3D Stager.\nNatter then lit the scene with a natural outdoor High Dynamic Range Image (HDRI), one of the pre-built environment-lighting options in 3D Stager. \u201cWhat I really like about the Substance 3D suite is that it cuts the frustration out of my workflow, and I can just do my thing in a flow state, without interruption, because everything is compatible and works together so well,\u201d she said.\nFine details like adding bugs from Adobe Stock helped Natter nail the scene.\nThe GeForce RTX 3090 GPU accelerated her workflow within 3D Stager, with RTX-accelerated and AI-powered denoising in the viewport unlocking interactivity and smooth movement. When it came time to render, RTX-accelerated ray tracing quickly delivered photorealistic 3D renders, up to 7x faster than with CPU alone.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had an NVIDIA GPU since I\u2019ve been working in video editing for the past decade and wanted hardware that works best with my apps. The GeForce RTX 3090 has made my life so much easier, and everything gets done so much faster.\u201d \u2014 3D artist Anna Natter\nCaptions can be easily applied in Adobe Substance 3D Stager.\nNatter can\u2019t contain her excitement for the eventual general release of the Sampler photogrammetry feature. \u201cAs someone who has invested so much in 3D design, I literally can\u2019t wait to see what people are going to create with this,\u201d she said.\n3D designer and creative explorer Anna Natter.\nCheck out Natter\u2019s Behance page.\nMAXimum Exposure in the #From2Dto3D Challenge\u00a0\nNVIDIA Studio wants to see your 2D to 3D progress!\nJoin the #From2Dto3D challenge this month for a chance to be featured on the NVIDIA Studio social media channels, like @JennaRambles, whose goldfish sketch was transformed into a beautiful 3D image.\n\nDoes this tiny sketch count? \ud83d\ude05#From2Dto3D https://t.co/Jrjpezds6N pic.twitter.com/LkX5TtL6lz\n\u2014 Ebb N Flow (@JennaRambles) October 4, 2022\n\nEntering is easy.

See our ethics statement.by  Tom WarrenOct 11, 2022, 1:00 PM UTCLinkFacebookThreadsIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeTom Warren is a senior editor and author of Notepad, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.I had to triple-check my benchmarks over and over during this review because I couldn\u2019t quite believe my eyes. The RTX 4090 is a beast of a graphics card that marks a new era for PC gaming, where the high frames I\u2019ve been getting used to at 1440p are now available in 4K.Coupled with Nvidia\u2019s latest update to its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), the RTX 4090 can deliver the type of smooth 4K performance in Cyberpunk 2077 that\u2019s never been possible before. I\u2019m talking nearly 140fps at 4K with all settings maxed out and psycho ray tracing enabled. And at 1440p, it\u2019s nearly hitting the limit of my 240Hz monitor.DLSS 3 provides an incredibly impressive performance bump, but in games where it\u2019s not yet supported, you\u2019re still getting around 70 percent better frame rates on average.All of this comes at a cost, though. At $1,599, the RTX 4090 is at the very top end of the GPU market, and its huge footprint could make it difficult to slot into some PC cases. The RTX 4090 also uses 450 watts of power, and you\u2019ll need plenty of spare PCIe power connectors to get this card powered up. But if you can deal with the price, size, and power requirements, this is a card capable of delivering a 4K experience like no other.8Verge ScoreNvidia RTX 4090$1599$1599The GoodGreat performance at 4KDLSS 3 transforms frame rates24GB of VRAMThe Bad450W power drawThe dongle adapter is still annoyingIt\u2019s freaking hugeIt\u2019s freaking expensive$1599 at Best Buy$1599 at AmazonHow we rate and review productsHOW WE RATE AND REVIEW PRODUCTSThe RTX 4090 Founders Edition ships in a box that\u2019s comically huge. It\u2019s how I imagine you\u2019d be sent a winning check from the lottery because the oversize box really prepares you for the surreal size of the RTX 4090.Although it\u2019s nearly 10mm shorter than the RTX 3090, the extra inch in height makes it look a lot chunkier. I didn\u2019t have any problems fitting it into my case, but I can imagine the sheer size will be problematic in some cases, particularly if you pick a third-party RTX 4090 where the sizes go way beyond the Founders Edition models.RelatedIntel Arc A750 and A770 review: new budget PC gaming contendersAMD\u2019s Ryzen 7900X arrives to take on Intel\u2019s 12900KWhile the overall aesthetics of the RTX 4090 are very similar to an RTX 3090, the RTX 4090 has a redesigned fan that includes seven blades instead of nine. That fan dominates more of the rear of the card now.RTX 3090 versus RTX 4090 (bottom). Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeNvidia has also switched up its power connector with the RTX 4090, and it\u2019s using the single 12-pin PCIe 5 standard that can deliver up to 600 watts in total. It\u2019s the same connector found on the RTX 3090 Ti, and Nvidia ships a 12VHPWR adapter cable in the box so you can connect four eight-pin PCIe power cables. That\u2019s double the amount of eight-pin cables needed over the RTX 3090, but you technically only need to connect three eight-pin cables that can deliver 150 watts each. That covers 450 watts in total, and Nvidia recommends connecting the fourth eight-pin if you\u2019re planning to overclock the card.You\u2019ll probably want to have a 1,000-watt power supply on hand for the RTX 4090, particularly because you\u2019ll need to pair this with the latest generation CPUs to really take advantage of the power on offer here. Nvidia recommends 850 watts in total, but having that extra headroom for overclocking could be useful.I\u2019m still a big fan of the Founders Edition design for Nvidia\u2019s RTX cards, even if very little has changed on the outside for this Ada Lovelace generation.1440p benchmarksTest machine:CPU: Intel Core i9-12900KCPU cooler: Corsair H150 Elite LCDMotherboard: MSI MAG Z690 Carbon Wi-FiRAM: 32GB Corsair Dominator Platinum DDR5 5600Storage: Western Digital SN850 1TBCase: Corsair Crystal 570XPSU: Corsair HX1000WI\u2019ve been testing the RTX 4090 with Intel\u2019s Core i9-12900K processor. For 1440p tests, I\u2019ve paired this GPU with a 32-inch Samsung Odyssey G7 monitor. This monitor supports refresh rates up to 240Hz as well as Nvidia\u2019s G-Sync technology.I\u2019ve put the RTX 4090 head-to-head with the RTX 3090 to see exactly what this new Ada Lovelace generation of GPUs offers over Ampere. I\u2019ve been testing a variety of AAA games, including Forza Horizon 5, Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, and Cyberpunk 2077. I\u2019ve also been testing DLSS 3 on Cyberpunk 2077 and Microsoft Flight Simulator, both notoriously demanding games.All games were tested at max or ultra settings on the RTX 4090, and most games deliver frame rates well beyond 100fps, even with ray-tracing options enabled. Control manages to hit a massive 223fps at 1440p, and even with ray tracing enabled, the RTX 4090 still manages to deliver an impressive 167fps frame rate.RTX 4090 (1440p)BenchmarkRTX 3090RTX 4090Microsoft Flight Simulator52fps52fpsMicrosoft Flight Simulator + DLSS 250fps50fpsShadow of the Tomb Raider170fps247fpsShadow of the Tomb Raider + DLSS 2200fps249fpsForza Horizon 5111fps175fpsCS:GO592fps652fpsGears 5140fps190fpsControl145fps223fpsControl + DLSS 2 + RT151fps185fpsControl + RT94fps167fpsMetro Exodus Enhanced80fps121fpsMetro Exodus Enhanced + DLSS 2 + RT84fps128fpsAssassin's Creed Valhalla98fps171fpsWatch Dogs: Legion97fps132fpsWatch Dogs: Legion + DLSS 2 + RT81fps94fpsCyberpunk 207797fps142fpsCyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 2 + RT75fps119fpsCyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 2 +  Psycho RT70fps114fpsWatch Dogs: Legion has always been particularly demanding, even on the RTX 3090, and the RTX 4090 manages to deliver 132fps without ray tracing enabled, a 36 percent jump in performance. Out of all the games I\u2019ve tested, I saw an average of a nearly 50 percent jump in performance from the RTX 3090 to the RTX 4090 at 1440p. That alone is an impressive leap, but things get even more interesting with DLSS 3 enabled.I\u2019ve been testing new versions of Cyberpunk 2077 and Microsoft Flight Simulator, which both include DLSS 3. This latest version uses the same AI upscaling techniques from DLSS 2 alongside a new AI frame generation technology using the new Ada Lovelace architecture. The frame generation feature essentially generates two frames using existing rendering techniques, then a third frame is inserted between them using the new frame generation tech. The result is a giant leap in performance that\u2019s exclusive to DLSS 3 on the RTX 40 series right now.RTX 4090 DLSS 3 (1440p)BenchmarkRTX 4090Microsoft Flight Simulator62fpsMicrosoft Flight Simulator + DLSS 264fpsMicrosoft Flight Simulator + DLSS 3133fpsCyberpunk 2077142fpsCyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 2 + RT119fpsCyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 2 +  Psycho RT114fpsCyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 3 + RT190fpsCyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 3 +  Psycho RT181fpsCyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 3 Perf +  Psycho RT217fpsPlaying Cyberpunk 2077 with maxed settings and psycho ray tracing and DLSS 2 quality enabled on the RTX 4090 runs at around 114fps on average. If you simply enable frame generation, that jumps nearly 60 percent alone to 181fps. If you\u2019re willing to sacrifice a little image quality, then the performance DLSS 3 mode will bump this all the way up to 217fps. That\u2019s an incredible jump at 1440p for a game that runs at 70fps on an RTX 3090.The same can be found on Microsoft Flight Simulator, too. I used the special test build of Flight Simulator and found it could manage around 64fps with settings at ultra, DLSS 2 quality, and online mode disabled. Simply flicking a switch to DLSS 3 frame generation bumped this by more than 100 percent to 133fps. I couldn\u2019t believe the performance I was seeing in Microsoft Flight Simulator, an incredibly demanding game.4K benchmarksIf the 1440p benchmarks sound impressive, wait until you see what the RTX 4090 can do at 4K. For 4K testing, I\u2019ve paired this GPU with a 31.5-inch Acer Nitro XV2 monitor. This monitor supports refresh rates up to 144Hz, and you\u2019ll see from the benchmarks that the RTX 4090 was able to deliver the types of frame rates to really take advantage of this 4K monitor.If the performance gains at 1440P with the RTX 4090 are getting close to 50 percent at times, they\u2019ve even bigger at 4K. Out of the games I\u2019ve been testing, the RTX 4090 delivers around a 70 percent jump in performance at 4K over the RTX 3090. It\u2019s truly a beast of a card for 4K gaming.I\u2019ve not really been interested in 4K gaming simply because GPUs haven\u2019t been able to deliver the types of high frame rates I\u2019m used to at 1440P. I\u2019m the type of person who can immediately tell when I\u2019m playing at 120fps instead of close to 200fps, but the RTX 4090 coupled with DLSS 3 is really tempting me over to 4K.RTX 4090 (4K)BenchmarkRTX 3090RTX 4090Microsoft Flight Simulator47fps51fpsMicrosoft Flight Simulator + DLSS 249fps49fpsShadow of the Tomb Raider98fps195fpsShadow of the Tomb Raider + DLSS 2132fps227fpsForza Horizon 585fps151fpsCS:GO421fps426fpsGears 580fps138fpsControl76fps134fpsControl + DLSS 2 + RT88fps158fpsControl + RT74fps86fpsMetro Exodus Enhanced53fps96fpsMetro Exodus Enhanced + DLSS 2 + RT58fps106fpsAssassin's Creed Valhalla68fps119fpsWatch Dogs: Legion62fps109fpsWatch Dogs: Legion + DLSS 2 + RT55fps89fpsCyberpunk 207748fps74fpsCyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 2 + RT41fps72fpsCyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 2 +  Psycho RT37fps66fpsI spent most of my time playing Cyberpunk 2077 at 4K with the RTX 4090, simply because I\u2019ve always wanted to play this game maxed out with all the settings and ray tracing at 4K. The RTX 3090 couldn\u2019t really cut it at everything maxed out at 4K, dropping below 30fps frequently in an experience that felt like sludge.With DLSS 3, I managed to hit nearly 140fps at 4K on average with everything maxed out, psycho ray tracing, and DLSS 3 performance mode enabled. Even without DLSS 3, Night City looked and felt a lot smoother with regular DLSS 2 quality delivering 66fps on average, but playing Cyberpunk 2077 at way beyond 100fps at 4K is a true delight.RTX 4090 DLSS 3 (4K)BenchmarkRTX 4090Microsoft Flight Simulator64fpsMicrosoft Flight Simulator + DLSS 261fpsMicrosoft Flight Simulator + DLSS 3125fpsCyberpunk 207774fpsCyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 2 + RT72fpsCyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 2 +  Psycho RT66fpsCyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 3 + RT109fpsCyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 3 +  Psycho RT103fpsCyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 3 Perf +  Psycho RT138fpsAnd it\u2019s not just Cyberpunk 2077 that plays well at 4K on the RTX 4090. Across the board, most games managed to deliver more than 100fps at 4K. Control felt super smooth maxed out with ray tracing enabled and DLSS, with a 158fps frame rate I\u2019ve only ever been used to playing at 1440p. I truly hope DLSS 3 comes to Control because the stunning improvements found in Cyberpunk 2077 would be great to see in more games that support DLSS.Microsoft Flight Simulator also runs really well on the RTX 4090 with DLSS 3 enabled. The special test build of Flight Simulator manages 61fps with settings at ultra, DLSS 2 quality, and online mode disabled. Moving to DLSS 3 frame generation bumps this by more than 100 percent to 125fps and makes the game far more playable at ultra settings in demanding sections.The RTX 4090 is impressive at 4K. Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeNvidia\u2019s first Ada Lovelace card shows that there are some big performance improvements over the Ampere 30-series generation. The $1,599 price tag puts the RTX 4090 way out of the price bracket for most PC gamers, but it sets the stage for what could be an exciting next generation of cards.DLSS 3 genuinely transforms frame rates here, all while maintaining the options of quality, balance, or performance for imagery. Only 35 games or apps have been confirmed for DLSS 3 so far, though, so it\u2019s going to be some time before we truly see the impact of this new technology.Even without Nvidia\u2019s DLSS 3 support, the RTX 4090 is in a performance league of its own right now. If you have to have the best of the best for 4K gaming, then the RTX 4090 won\u2019t disappoint. For everyone else, the RTX 4080 cards are both launching in November and offer a more reasonable entry point into this generation of cards. But will performance be as impressive on the controversial $899 12GB RTX 4080?AMD could arrive in November and upset the Nvidia RTX 40-series show with RDNA 3, but it\u2019s hard to imagine it will have anything close to DLSS 3. That\u2019s really the star of the show for the RTX 4090 \u2014 and reason alone to upgrade if you believe Nvidia will be able to pull off the kind of support we\u2019ve seen with DLSS 2 so far.Either way, the RTX 4090 is a beast of a GPU for 4K gaming, and it\u2019s seriously tempting me to upgrade. It\u2019s the $1,599 price tag that\u2019s tempting me not to.See More: EntertainmentGamingNvidiaPC GamingReviewsTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia no longer blocks ethereum (ETH) mining on its graphics card, roughly one month after the second-most valuable cryptocurrency moved away from GPU mining altogether.\u00a0Nvidia's Lite Hash Rate (LHR) cryptocurrency limiter was released alongside the RTX 3060 as a way of dissuading cryptocurrency miners from buying up all the available stock of the graphics card at launch. It would also roll out to other GeForce GPUs manufactured after that time. LHR was released as a supposedly untouchable implementation across hardware and software, which would detect an ethereum mining workload and slow the graphics card down to lower its profitability. However, following a shaky start, LHR would eventually become mostly, if not entirely, circumventable.Some miners even called LHR \"pointless.\"\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is winding down developer support for 9 and 10-series graphics cards, but they'll likely keep getting driver updates for a while yet\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's latest 572.16 driver isn't just for the RTX 50-series, as 20, 30 and 40-series cards are also gifted with significant updates\n\n\n\nFollowing ethereum's shift from a proof-of-work algorithm, one which required GPU mining to validate the blockchain; to a proof-of-stake algorithm, which uses consensus of validators instead, LHR has become even more pointless. The Merge, as the move is known as, took place on September 15, 2022, and reportedly no other cryptocurrencies are proving profitable enough for GPU miners to jump ship.Ethereum mining is dead and Nvidia's LHR no longer has any purpose.That might be why, according to recent reports from Reddit, via Twitter leaker I_Leak_VM and Videocardz, Nvidia has removed the LHR limiter from its cards completely. Many people are replying to social threads confirming an increase in hash rate on LHR GPUs with the new drivers, up to their non-LHR hash rate, and we've also tested the new drivers out on our test bench.We used nanominer, with an RTX 3080 Ti, mining ethereum classic (ETC). That cryptocurrency is a continuation of an older version of ethereum from 2016. It uses a near-identical proof-of-work algorithm to ethereum's ETHash and has been similarly affected by the LHR limiter. In our test, the RTX 3080 Ti's hash rate increased from 75MH/s to over 103MH/s between the old 516.41 driver and new 522.25 driver.\u00a0The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.For the record, not even the higher hash rate is anywhere close to profitable right now, especially not with the increased costs of energy today.Here's a screenshot of the mining software on Nvidia's older drivers. (Image credit: Future)I'm seeing some comments suggesting that Nvidia removed the LHR limiter to sell off old stock of RTX 30-series cards to miners, but that makes little to no sense. It has been increasingly difficult to make a profit from cryptocurrency mining for a large part of the year, even prior to the Merge, due to a wider cryptocurrency value write-off. Graphics cards were already less in demand as a result\u2014there are simply fewer miners left to appeal to.\u00a0Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest gaming motherboard: The right boards\nBest graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the restSimilarly, LHR was intended to prevent ethereum mining, which no longer exists, and while it did impact the hash rate for mining on some similar coins, such as ethereum classic, other alternatives were mineable at full pace. Miners were also circumventing LHR by mining ethereum and another crypto at the same time, to extract a card's full mining performance. And let's not forget the miners that simply got around LHR altogether, like NiceHash.The removal of LHR will mean that ethereum classic will now be easy to mine. However, its hash rate has never amounted to anything close to ethereum's, nor its value.One ETH is worth $1,328.40 at time of writing. One ETC is worth $24.34. And you'd need some 600MH/s at the same 300W level to get close to breaking even with today's energy prices.Nvidia's LHR is practically pointless today, and has been for a while now, so it's not at all surprising to see the company ditch this surplus code altogether.\u00a0Another thing to bear in mind, as far as we know, there's been no mention of the RTX 4090 being an LHR graphics card.And anyways, the removal of LHR from the latest Nvidia driver package is a sideshow to the real improvement that driver package offers for gamers: big performance increases for some DX12 games.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nCryptocurrency\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

He\u2019s an entrepreneur, software developer and, until lately, a volunteer fireman in his mountain village an hour\u2019s drive from Grenoble, a tech hub in southeast France.\nHe\u2019s nurturing a two-year old startup, NLP Cloud, that\u2019s already profitable, employs about a dozen people and serves customers around the globe. It\u2019s one of many companies worldwide using NVIDIA software to deploy some of today\u2019s most complex and powerful AI models.\nNLP Cloud is an AI-powered software service for text data. A major European airline uses it to summarize internet news for its employees. A small healthcare company employs it to parse patient requests for prescription refills. An online app uses it to let kids talk to their favorite cartoon characters.\nLarge Language Models Speak Volumes\nIt\u2019s all part of the magic of natural language processing (NLP), a popular form of AI that\u2019s spawning some of the planet\u2019s biggest neural networks called large language models. Trained with huge datasets on powerful systems, LLMs can handle all sorts of jobs such as recognizing and generating text with amazing accuracy.\nNLP Cloud uses about 25 LLMs today, the largest has 20 billion parameters, a key measure of the sophistication of a model. And now it\u2019s implementing BLOOM, an LLM with a whopping 176 billion parameters.\nRunning these massive models in production efficiently across multiple cloud services is hard work. That\u2019s why Salinas turns to NVIDIA Triton Inference Server.\nHigh Throughput, Low Latency\n\u201cVery quickly the main challenge we faced was server costs,\u201d Salinas said, proud his self-funded startup has not taken any outside backing to date.\n\u201cTriton turned out to be a great way to make full use of the GPUs at our disposal,\u201d he said.\nFor example, NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs can process as many as 10 requests at a time \u2014 twice the throughput of alternative software \u2014\u00a0 thanks to FasterTransformer, a part of Triton that automates complex jobs like splitting up models across many GPUs.\nFasterTransformer also helps NLP Cloud spread jobs that require more memory across multiple NVIDIA T4 GPUs while shaving the response time for the task.\nCustomers who demand the fastest response times can process 50 tokens \u2014 text elements like words or punctuation marks \u2014 in as little as half a second with Triton on an A100 GPU, about a third of the response time without Triton.\n\u201cThat\u2019s very cool,\u201d said Salinas, who\u2019s reviewed dozens of software tools on his personal blog.\nTouring Triton\u2019s Users\nAround the globe, other startups and established giants are using Triton to get the most out of LLMs.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Translate service helped disaster workers understand Haitian Creole while responding to a 7.0 earthquake. It was one of many use cases for the service that got a 27x speedup using Triton to run inference on models with up to 5 billion parameters.\nNLP provider Cohere was founded by one of the AI researchers who wrote the seminal paper that defined transformer models. It\u2019s getting up to 4x speedups on inference using Triton on its custom LLMs, so users of customer support chatbots, for example, get swift responses to their queries.\nNLP Cloud and Cohere are among many members of the NVIDIA Inception program, which nurtures cutting-edge startups. Several other Inception startups also use Triton for AI inference on LLMs.\nTokyo-based rinna\u00a0created chatbots used by millions in Japan, as well as tools to let developers build custom chatbots and AI-powered characters. Triton helped the company achieve inference latency of less than two seconds on GPUs.\nIn Tel Aviv, Tabnine runs a service that\u2019s automated up to 30% of the code written by a million developers globally (see a demo below). Its service runs multiple LLMs on A100 GPUs with Triton to handle more than 20 programming languages and 15 code editors.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tabnine.mp4\nTwitter uses the LLM service of Writer, based in San Francisco. It ensures the social network\u2019s employees write in a voice that adheres to the company\u2019s style guide. Writer\u2019s service achieves a 3x lower latency and up to 4x greater throughput using Triton compared to prior software.\nIf you want to put a face to those words, Inception member Ex-human, just down the street from Writer, helps users create realistic avatars for games, chatbots and virtual reality applications. With Triton, it delivers response times of less than a second on an LLM with 6 billion parameters while reducing GPU memory consumption by a third.\nIt\u2019s another example of how LLMs are expanding AI\u2019s horizons.\nTriton is widely used, in part, because its versatile. The software works with any style of inference and any AI framework \u2014 and it runs on CPUs as well as NVIDIA GPUs and other accelerators.\nA Full-Stack Platform\nBack in France, NLP Cloud is now using other elements of the NVIDIA AI platform.\nFor inference on models running on a single GPU, it\u2019s adopting NVIDIA TensorRT software to minimize latency. \u201cWe\u2019re getting blazing-fast performance with it, and latency is really going down,\u201d Salinas said.\nThe company also started training custom versions of LLMs to support more languages and enhance efficiency. For that work, it\u2019s adopting NVIDIA Nemo Megatron, an end-to-end framework for training and deploying LLMs with trillions of parameters.\nThe 35-year-old Salinas has the energy of a 20-something for coding and growing his business. He describes plans to build private infrastructure to complement the four public cloud services the startup uses, as well as to expand into LLMs that handle speech and text-to-image to address applications like semantic search.\n\u201cI always loved coding, but being a good developer is not enough: You have to understand your customers\u2019 needs,\u201d said Salinas, who posted code on GitHub nearly 200 times last year.\nIf you\u2019re passionate about software, learn the latest on Triton in this technical blog.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | Conversational AI | Customer Stories | Inception | Inference | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | NVIDIA in Europe | NVIDIA NeMo \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

Besides talking with TSMC, Jensen also visited several AIBs to get an update regarding the inventories of existing GPUs and how they are dealing with them.\nNVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang, Has Reportedly Visited Taiwan To Secure TSMC 3nm Wafer Orders\nAs reported by MyDrivers, it seems like NVIDIA's CEO recently paid a visit to Taiwan to meet with top executives of TSMC and their AIB partners. AMD's CEO, Dr. Lisa Su, was recently reported to have similar plans to secure next-gen wafer orders, mainly TSMC 3nm and 2nm. One of the main agendas of the visit to TSMC (Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) was to secure additional N5 and 4N capacities while also initiating talks to secure next-gen 3nm wafers.\nRelated Story Watch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For UnveilingThere are a lot of customers lining up to have their next-gen chips produced on TSMC's bleeding-edge 3nm process node and NVIDIA definitely wants to be one of them. As such, the company has to plan ahead and start talking with TSMC ahead of the production phase. While TSMC's 3nm node won't be mass-produced until next year, we won't see next-gen products based on the new node from Apple, AMD, or NVIDIA till 2024. So it looks like there will be a long wait till these companies start talking about their next-gen products.\n\nIn the meanwhile, NVIDIA & AMD both have released their latest GPUs and CPUs based on TSMC's 4N and N5 process nodes and those will have at least a 2-year life cycle before getting replaced by something new. We can't say for sure what the next-generation product from NVIDIA that utilizes the 3nm process node would be but it is likely that it could be the Blackwell GPUs that was hinted at in a previous leak.\nNVIDIA's CEO also reportedly visited several AIB partners who are responsible for making their graphics cards. The reason for the visit was to ensure that the GeForce RTX 30 GPU inventory situation was being handled smoothly. As we know, NVIDIA was left with a large stock of GPUs when crypto crashed and the PC market declined. NVIDIA's AIB partners have recently started to release various GeForce RTX 30 series products including the RTX 3070 Ti (GA102), RTX 3060 Ti (GDDR6X), and RTX 3060 (8 GB) which will be available in both DIY and OEM segments. These will help AIBs clear out a large portion of their inventory and focus on NVIDIA's RTX 40 series GPUs.\n\nThe company also recently cut down the production capacity of its GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card and shifted it to the Data Center HPC/AI chips to fulfill the last remaining orders o the A100 & H100 GPUs prior to the China ban.\nLastly, NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang also reportedly ensured their AIBs full support on the recent RTX 4080 12 GB graphics card cancellation. NVIDIA already promised to help bear the majority of the production costs that their AIBs endured. The AIBs will definitely see this as a positive gesture by NVIDIA's CEO and will ensure that the next launch goes more smoothly.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n55\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n40\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n40\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s A20 Arriving To The iPhone 18 Lineup Will Reportedly Stick With TSMC\u2019s 3nm \u2018N3P\u2019 Process, But It Could Differentiate Itself By Using A More Advanced Packaging\n\n\n\n37\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n30\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The last-generation RTX 3090 was a speed demon, but the GeForce RTX 4090\u2014thanks to Nvidia\u2019s new \u201cAda Lovelace\u201d architecture\u2014screams through traditional games up to 83 percent faster. Nvidia\u2019s 40-series flagship chews through futuristic ray-traced games too, propelled by more advanced 3rd-gen RT cores and a radical new \u201cFrame Generation\u201d DLSS 3 feature that doubles (or more) frame rates yet again with a heaping helping of AI.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not just about games, though. Creators will love the 24GB of blazing-fast GDDR6X memory when it comes to pixel-packed video renders, and Nvidia\u2019s inclusion of not one, but two AV1 video encoders means the RTX 4090 is suitably equipped to handle the future of streaming.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nNo matter what you want to accomplish, the monstrous GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition can handle it without breaking a sweat\u2014though your wallet and power supply might, as all this extra performance doesn\u2019t come free. Let\u2019s dig in.\n\n\n\n\n[ Further reading: Where to buy Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 4090 ]\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 specs, features, and price\nThis first GPU of a new generation provides our first glimpse at Nvidia\u2019s new Ada Lovelace architecture, running on a custom TSMC 4N (read: fancy 5nm) process. It\u2019s a ferocious jump. Before we start, here\u2019s a high-level look at how the RTX 4090\u2019s specifications compare to prior-gen GeForce flagships (which amusingly all sport different tier classifications):\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\nThe leap from Samsung\u2019s 8N process to TSMC\u2019s much more advanced 4N process can\u2019t be understated. Last-generation\u2019s full-fat RTX 3090 Ti packed 10,752 CUDA graphics cores and 28.3 billion transistors into a massive 628.4mm die. The new RTX 4090 ups that to a ludicrous 16,384 CUDA cores and 76.3 billion transistors on a smaller die. Thanks, TSMC!\nBut Nvidia worked its magic, too. While the bones of the Ada Lovelace architecture don\u2019t stray that wildly from last-gen\u2019s Ampere design\u2014though there\u2019s a lot more of everything\u2014Nvidia made some key tweaks to push performance even further. One example is a new Shader Execution Reordering function, which groups and schedules similar shading work on the fly. It boosts performance in games running traditionally rasterized graphics, sure, but accelerates ray tracing even more.\n\n\nEnhancing ray tracing performance was clearly a focus for Nvidia with the RTX 4090. The Ada Lovelace architecture upgrades to third-generation RT cores and fourth-gen tensor AI cores, all faster and more efficient than before. They\u2019re augmented by a beefed-up Optical Flow Accelerator that, in tandem with the tensor cores, unlocks DLSS 3 and its new Frame Generation feature. \nNvidia\u2019s DLSS 2 already stood strong as the gold standard for image upscaling, but DLSS 3 goes even further by using tensor cores to create fully AI-created frames that slot in between traditionally rendered frames, which can drastically increase performance\u2014even in CPU bound games, thanks to the way it works.\n\n\n\n\nIt all adds up. Without ray tracing active, the RTX 3090 could run Cyberpunk 2077 at 48 frames per second. The RTX 4090 gets 77fps out of the gate but flipping on DLSS 3 lets it soar all the way to 138fps\u2014and that\u2019s with strenuous ray tracing effects active. It\u2019s tremendously impressive. There are some key DLSS 3 details to be aware of, though. We\u2019ll dive much deeper into DLSS 3 and ray tracing later in our performance benchmarks.\nIntel beat Nvidia to the AV1 encoding punch with its debut Arc graphics cards\u2014which are also launching on October 12, concurrent to the RTX 4090\u2014but Nvidia is taking the futuristic video technology a step further by integrating two AV1 encoders into its new NVENC media engine. Nvidia says its AV1 encoding implementation is 40 percent more efficient than its already best-in-class H.264 encoding, and our deep-dive into Arc\u2019s AV1 encoding goes into what this means for the future of streaming video.\n\n\nOther, more traditional metrics also improved. In addition to Ada packing in simply more of everything, clock speeds improved dramatically, to a 2,520MHz rated Boost Clock (though the RTX 4090 can dynamically clock much higher than that in games). That\u2019s roughly 700MHz faster than the 3090 Ti. The new RTX 4090 also integrates the faster 21Gbps GGDR6X memory modules introduced in the 3090 Ti, letting the RTX 4090\u2019s 24GB of memory blaze along at over a terabyte of overall memory bandwidth each and every second. Cue Keanu Reeves: Whoa.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nAdding all these capabilities requires more power, however. While the GeForce RTX 4090 ostensibly packs the same 450W total graphics power rating as the 3090 Ti, real-world power use comes in a bit higher, and Nvidia adopted the new 12VHPWR 16-pin cable for ATX 3.0 power supplies, which is designed to handle higher GPU power needs. You don\u2019t need a new ATX 3.0 power supply to run the 4090, however (though you do need an 850W minimum PSU). Nvidia includes a 12VHPWR 16-pin adapter in the box that hooks up to four traditional 8-pin power connectors\u2014three mandatory, with the fourth required for overclocking endeavors.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s 12VHPWR adapter winds up looking cluttered in practice, and would have been more aesthetically pleasing with longer cables.\u00a0Brad Chacos/IDG\nIt works, but it\u2019s an ugly kludge around an otherwise sterling Founders Edition design. Corsair sent us its HX1500i power supply and optional $20 12VHPWR 600 cable for testing, and using that native cable as opposed to the adapter looks much more aesthetically pleasing. If your PSU manufacturer offers a 12VHPWR cable for a reasonable price, I highly recommend jumping on it. You don\u2019t want your $1,600 graphics card looking janky, after all.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nNvidia\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d Founders Edition design largely mirrors the RTX 30-series aesthetic and push-pull \u201cflow through\u201d cooling system. That\u2019s a good thing. These metal-clad cards look outstanding, albeit massive. Nvidia tweaked things under the hood to improve cooling performance for this supremely powerful graphics card, however. The GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition sports bigger fans with fluid dynamic bearings now, paired with a taller, redesigned heatfin stack. Nvidia claims the RTX 4090 FE \u201cdelivers the highest airflow ever measured in a discrete Nvidia GPU, achieving 15 percent more airflow than an RTX 3090 at the same acoustic level.\u201d In practice, the RTX 4090 FE runs utterly cool and utterly quiet. It rocks, though custom GeForce RTX 4090 cards are also available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nOf course, the GeForce RTX 4090 supports Nvidia\u2019s killer software stack, from NVENC to Broadcast to Shadowplay to Nvidia Reflex (which is actually a core component of DLSS 3). Software and features remain a key strength for GeForce, especially in contrast to Intel\u2019s spotty debut Arc drivers.\nBut enough talk. Let\u2019s get to the benchmarks. Giddy-up.\n\nOur RTX 4090 test system\nWe test graphics cards on a top-of-the-line AMD Ryzen 5900X PC used exclusively for benchmarking GPUs. But there\u2019s one new tweak for the start of this GPU generation: We\u2019ll now test with PCIe Resizable BAR (also known as Smart Access Memory on Ryzen systems) active, as most modern gaming PCs released in the last four years support the performance-boosting feature, either natively or via a motherboard firmware update. \nNvidia also recommends turning on the optional \u201cHardware-accelerated GPU scheduling\u201d option in Windows to let the RTX 40-series stretch its legs to the fullest, so we\u2019ve made that tweak as well. Most of the hardware was provided by the manufacturers, but we purchased the storage ourselves. Special thanks to Corsair, which sent us a HX1500i power supply and optional $20 12VHPWR 600 cable for testing the Founders Edition. \u00a0\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 5900X, stock settingsAMD Wraith Max coolerMSI Godlike X570 motherboard32GB G.Skill Trident Z Neo DDR4 3800 memory, XMP activeCorsair HX1500i power supply and optional $20 12VHPWR 600 cable1TB SK Hynix Gold S31 SSDWindows 10 (up-to-date)\nWe\u2019re comparing the $1,599 GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition against its direct predecessor, the $1,500 GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition, as well as AMD\u2019s rival Radeon RX 6900 XT, which launched at $1,000 but provided similar performance to the 3090 in rasterized games. Nvidia and AMD both released more powerful variants of those GPUs, in the form of the RTX 3090 Ti and Radeon RX 6950 XT, but we don\u2019t have those graphics cards on-hand for direct comparison with new drivers. \u00a0\nIn addition to turning on PCIe Resizable BAR by default, we\u2019re also moving to a new set of games in our testing suite. We test a variety of games spanning various engines, genres, vendor sponsorships (Nvidia, AMD, and Intel), and graphics APIs (DirectX 9, 11, DX12, and Vulkan), to try to represent a full range of performance potential. Each game is tested using its in-game benchmark, sanity checked by Nvidia\u2019s FrameView tool, at the highest possible graphics presets unless otherwise noted, with VSync, frame rate caps, real-time ray tracing or DLSS effects, and FreeSync/G-Sync disabled, along with any other vendor-specific technologies like FidelityFX tools or Nvidia Reflex. We\u2019ve also enabled temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) to push these cards to their limits. We run each benchmark at least three times and list the average result for each test.\nRTX 4090 gaming performance benchmarks\nEsports and older APIs\nLet\u2019s kick things off with a pair of ultra-popular esports games, and a tactical strategy game running on DX11.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nThe GeForce RTX 4090 is so fast that it can sometimes run into CPU bottlenecks even playing at 4K resolution with the eye candy maxed in some games, but esports games and older DirectX 11 titles don\u2019t necessarily push it to its blistering limits. The 4090 is just 36 percent faster than the 3090 in Total War: Troy\u2014a solid result, but one dwarfed by the advances in DX12 and Vulkan games. Likewise, while the RTX 4090 easily tops the CS:GO benchmark charts, the meager frame rate improvements at 4K and 1080p show that this long-established DirectX 9 title doesn\u2019t have much more to give to Ada Lovelace\u2019s might.\n\n\nRainbow Six Siege running on the modern Vulkan API shows a much more substantial uplift\u2014running 64 percent faster than the RTX 3090 at 4K\u2014and includes Nvidia\u2019s latency-dropping Reflex technology to make it even more responsive. Notice the hard engine or CPU bottleneck it hits at 1440p resolution (and perhaps even 4K) however. \nDX12 and Vulkan\nThat Vulkan uplift holds true when we widen our scope to examine a variety of Vulkan and DX12 games.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nHere, the GeForce RTX 4090 regularly performs around 55 to 60 percent faster than its predecessor at 4K resolution, but that can climb up to as high as 83 percent faster in particularly friendly games like Hitman 3 and F1 22. Gears Tactics runs 67 percent faster on the 4090, but it could\u2019ve been even more in theory\u2014the game wound up being CPU-bound 7 percent of the time while running the benchmark, a feat you don\u2019t see often at 4K/Ultra. The GeForce RTX 4090 is that fast.\nGeForce RTX 4090: Ray tracing benchmarks\nNvidia invested heavily in boosting Ada Lovelace\u2019s ray tracing chops, equipping it with new Shader Execution Reordering capabilities, third-gen RT cores, fourth-gen tensor AI (DLSS) cores, and an Optical Flow Accelerator to supercharge DLSS 3\u2019s performance uplift.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll dig into DLSS 3 next, but first, we wanted to dig into the RTX 4090\u2019s raw ray tracing performance. Intel\u2019s debut Arc GPUs operate at a much lower level of raw power, being roughly $300 graphics cards, but their first crack at ray tracing efficiency managed to surpass the second-gen RT cores in Nvidia\u2019s RTX 30-series. Nvidia\u2019s Lovelace upgrades claws the crown back.\nTo reveal Lovelace\u2019s prowess, the charts below show the raw performance of the RTX 4090, 3090, and Radeon RX 6900 XT in the selected games with ray tracing off, to get a baseline. Next, we show performance with any and all available ray tracing effects active and set to ultra. The important thing to note here is how these ray-traced frame rates compare proportionally to the game running with RT off, which reveals how efficient each GPU\u2019s raw ray tracing capabilities are. (If a game runs at 100fps with ray tracing off, and two different GPUs run the game with ray tracing on at 50fps and 25fps, for example, the former GPU offers better raw ray tracing chops).\nFinally, since ray tracing sends frame rates plummeting, pairing it with some sort of image upscaling technology (like Nvidia\u2019s DLSS, AMD\u2019s FSR 2, and Intel\u2019s XeSS) is a necessity. We\u2019ve also included performance metrics with DLSS running in balanced mode on Nvidia GPUs to show the sort of full-stack ray tracing performance you\u2019ll see in the real world. (Nvidia doesn\u2019t allow DLSS to run on rival graphics cards, so the AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT is represented by a zero in the DLSS measurements.) Running DLSS in Performance or Ultra Performance mode would result in even higher frame rates, but with potentially more image oddities. We like the balance of speed and fidelity that DLSS Balanced provides.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nWe\u2019ve also included a performance chart showing Red Dead Redemption 2 performance with DLSS Balanced on the various Nvidia GPUs. That game lacks ray tracing, but these results can show us if Ada Lovelace\u2019s new fourth-gen tensor cores are more efficient than their predecessor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nNo surprises here: Nvidia kickstarted the ray tracing revolution and has invested heavily in the ecosystem, and the RTX 4090 suitably smashes all comers. It can run Hitman 3 with ray tracing maxed-out while still surpassing 60 frames per second even at 4K, and that\u2019s without DLSS running whatsoever. Turn on DLSS and you can play Cyberpunk 2077 with all its beautifully strenuous ray tracing effects tuned to ultra at a blistering 84fps pace at 4K. Even with ray tracing off, the last-gen RTX 3090 can\u2019t crack 50fps at Ultra settings.\nThe GeForce RTX 4090 and Ada Lovelace make playing ray traced games practical\u2014but it\u2019s DLSS 3 that offers some truly special sauce.\nDLSS 3 Frame Generation: Using AI to supercharge speeds\nFinally, the true feather in Nvidia\u2019s cap: DLSS 3. Introduced alongside the RTX 40-series, DLSS 3 builds atop the framework already built by Nvidia\u2019s existing features to massively accelerate performance with the help of AI-generated frames. It\u2019s a radical and exciting new technology, capable of speeding up even CPU-bound games, though there are caveats worth knowing.\nNvidia\u2019s first two generations of DLSS were a binary feature. You could choose from different quality presets, of course, but at its bones DLSS has been either on or off. That changes with DLSS 3, which actually consists of three different features: DLSS Super Sampling, DLSS Frame Generation, and Nvidia Reflex. Turning on DLSS in a game that supports DLSS 3\u2014Nvidia already announced 35 DLSS 3 games coming down the pipe\u2014reveals options for all three of those complementary features.\n\n\nDLSS Super Resolution is easy. It\u2019s DLSS. Turning it on reveals the usual Quality, Balanced, Performance, and Ultra Performance options. DLSS (and all upsampling features) works by having the GPU render a frame at a lower resolution, then upsampling it to fit your monitor\u2019s resolution, using software tricks that vary by implementation. Since your GPU is internally rendering, say, a 1080p image rather than a full 4K image, performance soars. DLSS, AMD\u2019s FSR 2, and Intel\u2019s XeSS technologies all deliver similar enough results, with AMD managing to perform the same tricks without the help of dedicated AI hardware.\n\n\n\nBut AMD has no answer for DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS 3\u2019s secret sauce. DLSS 3 leverages the RTX 4090\u2019s tensor cores and Ada Lovelace\u2019s advanced Optical Flow Sensor to create fully AI-generated frames, interspersed between every other GPU-rendered frame.\nIf you\u2019re using DLSS Super Resolution to upscale a game from 1080p to 4K, and activate Frame Generation, only one out of every eight pixels shown in a pair of frames were actually rendered on the GPU shaders, which obviously supercharges performance. \u201cThe DLSS Frame Generation convolutional autoencoder takes 4 inputs \u2013 current and prior game frames, an optical flow field generated by Ada\u2019s Optical Flow Accelerator, and game engine data such as motion vectors and depth,\u201d to work its magic, Nvidia\u2019s DLSS 3 introductory page states. It\u2019s highly recommended reading if you want more nitty-gritty details on how DLSS 3 functions.\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\nThese AI frames are fully generated by the tensor cores, using the above inputs to inform the output. Digital Foundry performed an early frame-by-frame analysis on DLSS 3 and found some visual inconsistencies in those alternating AI frames, but with the screaming frame rates DLSS 3 Frame Generation provides, I didn\u2019t see any abnormalities in action while tooling around in Cyberpunk 2077 and Microsoft Flight Simulator. You really need to hunt and pixel peep to see any weirdness. That said, due to the way DLSS Frame Generation works, the effect could be more pronounced in fast-paced games with lots of camera motion.\n\n\nDropping AI frames between rendered frames accomplishes two things. First, it sends frame rates screaming, as you see in our benchmarks below. But since those AI frames are generated completely on the tensor cores, without any input from the rest of your PC needed, it can also supercharge performance even in CPU-bound games, which normally stall out because your CPU can\u2019t keep up. Flight Simulator is notoriously CPU-bound, but activating DLSS 3 Frame Generation instantly doubled our frame rates.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nYes, with DLSS 3, you can actually play Flight Sim at a glorious 120Hz on a 4K display. Droooool. And for additional context to the Cyberpunk 2077 slide, the RTX 3090 \u201conly\u201d managed to get about 48 frames per second at 4K with RT Ultra and DLSS 2 Super Resolution active.\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Weaving in those AI-generated frames also creates CPU backpressure and can actually add more latency, reducing responsiveness. The AI frames make your game look buttery smooth, but during those frames, the game isn\u2019t actually responding to your inputs, since the GPU and CPU aren\u2019t doing the work. To combat this, Nvidia mandates DLSS 3 games to also support Nvidia Reflex.\nOriginally introduced as a way to reduce latency and improve responsiveness in esports games, Reflex zeroes out a game\u2019s render queue, reducing CPU backpressure by telling it to supply frames to the GPU in a just-in-time basis. Because the CPU isn\u2019t under stress to supply a render queue, it can keep an eye out for mouse clicks until the last possible second, too. Our testing found it ferociously effective. Pairing Reflex with DLSS Frame Generation helps keep responsiveness largely identical and can even lower latency versus native performance in some games. It\u2019s a delightful combo, and I\u2019m pumped to see DLSS 3 drag Reflex kicking and screaming into a much wider arsenal of games.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat said, while the DLSS 3 experience shines, it doesn\u2019t always feel more responsive in your hands. Running Cyberpunk 2077 at 138fps with every possible bell and whistle active thanks to DLSS 3 looks absolutely stunning, full stop. But one of the perks of faster frame rates is increased responsiveness, and while Reflex greatly helps with that, Cyberpunk 2077 running at 138fps doesn\u2019t feel substantially more responsive than running it at the 77fps or so it hits in native 4K. Having twice as many frames looks fantastic but those AI frames aren\u2019t responding to your controls in the actual moment, though it\u2019s close.\nThis is not a negative. This is not a drawback. It can\u2019t be after running Flight Sim at 120fps, and Cyberpunk 2077 with ultra ray tracing at 138fps (the RTX 3090 tops out at 48fps). But it\u2019s worth highlighting. DLSS 3 work stunningly in these slower-paced games we\u2019ve tried, but if you\u2019re looking for maximum responsiveness from sweaty competitive titles, you\u2019d probably be better off disabling Frame Generation while activating Reflex and DLSS Super Resolution. \nWe need to spend much more time testing DLSS 3 Frame Generation in action before we make more concrete recommendations. If you\u2019re inclined to do so yourself, a new iteration of Nvidia\u2019s fantastic FrameView benchmarking tool includes new easy-to-read averages for 0.1 percent lows and overall PC latency, in addition to the usual stats. An impressive 35 games have already pledged to support DLSS 3, and Nvidia sent over the following notes about launch timing in specific games:\nSuper People: Early Access available at 10p.m. PT October 11 with DLSS 3Loopmancer: Updates with DLSS 3 on October 12Justice \u2018Fuyun Court\u2019: New graphics showcase available on October 12 with DLSS 3Microsoft Flight Simulator: Launches in beta for Xbox Insider program members on October 17 with DLSS 3A Plague Tale: Requiem: Launches October 18 with DLSS 3\nRTX 4090 power and thermals\nWe test power draw by looping the\u00a0F1 22\u00a0benchmark at 4K for about 20 minutes after we\u2019ve benchmarked everything else (to warm up the GPU) and noting the highest reading on our Watts Up Pro meter, which measures the power consumption of our entire test system. The initial part of the race, where all competing cars are onscreen simultaneously, tends to be the most demanding portion.\u00a0\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t a worst-case test. This is a GPU-bound game running at a GPU-bound resolution to gauge performance when the graphics card is sweating hard. If you\u2019re playing a game that also hammers the CPU, you could see higher overall system power draws. Consider yourself warned.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nThe RTX 3090 used a lot of power. The GeForce RTX 4090 and its swanky new 12VHPWR power cable uses even more. No surprises there. You don\u2019t buy a graphics card like this if you\u2019re worried about energy use, you buy it for peak performance.\nWe test thermals by leaving GPU-Z open during the\u00a0F1 22\u00a0power draw test, noting the highest maximum temperature at the end.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nNvidia\u2019s ultra-thick, metal-clad Founders Edition design shines yet again. Despite having to tame an unprecedented amount of raw power, the RTX 4090 FE stays whisper quiet and runs ultra-cool.\n\n\nShould you buy the GeForce RTX 4090?\nIs the 4090 for you? Probably not. Most people shouldn\u2019t spend $1,600 on a graphics card, just like they shouldn\u2019t spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a Lambo. Lambos exist for a reason, however. If you want peak performance no matter the price, you\u2019ll be spectacularly pleased with the GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition. This is the first graphics card capable of maxing out a 120Hz 4K monitor in many modern games\u2014a monumental achievement.\nThe GeForce RTX 4090 embarrasses all previous GPU contenders in all games, full stop. The uplift isn\u2019t quite as convincing in esports and DirectX11 titles, but the victories are there, and in games running the more modern DX12 and Vulkan APIs, the RTX 4090 is anywhere from 55 to 83 percent faster than the RTX 3090. That\u2019s on par with the RTX 3080\u2019s uplift over the RTX 2080. \nThis GPU is so fast, we witnessed some games suffering from CPU bottlenecks even at graphics-heavy 4K resolution. It screams. Dropping down to 1440p results in still sterling, but less impressive generational results, as the 4090\u2019s might results in more CPU and game engine bottlenecks at the lower resolution. You really want to buy this for use with a 4K or ultrawide monitor with a blazing-fast refresh rate. If you have a 60Hz 4K monitor, or a 1440p monitor, prior-gen GPUs still deliver plenty of oomph for a lot less money. \nRay tracing is where the GeForce RTX 4090 truly shines. Nvidia\u2019s Ada Lovelace architecture was optimized for these futuristic lighting effects, and the RTX 4090 can play 4K games with every graphics setting\u2014RT and otherwise\u2014cranked to 11 while well shattering the hallowed 60 frames per second mark at 4K with DLSS enabled. Again, that\u2019s a monumental achievement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nAnd DLSS 3\u2019s wondrous AI Frame Generation feature can send frame rates soaring even higher in games that support it, although it doesn\u2019t always make games feel proportionally more responsive. Cyberpunk 2077 runs at 48 frames per second with DLSS active on last-gen\u2019s RTX 3090; on the RTX 4090 with DLSS 3 Frame Gen active, it hits a blistering 138fps. That\u2019s nearly three times as fast and an unrivaled visual experience. Other GPUs hover around 60fps in Microsoft Flight Simulator thanks to its CPU bottlenecking, but DLSS Frame Gen doubles that. We\u2019ll need to see if Frame Gen\u2019s fidelity and responsiveness holds up over a wider spread of games, but in these early days, DLSS 3 works like black magic. It\u2019s wonderful and coming soon to 35 games. Nvidia is doing impressive stuff with its software features than AMD has yet to match.\nWe\u2019re aiming to have a separate examination of the RTX 4090\u2019s content chops in the coming days, but creators will love this thing, just like they did the RTX 3090. The 24GB of ultra-fast GDDR6X memory paired with dual AV1 encoders will make fast work of rendering and encoding tasks.\nPower draw went up a bit this generation, and you\u2019ll need to use a new 12VHPWR power cable, but it\u2019s worthwhile for this performance. Price went up slightly too, with the RTX 4090 costing $100 more than its predecessor. That stings but seems reasonable enough for this flagship GPU after years of inflation and pandemic-related supply woes. Nvidia\u2019s awesome Founders Edition cooler returns in slightly revamped form. It\u2019s huge yet cool, quiet, and incredibly attractive. The Founders Edition is so appealing it makes it harder to recommend custom designs.\nBottom line? The GeForce RTX 4090 is an absolute monster, delivering dominating performance built for the future of games and content creation. It\u2019s not perfect, but the few mild drawbacks it has are less \u201cflaws\u201d and more \u201cjust what you have to deal with for this much speed.\u201d If you\u2019re willing to spend $1,600 on a graphics card, the GeForce RTX 4090 provides the luxurious gaming experience you\u2019re looking for\u2014and if DLSS 3 gains traction, it could be so much faster in time.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a goliath start to Nvidia\u2019s Ada Lovelace generation. AMD\u2019s RDNA 3 Radeon GPUs will have their work cut out for them when they\u2019re revealed on November 3. Here\u2019s where you can buy the RTX 4090.\nEditor\u2019s note: This article originally published on October 11, but was updated October 12 to include links to our roundup of RTX 4090 models when the GPU hit the streets.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBest Prices Today: GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition\t\t\n\n\n\n\nRetailer\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$3,499.95\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nView Deal \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Brad Chacos, Executive Editor, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos spends his days digging through desktop PCs and tweeting too much.

The company is said to be offering employees the chance to continue working for it in another country.\nNvidia had already suspended all product shipments to Russia back in March over the country's invasion of Ukraine, but had apparently maintained an office presence in Russia in order to support its local employees and their families, the company said.\nHowever, the GPU giant said in a statement issued on Monday that it was now ceasing all activities and closing its offices in Russia, saying that \"with recent developments, we can no longer operate effectively there,\" adding: \"All employees will be given the option of continuing their jobs in other countries.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is understood that Nvidia had at least 300 employees working for the company in Russia before the invasion, and it is believed that there were at least 200 people left before the closure was announced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those employees that do not want to or are unable to move to a different location, the company is said to be offering severance pay.\nAfter Russia began drafting new troops on 22 September, flights from Moscow and St Petersburg sold out for days and airspace restrictions and a \"dramatic\" decrease in international flight options meant prices for those leaving the country skyrocketed, according to air traffic news site FlightRadar. EU airspace remains closed to departing flights.\n\nAutumn's GTC shows who Nvidia really cares about\nNvidia unveils RTX 4090 \u2013 but it's the 4080 to watch out for\nNvidia sets out timeline for H100 GPUs \u2013 now for HGX, next year for DGX\nYou didn't ask for it but Nvidia's gonna get you a metaverse-as-a-service cloud\n\nNvidia blamed the war in Ukraine for having an impact on its first quarter revenue figures for 2022 back in May. CFO Colette Kress said at the time that the company's outlook for the second quarter also included an estimated reduction of approximately $500 million relating to Russia and the COVID lockdowns in China.\nLast month, the US government banned both AMD and Nvidia from selling some kit such as GPUs used for accelerating AI and machine learning to either Russia or China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the UK government has also imposed further sanctions of its own following the annexation of the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia by Russia. The ban covers IT consultancy and a range of other professional services.\nNvidia's decision to completely shut up shop in Russia follows similar moves from many other technology companies, including IBM, which wound up its Russian operations in June, and networking giant Cisco, which also pulled out of Russia and Belarus in June. Oracle and SAP suspended their respective operations in Russia back in March. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Russia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Ukraine\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Russia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Ukraine\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Roscosmos\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                APAC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                EMEA\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Europe\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n                    COMMENTS\n            \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Russia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Ukraine\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Russia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Ukraine\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Roscosmos\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                APAC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                EMEA\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Europe\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSo \u2026 Russia no longer a cyber threat to America?\n\nComment\u00a0Mixed messages from Pentagon, CISA as Trump gets pally with Putin and Kremlin strikes US critical networks\n\nPublic Sector4 Mar 2025 | 218\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNvidia won the AI training race, but inference is still anyone's game\n\nComment\u00a0When it's all abstracted by an API endpoint, do you even care what's behind the curtain?\n\nSystems12 Mar 2025 | 5\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEutelsat in talks with Euro leaders as they mull Starlink replacement in Ukraine\nIncreasingly shaky relationship with the States has Europe considering options\n\nNetworks7 Mar 2025 | 187\n\n\n\n\n\n \nData deluge pushes financial services deeper into AI\nHarnessing AI to optimize applications and services is crucial but building the infrastructure is equally important\nSponsored Feature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAMD looks to undercut Nvidia, win gamers' hearts with RX 9070 series\nThe question is whether we can find them in stock and at MSRP\n\nSystems28 Feb 2025 | 51\n\n\n\n\n\n \nUncle Sam charges alleged Garantex admins after crypto-exchange web seizures\n$96B in transactions, some even labeled 'dirty funds,' since 2019, say prosecutors\n\nRansomware in Focus7 Mar 2025 | 4\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCoreWeave rides AI wave with IPO filing \u2013 but its fate hinges on Microsoft\nGPU farm discloses 77% of revenue tied to just two customers, putting Redmond giant front and center\n\nAI + ML4 Mar 2025 | \n\n\n\n\n\n \nCash torrent pouring into Nvidia slows \u2013 despite booming Blackwell adoption\nMay we all have problems like annual revenue growth dropping from 126 to 114 percent\n\nNvidia GTC27 Feb 2025 | 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIf you dread a Microsoft Teams invite, just wait until it turns out to be a Russian phish\nRoses aren't cheap, violets are dear, now all your access token are belong to Vladimir\n\nCSO15 Feb 2025 | 27\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRussia's Sandworm caught snarfing credentials, data from American and Brit orgs\n'Near-global' initial access campaign active since 2021\n\nResearch12 Feb 2025 | 9\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRunning hot?

In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll be deep diving on new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\nTwitchCon \u2014 the world\u2019s top gathering of live streamers \u2014 kicks off Friday with the new line of GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs bringing incredible new technology \u2014 from AV1 to AI \u2014 to elevate live streams for aspiring and professional Twitch creators alike.\nIn addition, creator and educator EposVox is in the NVIDIA Studio to discuss his influences, inspiration and advice for getting the most out of live streams.\nPlus, join the #From2Dto3D challenge this month by sharing a 2D piece of art next to a 3D rendition of it for a chance to be featured on the NVIDIA Studio social media channels. Be sure to tag #From2Dto3D to enter.\nAV1 and Done\nReleasing on Oct. 12, the new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs feature the eighth-generation NVIDIA video encoder, NVENC for short, now with support for AV1 encoding. For creators like EposVox, the new AV1 encoder will deliver 40% increased efficiency, unlocking higher resolutions and crisper image quality.\nThe GeForce RTX 40 Series delivers higher video quality with AV1.\nNVIDIA has collaborated with OBS Studio to add AV1 support to its next software release, expected later this month. In addition, Discord is enabling AV1 end to end for the first time later this year. GeForce RTX 40 Series owners will be able to stream with crisp, clear image quality at 1440p and even 4K resolution at 60 frames per second.\n\nGeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs also feature dual encoders. This allows creators to capture up to 8K60. And when it\u2019s time to cut a VOD of live streams, the dual encoders work in tandem, dividing work automatically, which slashes export times nearly in half. Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve, the popular Voukoder plugin for Adobe Premiere Pro, and Jianying \u2014 the top video editing app in China \u2014 are all enabling dual encoder through encode presets. Expect dual encoder availability for these apps in October.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/studio-itns-wk24-demo-encoding-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nThe GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs also give game streamers an unprecedented gen-to-gen frame-rate boost in PC games alongside the new NVIDIA DLSS 3 technology, which accelerates performance by up to 4x. This will unlock richer, more immersive ray-traced experiences to share via live streams, such as in Cyberpunk 2077 and Portal with RTX.\nVirtual Live Streams Come to Life\nVTube Studio is a leading app for virtual streamers (VTubers) that makes it easy and fun to bring digital avatars to life on a live stream.\nSeamlessly control avatars with AI by using a webcam and GeForce RTX GPU in VTube Studio.\nVTube Studio is adding support this month for the NVIDIA Broadcast AR SDK, allowing users to seamlessly control their avatars with AI by using a regular webcam and a GeForce RTX GPU.\nObjectively Blissful Streaming\nOBS doesn\u2019t stand for objectively blissful streaming, but it should.\nOBS Studio is free, open-source software for video recording and live streaming. It\u2019s one of EposVox\u2019s essential apps, as he said it \u201callows me to produce my content at a rapid pace that\u2019s constantly evolving.\u201d\nThe software now features native integration of the AI-powered NVIDIA Broadcast effects, including Virtual Background, Noise Removal and Room Echo Removal.\nIn addition to adding AV1 support for GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs later this month, the recent OBS 28.0 release added support for high-efficiency video coding (HEVC or H.265), improving video compression rates by 15% across a wide range of NVIDIA GPUs. It also now includes support for high-dynamic range (HDR), offering a greater range of bright and dark colors, which brings stunning vibrance and dramatic improvements in visual quality.\nBroadcast for All\nThe SDKs that power NVIDIA Broadcast are available to developers, enabling native AI feature support in devices ranging from Logitech, Corsair and Elgato, as well as advanced workflows in OBS and Notch software.\nFeatures released last month at NVIDIA GTC include new and updated AI-powered effects.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/studio-itns-wk25-virtual-background-1280w_1.mp4\n\u00a0\nVirtual Background now includes temporal information, so random objects in the background will no longer create distractions by flashing in and out. This will be available in the next major version of OBS Studio.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/studio-itns-wk25-avatar-1280w_1.mp4\n\u00a0\nFace Expression Estimation allows apps to accurately track facial expressions for face meshes, even with the simplest of webcams. It\u2019s hugely beneficial to VTubers and can be found in the next version of VTube Studio.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/studio-itns-wk25-eye-contact-1280w_1.mp4\n\u00a0\nEye Contact allows podcasters to appear as if they\u2019re looking directly at the camera \u2014 highly useful for when the user is reading a script or looking away to engage with viewers in the chat window.\nIt\u2019s EposVox\u2019s World, We\u2019re All Just Living in It\nAdam Taylor, who goes by the stage name EposVox or \u201cThe Stream Professor,\u201d runs a YouTube channel focused on tech education for content creators and streamers. He\u2019s been making videos since before YouTube even existed.\n\u201cDailyMotion, Google Video, does anyone remember MetaCafe? X-Fire?\u201d said EposVox.\nHe maintains a strong passion for educational content, which stemmed from his desire to learn video editing workflows as a young man, when he lacked the wealth of knowledge and resources available today.\n\u201cI immediately ran into constant walls of information that were kept behind closed doors when it came to deeper video topics, audio setups and more,\u201d the artist said. \u201cIt was really frustrating \u2014 there was nothing and no one, aside from a decade or two of DOOM9 forums and outdated broadcast books, that had ever heard of a USB port to help guide me.\u201d\nWhile content creation and live streaming, especially with software like OBS Studio and XSplit, are EposVox\u2019s primary focuses, he also aspires to make technology more fun and easy to use.\n\u201cThe GPU acceleration in 3D and video apps, and now all the AI innovations that are coming to new generations, are incredible \u2014 I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be able to create on the level that I do, nor at the speed I do, without NVIDIA GPUs.\u201d\n\nWhen searching for content inspiration, EposVox deploys a proactive approach \u2014 he\u2019s all about asking questions. \u201cWhether it\u2019s trying to figure out how to do some overkill new setup for myself, breaking down neat effects I see elsewhere, or just asking which point in the process might cause friction for a viewer \u2014 I ask questions, figure out the best way to answer those questions, and deliver them to viewers,\u201d he said.\nEposVox stressed the importance of experimenting with multiple creative applications, noting that \u201cevery tool I can add to my tool chest enhances my creativity by giving me more options or ways to create, and more experiences with new processes for creating things.\u201d This is especially true for the use of AI in his creative workflows, he added.\n\u201cWhat I love about AI art generation right now is the fact that I can just type any idea that comes to mind, in plain text language, and see it come to life,\u201d he said. \u201cI may not get exactly what I was expecting, I may have to continue refining my language and ideas to approach the representation I\u2019m after \u2014 but knocking down the barrier between idea conception and seeing some form of that idea in front of me, I cannot overstate the impact that is created here.\u201d\nFor an optimal live-streaming setup, EposVox recommends a PC equipped with a GeForce RTX GPU. His GeForce RTX 3090 desktop GPU, he said, can handle the rigors of the entire creative process and remain fast even when he\u2019s constantly switching between computationally complex creative applications.\nThe artist said, \u201cThese days, I use GPU-accelerated NVENC encoding for capturing, exporting videos and live streaming.\u201d\nEposVox can\u2019t wait for his GeForce RTX 4090 GPU upgrade, primarily to take advantage of the new dual encoders, noting \u201c I\u2019ll probably end up saving a few hours a day since less time waiting on renders and uploads means I can move from project to project much quicker, rather than having to walk away and work on other things. I\u2019ll be able to focus so much more.\u201d\nWhen asked for parting advice, EposVox didn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cIf you commit to a creative vision for a project, but the entity you\u2019re making it for\u2014 the company, agency, person or whomever \u2014 takes the project in a completely different direction, find some way to still bring your vision to life,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be so much better off \u2014 in terms of how you feel and the experience gained \u2014 if you can still bring that to life.\u201d\nYouTuber and live streamer EposVox, aka \u201cThe Stream Professor.\u201d\nFor more tips on live streaming and video exports, check out EposVox\u2019s YouTube channel.\nAnd for step-by-step tutorials for all creative fields \u2014 created by industry-leading artists and community showcases \u2014 check out the NVIDIA Studio YouTube channel.\nFinally, join the #From2Dto3D challenge by posting on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook.\n\n\ud83d\udfea It's time to show how your artwork has gone from 2D to 3D (just like @juliestrator)!\nJoin our October #From2Dto3D challenge by sharing a 2D piece of art next to a 3D piece you've made for a chance to be featured on our channels. \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\nTag #From2Dto3D so we can see your post! pic.twitter.com/pc6A6oJVWb\n\u2014 NVIDIA Studio (@NVIDIAStudio) October 3, 2022\n\nGet updates directly in your inbox by subscribing to the NVIDIA Studio newsletter.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: Creators | In the NVIDIA Studio | NVIDIA RTX | NVIDIA Studio \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

Reviews ethics statement        Tech Computing   \n      Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Review: A Monster 4K Gaming GPU\n       \n    Nvidia's flagship graphics card for its new Ada Lovelace architecture is pricey, power-hungry and huge, but it performs.\n        Lori Grunin Senior Editor / Advice I've been reviewing hardware and software, devising testing methodology and handed out buying advice for what seems like forever; I'm currently absorbed by computers and gaming hardware, but previously spent many years concentrating on cameras. I've also volunteered with a cat rescue for over 15 years doing adoptions, designing marketing materials, managing volunteers and, of course, photographing cats.

But it is really, really powerful, and if you're looking to upgrade from an RTX 3080 Ti or lower in search of a kick-ass 4K gaming (or creating) experience, it's the one to beat. Well, at least until we see what AMD's Radeon RX 7000-series GPUs can do in November.But that's only if you take price out of the equation: At $1,600 (\u00a31,699, AU$2,959), it's out of reach for most folks. And as a triple-slot, 5.4-inch tall, 450-watt card, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition is out of reach for a lot of systems as well.     Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition    $1,600 at Best Buy    Like \n              Really fast\n            \n              Lifts performance of everything, not just games and applications that specifically support the new algorithms\n            \n              Relatively quiet\n             Don't like \n            Big and power-hungry\n          \n            Using the four-headed power adapter gets ugly\n           But I really wouldn't buy one before the discount season starts in mid-November. Yes, the price is high, but it's not gougingly overpriced given its performance; it's just suffering from the business-as-usual, taking-advantage-of-FOMO markup. (Big caveat: I haven't tested the RTX 3090 Ti.) The RTX 3090 launched two years ago at $1,499 and the RTX 3090 Ti in March 2022 for $2,000; prices on the latter have since dropped to $1,550 and below. If you can't or don't want to spend that much money now, don't.In the absence of performance results for the RTX 4080s and whatever AMD ships, there's no way to make any price-to-performance-based recommendations. Especially since it's not clear if the RTX 4080s will put any more downward pressure on RTX 3080 Ti prices as sellers really need to get rid of stock, or if the 4090's price will drop as buyers balk at the price.Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition   Memory 24GB GDDR6XMemory bandwidth (GBps) 1.0Memory clock (GHz) 10.5GPU clock (GHz, base/boost) 2.23/2.52Memory data rate/Interface 21Gbps/384-bitRT cores 128CUDA Cores 16,384Texture mapping units 512Streaming multiprocessors 128Tensor cores 512Process 4nmTGP/min PSU (watts) 450W/850WMax thermal (degrees) 194F/90CBus PCIe 4.0x16Connectors 3x DP 1.4a, 1x HDMI 2.1Size 3 slots; 12 x 5.4 in (304 x 137 mm)Launch price $1,600Ship date Oct. 11    Big and bulkyAlthough much has been made of the RTX 4090's size, the Founders Edition is at least smaller than the RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti -- about an inch shorter. It's just as tall, though (distance from PCI connector side to top), and I wish it were a bit less so. While it fits in my Corsair 4000D Airflow case -- just a midtower, but still pretty wide at 9 inches -- a bit more space would give the quad-hydra power adapter coming off the top of the GPU a more comfortable bend where it hits the glass panel. And you can forget about your system's inner beauty. Time to get some PCIe 5 power cables so I don't have to use the Nvidia adapters.     The RTX 4090 Founders Edition is slightly bigger than an Xbox Series S.\u00a0 Lori Grunin/CNETThe card is still big, though: Slightly bigger than an Xbox Series S and definitely fatter than the RTX 3090 Ti FE. Somewhat more mind-boggling, though, is that the Founders Edition only has two fans and it's still a foot long. Third-party cards mostly have three (smaller) fans, so they'll likely be even longer. It's quiet most of the time, too, though when you're pushing it you can hear the fans. I've heard worse, though, and at least they don't whine.\u00a0 \u00a0     Nvidia's quad-headed adapter only requires three of the connections for sufficient power, but if you want to overclock the card you'll need to hook up the fourth. Lori Grunin/CNETBut the FE is heavy, probably because that heft includes a lot of heat-dissipating materials to make up for more fans. While it certainly requires three full slots, even if it didn't, that third slot's screw made me feel a lot more comfortable about relieving some potential stress on the PCI connector.     Plenty of room for vents on the triple-slot card. Lori Grunin/CNETNvidia has made a point of saying support for DLSS 3 is limited to the new Ada Lovelace-class GPUs at launch, but post-launch it's likely it will extend to at least some RTX 30-series cards as well. But I don't expect it to deliver nearly as much improvement for the older GPUs simply because Ada has a lot of streamlining, new algorithms and so on that generally lift performance before you even get to DLSS improvements. Similar to how the 30 series made a real jump over the 20 series for many things. (Here's a summary of all the updates the 40 series brings to the line.)Fast 4KThere's a lot to unpack with respect to the RTX 4090 FE's performance relative to other cards, and I don't have much of the comparative data yet -- I've just switched to a new GPU testbed and haven't completed a lot of my RTX 4090 testing or going back through older cards to retest.\u00a0I have tested enough to answer some of my most pressing questions, though. For one, even games that don't yet (or won't) support DLSS 3 get a notable boost in DLSS 2 performance in 4K. With DLSS 3, the CPU tends to run a little hotter and the GPU a little cooler compared to DLSS 2. You can get really good 4K performance without any performance-enhancing operations enabled   (i.e. DLSS), and with everything ray-traceable and HDR maxed out at 4K, you can play Cyberpunk 2077 pretty well with DLSS 3 (101 fps). Although there isn't a lot of improvement in minimum latency with DLSS 3 (which isn't surprising), it can significantly lower the maximum latency.\u00a0Its ray-tracing performance, both on Port Royal and 3DMark DXR, blew past everything else I've tested by a lot, and the same goes for every test in the SpecViewPerf 2020 pro graphics suite. It seems to run pretty coolly, but I haven't stressed it for an extended period yet.I'll have my complete set of results ready by the time I've got an RTX 4080 or AMD Radeon RX 7000-series card for review. But I can say that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition is a great card if you've got the room and the power supply for it. However, if you care about the money and aren't desperate, wait a month or two before committing.DLSS 2 vs. 3  4K, no DLSS  57.014K, DLSS 2, quality  99.411440p, no DLSS  118.044K, DLSS 3, quality  132.711440p, DLSS 2, quality  177.341440p, DLSS 3, quality  240.59  Note: Longer bars indicate better performance (FPS)\n     Test PC configuration   Custom PC Microsoft Windows 11 Pro (22H2); 3.2GHz Intel Core i9-12900K; 32GB DDR5-4800; 2x Corsair MP600 Pro SSD; Corsair HX1200 80 Plus Platinum PSU, MSI MPG Z690 Force Wi-Fi motherboard, Corsair 4000D Airflow midtower case        \n    Computing Guides\n   \n      Laptops\n     \n  \n          Best Laptop\n        \n          Best Chromebook\n        \n          Best Budget Laptop\n        \n          Best Cheap Gaming Laptop\n        \n          Best 2-in-1 Laptop\n        \n          Best Windows Laptop\n        \n          Best Macbook\n        \n          Best Gaming Laptop\n        \n          Best Macbook Deals\n        \n      Desktops & Monitors\n     \n  \n          Best Desktop PC\n        \n          Best Gaming PC\n        \n          Best Monitor Under 200\n        \n          Best Desktop Deals\n        \n          Best Monitors\n        \n          M2 Mac Mini Review\n        \n      Computer Accessories\n     \n  \n          Best PC Speakers\n        \n          Best Printer\n        \n          Best External Hard Drive SSD\n        \n          Best USB C Hub Docking Station\n        \n          Best Keyboard\n        \n          Best Webcams\n        \n          Best Mouse\n        \n          Best Laptop Backpack\n        \n      Photography\n     \n  \n          Best Camera to Buy\n        \n          Best Vlogging Camera\n        \n          Best Tripod\n        \n          Best Waterproof Camera\n        \n          Best Action Camera\n        \n          Best Camera Bag and Backpack\n        \n          Best Drone\n        \n      Tablets & E-Readers\n     \n  \n          Best E-Ink Tablets\n        \n          Best iPad Deals\n        \n          Best iPad\n        \n          Best E-Reader\n        \n          Best Tablet\n        \n          Best Android Tablet\n        \n      3D Printers\n     \n  \n          Best 3D Printer\n        \n          Best Budget 3D Printer\n        \n          Best 3D Printing Filament\n        \n          Best 3D Printer Deals\n                          Your guideto a better future DealsReviewsBest ProductsGift GuideCouponsVideosSoftware Downloads About CNET Press Room Newsletters Licensing Sitemap Careers Accessibility Cookie Settings Privacy Policy  Terms of Use Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information instagram youtube tiktok facebook x flipboard  US France Germany Japan Korea \n  \u00a9 2025 CNET, a Ziff Davis company.\n  All rights reserved.\n   \n\n\n"

The company, founded in 2019, has rapidly deployed robots for a handful of customer applications, including for Starbucks and Grubhub deliveries.\nCartken CEO Chris Bersch said that he and co-founders Jonas Witt, Jake Stelman and Anjali Jindal Naik got excited about the prospect for robots because of the technology\u2019s readiness and affordability. The four Google alumni decided the timing was right to take the leap to start a company together.\n\u201cWhat we saw was a technological inflection point where we could make small self-driving vehicles work on the street,\u201d said Bersch. \u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t make sense to build a $20,000 robot that can deliver burritos.\u201d\nCartken is among a surge of NVIDIA Jetson-enabled autonomous mobile robot (AMR) startups making advances across agtech, manufacturing, retail and last-mile delivery.\nNew and established companies are seeking business efficiencies as well as labor support amid ongoing shortages in the post-COVID era, driving market demand.\nRevenue from robotic last-mile deliveries is expected to grow more than 9x to $670 million in 2030, up from $70 million in 2022, according to ABI Research.\u201d\nJetson Drives Robots as a Service\u00a0\nCartken offers robots as a service (RaaS) to customers in a pay-for-usage model. This way, as a white- label technology provider, Cartken enables companies to customize the robots for their particular brand appearance and specific application features.\nIt\u2019s among a growing cohort of companies riding the RaaS wave, with ambitions as far flung as on-demand remote museum visits to autonomous industrial lawn mowers.\nMuch of this is made possible with the powerful NVIDIA Jetson embedded computing modules, which can handle a multitude of sensors and cameras.\n\u201cCartken chose the Jetson edge AI platform because it offers superior embedded computational performance, which is needed to run Cartken\u2019s advanced AI algorithms. In addition, the low energy consumption allows Cartken\u2019s robots to run a whole day on a single battery charge,\u201d said Bersch.\nThe company relies on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin \u00a0to run six cameras that aid in mapping and navigation as well as wheel odometry to measure its physical distance of movement.\nHarnessing Jetson, Cartken\u2019s robots run simultaneous localization and mapping, or SLAM, to automatically build maps of their surroundings for navigation. \u201cThey are basically level-4 autonomy \u2014 it\u2019s based on visual processing, so we can map out a whole area,\u201d Bersch said.\n\u201cThe nice thing about our navigation is that it works both indoors and outdoors, so GPS is optional \u2014 we can localize based on purely visual features,\u201d he said.\nCartken is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program that helps startups with GPU technologies, software and business development support.\nServing Grubhub and Starbucks\nCartken\u2019s robots are serving Grubhub deliveries at the University of Arizona and Ohio State. Grubhub users can order on the app as normally they would, and get a tracking link to follow their order\u2019s progress. They\u2019re informed that their delivery will be by a robot, and can use the app to unlock the robot\u2019s lid to grab grub and go.\nSome might wonder if the delivery fee for such entertaining delivery technology is the same. \u201cI believe it\u2019s the same, but you don\u2019t have to tip,\u201d Bersch said with a grin.\nMitsubishi Electric is a distributor for Cartken in Japan. It relies on Cartken\u2019s robots for deployments in AEON Malls in Tokoname and Toki for deliveries of Starbucks coffee and food.\nThe companies are also testing a \u201csmart city\u201d concept for outdoor deliveries of Starbucks goods within the neighboring parks, apartments and homes. In addition, Mitsubishi, Cartken and others are working on deliveries inside a multilevel office building.\nLooking ahead, Cartken\u2019s CEO says the next big challenge is scaling up robot manufacturing to keep pace with orders. It has strong demand from partners, including Grubhub, Mitsubishi and U.K. delivery company DPD.\nCartken in September announced a partnership with Magna International, a global leader in automotive supplies, to help scale up manufacturing of its robots. The agreement offers production of thousands of AMRs as well as development of additional robot models for different use cases.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | RoboticsTags: Agriculture and Food | GPU | Inception | Jetson \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll deep dive on new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\nCreators can now pick up the GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, available from top add-in card providers including ASUS, Colorful, Gainward, Galaxy, GIGABYTE, INNO3D, MSI, Palit, PNY and ZOTAC, as well as from system integrators and builders worldwide.\nFall has arrived, and with it comes the perfect time to showcase the beautiful, harrowing video, Old Abandoned Haunted Mansion, created by 3D artist and principal lighting expert Pasquale Scionti this week In the NVIDIA Studio.\nArtists like Scionti can create at the speed of light with the help of RTX 40 Series GPUs alongside 110 RTX-accelerated apps, the NVIDIA Studio suite of software and dedicated Studio Drivers.\nA Quantum Leap in Creative Performance\nThe new GeForce RTX 4090 GPU brings an extraordinary boost in performance, third-generation RT Cores, fourth-generation Tensor Cores, an eighth-generation NVIDIA Dual AV1 Encoder and 24GB of Micron G6X memory capable of reaching 1TB/s bandwidth.\nThe new GeForce RTX 4090 GPU.\n3D artists can now build scenes in fully ray-traced environments with accurate physics and realistic materials \u2014 all in real time, without proxies. DLSS 3 technology uses the AI-powered RTX Tensor Cores and a new Optical Flow Accelerator to generate additional frames and dramatically increase frames per second (FPS). This improves smoothness and speeds up movement in the viewport. NVIDIA is working with popular 3D apps Unity and Unreal Engine 5 to integrate DLSS 3.\nDLSS 3 will also benefit workflows in the NVIDIA Omniverse platform for building and connecting custom 3D pipelines. New Omniverse tools such as NVIDIA RTX Remix for modders, which was used to create Portal with RTX, will be game changers for 3D content creation.\nVideo and live-streaming creative workflows are also turbocharged as the new AV1 encoder delivers 40% increased efficiency, unlocking higher resolution and crisper image quality. Expect AV1 integration in OBS Studio, DaVinci Resolve and Adobe Premiere Pro (though the Voukoder plugin) later this month.\nThe new dual encoders capture up to 8K resolution at 60 FPS in real time via GeForce Experience and OBS Studio, and cut video export times nearly in half. These encoders will be enabled in popular video-editing apps including Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve, the Voukoder plugin for Adobe Premiere Pro, and Jianying Pro \u2014 China\u2019s top video-editing app \u2014 later this month.\nState-of-the-art AI technology, like AI image generators and new video-editing tools in DaVinci Resolve, is ushering in the next step in the AI revolution, delivering up to a 2x increase in performance over the previous generation.\nTo break technological barriers and expand creative possibilities, pick up the GeForce RTX 4090 GPU today. Check out this product finder for retail availability.\nHaunted Mansion Origins\nThe visual impact of Old Abandoned Haunted Mansion is nothing short of remarkable, with photorealistic details for lighting and shadows and stunningly accurate textures.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s Scionti\u2019s intentional omission of specific detail that allows viewers to construct their own narrative, a staple of his work.\nScionti highlighted additional mysterious features he created within the haunted mansion: a painting with a specter on the stairs, knocked-over furniture, a portrait of a woman who might\u2019ve lived there and a mirror smashed in the middle as if someone struck it.\n\u201cPerhaps whatever happened is still in these walls,\u201d mused Scionti. \u201cAbandoned, reclaimed by nature.\u201d\nScionti said he finds inspiration in the works of H.R. Giger, H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe, and often dreams of the worlds he aspires to build before bringing them to life in 3D. He stressed, however, \u201cI don\u2019t have a dark side! It just appears in my work!\u201d\nFor Old Abandoned Haunted Mansion, the artist began by creating a moodboard featuring abandoned places. He specifically included structures that were reclaimed by nature to create a warm mood with the sun filtering in from windows, doors and broken walls.\nFoundational building blocks in Autodesk 3ds Max.\nScionti then modeled the scene\u2019s objects, such as the ceiling lamp, painting frames and staircase, using Autodesk 3ds Max. By using a GeForce RTX 3090 GPU and selecting the default Autodesk Arnold renderer, he deployed RTX-accelerated AI denoising, resulting in interactive renders that were easy to edit while maintaining photorealism.\nModeling in Autodesk 3d Max.\nThe versatile Autodesk 3ds Max software supports third-party GPU-accelerated renderers such as V-Ray, OctaneRender and Redshift, giving RTX owners additional options for their creative workflows.\nWhen it comes time to export the renders, Scionti will soon be able to use GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs to do so up to 80% faster than the previous generation.\nTexture applications in Adobe 3D Substance Painter.\nScionti imported the models, like the ceiling lamp and various paintings, into Adobe Substance 3D Painter to apply unique textures. The artist used RTX-accelerated light and ambient occlusion to bake his assets in mere seconds.\nModeling techniques for the curtains, the drape on the armchair and the ghostly figure were created using Marvelous Designer, a realistic cloth-making program for 3D artists. In a system-requirements page, the Marvelous Designer team recommends using GeForce RTX 30 and other NVIDIA RTX GPU class GPUs, as well as downloading the latest NVIDIA Studio Driver.\nTexturing and material creation in Quixel Mixer.\nAdditional objects like the wooden ceiling were created using Quixel Mixer, an all-in-one texturing and material-creation tool designed to be intuitive and extremely fast.\nBrowsing objects in Quixel Megascans.\nScionti then searched Quixel Megascans, the largest and fastest growing 3D can library, to acquire the remaining assets to round out the piece.\nWith the composition in place, Scionti applied final details in Unreal Engine 5.\nRTX ON in Unreal Engine 5\nScionti used Unreal Engine 5, activating hardware-accelerated RTX ray tracing for high-fidelity, interactive visualization of 3D designs. He was further aided by NVIDIA DLSS, which uses AI to upscale frames rendered at lower resolution while retaining high-fidelity detail. The artist then constructed the scene rich with beautiful lighting, shadows and textures.\nThe new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU lineup will use DLSS 3 \u2014 coming soon to UE5 \u2014 with AI Frame Generation to further enhance interactivity in the viewport.\nScionti perfected his lighting with Lumen, UE5\u2019s fully dynamic global illumination and reflections system, supported by GeForce RTX GPUs.\nPhotorealistic details achieved thanks to Unreal Engine 5 and NVIDIA RTX-accelerated ray tracing.\n\u201cNanite meshes were useful to have high polygons for close up details,\u201d noted Scionti. \u201cFor lighting, I used the sun and sky, but to add even more light, I inserted rectangular light sources outside each opening, like the windows and the broken wall.\u201d\nTo complete the video, Scionti added a deliberately paced, instrumental score which consists of a piano, violin, synthesizer and drum. The music injects an unexpected emotional element to the piece.\nScionti reflected on his creative journey, which he considers a relentless pursuit of knowledge and perfecting his craft. \u201cThe pride of seeing years of commitment and passion being recognized is incredible, and that drive has led me to where I am today,\u201d he said.\n\nTo embark on an Unreal Engine 5-powered creative journey through desert scenes, alien landscapes, abandoned towns, castle ruins and beyond, check out the latest NVIDIA Studio Standout featuring some of the most talented 3D artists, including Scionti.\n3D artist and principal lighting expert Pasquale Scionti.\nFor more, explore Scionti\u2019s Instagram.\nJoin the #From2Dto3D challenge\nScionti brought Old Abandoned Haunted Mansion from 2D beauty into 3D realism \u2014 and the NVIDIA Studio team wants to see more 2D to 3D progress.\nJoin the #From2Dto3D challenge this month for a chance to be featured on the NVIDIA Studio social media channels, like @juliestrator, whose delightfully cute illustration is elevated in 3D:\n\nHere's another example for inspiration\u2026\ud83d\ude1c\nCredit: @juliestrator pic.twitter.com/RsY6nLg8pT\n\u2014 NVIDIA Studio (@NVIDIAStudio) October 3, 2022\n\nEntering is quick and easy.

This was good news for the people who care about this kind of thing\u2014the $899 12GB RTX 4080 and $1,199 16GB RTX 4080 were substantially different cards with much different performance levels. Giving them both the same name could have created unnecessary disappointment and confusion for buyers of the cheaper card.\nThe problem for GPU makers is that Nvidia planned to launch those cards in mid-November, and partners had already started manufacturing and packaging them so they could be shipped out to retailers. Gamers Nexus has spoken with sources at two of Nvidia's board partners about some of these logistical hurdles, reporting that existing boxes for 12GB RTX 4080 cards were being \"collected and destroyed\" and that Nvidia \"is at least subsidizing the boxes, or part of them, to be replaced.\" The relabeled GPUs will supposedly be reintroduced or relaunched (or un-unlaunched?) around CES in January 2023.\nThere will be other costs for board partners, too, both for GPUs that have already been produced and those that will be manufactured after Nvidia has settled on a name (Gamers Nexus says this hasn't happened, but that \"4070\" or \"4070 Ti\" seems most likely). GPU coolers usually have the card's name and model number printed on them somewhere, occasionally in a prominent place with programmable LEDs underneath. These coolers will either need to be rebadged, reprinted, or replaced to switch out the old RTX 4080 branding with the new branding.\nThe BIOSes on the cards will need to be re-flashed, too, so that the GPUs properly identify themselves (both to drivers and to operating systems) with their new model number rather than showing up as RTX 4080 cards. Gamers Nexus and its sources didn't know for sure whether Nvidia would also be adjusting the card's specs to go with its new model name, though Nvidia's post from last week makes it sound unlikely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it\u2019s not named right,\" reads the original blog post. To change its specs just because the name is changing could run the risk of making it less \"fantastic\" and would likely engender some of the same consumer backlash that prompted Nvidia to change the name in the first place.\nFinally, Gamers Nexus says that Nvidia \"will also be reducing the price\" of its rebranded GPU to reflect the new name. This could be tricky for partners that have already manufactured cards with its old retail price in mind, especially because profit margins for these board partners are reportedly already pretty low. If you built GPUs for (say) $700 or $800 expecting to sell them for $900, you would only have so much room to lower the price before you started losing money, and we don't know whether Nvidia would offer some kind of rebate or reimbursement for partners who have already purchased those GPU dies.\nAsked by Ars about the reimbursements, an Nvidia spokesperson told us the company had \"nothing to add.\"\nOne partner that won't be affected by this? EVGA, which broke its longstanding ties to Nvidia in September because of an alleged lack of communication and because of competition from Nvidia's first-party Founders Edition cards. There were other sides to this story\u2014EVGA's profit margins on GPUs were supposedly lower than some of Nvidia's other board partners because they didn't manufacture their own circuit boards or coolers, for example\u2014but if you wanted to prove that Nvidia could be difficult to work with, \"renaming a GPU weeks before release and only partially compensating partners for the trouble\" is a pretty good example.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Nvidia will \u201cunlaunch\u201d the 12GB RTX 4080, says it\u2019s \u201cnot named right\u201d\n          \n\n            Nvidia had taken heat for announcing two 4080 cards with wildly divergent specs.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            GeForce GPUs are 80% of EVGA\u2019s revenue\u2014but it\u2019s cutting ties with Nvidia anyway\n          \n\n            EVGA will continue selling current-gen GeForce cards until it runs out of stock.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Listing image:\n    Getty Images\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n      Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with a focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of operating systems like Windows and macOS.

Gritty dystopian megacities. Battlefields swarming with superheroes. As one of Hollywood\u2019s top concept artists, Drew Leung can visualize any world you can think of, except one where AI takes his job.\nHe would know. He\u2019s spent the past few months trying to make it happen, testing every AI tool he could. \u201cIf your whole goal is to use AI to replace artists, you\u2019ll find it really disappointing,\u201d Leung said.\nPros and amateurs alike, however, are finding these new tools intriguing. For amateur artists \u2014 who may barely know which way to hold a paintbrush \u2014 AI gives them almost miraculous capabilities.\nThanks to AI tools such as Midjourney, OpenAI\u2019s Dall\u00b7E, DreamStudio, and open-source software such as Stable Diffusion, AI-generated art is everywhere, spilling out across the globe through social media such as Facebook and Twitter, the tight-knit communities on Reddit and Discord, and image-sharing services like Pinterest and Instagram.\nThe trend has sparked an uproarious discussion in the art community. Some are relying on AI to accelerate their creative process \u2014 doing in minutes what used to take a day or more, such as instantly generating mood boards with countless iterations on a theme.\nOthers, citing issues with how the data used to train these systems is collected and managed, are wary. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated because this could be really exciting if done right,\u201d said illustrator and concept artist Karla Ortiz, who currently refuses to use AI for art altogether.\nNVIDIA\u2019s creative team provided a taste of what these tools can do in the hands of a skilled artist during NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote at the most recent NVIDIA GTC technology conference.\n\u201cArtificial Intelligence, Leonardo da Vinci drawing style,\u201d an image created by NVIDIA\u2019s creative team using the Midjourney AI art tool.\nHighlights included a woman representing AI created in the drawing style of Leonardo da Vinci and an image of 19th-century English mathematician Ada Lovelace, considered by many the first computer programmer, holding a modern game controller.\nMore Mechanical Than Magical\nAfter months of experimentation, Leung \u2014 known for his work on more than a score of epic movies including Black Panther and Captain America: Civil War, among other blockbusters \u2014 compares AI art tools to a \u201ckaleidoscope\u201d that combines colors and shapes in unexpected ways with a twist of your wrist.\nUsed that way, some artists say AI is most interesting when an artist pushes it hard enough to break. AI can instantly reveal visual clich\u00e9s because it fails when asked to do things it hasn\u2019t seen before, Leung said.\nAnd because AI tools are fed by vast quantities of data, AI can expose biases across collections of millions of images, such as poor representation of people of color, because it struggles to produce images outside a narrow ideal.\nNew Technologies, OId Conversations\nSuch promises and pitfalls put AI at the center of conversations about the intersections of technology and technique, automation and innovation, that have been going on long before AI, or even computers, existed.\nAfter Louis-Jacques-Mand\u00e9 Daguerre invented photography in 1839, painter Charles Baudelaire declared photography \u201cart\u2019s most mortal enemy.\u201d\nWith the motto, \u201cYou push the button, we do the rest,\u201d George Eastman\u2019s affordable handheld cameras made photography accessible to anyone in 1888. It took years for 19th-century promoter and photographer Alfred Stieglitz, who played a key role transforming photography into an accepted art form, to come around.\nRemaking More Than Art\nOver the next century new technologies, like color photography, offset printmaking and digital art, inspired new movements, from expressionism to surrealism, pop art to post-modernism.\nBy the late 20th century, painters had learned to play with the idioms of photography, offset printing and even the line drawings common in instructional manuals to create complex commentaries on the world around them.\nThe emergence of AI art continues the cycle. And the technology driving it, called transformers, like the technologies that led to past art movements, is driving changes far outside the art world.\nFirst introduced in 2017, transformers are a type of neural network that learns context and, thus, meaning, from data. They\u2019re now among the most vibrant areas for research in AI.\nA single pretrained model can perform amazing feats \u2014 including text generation, translation and even software programming \u2014 and is the basis of the new generation of AI that can turn text into detailed images.\nThe diffusion models powering AI image tools, such as Dall\u00b7E and Dall\u00b7E 2, are transformer-based generative models that refine and rearrange pixels again and again until the image matches a user\u2019s text description.\nMore\u2019s coming. NVIDIA GPUs, the parallel processing engines that make modern AI possible, are being fine-tuned to support ever more powerful applications of the technology.\nIntroduced earlier this year, the Hopper FP8 Transformer Engine in NVIDIA\u2019s latest GPUs will soon be embedded across vast server farms, in autonomous vehicles and in powerful desktop GPUs.\nIntense Conversations\nAll these possibilities have sparked intense conversations.\nArtist Jason Allen ignited a worldwide controversy by winning a contest at the Colorado State Fair with an AI-generated painting.\nAttorney Steven Frank has renewed old conversations in art history by using AI to reassess the authenticity of some of the world\u2019s most mysterious artworks, such as \u201cSalvator Mundi,\u201d left, a painting now attributed to da Vinci.\nPhilosophers, ethicists and computer scientists such as Ahmed Elgammal at Rutgers University are debating if it\u2019s possible to separate techniques that AI can mimic with the intentions of the human artists who created them.\nOrtiz is among a number raising thorny questions about how the data used to train AI is collected and managed. And once an AI is trained on an image, it can\u2019t unlearn what it\u2019s been trained to do, Ortiz says.\nSome, such as New York Times writer Kevin Roose, wonder if AI will eventually start taking away jobs from artists.\nOthers, such as Jason Scott, an artist and archivist at the Internet Archive, dismiss AI art as \u201cno more dangerous than a fill tool.\u201d\nSuch whirling conversations \u2014 about how new techniques and technologies change how art is made, why art is made, what it depicts, and how art, in turn, remakes us \u2014 have always been an element of art. Maybe even the most important element.\n\u201cArt is a conversation we are all invited to,\u201d American author Rachel Hartman once wrote.\nOrtiz says this means we should be thoughtful. \u201cAre these tools assisting the artist, or are they there to be the artist?\u201d she asked.\nIt\u2019s a question all of us should ponder. Controversially, anthropologist Eric Gans connects the first act of imbuing physical objects with a special significance or meaning \u2014 the first art \u2014 to the origin of language itself.\nIn this context, AI will, inevitably, reshape some of humanity\u2019s oldest conversations. Maybe even our very oldest conversation. The stakes could not be higher. But if the past is prologue, art and AI can only grow richer.\n\u00a0\nFeatured image: Portrait of futuristic Ada Lovelace, playing video games, editorial photography style by NVIDIA\u2019s creative team, using Midjourney.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Art | Artificial Intelligence \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

After more than a year of extreme GPU prices and shortages, CEO Jensen Huang revealed key details at GTC 2022, with a price sure to make many cry out in despair. $1,599 for the top offering from Nvidia's Ada Lovelace architecture? Actually, that's only $100 more than the RTX 3090 at launch, and if the card can come anywhere near Nvidia's claims of 2x\u20134x the performance of an RTX 3090 Ti, there will undoubtedly be people willing to pay it. The RTX 4090 now sits atop the GPU benchmarks hierarchy throne, at least at 1440p and 4K. For anyone who's after the fastest possible GPU, never mind the price, it now ranks among the best graphics cards.\n\nThat's not to say the RTX 4090 represents a good value, though that can get a bit subjective. Looking just at the FPS delivered by the various GPUs per dollar spent, it ranks dead last out of 68 GPUs from the past decade. Except our standard ranking uses 1080p ultra performance, and the 4090 most decidedly is not a card designed to excel at 1080p. In fact, it's so fast that CPU bottlenecks are still a concern even when gaming at 1440p ultra. Look at 4K performance and factor in ray tracing, and you could argue it's possibly one of the best values \u2014 see what we mean about value being subjective?\n\nAgain, you'll pay dearly for the privilege of owning an RTX 4090 card, as the base model RTX 4090 Founders Edition costs $1,599 and partner cards can push the price up to $1,999. But for those who want the best, or anyone with deep enough pockets that $2,000 isn't a huge deal, this is the card you'll want to get right now, and we'd be surprised to see anything surpass it in this generation, short of a future RTX 4090 Ti.\u00a0Swipe to scroll horizontallyCurrent Top-Tier GPU SpecificationsGraphics CardRTX 4090RTX 3090 TiRTX 3090RTX 3080 TiRX 6950 XTArc A770 16GBArchitectureAD102GA102GA102GA102Navi 21ACM-G10Process TechnologyTSMC 4NSamsung 8NSamsung 8NSamsung 8NTSMC N7TSMC N6Transistors (Billion)76.328.328.328.326.821.7Die size (mm^2)608.4628.4628.4628.4519406SMs / CUs / Xe-Cores1288482808032GPU Shaders1638410752104961024051204096Tensor Cores512336328320N/A512Ray Tracing \"Cores\"1288482808032Boost Clock (MHz)252018601695166523102100VRAM Speed (Gbps)212119.5191817.5VRAM (GB)242424121616VRAM Bus Width384384384384256256L2 / Infinity Cache7266612816ROPs176112112112128128TMUs512336328320320256TFLOPS FP3282.64035.634.123.717.2TFLOPS FP16 (FP8/INT8)661 (1321)160 (320)142 (285)136 (273)47.4138 (275)Bandwidth (GBps)10081008936912576560TDP (watts)450450350350335225Launch DateOct 2022Mar 2022Sep 2020Jun 2021May 2022Oct 2022Launch Price$1,599 $1,999 $1,499 $1,199 $1,099 $349 Here's a look at the who's who of the extreme performance graphics card world, with the fastest cards from Nvidia, AMD, and now Intel. Obviously, Intel's Arc A770 competes on a completely different playing field, but it's still interesting to show how it stacks up on paper.\n\nWe're going to simply refer you to our Nvidia Ada Lovelace Architectural deep dive if you want to learn about all the new technologies and changes made with the RTX 40-series. The above specs table tells a lot of what you need to know. Transistor counts have nearly tripled compared to Ampere; core counts on the RTX 4090 are 52% higher than the RTX 3090 Ti; GPU clock speeds are 35% faster, and the GDDR6X memory? It's still mostly unchanged, except there's now 12x more L2 cache to keep the GPU from having to request data from memory as often.\n\nOn paper, that gives the RTX 4090 just over double the compute performance of the RTX 3090 Ti, and there are definitely workloads where you'll see exactly those sorts of gains. But under the hood, there are other changes that can further widen the gap.\n\nRay tracing once again gets a big emphasis, and three new technologies \u2014 Shader Execution Reordering (SER), Opacity Micro-Maps (OMM) and Displaced Micro-Meshes (DMM) \u2014 all offer potential improvements. However, they also require developers to use them, which means existing games and engines won't benefit.\n\nDeep learning and AI workloads also stand to see massive generational improvements. Ada includes the FP8 Transformer Engine from Hopper H100, along with FP8 number format support. That means double the compute per Tensor core, for algorithms that can use FP8 instead of FP16, and up to four times the number-crunching prowess of the 3090 Ti.\n\nOne algorithm that can utilize the new Tensor cores \u2014 along with an improved Optical Flow Accelerator (OFA) \u2014 is DLSS 3. In fact, DLSS 3 requires an RTX 40-series graphics card, so earlier RTX cards won't benefit. What does DLSS 3 do? It takes the current and previously rendered frames and generates an extra in-between frame to fill the gap. In some cases, it can nearly double the performance of DLSS 2. We'll take a closer look at DLSS 3 later in this review.\n\nFrom a professional perspective, particularly for anyone interested in deep learning, you can easily justify the cost of the RTX 4090 \u2014 time is money, and doubling or quadrupling throughput will definitely save time. Content creators will find a lot to like and it's a quick and easy upgrade from a 3090 or 3090 Ti to the 4090. We'll look at ProViz performance as well.\n\nBut what about gamers? Unlike the RTX 3090 and 3090 Ti, Nvidia isn't going on about how the RTX 4090 is designed for professionals. Yes, it will work great for such people, but it's also part of the GeForce family, and Nvidia isn't holding back on its gaming performance claims and comparisons. Maybe the past two years of cryptocurrency mining are to blame, though GPU mining is now unprofitable so at least gamers won't have to fight miners for cards this round.\u00a0MORE:\u00a0Best Graphics CardsMORE:\u00a0GPU Benchmarks and HierarchyMORE:\u00a0All Graphics ContentNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 at Amazon for $2,899Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090: Price Comparison15 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $2,899View $3,299.99View $3,398View $3,499.99View No price informationCheck WalmartShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n7\n\n\n8\n\n\n9\n\n\n10\n\n\n\nCurrent page:\n\nMeet the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090\n\n\n\nNext Page Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n4K\nGeForce RTX 3090\nAda Lovelace\nGeForce RTX 4090\nGeForce\nrtx\nray tracing\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (79)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

I think I'm going to wait for the 5k series GPU's. I know this is a major bump, but dang it's expensive! I simply can't afford to be making these kind of investments in depreciating assets for FUN.You could still possibly get $800 for the 3090. Then it\u2019s \u201conly\u201d $800 to upgrade! LOL. Of course if you sell on eBay it\u2019s $800 - 15%.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkiniku\n\n\nA review like this, comparing a 4090 to an expensive sports car we should be in awe and envy of, is a bit misleading. PC Gaming systems don't equate to racing on the track or even the freeway. But the way it's worded in this review if you don't buy this GPU, anything \"less\" is a compromise. That couldn't be further from the truth. People with \"big pockets\" aren't fools either, except for maybe the few readers here that have convinced themselves and posted they need one or spend everything they make on their gaming PC's. Most gamers don't want or need a 450 watt sucking, 3 slot, space heater to enjoy an immersive, solid 3D experience.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ny2kmady\n\n\ncan this be used in aorus b550 pro ac ?\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspongiemaster\n\n\nkiniku said:Most gamers don't want or need a 450 watt sucking, 3 slot, space heater to enjoy an immersive, solid 3D experience.Congrats on stating the obvious. Most gamers have no need for a halo GPU that can be CPU limited sometimes even at 4k. A 50% performance improvement while using the same power as a 3090Ti shows outstanding efficiency gains. Early reports are showing excellent undervolting results. 150W decrease with only a 5% loss to performance.\n\nAny chance we could get some 720P benchmarks?\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastStanding\n\n\nthe RTX 4090 still comes with three DisplayPort 1.4a outputs \nthe PCIe x16 slot sticks with the PCIe 4.0 standard rather than upgrading to PCIe 5.0. \nThese missing components are selling points now, especially knowing NVIDIA's rival(s?) supports the updated ports, so, IMO, this should have been included as a \"con\" too.\n\nAnother thing, why would enthusiasts only value \"average metrics\" when \"average\" barely tells the complete results?! It doesn't show the programs stability, any frame-pacing/hitches issues, etc., so a VERY miss oversight here, IMO.\n\nI also find weird is, the DLSS benchmarks. Why champion the increase for extra fps buuuut... never, EVER, no mention of the awareness of DLSS included awful sharpening-pass?! \ud83d\ude0f What the sense of having faster fps but the results show the imagery smeared, ghosting, and/or artefacts to hades? \ud83e\udd14\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchalabam\n\n\nThis card is for AI.

These EVs will be software defined, with automated driving and intelligent features that will be continuously upgraded via over-the-air updates.\nThis extends next-generation vehicle technology to thousands of new customers. NETA has been leading battery-EV sales among new market entrants for the past three months, delivering a total of 200,000 EVs since it began production in late 2018.\nNETA aims to make travel more comfortable with innovative technologies that break the norm. Hallmarks of NETA vehicles include 5G connectivity and digital assistants.\nLast year, NETA Auto released the Shanhai Platform, an independently developed smart automotive architecture. The first model based on this platform, the NETA S, launched in July.\n\nWith the addition of DRIVE Orin, these vehicles will have centralized, high-performance compute to enable even greater capabilities.\nStreet Smarts\nTraditionally, implementing the latest technology in new vehicles requires lengthy product cycles and the updating of distributed computers throughout the car.\nWith centralized, software-defined compute, this process has been reimagined. The vehicle\u2019s intelligent functions run on a single, high-performance AI compute platform. When new software is developed and validated, it can be installed via over-the-air updates, even after the car leaves the dealership.\n\nThe DRIVE Orin system-on-a-chip delivers 254 trillion operations per second \u2014 ample compute headroom for a software-defined architecture. It\u2019s designed to handle the large number of applications and deep neural networks that run simultaneously in autonomous vehicles, while achieving systematic safety standards such as ISO 26262 ASIL-D.\nEquipped with the performance of DRIVE Orin, NETA vehicles will have limitless possibilities.\nAiming Higher\nIn addition to designing its vehicles with DRIVE Orin, NETA is working with NVIDIA technologies to develop advanced autonomous-driving capabilities.\nThe companies are collaborating on the design and development of a centralized cross-domain fusion computing platform for level 4 autonomy.\nZhang Yong, NETA Auto co-founder and CEO, with Liu Tong, NVIDIA automotive general manager in China, at the October signing ceremony.\n\u201cNETA Auto is at a new stage of development and sees technological innovation as one of the biggest enablers moving this industry forward,\u201d said Zhang Yong, co-founder and CEO of NETA. \u201cThe close cooperation with NVIDIA will give NETA Auto a strong boost in bringing intelligent, technology-rich vehicles to market worldwide.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

We didn't get into much detail on DLSS 3 though, one of the new key selling points of Nvidia's Ada Lovelace generation.\nNvidia is making some pretty bold claims around DLSS 3, including its supposed ability to triple or even quadruple performance with the RTX 4090 relative to older Ampere graphics cards. On the flip side, we've seen DLSS 3 being described as a \"fake frame generator\" or some variation of that. The thinking being that DLSS 3 doesn't actually generate what we would typically class as a \"frame\" while gaming, or at least a real frame. We'll explore both sides to that story to see exactly where this new technology sits and whether it's a true selling point for Nvidia's RTX 40 series.\n\nBut first, what is DLSS 3?\nBy now most GPU owners should be familiar with DLSS, an upscaling technique that renders a game at a lower resolution then upscales to a higher resolution using temporal information, motion vectors, and an AI super resolution model. DLSS 2.0 is an excellent technology for gamers in that in delivers more performance than native resolution gaming with only a minor hit to visual quality \u2013 especially using the highest quality presets.\n\nDLSS 3 takes this idea one step further by generating entirely new frames to slot between traditionally rendered frames. With DLSS 2, at least some portion of each frame shown was actually rendered by the game engine in some capacity, but with DLSS 3, Nvidia GPUs have gained the ability to create frames without any traditional rendering taking place.\nThis is achieved through the combination of motion vectors, which show where and how elements on screen are moving between frames; and optical flow, a technique used to blend and interpolate between two images. The resulting generated frames are essentially an estimation of what DLSS 3 thinks the game would have rendered between each real frame.\n\nThe \"performance\" benefits of DLSS 3 - and we need to be careful using the term \"performance\" with this feature as we'll talk about later - come from the GPU being able to run at full power to render normal frames, with the DLSS 3 algorithm generating more at a small performance overhead. This is why Nvidia claims big frame rate boosts using the technology.\n\nBut \"generating frames\" throws up a lot of questions. What is the visual quality like of each frame that's being fully generated by an algorithm? If DLSS 3 is generating frames between each normal frame, how does this impact latency? What are the limitations of using this technology? We'll answer those questions in this article.\nWhere DLSS 3 Works Well\nBefore diving into some visual comparisons, we wanted to touch on the challenges of testing DLSS 3 right now. Currently we only have access to the flagship RTX 4090. DLSS 3 is exclusive to new RTX 40 series GPUs, which means that often DLSS 3 will push frame rates well into the hundreds \u2013 way more than 60 FPS video we can upload and embed on YouTube as shown below.\n\nThis presents an immediate issue of how do you show the visual quality of DLSS 3 when showing 120 FPS+ gameplay at 60 FPS \u2013 will we see many frames cut from the footage? What if those frames being cut are the generated frames, then effectively you aren't actually seeing what DLSS 3 is doing to visuals? This is something that is going to be an issue across all captures of DLSS 3 gameplay, which is why we think you need to be wary of simple 60 FPS reposts of DLSS 3 footage.\nSo how are we approaching this? Well in today's feature you're going to see a mixture of techniques to illustrate what DLSS 3 looks like in motion. At times we'll be playing high frame rate footage straight back at 60 FPS, but at other times we will be slowing the footage down to highlight certain areas of the visuals \u2013 but only in situations where what we are showing is visible in real time, and we'll discuss that as we go.\nFor a better representation of image quality comparisons, check out the Hardware Unboxed video below:\n\nWe're also going to limit DLSS 3 to a much lower frame rate at times using a few tricks, so we can see how the algorithm fares on theoretical future GPUs that aren't nearly as fast as the 4090.\nIt's also difficult to capture 4K 120 FPS gameplay as today's capture cards don't support this, and we typically rely on external captures for these sorts of videos. However, for DLSS 3 we're almost forced into using local capture using NVENC to get footage at a high frame rate, which is what we've done.\nOur test system is using the RTX 4090 Founders Edition, paired with a Ryzen 9 5950X and 32GB of DDR4-3200 memory. There are a number of resources Nvidia provided to look at DLSS 3 but we're sticking to real-world game examples, primarily of three games: Cyberpunk 2077, Microsoft Flight Simulator and F1 22.\nThe implementation of DLSS 3 across these games is quite janky in the pre-release beta versions we were provided, but each developer promises the issues will be ironed out by launch, and in some instances we believe it could be several weeks until the DLSS 3 patch for the game goes live.\nBefore trying to break DLSS 3 with tricky test conditions we wanted to show the typical gaming experience that you'll see reasonably often. Here's Cyberpunk 2077 with DLSS Quality mode on one side, and DLSS Quality mode plus Frame Generation, a.k.a. DLSS 3, on the other side.\nWhen driving along this highway in a predictable, standard fashion as you would in a game, there's not a huge difference between each image. Both sides here are running at about 100 FPS, so we can do a direct image quality comparison. Whether you're playing the game or watching this footage in real time it's quite hard to spot the differences at 4K, which is good news for DLSS 3's frame generation technology.\nClick on the video to jump to the scene described on this section.\n\n\n\n\nOn closer inspection, as expected, the DLSS 3 image is more prone to artifacts, and generally has a slightly softer and blurrier look overall - more akin to DLSS 2's Performance mode than Quality mode. The most common issue with DLSS 3 in motion is slight sizzling and flickering of moving objects. One frame, the normally rendered frame, will be of high quality; the next frame will be a generated frame with unstable edges, ghosting and issues. However at high frame rates this can be pretty hard to spot.\nWe were playing back footage at real time, but how about half rate, roughly 50 FPS? Can you spot the issues? What about now at 25% playback speed? No? What about 12.5% speed? It's easier to spot the artifacts every second frame now, but when we're talking about ~100 FPS footage each of these dodgy frames is only being shown for 10ms with good quality frames in between.\nWhen only small portions of the screen have issues, gameplay is relatively consistent with only small to moderate changes in each frame, this sizzling and artifacting is masked to some degree.\nClick on the video to jump to the scene described on this section.\n\n\n\n\nLet's show another example in Cyberpunk 2077. In this scene we spotted a fair bit of ghosting with each image, but that was present regardless of whether DLSS 3 was used or not - it's an issue with DLSS 2's reconstruction. In this scene we're not equalizing frame rate, so the DLSS Quality side is running at about 50-60 FPS while the DLSS 3 image is at about 80 to 90 FPS.\nWhen we focus our attention on the street lights and overhead power wires, both sides have their share of issues with image stability. But in this scene even looking at real time footage the DLSS 3 image is clearly less stable in motion with more artifacts and more flickering. It's only for some areas of the screen though, it's not like the entire presentation turns terrible with frame generation enabled, it's only parts of the screen which you may find hard to notice depending on how sensitive you are to these issues.\nWhen slowing down the footage it does become more apparent which frames are the normally rendered frames and which are the generated frames - and it's apparent here with a less aggressive slowdown because the frame rate is lower. Previously, when looking at 100+ FPS footage, each generated frame was being shown for less than 10ms. But with this 80 FPS footage we're up to 12.5ms per frame, which doesn't sound like a big difference, but does impact the visibility of artifacts.\nClick on the video to jump to the scene described on this section.\n\n\n\n\nAnother example, this time F1 22 captured at 120 FPS for both DLSS Quality and DLSS Quality + Frame Generation, slowed down to 60 FPS, so we're not discarding every second frame. Even under these slow motion conditions, when just playing the game under regular race circumstances it's pretty hard to tell the difference between frame generation on or off.\nAt this sort of frame rate, each generated frame is only on screen for 8ms or thereabouts, interlaced with higher quality frames. In real time or even half rate playback the DLSS 3 image looks pretty good with only a small drop to image quality visible at times.\nClick on the video to jump to the scene described on this section.\n\n\n\n\nNext example is Flight Simulator, and we're inside the cockpit of an aircraft here, lots of fine details, small knobs, bigger knobs, even a few large shafts to look at. When moving the camera around the cockpit as you would playing the game, DLSS 3 handled this pretty well with a final frame rate of around 120 FPS.\nI wasn't able to notice the artifacts in practice, so while there is a small quality difference between DLAA and DLSS frame generation, in this sort of very slow paced simulator game and even when moving the camera around like this, it wasn't much of an issue for DLSS 3.\nEven landing planes using an external view there's not much motion here, each frame is relatively consistent - ideal conditions for DLSS 3 and this is the majority of the game, so it holds up really well. You'll have to excuse our flying as I'm an absolutely atrocious pilot using keyboard and mouse controls.\nSo when talking about DLSS 3's image quality and best case scenarios, there were a few common themes. If the final frame rate of the scene is above about 100 to 120 FPS, each generated frame is only shown on screen for a short time, making artifacts hard to spot. The higher the frame rate, the less noticeable artifacts are, with more real rendered frames interlaced into the presentation.\nDLSS 3 also benefits from consistency and a lack of motion. Slower paced games like Flight Simulator are a great use case, but even driving around in Cyberpunk provided what you're doing is pretty standard, consistent type stuff then the frame generation and particularly the optical flow algorithm doesn't have to all that much. While DLSS 3 typically doesn't look as good as DLSS 2's Quality or even Performance modes, if these conditions are met the image quality is definitely usable on many occasions.\nWhere DLSS 3 Struggles\nHowever, and this is a BIG however, there were several instances where we were able to really expose the flaws with DLSS 3 and this was much easier to spot than with DLSS 2.\nDLSS 2 does have its share of problems in motion, we've talked about ghosting, aliasing, and flickering in the past, but usually you'd have to be zooming-in footage and viewing fine detail to spot the changes. At times, DLSS 2 is also capable of improving image quality relative to weak native presentations using crappy TAA, and with a performance benefit as well.\nWith DLSS 3 there are no situations where I would describe the image as better than native, and when you see artifacts with frame generation enabled, they are more noticeable than with DLSS 2's fine detail issues.\nClick on the video to jump to the scene described on this section.\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest and most noticeable problems with DLSS 3 concern the UI or UI elements within a game. Frame generation attempts to reconstruct the entire image, and this appears to include the UI. With lots of text, vector-type images, or big uniform areas of color, UI issues are very noticeable, much more than with regular in-game scenes like roads or leaves.\nTake Flight Simulator as an example. While moving around the cockpit it looks just fine for the actual cockpit elements, the UI text showing a waypoint is completely garbled when frame generation is used. There is a lot of flickering and instability with this as we pan the camera, and it doesn't even take rapid movements to expose the flaw. We were able to spot this with the frame rate around 120 FPS, so even though each generated image is being shown on screen for a relatively short period, this constant flickering was distracting and looked horrible. When slowing the footage down you can clearly spot which frames are real and which are generated, with the generated frames not having much idea of what to do in reconstructing the UI.\nThis is also the case in F1 22 at any frame rate. Above each competitor you'll see the names and place of that driver but during standard motion in a race these labels can easily get garbled as frame generation struggles to figure out what to do with these elements. It seems clear that the UI should be rendered into the image after frame generation is applied, but whether this is possible given how DLSS 3 works, we can't be sure.\nThe second issue is when you change camera perspectives or angles within a game. For a brief moment DLSS 3 doesn't know how to handle the image and what you end up with is a terrible frame on screen for a split second. This is how F1 22 handles that transition, you get this big blurry mess as frame generation tries to interpolate between two very different frames. It can be hard to notice this at high frame rates, but it's questionable as to whether showing this frame has any benefit whatsoever when it doesn't really look like a real frame.\nAnd this crops up across many scenarios. If you stop and scrutinize the frames that DLSS 3 actually generates, it's not a pretty picture. Huge areas of blur, elements being blended together, repeated sections of frames, low detail level. Obviously, this is an unrealistic situation because in a game you're not stopping to view each individual frame, but the goal with DLSS 3 is to basically hide these frames between the real rendered frames and fake its way up to a higher level of smoothness.\nProvided the frame rate is high enough and each of these dodgy generated frames is shown only for a short enough time, you'll probably not notice what is going on - and that's true! It can genuinely be hard to spot all of these issues that can appear so glaring when you view the individual generated frames.\nBut there are situations where you can only do so much to hide the flaws. The big problem with DLSS in this sense is when you are using frame generation at a low frame rate, which may be the case on future, lower-end RTX 40 series GPUs. We power limited the RTX 4090 to simulate a much slower GPU that may only be capable of rendering games with DLSS 2 enabled at around 30-40 FPS with heavy ray tracing effects enabled. Then when turning on DLSS 3 frame generation we can try and get this frame rate more up in the 60 to 70 FPS range - this is very likely to be something that users may consider with a card like an RTX 4050 or RTX 4060.\nClick on the video to jump to the scene described on this section.\n\n\n\n\nThe problem with using DLSS 3 at a final frame rate of ~60 FPS is that it no longer hides the artifacts. Here we have Flight Simulator running at just above 60 FPS with frame generation enabled. When panning around this Airbus A320 from the exterior you can easily see instability around the edges of the aircraft, particularly the vertical stabilizer on the rear. These artifacts flicker noticeably and almost look like there's an issue with display corruption - that's DLSS 3.\nIn Cyberpunk 2077 we tried the same, running around 60 FPS with frame generation on, and you can see sizzling and artifacting around some on screen elements in motion. It's more noticeable at slower playback speeds, but is still visible in real time, and contrasts to the DLSS 2 image which doesn't have these issues at the same frame rate.\nThis makes DLSS 3 unsuitable/unusable as a tool to target 60 FPS if your GPU isn't powerful enough to render at this frame rate natively. In fact, you'll likely see issues with the presentation at any target frame rate below 100 to 120 FPS based on our experience with the technology so far.\nThis means the GPU must be capable of rendering at least with DLSS 2 enabled somewhere in the 60 to 80 FPS range before enabling DLSS 3, and to avoid UI artifacts you'll need to aim higher, even a baseline of say 100-120 FPS with a final frame rate near 200 FPS. It's abundantly clear that DLSS 3 only shines from a visual standpoint at high frame rates.\nInput Latency\nDLSS 3 frame generation also increases input latency, even if it increases the frame rate. What this creates is a weird situation where frame rate increases, but latency increases as well - usually when gaming, higher frame rates lead to lower latency, and therefore a more responsive experience.\nBut this isn't the case with DLSS 3, which means that at times enabling DLSS 3 can make a game feel more sluggish even if the frame rate has risen, a weird feeling for sure.\nWe tested this in Cyberpunk 2077, with latency numbers measured as click to photon latency using Nvidia's LDAT tool, which allows us to record the total latency from when you click to when you see the action appear on screen - this is the most accurate way to test latency and gives the most real world results.\n\n\nThe results are very interesting. When enabling DLSS Quality mode, we see what normally happens when frame rates increase. In the area we tested, scene FPS rose from 42 to 72 FPS, and that came with a decrease in latency from 64 to 47 ms. The game feels faster as you'd expect.\nBut when enabling frame generation, while scene FPS rose again to 112 FPS, latency increased to 63 ms. What this means is that despite the game having the visual smoothness of 112 FPS, the latency and responsiveness you're experiencing is more like playing the game at 40 FPS. You end up with smooth motion but a slow feel, which is hard to show on a video.\nIn contrast, if we use DLSS Performance mode to raise performance further instead, we end up running at a lesser frame rate but with noticeably better latency and this plays out as a more responsive gaming experience. Enabling frame generation sees latency rise as well, but at least latency is now lower than native rendering.\nThe reason why we're seeing these results and why there's a stark discrepancy to Nvidia's own numbers is that we tested DLSS 2 and native performance with Reflex enabled. After all, if Reflex is available, why would you disable it?\nIt also equalizes the playing field between DLSS3 - which forces Reflex on - and the other rendering methods. So with frame generation as the only variable, we clearly produce higher latency. But when compared to the Reflex off numbers, suddenly frame generation looks pretty good, we go from 102ms at native rendering, to 63ms with DLSS 3 - it's just that no one would consider playing with Reflex off, so it's an unrealistic test condition.\n\n\nThis holds true for the other games we tested. In Microsoft Flight Simulator we measured the latency of changing cameras from the cockpit to exterior camera. The game is heavily CPU limited, so there's no difference in performance between native TAA and DLSS, and only a slight improvement to latency using DLSS.\nBut when enabling frame generation we see an increase in latency, so despite running at double the frame rate, latency is higher by over 10ms. This means responsiveness has gone backwards and is actually worse than running natively. Luckily, in a game like Flight Simulator, latency is not a problem and the game is playable with DLSS 3 on.\n\n\nIn F1 22 we saw the same behavior. Testing the latency of a camera angle change, going from native TAA to DLSS Quality saw a huge uplift in performance and a corresponding decrease in latency - which is what we're used to seeing.\nBut enabling frame generation, improved performance by nearly 40 FPS, but it also increased latency by 11ms. In other words, while the game is running at 170 FPS, you're getting the latency and responsiveness as if the game was being rendered at 100 FPS.\nIn this game we can also compare the latency of DLSS Performance mode to DLSS Quality + Frame Generation, which both ran at roughly the same frame rate. Despite this, using DLSS 3 saw almost 20ms of additional latency added which is quite noticeable. From this perspective, you'd clearly prefer to use DLSS Performance mode over DLSS Frame Generation, as not only does Performance mode look better, it delivers the same frame rate at lower latency. Even using Frame Generation with DLSS Performance mode we can't reach the latency of just running with DLSS Quality mode.\nSo while the visual quality of DLSS 3 may be acceptable in some situations, the latency cost is hard to swallow and the resulting experience depends significantly on what level of performance you're coming from. At a target frame rate of 60 FPS, DLSS 3 provides latency similar to running the game at 30 FPS, which feels terrible and made titles such as Cyberpunk 2077 feel slow and laggy. I have serious question marks over the viability of DLSS 3 for lower end, less powerful GPUs as a result.\nEven gaming with DLSS 3 pumping out 120 FPS, in real world latency terms the game felt more like it was being ran at 60 FPS or even less than 60 FPS at times. I'm not the most latency sensitive gamer, but even I was able to tell the difference.\n\nI tested 120 FPS with frame generation, 120 FPS without frame generation, and 60 FPS without frame generation and the DLSS 3 frame generation results were most like the 60 FPS normal rendering results - which isn't a huge surprise as the latency numbers suggest this would be the case.\nIt was honestly a weird experience playing a game where the smoothness is clearly high, but the game still feels slow, it's not something you typically experience unless there's something wrong with the game engine and how it handles inputs.\nBased on this it's hard to recommend anyone use DLSS 3 at moderate to low frame rates. To avoid any latency issues and effectively playing the game at a lower performance level than you started with, you need a high baseline FPS before enabling frame generation. We would recommend a minimum of 120 FPS before DLSS 3, targeting around 200 FPS with frame generation enabled. In this configuration you'll probably see latency equivalent to playing in the 100-120 FPS range, but with a higher level of smoothness, which we feel is acceptable for single-player titles where latency isn't a huge factor.\nThis also means DLSS 3 is useless for competitive gamers. The key reason you want high frame rates in competitive titles such as Fortnite, Overwatch, CS GO and similar games is to reduce input latency, which makes it easier to track and kill enemies. DLSS 3 hurts input latency despite the apparent gain to FPS, so it's not ideal for those titles. You're better off turning down quality settings or using DLSS 2. With the RTX 4090, the performance level is so high in competitive titles there's no point of considering DLSS 3 anyway.\nOther Important Aspects and Implications\nIt's also pointless to use DLSS 3 when the frame rate exceeds your monitor's maximum refresh rate. With normal rendering, you can see some benefit running at a higher frame rate than your maximum refresh rate because higher FPS will continue to give you latency benefits. DLSS 3 though doesn't provide that same latency advantage because higher FPS does not come hand in hand with better latency. In effect, using DLSS 3 above your maximum refresh rate is doing nothing - it's just producing frames you might not fully see, at no benefit to latency, with the potential for tearing.\n\nWith the recommendations we've outlined so far this makes DLSS 3 most useful for those with high refresh rate 240 Hz monitors or greater. If you can start with around 120 FPS gameplay and use DLSS 3 to boost that up to near the maximum refresh of your display, you'll get a smoother experience with less sample and hold blur. In other situations, either at a lower frame rate or with monitors of a lower refresh rate, the benefits to DLSS 3 are less relevant.\nThe final issue to DLSS 3 is it doesn't support frame caps or V-Sync. Therefore it's crucial to run DLSS 3 on an adaptive sync display, otherwise you will see ugly tearing as DLSS 3 forces a V-Sync off state. You also can't cap or limit what DLSS 3 produces, so a high refresh monitor is required, otherwise you'll run above the maximum refresh and tearing will also reoccur. We hope this is something Nvidia can address in a future revision of DLSS 3 because as it stands for many gamers features like frame caps and V-Sync are essential.\nThere's also the implications of describing what DLSS 3 provides as an \"increase to performance.\" Across GPU history, up until this point, when we talked about one product producing higher FPS than another, that's directly leading to two benefits: smoother visuals and lower latency for more responsive gameplay. The two have always gone hand in hand.\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3 only provides one of the two benefits to higher FPS. It does improve smoothness, but it doesn't improve latency. If you're only getting half of the usual benefit from higher FPS, is it fair to say that has improved performance in the same way as other methods?\nWe would argue that isn't fair, and that DLSS 3 frames per second are categorically not equivalent or comparable to non-DLSS 3 frames per second, even without factoring in visual differences. They're almost measuring different things. That's why in this article we've steered clear of any discussion of raw FPS improvements comparing DLSS 3 on and off and to other techniques.\nWhen you add to the mix the visual discrepancies and what DLSS 3 actually generates in many instances, it becomes even harder to compare. At this point it's clear that a game running at 120 FPS without DLSS 3 frame generation, and one at 120 FPS with DLSS 3, are not equivalent visually.\nOf course, this was also true for DLSS 2, FSR, and other upscaling technologies, but the discrepancy in image quality is perhaps largest when comparing generated frames to real frames with DLSS 3. This makes any benchmark chart showing DLSS 3 vs non-DLSS 3 rendering highly dubious or even misleading. Nvidia loves to make those comparisons, but we just don't think they are truly apples-to-apples. That's not to say DLSS 3 has no benefits, it's just that it can't and shouldn't be compared in this way.\nWhat We Learned: Hot or Not?\nAfter testing DLSS 3 for the past week or two we're coming away with mixed feelings. We don't think DLSS 3 is the disaster that DLSS 1.0 was, but it's clear that DLSS 3 is providing a narrower set of improvements than DLSS 2.0, which is a more versatile technology that delivers benefits to nearly all GeForce RTX owners. DLSS 3 has a more limited set of use cases where gamers will benefit, making it more niche than the excellent DLSS 2.0.\n\nIn short, DLSS 3 will be of benefit to you provided you meet a few criteria:\n\nBefore enabling frame generation, you need to already be rendering the game at a decent frame rate, in the 100-120 FPS range.\nYou'll need to have a high refresh rate display, ideally 240 Hz or higher.\nYou'll need to be playing a game that is slower paced and not latency sensitive, like a single-player title.\n\nIf all of these factors are combined and you have the right set of conditions, DLSS 3 can improve the visual smoothness of gameplay, and while the quality of generated frames is typically less than that of traditionally rendered frames, the way they are interlaced into the output makes artifacts hard to notice.\nWe think it's best to think of DLSS 3 as a toggle for high refresh rate gamers to get closer to maxing out their display; turn it on, and in many cases you can take that 120 FPS level of performance and get near 200 FPS effortlessly, leading to better smoothness - after all, monitors perform best when run at as high of a refresh rate as possible, with the most frames being fed to it.\n\nThis is a decent step towards making 500Hz and 1000Hz displays of the future viable. Rendering at those sorts of frame rates is probably never going to be achievable with the advancements in games, but there is a visual benefit from running at such a high refresh rate. Frame interpolation like DLSS 3 is one technology that could give us that benefit without requiring ridiculous levels of GPU processing hardware.\nDLSS 3 was a real joy to use in Microsoft Flight Simulator most of the time and we suspect you'll find the same in other games that are not latency sensitive or are CPU limited. As DLSS 3 simply generates its own frames without game engine input, it can avoid the CPU bottleneck and deliver a smoother experience.\nHowever, there are limitations to DLSS 3. The biggest is that it hurts latency when enabled. This means that while frame rates go up, the game doesn't feel more responsive, and in a worst case scenario, will feel sluggish because of DLSS 3. A game run with DLSS 3 at 60 FPS feels like a 30 FPS game in its responsiveness, which is not great and makes the technology unsuitable for transforming slower GPUs into 60 FPS performers.\n\nYou get a similar issue with DLSS 3 at 120 FPS feeling more like 60 FPS despite having the visual clarity of 120 FPS - this is why we suggest users target rendering at 120 FPS before enabling the technology, because at this frame rate you're getting a pretty good level of baseline latency and any impact from DLSS 3 will be minimal, especially for a single-player title.\nDLSS 3 also has some visual issues which are most noticeable at frame rates below 120 FPS. The technology does not handle UI elements well, and fast motion can cause flickering, sizzling, blur or ghosting. The lower the final frame rate, the more noticeable these issues will be. Not only does DLSS 3 feel slow at 60 FPS, it also suffers from noticeable artifacts. In general, the visual quality is lower than that of DLSS 2.0 Performance mode, so if you already find that mode unsatisfactory, you won't get a lot out of DLSS 3.\nBecause DLSS 3 provides no latency benefit, there's no reason to run it above your monitor's maximum refresh rate. This is why we strongly recommend a 240Hz display or greater with adaptive sync support. There's also no way to cap DLSS 3 inside the maximum refresh rate.\nAll of this brings us to the major question: is DLSS 3 a key selling point for RTX 40 series GPUs?\nBecause its use cases are more constrained, we don't think it's as much of a selling point as DLSS 2.0. On a powerful GPU like the RTX 4090 there are many cases where you don't need DLSS 3 at all because frame rates are already so high, and we have question marks over how useful it will be on entry-level products, like an \"RTX 4050\" if that ever comes to market.\n\nWe didn't touch on DLSS 3 at lower resolutions in this video, but we briefly tested at 1080p and 1440p and found all the limitations from the 4K presentation also apply there.\nThe sweet spot where buyers will benefit the most will be around RTX 4070 levels of performance, where good frame rates are achievable and DLSS 3 can provide a boost into the 200 FPS range. But we don't think it's a must-have feature, nor would we pay a premium to access DLSS 3.\nThe main benefit of upgrading to Ada Lovelace is its higher performance, especially for ray tracing. DLSS 3 is a nice bonus and adds to the strong feature set of Nvidia GPUs that include DLSS 2, NVENC and Reflex - together those things are hard to beat.\nTo make DLSS 3 a killer feature Nvidia needs to work hard on several areas. Reducing visual artifacts in generated frames will help the experience at more modest frame rates, especially if the algorithm can be improved to handle UI elements better. Adding support for Vsync and frame limits is also essential. However, we're uncertain if the main issue of latency can ever be solved given DLSS 3 fundamentally needs access to a future frame to slot in its generated frame. If Nvidia can somehow fix latency that would be amazing and elevate DLSS 3 to killer feature status, but we wouldn't hold our breath for that to happen.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4080 on Amazon (soon)\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090 on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 5 7600X on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 7 7700X on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 71\n\n\n Got something to say?

The countries join NIO\u2019s customer base in China and Norway.\nThe models launching in the European market are all built on the NIO Adam supercomputer, which uses four NVIDIA DRIVE Orin systems-on-a-chip to deliver software-defined AI features.\nThese intelligent capabilities, which will gradually enable automated driving on expressways and urban areas, as well as autonomous parking and battery swap, are just the start of NIO\u2019s fresh take on the vehicle ownership experience.\nAs the automaker expands its footprint, it is emphasizing membership rather than pure ownership. NIO vehicles are available via flexible subscription models, and customers can access club spaces, called NIO Houses, that offer a wide array of amenities.\nInternational Supermodels\nNIO\u2019s lineup sports a premium model for every type of driver.\nThe flagship ET7 sedan boasts a spacious interior, with more than 620 miles of battery range and an impressive 0-to-60 miles per hour in under four seconds. For the mid-size segment, the ET5 is an EV that\u2019s as agile as it is comfortable, borrowing the same speed and immersive interior as its predecessor in a more compact package.\nCourtesy of NIO\nFinally, the ES7 \u2014 renamed the EL7 for the European market\u00a0 \u2014 is an electric SUV for rugged and urban drivers alike. The intelligent EV sports 10 driving modes, including a camping mode for off-road adventures.\nCourtesy of NIO\nAll three models run on the high-performance, centralized Adam supercomputer. With more than 1,000 trillion operations per second of performance provided by four DRIVE Orin SoCs, Adam can power a wide range of intelligent features, with enough headroom to add new capabilities over the air.\n\nCourtesy of NIO\nUsing multiple SoCs, Adam integrates the redundancy and diversity necessary for safe autonomous operation. The first two SoCs process the 8GB of data produced every second by the vehicle\u2019s sensor set.\nThe third Orin serves as a backup to ensure the system can operate safely in any situation. And the fourth enables local training, improving the vehicle with fleet learning and personalizing the driving experience based on individual user preferences.\nWhile NIO\u2019s models vary in size and design, they all share the same intelligent DNA, so every customer has access to the cutting edge in AI transportation.\nA NIO Way Forward\nThe NIO experience doesn\u2019t end when the drive is over \u2014 it aims to create an entire lifestyle.\nCustomers in new markets won\u2019t be buying the vehicles, they\u2019ll sign for leases as long as 60 months or as short as one month. These subscriptions include insurance, maintenance, winter tires, a courtesy car, battery swapping and the option to upgrade battery services.\nThe purpose of the business model is to offer the utmost flexibility, so customers always have access to the best vehicle for their needs, whatever they may be and however often they may change.\nAdditionally, every customer has access to the NIO House. This community space offers co-working areas, cafes, workout facilities, playrooms for children and more. NIO Houses exist in more than 80 places around the world, with locations planned for Amsterdam, Berlin, Copenhagen, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt, Gothenburg, Hamburg, Rotterdam and Stockholm.\nCourtesy of NIO\nDeliveries to the expanded European markets are scheduled to start with the ET7 sedan on Sunday, Oct. 16, with the EL7 and ET5 set to ship in January and March of 2023, respectively.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

Marco Chiappetta is a technologist who covers semiconductors and AI.Follow AuthorOct 03, 2022, 03:05pm EDTShareSaveCommentThis article is more than 2 years old.NVIDIA STEM Laptop Running Ansys DiscoveryNVIDIA\nThere is a common misconception that NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX GPUs are meant solely for gaming and some content creation workloads, but that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. While NVIDIA does offer an array of powerful, purpose-built enterprise products for specialized engineering, data science, economic, and AI / ML applications, GeForce RTX GPUs can accelerate many of these workloads as well \u2013 all GPUs are massively-parallel processors after all. In fact, NVIDIA\u2019s consumer, professional, and enterprise products often leverage similar GPU architectures. Many of the applications STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) students use in particular can benefit greatly from GPU acceleration, and it is with this in mind that NVIDIA recently launched an initiative to educate STEM students about the benefits of GPU acceleration with many of the popular STEM applications out there.\n\n\nA claim on NVIDIA\u2019s website states, \u201cNVIDIA GeForce RTX laptops do so much more than boost high-performance gaming applications\u2014they also supercharge studies for STEM majors. Powerful Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) help students work faster, with acceleration for top student applications...\u201d\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s STEM Laptops For Students Accelerate Many Key Applications\nPurchasing a new laptop is often a top priority for students as they head off to college, change majors, or simply start a new school year. And high portability is typically a must have; most students want a thin and light laptop that\u2019s easy to carry around from class to class. Unfortunately, many of the thinnest and lightest ultra-portable laptops are relatively under-powered, and rely on basic, integrated graphics solutions. That\u2019s fine for tooling around on-line and editing Word documents, but it can significantly hamper the performance of many popular STEM applications.\n\nA Sampling Of GPU Accelerated STEM Apps.NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2019s STEM campaign not only highlights the many applications that receive a massive performance boost with GPU acceleration, but also a wide array of highly portable laptops that feature the latest GeForce RTX mobile GPUs. NVIDIA is effectively claiming that STEM students can have their cake and eat it too.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nThere is a multitude of GPU accelerated STEM applications, including PyTorch, Tensorflow, Matlab, Ansys Discovery, and Unreal Engine 5, to name just a few. Many burgeoning fields like Deep Learning, Data Analytics, and 3D modeling rely on applications that can receive big performance boosts from GPU acceleration. And that performance boost often translates to significant time savings, a superior user experience, or both, which means getting more classwork done faster.\n\nNVIDIA lists an array of GeForce RTX-equipped laptops on its website ideally suited to STEM students, from companies like Dell, ASUS, and others. If you peruse the offerings, you\u2019ll find a diverse set of options that are highly portable, yet offer the powerful GPU, CPU, memory and storage configurations to run STEM applications with excellent performance.\n\n NVIDIA STEM Laptop RenderingNVIDIA\nNVIDIA STEM Laptops Offer Huge Performance Boosts\nTo put NVIDIA\u2019s claims to the test, we actually took an ASUS STEM laptop for a spin at HotHardware \u2013 the sub-$900 ASUS TUF Dash F15 with a GeForce RTX 3070 \u2013 with Matlab and a handful of AI/ML workloads \u2013 to see how it performed versus a CPU with integrated graphics alone, and the results were stark. In regards to a machine vision application, for example, author Ben Funk states, \u201cThe GeForce RTX 3070 cruised through about 415 images per second, while the Intel integrated graphics could only handle about 15 using the same set of images. That's a performance increase of around 27.67x, or greater than 2,700% of the performance.\u201d That is an absolutely massive performance improvement. And if you peruse the entire article, you\u2019ll also note that the machine performs very well in general in a wide array of benchmarks, and its battery life is solid too.\nAccelerating commonly used applications, improving the user experience, and ultimately giving time back to STEM students are very real, appreciable benefits that can help those students achieve their education goals, quicker and easier. As such, NVIDIA\u2019s awareness efforts here are spot-on. And of course, having a GeForce in a laptop can also help STEM student blow off steam in their favorite games, which is an ancillary benefit that many of them will appreciate.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

offers a powerful platform that anyone can spin up in minutes without having to incur the costs and burden of managing their own on-premises infrastructure. And of course, we have taken our benchmarking of the new framework to a new level, to truly show the power of the Azure infrastructure.\t\t\n\n\nThis post was co-authored by Hugo Affaticati, Technical Program Manager, Microsoft Azure HPC + AI, and Jon Shelley, Principal TPM Manager, Microsoft Azure HPC + AI.\nNatural language processing (NLP), automated speech recognition (ASR), and text-to-speech (TTS) applications are becoming increasingly common in today\u2019s world. Most companies have leveraged these technologies to create chatbots for managing customer questions and complaints, streamlining operations, and removing some of the heavy cost burden that comes with headcount. But what you may not realize is they\u2019re also being used internally to reduce risk and identify fraudulent behavior, reduce customer complaints, increase automation, and analyze customer sentiment. It\u2019s prevalent in most places, but especially in industries such as healthcare, finance, retail, and telecommunications.\nNVIDIA recently released the latest version of the NVIDIA NeMo Megatron framework, which is now in open beta. This framework can be used to build and deploy large language models (LLMs) with natural language understanding (NLU).\nCombining NVIDIA NeMo Megatron with our Azure AI infrastructure offers a powerful platform that anyone can spin up in minutes without having to incur the costs and burden of managing their own on-premises infrastructure. And of course, we have taken our benchmarking of the new framework to a new level, to truly show the power of the Azure infrastructure.\nReaching new milestones with 530B parameters\nWe used Azure NDm A100 v4-series virtual machines to run the GPT-3 model\u2019s new NVIDIA NeMo Megatron framework and test the limits of this series. NDm A100 v4 virtual machines are Azure\u2019s flagship GPU offerings for AI and deep learning powered by NVIDIA A100 80GB Tensor Core GPUs. These instances have the most GPU memory capacity and bandwidth, backed by NVIDIA InfiniBand HDR connections to support scaling up and out. Ultimately, we ran a 530B-parameter benchmark on 175 virtual machines, resulting in a training time per step of as low as 55.7 seconds (figure1). This benchmark measures the compute efficiency and how it scales by measuring the time taken per step to train the model after steady state is reached, with a mini-batch size of one. Such outstanding speed would not have been possible without InfiniBand HDR providing excellent communication between nodes without increased latency.\nFigure 1: Training time per step on the 530B-parameter benchmark from 105 to 175 virtual machines.\nThese results highlight an almost linear speed increase, guaranteeing better performance for a higher number of nodes\u2014paramount for heavy or time-sensitive workloads. As shown by these runs with billions of parameters, customers can rest assured that Azure\u2019s infrastructure can handle even the most difficult and complex workloads, on demand.\n\u201cSpeed and scale are both key to developing large language models, and the latest release of the NVIDIA NeMo Megatron framework introduces new techniques to deliver 30 percent faster training for LLMs,\u201d said Paresh Kharya, senior director of accelerated computing at NVIDIA. \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s testing with NeMo Megatron 530B also shows that Azure NDm A100 v4 instances powered by NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs and NVIDIA InfiniBand networking provide a compelling option for achieving linear training speedups at massive scale.\u201d\nShowcasing Azure AI capabilities\u2014now and in the future\nAzure\u2019s commitment is to make AI and HPC accessible to everyone. It includes, but is not limited to, providing the best AI infrastructure that scales from the smallest use cases to the heaviest workloads. As we continue to innovate to build the best platform for your AI workloads, our promise to you is to use the latest benchmarks to test our AI capabilities. These results help drive our own innovation and showcase that there is no limit to what you can do.

When a standalone GPU is as large as a modern video gaming console\u2014it's nearly identical in total volume to the Xbox Series S and more than double the size of a Nintendo Switch\u2014it's hard not to laugh incredulously at the thing. None of Nvidia's highest-end \"reference\" GPUs, previously branded as \"Titan\" models, have ever been so massive, and things only get more ludicrous when you move beyond Nvidia's \"Founders Edition\" and check out AIB options from third-party partners.

You're going to consistently laugh with, not at, the RTX 4090, either in joy or excited disbelief.\nThe RTX 4090 is the biggest holy-cow jump in GPU performance compared to its contemporaries in recent history. It arguably exceeds even the Nvidia 1000-series Titan X in that regard. Think of any current PC gaming workload that includes \"future-proofed\" overkill settings, then imagine the RTX 4090 faking like Grave Digger and crushing those tests like abandoned cars at a monster truck rally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Zoom in on nicely etched text.\n          \n\n\n\n\nZoom in on nicely etched text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Nvidia's twin-fan design returns in a chassis that resembles the 3000-series founders editions.\n              \n                      Sam Machkovech\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's twin-fan design returns in a chassis that resembles the 3000-series founders editions.\n\n                      Sam Machkovech\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Unsurprising combination of HDMI 2.1 and DP 1.4 ports, along with a better sense of its height.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nUnsurprising combination of HDMI 2.1 and DP 1.4 ports, along with a better sense of its height.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's twin-fan design returns in a chassis that resembles the 3000-series founders editions.\n\n                      Sam Machkovech\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nUnsurprising combination of HDMI 2.1 and DP 1.4 ports, along with a better sense of its height.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      You're not imagining things; that's a slight concave curve on each of its edges. If you already have an ATX 3.0-compliant power supply, you can expect a tidier connection between the 4090 and your PC's power supply. If not...\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      ... you can use this adapter to connect the 4090 to legacy PSUs. This cable comes with the 4090 by default, and the box suggests no less than 450 W for its power.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Spoiler alert: You only need to connect three of these to get the GPU running. But the fourth is there for... reasons.\n          \n\n\n\n\nYou'd hope for results like that from a $1,599-and-up GPU, but remember, at its launch, Nvidia's Titan-like RTX 3090 disappointed on a price-to-performance front compared to the RTX 3080. What's more, the RTX 3090 only got away with its inflated price due to the Great GPU Shortage. (Emails I sent to many desperate friends during the Dark Times amounted to \"if you have to spend over $1,000 on a new GPU, see about getting a 3090 at MSRP.\")\nFor anyone even considering the 4090 at its bonkers price tag, you're at least getting what you pay for (AIB markups notwithstanding). The RTX 4090 is as impressive as it is fairly priced\u2014at least until the competition at AMD tries to catch up. But this review is also for anyone wondering what the \"Ada Lovelace\" generation of Nvidia GPUs may eventually deliver at lower price tiers\u2014in particular, a bold new flavor of Nvidia's \"DLSS\" system\u2014and whether the 4090's staggering successes will trickle down to the rest of us. Because for those customers, hoping for higher performance and fair, realistic pricing is no laughing matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlasting beyond the 3090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Results from synthetic benchmarks like 3DMark look compelling, but the real show\u00a0comes from game-specific benchmarks, which you'll see further below.\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Results from synthetic benchmarks like 3DMark look compelling, but the real show\u00a0comes from game-specific benchmarks, which you'll see further below.\n\n          \n\n\n\nMy usual benchmarking suite has previously been maxed out on the GPU front by the 3080 Ti, the strongest GPU in my collection. I leaned on it for this review, as its high-end gaming performance typically lands within 95\u201398 percent of RTX 3090 test results. (This closeness is mostly because modern games have crept into higher VRAM demands but rarely exceed the RTX 3080 Ti's 12GB GDDR6X\u00a0capacity, let alone the 24GB GDDR6X\u00a0VRAM in the RTX 3090.)\nTo AMD's credit, the RX 6900XT, which I also don't have on hand, can either lag the RTX 3090 by as much as 10 percent or exceed it by as much as 10 percent in 4K test results\u2014and it pulls ahead even more often in 1440p tests. And there's more performance headroom if we account for this year's RTX 3090 Ti, which delivers roughly 10\u201315 percent more performance than the vanilla 3090.\nAt first, I was concerned that this amount of performance variance above the RTX 3080 Ti might tarnish my collection of test results. Then I started running my usual suite of in-game benchmarks on both GPUs, where I saw an unbelievable gulf in performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Beastly performance in this collection of non-RT benchmark victories for the RTX 4090 over the 3080 Ti. (Any test with two asterisks indicates it was recorded on a different PC, so account for a margin of error within 5 percent.)\n          \n\n\n\n\nBeastly performance in this collection of non-RT benchmark victories for the RTX 4090 over the 3080 Ti.

We'll have to see if that continues to be true when AMD launches its next heavyweight GPUs.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Even this dated, demanding Deus Ex benchmark sees the RTX 4090 gain hugely.\n          \n\n\n\n\nTime and time again, I found that in like-for-like tests at 4K resolution (sans DLSS), the RTX 4090 made mincemeat out of the RTX 3080 Ti's already-high frame rates. The inefficient, GPU-pummeling workload of Borderlands 3: up 55 percent. The non-RT benchmarks of Watch Dogs Legion: up 48.5 percent. Assassin's Creed Odyssey: up 47.9 percent. Assassin's Creed Valhalla\u00a0gets bigger gains at 68.5 percent. Red Dead Redemption 2: up 69.6 percent. (Its predecessor Grand Theft Auto V \"only\" jumps 44.7 percent on the 4090 versus the 3080 Ti.)\nI was so astonished by RDR2's performance on the 4090 that I went back into the game's menus to unlock every possible setting beyond the \"highest\" preset while leaving the pixel resolution at a raw 4K, no DLSS enabled. The same benchmark continued to easily exceed 100 fps on average, all while sticking to a \"1 percent low\" rating of 70 fps (which shows whether or how much a high-performing GPU might drop frames). In other words, Rockstar's gorgeous, demanding, overkill, accurate-horse-hair tech demo on PC should rarely lurch on the RTX 4090 in a way you'd perceive, and you're only one DLSS toggle or one slight visual downgrade away from boosting that frame rate even further.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay tracing, unsurprisingly, widens the 4090\u2019s lead\u2014plus, good VR news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      This RT-specific gallery focuses, again, on RTX 4090 victories.

(Yes, 4090 owners: You can finally get this demanding game to average more than 60 fps at 4K with all RT settings maxed. Another option: Drop the resolution to 1080p to enjoy a whopping 260 fps ray-traced average! With global illumination enabled!)\nIn\u00a0Control, the 4090's\u00a0lead over 3080 Ti is 81 percent with all ray tracing settings maxed out. In Guardians of the Galaxy's most maxed-out 4K ray tracing preset, the 4090 is up 68 percent. Shadow of the Tomb Raider with RT: up a staggering 90.8 percent. And the Hitman 3 benchmark sequence in a fancy-pants Dubai palace, with max RT settings flipped on, fully doubles the 3080 Ti's frame rate.\nThe RTX 4090 is so powerful that I've reached a point where some tests' maxed-out settings at 4K resolutions have become CPU-limited, and that makes our usual slew of multi-GPU comparisons a bit moot. Nvidia suggests that all 4090 owners should upgrade CPUs and get system RAM up to a DDR5 rating, and my own tests bear that out. I still found meaningful distinctions between GPUs on my test rig\u2014which sports an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X and 32GB of DDR4-3200 RAM\u2014and I don't think anybody shooting below the $1,599-and-up GPU marketplace should dump comparable systems just yet.\nThe 4090 also mostly tests well as a brute-force option for VR. As a highlight, the famously inefficient Fallout 4 VR now runs so smoothly on an HP Reverb G2\u2014truly,\u00a0zero hitches in a maxed-settings test\u2014that I could actually imagine playing the whole campaign this way. My only disappointing VR test result came from No Man's Sky, which spurts and stutters in VR, even with the power of the RTX 4090 behind it. This appears to be an issue with the game's streaming of assets and textures, and it could clearly use more optimization to make the most of an overkill GPU like the 4090.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next generation of DLSS: Frame Generation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Ubisoft's Far Cry 6 performs comparably on the RTX 4090 and the RTX 3080 Ti.\n          \n\n\n\n\nUbisoft's Far Cry 6 performs comparably on the RTX 4090 and the RTX 3080 Ti.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Most of my tests of the Guardians of the Galaxy benchmark suite resulted in a pretty scant lead for the RTX 4090.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nMost of my tests of the Guardians of the Galaxy benchmark suite resulted in a pretty scant lead for the RTX 4090.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Only when I put the game into its fullest \"overkill\" settings mode did the RTX 4090 start to significantly pull ahead.

That's CPU limits right there.\n\n\n\n\nStill, with only rasterization as a metric, some testing limits became evident in a small percentage of tests. One major example came from 2020's famously CPU-limited Microsoft Flight Simulator. Jumping from the RTX 3080 Ti to the RTX 4090 in the same 4K, \"ultra\" preset benchmark, sans DLSS, resulted in \"only\" a 28.1 percent boost. If I want bigger gains there,\u00a0do I need to upgrade my PC\u2014or even overclock my CPU?\nAt least for compatible software, this is where Nvidia would like you to believe that your $1,599-and-up purchase is going further than you might expect. What if your new, Ada Lovelace-generation GPU could wave a magic wand that lifts rendering burdens off both the GPU and CPU, increase frame rates across the board, and retain low button-tap latency in your favorite computationally expensive games?\nThat's the DLSS 3.0 promise, and it revolves around a new feature simply named Frame Generation (FG).\nDLSS, like other popular image reconstruction techniques (namely, AMD's FSR and Intel's XeSS), works with temporal information. Take a field of pixels in a 3D image, along with limited motion information showing where those pixels are going, then feed that data into a machine learning-developed model that has studied tens of thousands of hours of gaming footage. GPUs can then process that information with either AI-specific computing cores or general-purpose cores to interpret the limited data and draw additional pixels to fill in the gaps.\nThe result: higher resolutions\u00a0that require lower native rendering resolutions, which thus run at higher frame rates. Nvidia and AMD needed two generations of their respective technologies to accurately upscale lower pixel counts; in particular, fine details like particles are now mostly preserved by DLSS and FSR. Often, the final resolved image can look\u00a0better than the picture produced by native resolution and treated with temporal anti-aliasing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                A simplified representation of Nvidia's DLSS 3 Frame Generation (FG). By examining the entirety of two animation frames, Nvidia says it can generate its own iterative frames between the natively rendered ones, all using nothing more than machine learning-driven techniques.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Nvidia\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      A simplified representation of Nvidia's DLSS 3 Frame Generation (FG).

The company suggested that the optical flow engine (OFA) in its Ada Lovelace GPUs can compute more than double the rate of machine learning calculations compared to the same OFA in Ampere (the RTX 3000 series). And the RTX 4090 uses this jump in calculative horsepower to read more kinds of data, particularly motion vectors, to better fuel its algorithmic image-generation engine. This methodology requires parsing each full, individual frame of animation of gameplay for useful data as opposed to the minute temporal shifts in particular chunks of pixels\u2014then generating and inserting a newly generated frame of animation between each natively rendered frame, all on the fly while you're playing a game.\nWith this FG system turned on, frame rates in DLSS 3-compatible games increase anywhere from 50 to 110 percent in like-for-like scenarios.\nLet\u2019s talk about latency, part 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                The green portions are the ones that Nvidia's AI systems are generating on the fly. The black portions are natively rendered by your computer. There's gotta be a catch, right?

How can a graphics card process and compare two native frames of animation, then generate and insert an invented frame between each, without slowing down the sensation that your favorite video game character is jumping, punching, or shooting the instant you press a button?\nThe answer is Nvidia Reflex, the GPU maker's branding for a system that provides faster delivery of frames from your GPU to its HDMI or DP port. Nvidia has talked up Reflex for the past two GPU generations, but that talk has mostly involved 240 Hz or even 360 Hz displays. If you're an esports pro whose competitive success lives or dies on mouse adjustments at the nanosecond level, then sure, a recovery of 10\u201315 ms of visual information is crucial stuff. But what about those of us content with our 120 Hz or 144 Hz screens?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you toggle on FG in a compatible game, Nvidia Reflex turns on by default in its highest-speed \"boost\" capacity. Those additional 10\u201315 ms of button-tap latency are now being spent to mask the hit that FG inevitably contributes. To clarify, FG is not enabled by default in DLSS 3. If you prefer DLSS to work the way you remember it, you can simply select \"super resolution\" in a compatible game, and that will lower the rendering resolution and add a much smaller latency hit to process those pixels. (Super resolution, as in older generations, usually results in lower latency, thanks to how its trade-off pans out.)\nAlso, DLSS 3's FG succeeds in part due to brute force. The RTX 4090's array of tensor cores\u2014Nvidia's third generation of the technology\u2014is thus far capable of generating and inserting new frames of animation on the fly in a manner that, while technically noticeable, is honestly quite swift.\n\nLatency, continued: When you want to be on the right side of 10\u201315 ms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      DLSS 3 FG's results make apparent frame rates jump significantly\u2014though as we explain, this comes with some amount of additional latency.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3 FG's results make apparent frame rates jump significantly\u2014though as we explain, this comes with some amount of additional latency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      We've added a new, more punishing CP77 test with high-speed highway driving, and the RTX 4090 handles it with ease.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nWe've added a new, more punishing CP77 test with high-speed highway driving, and the RTX 4090 handles it with ease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3 FG's results make apparent frame rates jump significantly\u2014though as we explain, this comes with some amount of additional latency.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've added a new, more punishing CP77 test with high-speed highway driving, and the RTX 4090 handles it with ease.\n\n\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077 has so far delivered DLSS 3's most telling FG test scenario since it supports the twitchiest kind of PC gaming action: aiming a gun with a high-DPI mouse while staring down precise sights. Thanks to both slow-motion cameras and Nvidia's own handy FrameView app, I've been able to measure an incredible success story for DLSS 3 and FG: a mere 10\u201312 ms addition to CP77's latency with FG enabled. (During smoother moments, you can expect 38 ms of total measured latency with FG off or 48\u201350 ms with FG on. During rougher moments, CP77's latency jumps to 58 ms with FG off and 70 ms with FG on.)\nAll this happens while the game's frame rates remain steadily in the 100\u2013110 fps range on my testing rig, with the \"ultra\" graphics preset and the \"ultra\" ray tracing setting enabled. Screaming down any of future-California's neon-soaked highways in a CP77 car at such a high frame rate is transcendent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some DLSS 3 FG scenarios, the latency hit is barely discernible. In others, it's more so. Speeding up by 10\u201315 ms when a game already feels smooth is different from\u00a0adding 10\u201315 ms when a game might start chugging. My worst moments of FG aim sensitivity in CP77 were always followed by a reboot and retest of the same scene with FG disabled, where I realized, sure, the latency is bad in that particularly intense moment with native rendering as well... but it certainly isn't\u00a0better with FG turned on. (The same goes for moments when a busy game's frame rate lurches due to extreme loads or shader compilation stutters; DLSS 3 can't mask those bumps.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                There's really no getting around the majesty of DLSS 3 FG's impact on a CPU-heavy game like MS Flight Simulator.\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      There's really no getting around the majesty of DLSS 3 FG's impact on a CPU-heavy game like MS Flight Simulator.\n\n          \n\n\n\nThat said, when playing\u00a0Microsoft Flight Simulator, where latency is arguably easier to ignore than when playing a shooter, I saw only a small hit to latency with DLSS 3 FG enabled at 4K and \"ultra\" settings: an additional 10\u201315 ms. To clarify, that tiny bump in latency is fueling a whopping 106 percent jump in frame rate performance (136.6 fps) compared to native 4K rendering (66 fps).\nPushing DLSS 3 FG to its limits: What happens at 8K?\nIn Microsoft Flight Simulator, DLSS 3 FG really does feel like a magic wand. In that detailed, beautiful game, this system's image-reconstruction methodology works well, even to my critical eye. I'm the Tom Cruise of Ars Technica: I harangue strangers about the \"soap opera effect\" and tell them to disable built-in frame interpolation systems on their TVs. (I carry lots of \"sir, this is a Wendy's\" energy, I know.)\nEven so, DLSS 3 FG's visual performance has left me mostly charmed. My spot checks of back-and-forth details, both up-close and distant, have left me struggling to see a difference between FG being enabled or disabled. Foliage, buildings, mountains, clouds, and sunsets\u2014DLSS 3 FG seems to get them all right. (The same goes for the flashy, dynamic lights and pedestrian-filled streets of CP77.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne reason might be because the feature has operated on the RTX 4090 at no less than 80 fps. During my 4K tests, it was always interpolating from a base of at least 40 fps, though usually much more; I counted 60\u201380 fps as a base in most DLSS 3-compatible games at maximum settings.\u00a0(Remember: \"base\" frame rate is the amount being natively rendered by the PC, which DLSS 3 FG then automatically inserts more AI-generated frames into.) These final 100\u2013160 fps results take advantage of our brains' limited sensitivity to minute changes once frame rates exceed the 90s. I would surely catch some splotchy or incomplete frame generation if I paused between frames, but thus far, at worst, the system looks like a fine-if-unnecessary motion blur system, all without slowing down the apparent speed of my gameplay.\nNvidia gets to make a great first impression with DLSS 3 FG in part because it's operating on a powerhouse GPU like the RTX 4090. On a 4K panel, the lowest base frame rate I can work with has come in the 40s, in part because DLSS 3 FG always has\u00a0some form of DLSS super resolution enabled.\u00a0 You cannot apply DLSS FG to raw pixel counts, which would help me drive frame rates a lot lower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      An 8K stress test of the new Nvidia DLSS 3 Frame Generation (FG) feature.

At such an overkill resolution, with DLSS set to \"balanced,\" I could get my Microsoft Flight Simulator testing environment to run at 28 fps before enabling FG, which then boosted performance to 41 fps. In this scenario, FG was still surprisingly stable on the visual front, so long as I kept my mid-flight camera steady. Moving the camera quickly, on the other hand, revealed severe, YouTube-like macroblocking errors as the DLSS system tried and failed to stitch together accurate 8K images (see above).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn arguably bigger issue in this stress test is that FG's latency hit turns out to be either a multiple or exponential factor of the base\u2014up to roughly 150 ms of button-click latency in my extreme FG tests, compared to 110 ms of latency in the same 8K test with FG disabled. That's 36 percent more latency with FG enabled. An additional 8K test of an Unreal Engine 5 demo, provided by Nvidia, revealed an even more extreme jump in DLSS 3 FG latency: up to 390 ms with FG on, compared to 115 ms of latency in the same 8K sequence with FG turned off.\n(At one point, I tricked a preview DLSS 3 build of Codemasters' F1 22\u00a0to activate FG inside its VR mode. The result was a splotchy, stomach-turning mess whenever I looked to the left or right while driving. As a result, I do not see a future for DLSS 3 FG in VR.)\nEstimating how DLSS 3 FG will trickle down\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      How good does DLSS 3 look in action?

Rather, the test leaves me unsure about future, more affordable RTX 4000-series GPUs.\nWill the base architecture that powers Nvidia's latest \"OFA\" system adequately scale down to a hypothetical RTX 4070 or RTX 4060 to ensure minimal macroblocking artifacts and latency hits for anyone who wants to apply DLSS 3 FG to 1440p games or even 1080p fare? The 4090's FG system exhibits some clear limits when it's pushed too far, and more affordable RTX 4000-series GPUs will certainly have fewer tensor cores to work with, despite them all being one generation newer than those in the RTX 3000-series GPUs. One telling spec count: The $899 RTX 4080 12GB model has less than half of the 4090's pool of tensor cores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy educated guess at this point is that the RTX 4090 is so overpowered that we should temper our DLSS 3 FG expectations for other GPUs. Weaker cards' FG systems may have lower image interpolation quality, worse latency results, or both. If I had to bet about future, weaker Nvidia GPUs, I would assume their FG latency will be the thing to suffer because Nvidia reps have already made clear that they have not tuned DLSS 3 FG for competitive first-person shooters.\nDLSS 3 FG currently seems like a lottery ticket for a possible rendering\u00a0future.\nBut as a first-generation option in weaker cards, I could see it being tolerable in select cases. Already, I've tested games that have incredible 120-and-up frame rates while DLSS 3 FG is enabled, yet latency creeps up an additional 30\u201340 ms.\u00a0Nvidia provided members of the press with an early look at the demanding game A Plague's Tale: Requiem, which is expected to support DLSS 3 upon its retail launch. After testing the game's DLSS 3 FG mode with a mouse and keyboard, I switched to a gamepad, leaned back in my chair, and was happier to accept the ~40 fps latency increase, owing to its third-person perspective and non-twitchy stealth sequences.\n\nMy choice to stick to DLSS 3 FG in some test cases reminds me of console games that offer a range of graphical modes, each with its own unique frame rate caps. In the past year, some of Sony's biggest first-party PS5 games have added optional 40 fps modes, and these split the difference between higher graphical quality and a smidge more button-tap responsiveness than 30 fps offers. DLSS 3 FG, in this worst-case scenario, feels like a split between these two extremes\u2014only with visuals that comfortably land in an astonishing 120 fps range.\nAs a result, DLSS 3 FG feels first-generation in the same way that Nvidia's first wave of RT-compatible GPUs did. I once suggested early buyers of RTX 2000-series GPUs were buying lottery tickets for a possible RT rendering future; limited results in the field were impressive, but a few combined technologies needed to mature to make RT a viable option in more games. With the RTX 4090, we only got to test four retail video games with DLSS 3 FG compatibility; in particular, we weren't able to test the feature as previously advertised in Marvel's Spider-Man. Just the same, the first wave of DLSS 3 FG sometimes combines RT, higher frame rates, clear interpolation, and responsive gameplay in eye-bulging fashion. Yet in other scenarios, its latency hit is a smidge too much to recommend. DLSS 3 FG is off to a great start, but we want to see more games' implementations and further improvements before declaring it a new standard of clever 3D-game rendering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReasonable GPU temps and noise, unreasonable DLSS 3 FG steps (for now)\nNvidia hasn't mentioned any other paths to significant rendering efficiency gains in the run-up to RTX 4090's launch. This includes technologies that Nvidia trumpeted as far back as the RTX 2000 series launch, including variable rate shading (VRS) and mesh shading, which simply never caught on in the years that followed. The image-reconstruction systems of DLSS, FSR, and XeSS have enjoyed more success as a drop-in addition to existing, popular game engines than anything else Nvidia has pushed in the past decade (and we may still see VRS explode in the future thanks to its DirectX 12 ties, though, at this point, every GPU manufacturer supports that feature).\nIt's unclear whether DLSS 3 and its FG system can be as easily dropped into current and future games' codebases as existing DLSS versions. Nvidia's instructions for DLSS 3-compatible pre-release demos have already included a number of finicky suggestions, so caution is warranted. These issues have included requirements to change certain settings in a certain order for nearly every demo I tested, lest the game crash (and in some cases, those crashes have forced users to delete and recompile an affected game's shaders). This is a matter of pre-release software, obviously, and everything could be peachy-keen once the games in question reach retail.\u00a0But from a testing standpoint, this is certainly the most finicky pre-release Nvidia testing environment we've ever seen. DLSS 3 FG is coming in hot.\nDuring testing, we were also given a counterintuitive suggestion for Nvidia systems: reverse the steps normally used to get Nvidia's G-Sync technology working on compatible screens and monitors. G-Sync users are usually told to enable V-Sync on the Nvidia Control Panel level, but doing this increases DLSS 3 FG's latency an additional 60\u2013100 ms. Nvidia says it is working on a streamlined solution to let G-Sync and DLSS 3 FG play nice together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, while DLSS 3 FG can be impressive in its most ideal uses, Nvidia's Ada Lovelace line is interesting less because of proprietary features and more due to its move to a 5 nm process. The new TMSC process eclipses the 8 nm material in the Ampere generation, and it drives huge jumps in performance-per-watt while keeping the 4090 FE operating at a reasonably mild volume and default clocks that rarely run the GPU above 60\u00b0C.\n\nPower, content creation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia's provided specs breakdown between the RTX 4090 and the RTX 3090 Ti.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Nvidia\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Nvidia's provided specs breakdown between the RTX 4090 and the RTX 3090 Ti.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Nvidia\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nI can't comprehensively speak to the GPU's suggested 450 W power rating, which might raise potential 4090 owners' anxiety levels about power management. My limited testing time didn't include extensive overclocking or power-envelope tests. The good news is that at default settings, the 4090 FE's power draw has not wreaked havoc on my system and its gold-rated 850 W PSU. I honestly wonder whether a 750 W-rated gold PSU would suffice, based on how stable my testing has been, but I don't see any reason to go against Nvidia's wattage suggestion if you're already spending $1,599 and up on a GPU.\nMy advice: If you're happy with an 850 W PSU, stick with it and see what kind of mild 4090 overclocking you can achieve. (On my own testing rig, with an 850 W PSU, I got 4090 FE's base clocks up 150 MHz and memory clocks up 450 MHz for significant periods without running into any spikes, crashes, or issues.) If you really want to push this GPU, which Nvidia suggests has quite a bit of headroom beyond its default spec, check your local energy rates before jumping to a 1000 W PSU and pushing the 4090's limits. (AIB versions of the 4090 will each have their own power ratings.)\nIf you want to buy a GPU with a whopping 24GB of blazing-fast GDDR6X VRAM, you're probably looking to do some sort of content creation, and my cursory tests suggest you'll get your money's worth, even if you decide to dump a 3090 or 3090 Ti in favor of this new card. One big reason is the 4090's shift to a new dual encoder setup, which fuels both traditional h.265 video encoding and the newer, super-efficient AV1 standard. I can't attest to the same flat \"nearly doubled\" encoding speed for both workflow types compared to the 3090 Ti, but my tests using an included AV1-compatible version of OBS showed screaming-fast performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs previously mentioned in our coverage of the Intel Arc A770 and Arc A750, AV1 adoption is beginning to ramp up on the content creator side, and this GPU-powered encoding method enjoys newly native support on the 4090, just like it does on Intel's Arc products. We'll be looking more closely at AV1 once more online platforms begin supporting its huge efficiency gains, especially in a livestreaming capacity. In the meantime, we hope (but don't know for sure) that more affordable Nvidia 4000-series GPUs will deliver comparable gains on the AV1 front and will be worth waiting on if you're more interested in streaming than in, say, applying ray tracing to a pre-rendered scene and then using AI-driven DaVinci plug-ins to isolate 3D actors in that scene and apply further effects to them even as they animate. (For those kinds of workloads, you'll want the 4090.)\nVerdict: A great card now, an unclear harbinger of Nvidia cards to come\nMaking predictions about future GPUs in a given line is never as simple as comparing die elements like boost clocks, VRAM counts, and shader units (which Nvidia still calls CUDA cores), then projecting how those pieces will trickle down to less expensive GPUs. In the Ada Lovelace generation's case, predictions are made trickier by a limited number of announced GPUs, all of which cost a lot of money.\nIf we go by the specs, the $899 RTX 4080 12GB edition (which I sometimes call the RTX 4079 since it sports a wholly different chipset than the 4080 16GB edition) looks like a 60-percent version of the RTX 4090. It will feature less than half the CUDA cores, RT cores, and tensor cores of the 4090 while sporting an MSRP that's more than half as expensive, which might put it in punching range of the RTX 3080 or even the RTX 3080 Ti, albeit with potential hooks for the DLSS 3 FG system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I'm generously assuming that the 4080's higher boost clocks and general efficiency gains, via new generations of existing Nvidia technologies, will get it to a 60-percent performance figure compared to the 4090. The resulting performance could be anywhere from 3070 performance to 3080 Ti, depending on how much efficiency Nvidia's new TSMC 5 nm process adds. That's the wild-card variable we still can't account for until we test 4080 GPUs ourselves.\nBut if our worst estimations come true, it may mean we'll see either a terrible value at the lower end of the RTX 4000 generation or a ludicrous bargain for the higher-end RTX 4090 (possibly both simultaneously). Nvidia's upcoming pair of RTX 4080 GPUs currently look like target practice for whatever AMD may announce on the GPU front in November, but the same cannot be said for the impressive 4090.\nNvidia's latest GPU is the kind of demanding houseguest that is worth making the room and accommodations for. If you can find the RTX 4090 anywhere near MSRP, it will make any $1,000-and-up GPU purchase of the past two years look like a miserable financial decision in comparison.\nYou may not need this much graphics-rendering overkill in your home computing environment, but you'll absolutely want it.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Tom Cruise finally takes a stand\u2026 on your parents\u2019 terrible TV settings\n          \n\n            The \"soap opera effect\" is a common default setting on most high-definition TVs.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Listing image:\n    Sam Machkovech\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Machkovech\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Machkovech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    285 Comments\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Comments\n  \n\n\nForum view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Loading comments...\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrev story\n\n\nNext story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Most Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\nEverything you say to your Echo will be sent to Amazon starting on March 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\u201cAwful\u201d: Roku tests autoplaying ads loading before the home screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\nTrump plan to fund Musk\u2019s Starlink over fiber called \u201cbetrayal\u201d of rural US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\nReport: mRNA vaccines are in RFK Jr\u2019s crosshairs; funding in question\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\nSobering revenue stats of 70K mobile apps show why devs beg for subscriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArs Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

No, you may not need a new PSU.Performance TestingSome Benchmark ResultsBenchmarks with DLSSPower, Thermals, NoiseFinal Thoughts (for now)An Insanely Fast Graphics Card\nIt\u2019s here, and after several days of benchmarking I can confirm that NVIDIA\u2019s Founders Edition of GeForce RTX 4090 lives up to the hype. Well, the performance hype, anyway. There has been talk that the card itself is larger than a game console (ok, it\u2019s bigger than a Switch), or that it might draw enough power to put a strain on your average household circuit. That was all nonsense, but this Founders Edition version is a less power hungry card than what will see from some partner designs.\nYes, there will be two basic types of RTX 4090, with this Founders Edition falling into the 450-watt TGP category, and partners able to configure up to a 600-watt TGP. Still, 450 watts is no joke, though we have already seen this total board power figure from NVIDIA with the previous gaming flagship, the RTX 3090 Ti. However, transient power draw (momentary spikes) is more demanding on a PSU with the RTX 4090, so perhaps not all 450W TGPs are created equal.\nYou can compare the GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition\u2019s specifications to a few other recent NVIDIA graphics cards in the table below:\n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\nRTX 4090\nRTX 3090 Ti\nRTX 3090\nRTX 3080\n\n\nGPU\nAD102\nGA102\nGA102\nGA102\n\n\nArchitecture\nAda Lovelace\nAmpere\nAmpere\nAmpere\n\n\nSMs\n128\n84\n82\n68\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n16384\n10752\n10496\n8704\n\n\nTensor Cores\n512\n336\n328\n272\n\n\nRT Cores\n128\n84\n82\n68\n\n\nBase Clock\n2235 MHz\n1670 MHz\n1395 MHz\n1440 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock\n2520 MHz\n1860 MHz\n1695 MHz\n1710 MHz\n\n\nTexture Units\n512\n336\n328\n272\n\n\nROPs\n176\n112\n112\n96\n\n\nMemory\n24GB GDDR6X\n24GB GDDR6X\n24GB GDDR6X\n10GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Data Rate\n21 Gbps\n21 Gbps\n19.5 Gbps\n19 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Interface\n384-bit\n384-bit\n384-bit\n320-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n1 TB/s\n1 TB/s\n936 GB/s\n760 GB/s\n\n\nTransistor Count\n76.3B\n28.3B\n28.3B\n28.3B\n\n\nDie Size\n608 mm^2\n628 mm^2\n628 mm^2\n628 mm^2\n\n\nProcess Tech\nTSMC 4nm NV Custom\nSamsung 8nm NV Custom\nSamsung 8nm NV Custom\nSamsung 8nm NV Custom\n\n\nTGP\n450W\n450W\n350W\n320W\n\n\nLaunch Price\n$1599\n$1999\n$1499\n$699\n\n\n\n \nYou will probably notice the massive increase in CUDA Core count from the previous flagship, with the RTX 4090 at 16384 cores, up from 10752 with the RTX 3090 Ti. The SM count moves up from 84 to 128 with the RTX 4090, and the new Ada Lovelace flagship offers 512 4th Gen Tensor Cores (up from 336 / 3rd Gen) and 128 3rd Gen RT Cores (up from 84 / 2nd Gen).\nIt may seem as though memory specs are identical to the RTX 3090 Ti, as both sport 24GB of 21 Gbps effective GDDR6X on a 384-bit bus, but an important distinction is a data point from NVIDIA\u2019s new Ada Lovelace architecture not on this legacy format table: L2 cache size. This moves from 6144 KB (~6 MB) from the RTX 3090 Ti to a whopping 73728 KB (~70 MB) from the RTX 4090. Cache obviously makes a difference, as we saw from AMD with the RX 6000 Series.\n \n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 4090 is being produced on a TSMC 4nm NVIDIA custom process, down from the custom 8nm Samsung process of the RTX 30 Series. And as massive as this monolithic RTX 4090 GPU is, with a truly astonishing transistor count of 76.3 billion \u2013 up from 28.3 billion with the RTX 3090 Ti, the die size is actually down slightly from the RTX 3090 Ti (from 628 mm^2 to 608 mm^2).\nAs to pricing, assuming availability at MSRP for all cards, if we consider the $1599 RTX 4090 in relation to an RTX 3090 Ti and RTX 3090, it doesn\u2019t look like a bad value. Consider this: NVIDIA has not released a TITAN card since the $2499 RTX TITAN in the 20 Series era, with the RTX 3090 taking its place at the top of the RTX 30 Series stack \u2013 until the RTX 3090 Ti later on, of course. If the RTX 4090 is this generation\u2019s \u201cTITAN\u201d level product, its $1599 MSRP is $900 less than the last official TITAN, and $400 less than the $1999 RTX 3090 Ti (if you could ever find it at that price).\nWrapping up this intro, we don\u2019t have a deep dive into Ada Lovelace today, and there are certainly more aspects to this new architecture to cover besides gaming performance, not the least of which concerns advancements in the content creation category. We will have to revisit the GPU with a look at performance with the Studio Driver, including video production. It seems that the RTX 40 Series offers dual encoders which, \u201ctogether with the new algorithm to automatically split frames combined with architectural performance improvements allow HEVC and AV1 encoding to be up to 2x faster on 40-Series GPUs than on 30-Series GPUs\u201d, according to NVIDIA.\n \n \n \n\n\nThe RTX 4090 Founders Edition Card\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout a doubt, this is a big graphics card. It tips the scales at nearly five pounds, occupies three full slots (and wants one more for breathing room), and while this is close to the same dimensions of the RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4090 is equipped with slightly larger fans (115 mm) than its predecessor.\nYes, it requires a lot of power. No, you may not need a new PSU.\nThe most talked about aspect of this GPU is power draw, and while 450 W is on the low side of RTX 4090 TGP it\u2019s still novel to observe this gargantuan card somehow managing its 450W input via a single 12VHPWR connector.\u00a0Of course many of us (myself included) will rely, at least for now, on the included 4x PCIe 8-pin adapter, dramatically photographed below:\n \n\n\nWe were supplied with a very powerful current-gen PSU from be quiet! for our review, the Dark Power Pro 12 1500W, which was overkill but certainly instilled confidence going into the review. And speaking of be quiet!, they have a post about the RTX 40 Series in which they explain that no, you don\u2019t need a new power supply if your current PSU provides the recommended power (they go into a lot more detail in the post than I just did).\n \n \n \n\n\nPerformance Testing\nThis review marks yet another new beginning in the history of PC Perspective GPU benchmarking, as I have decided to discard all legacy tests and move to a new platform. We were fortunate enough to receive the latest and greatest from AMD, and with a Ryzen 9 7950X we shouldn\u2019t be CPU bound for a long time.\nSome might argue in favor of the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, but we don\u2019t have one (our 5800X3D-equipped Tiki test system went back to Falcon Northwest a long time ago), and while we have a Core i9 12900KS on hand, 13th Gen Core processors are right around the corner, but not out quite yet. Thus, we proceed with the X670E platform.\n \n\n\n\nPC Perspective GPU Test Platform\n\n\nProcessor\nAMD Ryzen 9 7950X (Stock)\n\n\nMotherboard\nMSI MEG X670E ACEBIOS v1.25 BetaAGESA ComboPI 1.0.0.3 Patch AResizable BAR Enabled\n\n\nMemory\n32GB (16GBx2) G.Skill Trident Z NEO DDR5-6000 CL30\n\n\nStorage\nSK Hynix Platinum P41 2TB NVMe SSD\n\n\nPower Supply\nbe quiet!

And there are no AMD cards here, partly because I didn\u2019t have time, and partly because the highest-end SKU we have is a Radeon RX 6800 XT. It would have ended up in the middle of the pack in each chart, and I probably would have been asked \u201cwhere\u2019s the RX 6900 XT?\u201d or \u201cwhy no RX 6950 XT?\u201d, to which I would reply \u201cwe were never sampled beyond the RX 6800 XT\u201d.\nIdeally, ALL relavant high-end graphics cards would be tested for a GPU launch like this, but I can\u2019t do that this time. I don\u2019t like it, and it makes the review less compelling, but here we are.\nIt may be of interest to see how performance has evolved over the past four years of RTX cards, and to this end I have freshly re-tested the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, RTX 3080 Ti, RTX 3090, and the new RTX 4090. (We don\u2019t have an RTX 3090 Ti to test). I think you\u2019ll find the RTX 4090 to have just a bit of an advantage here, and it\u2019s only going to get bigger as the drivers mature and more games gain support for DLSS 3.0.\nSome Benchmark Results\nFirst, a look at 3DMark Time Spy Extreme:\n \n\n\nAt first I thought I messed up and clicked on \u201cTime Spy\u201d instead of \u201cTime Spy Extreme\u201d. Nope. It just looks like a regular Time Spy score. With a GPU score averaging over 19,000 (all results are the avg. of three runs), this RTX 4090 offers some serious muscle. Let\u2019s see if this result is any indication of results with a real game engine.\nFor our first look at Cyberpunk 2077 performance, I set the quality to the \u201cUltra\u201d preset, and there is no DLSS or other resolution scaling in effect.\n(Update 10/12/22: I should say, I believe there is no resolution scaling in effect, because I set it to \u201coff\u201d. But Cyberpunk has a mind of its own, it seems, and these numbers seem high (we aren\u2019t the only one, at least). Regardless, all four of the cards were tested with identical settings on this system, so the comparison is still valid. Also, Cyberpunk 2077 v1.60 uses AMD FSR by default. Even though we turned it \u201coff\u201d. So maybe these numbers are just the new normal.)\n \n\n\nAs in the 3DMark test above, performance is about double that of the RTX 3090. More than double in this case, actually. How about another title?\n \n\n\nNot quite double the average FPS of the RTX 3090 this time, but still really, really impressive. I\u2019m already convinced; the RTX 4090 is a beast, and can provide unheard-of frame rates even without DLSS 3.0.\nHow about one more title, again without any DLSS?\n \n\n\nIn DiRT 5 at 3440\u00d71440 / ultra we are seeing over 200 FPS from the RTX 4090, with the RTX 3090 all the way down around 120 FPS. It\u2019s a 70% increase this time, but the bigger key for me is how smooth this is, with even the 1% lows well above my display\u2019s 144 Hz refresh rate.\nBenchmarks with DLSS\nNext we have to look at some DLSS results, with older benchmarks as well as something that can take advantage of the DLSS 3.0 / frame generation feature of the RTX 40 Series. I\u2019ll start with the trusty Bright Memory Infinite benchmark, which is built for these RTX cards.\n \n\n\nNot quite 2x the performance of the RTX 3090, but damned impressive nonetheless. It was a big deal (to me, anyhow) when the RTX 3090 SUPRIM could offer over 60 FPS in this demanding test, after the RTX 2080 Ti only managed about 35 FPS. Here the RTX 4090 is averaging well over 100 FPS \u2013 though we see a slight regression in 1% lows. I suspect the press driver was not optimized for this benchmark.\nLet\u2019s revisit a couple of games from the above results, beginning with Metro Exodus \u2013 this time with DLSS enabled, and set to \u201cBalanced\u201d.\n \n\n\nAs impressive as raw performance is, the first DLSS result is almost disappointing. We are still looking at an increase of 46%, but after seeing both raster and ray traced increases in the 70% and higher range, I feel like there\u2019s some performance left on the table here.\nWhat about Cyberpunk 2077 again?\n \n\n\nThat\u2019s better \u2013 an increase of 69% over the RTX 3090 in Cyberpunk at the Raytraced Ultra preset with DLSS set to \u201cBalanced\u201d. But this isn\u2019t all the RTX 4090 is capable of. We haven\u2019t seen the insanity that is DLSS 3.0 with frame generation enabled. Here\u2019s an example:\n \n\n\nThe above chart is a comparison of performance with the RT Ultra preset again, but this time without DLSS, with DLSS set to Balanced, and then with DLSS 3.0 Performance + Frame Generation enabled. The numbers speak for themselves, but a chart isn\u2019t going to tell the story with this sort of technology, as visual fidelity obviously demands first-hand experience. Without watching slow motion / zoomed footage or looking at screenshots, I can only offer my subjective impressions.\nI am not a DLSS fanboy, and I was pretty critical of when it was a first-gen product. DLSS 2.0 reached the point where it was hard for me to tell that it was enabled, particularly in the \u201cQuality\u201d mode where I absolutely can not tell it from native in real time. To me, DLSS 3.0 Performance looks as good as DLSS 2.0 Quality, but maybe I\u2019m just bad at picking up telltale artifacts in real time. But that isn\u2019t even the biggest part of this test result. Frame generation was enabled, and even though I started at the screen through multiple benchmark runs, I never saw any sign of interpolation \u2013 no \u201csoap opera\u201d effect, no blurriness with objects in motion, etc. It\u2019s scary how effective the frame generation is.\n \n\n\nFirst of all, there seems to be something amiss about DLSS performance in the press build of Flight Simulator, as there was virtually no improvement with DLSS Balanced over TAA, with all other settings identical. I re-tested this game with both DX11 and DX12 (beta) in the standard build, and again with the press build that enabled DLSS 3.0 but the DLSS results without frame generation remained within a couple of frames of TAA (DLSS disabled) results. I suspect this has something to do with the build itself, which was set up for the full DLSS 3.0 experience, including frame generation.\nAnyway, if I set DLSS to Performance and turned on Frame Generation the results were fantastic, taking this demanding title up to an impressive ~157 FPS average, which is more than double the performance I could get at 3440\u00d71440 / Ultra without the feature enabled. And, as with Cyberpunk 2077, I could not discern any difference in quality, nor any evidence of frame interpolation, in real time. It\u2019s a remarkably good technology. I\u2019m curious to read what others think of it after they\u2019ve tried it out.\n \nPower, Thermals, Noise\nBelieve it or not, this RTX 4090 Founders Edition card is actually very well balanced. For a gaming load test I ran my usual 10x iterations of the Metro Exodus benchmark, this time at 3440\u00d71440 / Extreme. We already know that this card is limited to 450 watts, and it did not exceed that (in this test it topped out at 436 W board power), and the entire system pulled 648 W at the wall.\n \n\n\nThermals were better than expected given the low noise, with a max recorded temps during the 10x iterations of the benchmark 67 C GPU, 76.8 C Hot Spot in a ~22 C room. These temps came with a maximum fan speed of 40% (~1320 RPM), which resulted in a reading of 37.7 dBA from my SPL meter, which was positioned exactly 12 inches from the front of the card. The fans do get quite a bit more noticeable if they need to spin up, reaching 46.4 dBA at 60%, 52.6 dBA at 80%, all the way up to 57.3 dBA in the event that you choose to manually run your card with 100% (2660 RPM) fans.\nI will add that the fan curve clearly favors low noise, as I never saw above 40% during testing, and had to force the issue using Afterburner for the above SPL readings. At idle the fans don\u2019t spin, and at the lowest setting I could manually set, 30% (1100 RPM), the card only registered 33.9 dBA. Considering the controlled thermals even at lower fan speeds, I think this is one of the better behaved reference cards I\u2019ve tested.\n \n \n \n\n\nFinal Thoughts (for now)\nIf you consider this product within context, I think its fair to say that NVIDIA has hit a home run with the RTX 4090. They are bringing a massive performance uplift to the ultra high-end segment of their product stack, while asking $400 less than the list price of an RTX 3090 Ti. Will this fact make enthusiast gamers happy about a $1599 price tag? Well, what do you think?\nPersonally, I don\u2019t have a problem with these halo products being expensive, as long as we reap the technology benefits in the lower-cost segment down the line. I think the real test is going to be how fast the RTX 4080 16GB is, but at $1199 that card will probably be a tough sell even if performance relative to the RTX 4090 matches the 25% lower asking price. Time will tell.\n \n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 4090 is an absolute beast. It looks and feels ultra high end. It performs like a supercar. Not all graphics cards can be a Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla. The RTX 4090 Founders Edition is like a McLaren. Beautiful, insanely fast, and out of most people\u2019s price range. Ok, it\u2019s not that expensive. Remember, it was just a couple of years ago that NVIDIA sold an RTX TITAN for $2499, and this card would mop the floor with it (I\u2019m assuming, since I don\u2019t have one here to test).\nI can\u2019t wait to test out the RTX 4090 with the Studio driver and see how fast I can render video and accelerate other tasks, given the raw horsepower of this GPU. It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve had new architecture to play with, and while a lot of the conversation leading up to this launch has been about power draw and the size of partner cards, the performance potential of this card cannot be understated. It\u2019s a titan of a GPU, with the size and power draw to match. But I think people will find a way to integrate it into their systems anyway.\nBottom line, NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition is in a class by itself. It doesn\u2019t matter which team you root for, or what games you play. It\u2019s ridiculously fast, and we are only scratching the surface of its performance potential in this short review. For more on this product I highly recommend watching der8auer\u2019s video on the subject (YT link), which includes a study in performance after lowering the card\u2019s power limit (with surprising results).\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nReview Disclosures\n\n\n\n\nThis is what we consider the responsible disclosure of our review policies and procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Product Was Obtained\nThe product is on loan from NVIDIA for the purpose of this review.\n\n\nWhat Happens To Product After Review\nThe product remains the property of NVIDIA but is on extended loan for future testing and product comparisons.\n\n\nCompany Involvement\nNVIDIA had no control over the content of the review and was not consulted prior to publication.\n\n\nPC Perspective Compensation\nNeither PC Perspective nor any of its staff were paid or compensated in any way by NVIDIA for this review.\n\n\nAdvertising Disclosure\nNVIDIA has not purchased advertising at PC Perspective during the past twelve months.\n\n\nAffiliate Links\nIf this article contains affiliate links to online retailers, PC Perspective may receive compensation for purchases through those links.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousPodcast #696 \u2013 Arc A770 and A750, Ryzen 7000 Undervolting, RTX 4090 Hands On, PS5 Jailbreak, Stadia dead plus MORE \n\nNextThe New Intel NUC 13 Extreme Might Just Fit An RTX 4090 \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nSebastian Peak\nEditor-in-Chief at PC Perspective.

Cards like the Nvidia 1060 ($250-300) and AMD RX 590 (similar price range) has completely disappeared.  While those cards had to run at lower detail levels (1080P was the high end of cards on Steam) they were great for entry level systems to get people gaming.  With RTX 3050 @ $399 and the RX 6600 XT both in $300-500 range there isn\u2019t an entry level as anything below the 6600-XT does not give you the performance you need and the 3050 too much performance for a price the entry level can\u2019t fit   Nvidia and AMD are making the Budget Gaming PC no longer within budget.\nReply  \n \n \n\n\n\nLeave a reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

These previously impossible levels of performance give you the power to play fully ray-traced games such as Portal with RTX, NVIDIA Racer RTX, and Cyberpunk 2077 with the upcoming Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode upgrade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday also marks the launch of NVIDIA DLSS 3. 5 games are available this week, multiplying performance, giving GeForce RTX 4090 players 4K, max setting, high FPS gameplay. Additionally, there are numerous other DLSS launches this month, so head over to our new RTX Games article to get the full rundown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn creative apps, the GeForce RTX 4090 is up to 2X faster. Thanks to the addition of dual 8th Gen NVIDIA Encoders, which include support for the next-gen bandwidth-optimizing AV1 codec, export times are slashed in half for video production. Live streamers will see 40% better efficiency, allowing them to produce higher quality streams with the GeForce RTX 4090 added to their home production setups. And AI tools will speed up previously tedious tasks, like Rotoscoping in Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve, which will now be 70% faster than the previous gen on the new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartner apps for NVIDIA Studio will upgrade with support for new features that benefit both gamers and creators that pick up the GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs. Creative editing apps like Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve, the Vokoder plugin for Adobe Premiere Pro, and Jianying will bring dual encoder and AV1 support in updates later in October. NVIDIA is also working with popular video effects apps to enable AV1 with Notch and AV1 and dual encoder support with Topaz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive streamers can look forward to OBS Studio updates releasing later this year with the native integration of the popular AI-powered NVIDIA Broadcast effects, including Virtual Background, Noise Removal and Room Echo Removal. The features will soon be available to NVIDIA Studio partners. Get all the details in our new NVIDIA Studio article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards are also loaded with new technology to make work and play faster and better. For all the details, check out our GeForce RTX 40 Series, RTX Games, NVIDIA DLSS 3, NVIDIA Reflex, NVIDIA RTX Remix, Portal with RTX, and NVIDIA Studio articles.\nBeyond the new additions, every existing innovation and enhancement is available for buyers of GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, including G-SYNC, GeForce Experience one-click overclocking and game optimization, Shadowplay recording and streaming, and so much more. See the full list here.\nOnce you get your GeForce RTX 4090, install our new Game Ready Driver to enhance your gaming and accelerate your workloads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 4090 Reviews\nThe world\u2019s press and YouTubers have been putting the GeForce RTX 4090 through its paces - here\u2019s a sampling of what they said in their reviews:\n\n\u201cThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 is more powerful than we even thought possible.\u201d - TechRadar\n\u201cFantastically, futuristically fast.\u201d - PCWorld\n\u201cI had to triple-check my benchmarks over and over during this review because I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. The GeForce RTX 4090 is a beast of a graphics card that marks a new era for PC gaming, where the high frames I\u2019ve been getting used to at 1440p are now available in 4K.\u201d - The Verge\n\u201cSo let\u2019s get into some of the creator apps first. And this is going to be easy to talk about because the GeForce RTX 4090 just puts on a clinic, by absolutely demolishing every other card here. In a lot of cases it\u2019s almost cutting rendering times in half.\u201d - Hardware Canucks\u00a0\n\u201cRegular viewers will also know that power testing is a key focus for me in my GPU reviews. And no two ways about it, the GeForce RTX 4090 is a new efficiency champion.\u201d - KitGuru\n\u201cDLSS 3 is pure magic at this point, someone should check NVIDIA to see if they have a coven or something.\u201d - TweakTown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 4090 Out Now\nIf you\u2019re itching to add the GeForce RTX 4090 to your system, or want a pre-built with the beyond fast graphics card, head over to our Product Finder.\nTo learn more about the games and apps adding support for RTX technologies, stay tuned to GeForce.com.

Qualcomm also licensed chip blueprints from Arm to use in its Snapdragon family of chips: Qualcomm holds Armv8 and v9 licenses as well as licenses for off-the-shelf, pre-designed CPU cores from Arm.\nAnd when Qualcomm took over Nuvia, Qualcomm started to use Nuvia's Arm-compatible CPU cores for its own chips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArm alleged Qualcomm failed to obtain Arm\u2019s consent, as required by its licenses, to absorb and use that Nuvia-designed technology, which was produced under Nuvia's architectural license. Arm said Qualcomm had declined to negotiate new licensing terms after the Nuvia acquisition.\nArm basically argued that the license it gave Nuvia was for Nuvia's Armv8 server chips, and Qualcomm couldn't just start integrating those Nuvia designs even though it bought Nuvia: Qualcomm had to ask for Arm's permission as per the licensing agreements, it was claimed.\nFor one thing, it appears, Nuvia had a higher royalty rate with Arm than Qualcomm had with Arm, and Qualcomm had hoped to use Nuvia's designs on its lower rate. Arm would prefer Qualcomm pay the higher rate when it comes to using Nuvia's blueprints, something that Qualcomm is seemingly resisting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Qualcomm effectively seeks to circumvent Arm\u2019s licensing model,\" by buying Nuvia and continuing to use the startup's licenses rather than get fresh license agreements, Arm's lawsuit stated.\n\nArm has no right to demand any destruction of Qualcomm\u2019s CPU technology\n\nIn Qualcomm\u2019s 77-page response [PDF] to the suit, Qualy denied the vast majority of complaints leveled against it. Qualcomm argued that its Armv8 architectural license with Arm was \"broadly overlapping\" with the one Nuvia had, with pretty much the same rights. That's broadly, not totally. In Qualcomm's mind, the license it had with Arm was the same as the one Nuvia had with Arm.\nThe Snapdragon designer also suggested that Arm\u2019s efforts to prevent it from using the core designs acquired from Nuvia was \u201cpayback\u201d for opposing Nvidia\u2019s bid to buy the British biz.\nNvidia's takeover of Arm fell through earlier this year after Nvidia failed to garner regulatory support for the mega-merger amid complaints from Qualcomm, Google, and others.\n\u201cArm has no right to demand any destruction of Qualcomm\u2019s CPU technology because Qualcomm\u2019s use of Arm technology and information is licensed under overlapping license agreements,\u201d Qualcomm submitted to the court.\nIt's understood that Arm licenses are tailored to the customer use case and situation. As such, Arm argues Qualcomm really should have negotiated a suitable royalty rate and obtained permission to use Nuvia\u2019s IP, as required by the paperwork.\nQualcomm's filing states that Qualcomm believed Arm would welcome the acquisition, but instead demanded Qualcomm pay higher royalty rates; restrict Qualcomm employees with access to Arm confidential information from working on any CPU design related to the Nuvia acquisition for three years; pay a design transfer fee for Nuvia\u2019s CPU design; and agree to a separate license subject to additional fees.\n\nArm sues Qualcomm over custom Nuvia CPU cores, wants designs destroyed\nQualcomm 'on track' for Apple M-level Nuvia chips in late 2023\nQualcomm readying new Arm server chip based on Nuvia acquisition\nArm'd with ex-Apple engineers from Nuvia, Qualcomm hopes to make Apple M1-matching chips for Windows PCs\n\n\u201cArm\u2019s demands were outrageous,\u201d Qualcomm told the court. \u201cArm is claiming a right to control the transfer of Nuvia technology, when Nuvia\u2019s ALA [architectural license agreement] provided no such rights to Arm.\u201d\nFailing to coax Qualcomm into paying higher fees and delaying development of Nuvia-derived CPUs, Arm's \"alternative strategy was to seek to preclude Qualcomm from proceeding with developing its custom CPU, and in doing so, force the purchase of Arm\u2019s off-the-shelf CPU,\" wrote Qualcomm.\nBackground\nArm offers a full suite of pre-built, off-the-shelf core designs under its Cortex and Neoverse portfolios, which chipmakers can license under a more restrictive technology license agreement. Qualcomm holds both architectural (ALA) and technology (TLA) license agreements with Arm and has long used its Cortex cores in its Snapdragon mobile processors.\nQualcomm appears to suggest that Arm may have been concerned that a shift to Nuvia\u2019s core designs could negatively impact Arm's profit margins. Chips covered by ALAs usually have a lower royalty rate to Arm than those using TLA cores.\nIf Qualcomm uses CPU cores designed by Nuvia under the startup's architectural license, Qualcomm doesn't have to pay Arm as much in royalties per-chip than if Qualcomm licensed off-the-shelf Arm CPU cores. And Arm seems to be arguing that Qualcomm can't use its own ALAs from Arm to cover the Nuvia-designed cores, as those will have to be renegotiated.\n\u201cThe TLA has a higher royalty rate than Qualcomm\u2019s ALA,\u201d Qualcomm\u2019s response reads. \u201cWhen Qualcomm successfully replaces Arm-designed CPUs with its own designs, Qualcomm will pay Arm lower royalties under the ALA.\u201d\nThe Snapdragon giant believed the integration of Nuvia\u2019s Phoenix cores into its products would allow it \u201cto compete more effectively against not only rival Arm licensees and Arm, but also rival suppliers of CPUs compliant with other instruction set architectures \u2014 notably, Intel\u2019s x86.\u201d\nThe chipmaker has called on the Delaware federal court to dismiss Arm\u2019s claims and declare Qualcomm and Nuvia\u2019s conduct fully licensed.\n\u201cUnless this court rejects Arm\u2019s arguments, Arm\u2019s extreme position could be weaponized against all of its licensees, allowing Arm to claim ownership over all its licensees\u2019 innovations,\u201d reads Qualcomm\u2019s response, which was very quietly filed on a Friday at the end of September.\n\nArm is seeking to enforce Qualcomm\u2019s obligation to destroy and stop using the Nuvia designs that were derived from Arm\u2019s technology\n\nArm, meanwhile, maintains that it is simply protecting its ecosystem and partners from those that would circumvent the rules.\n\u201cArm\u2019s claim against Qualcomm is aimed at protecting the Arm ecosystem and partners who rely on our intellectual property and innovative designs. Qualcomm has violated the terms of the Nuvia license agreement and yet it continues to use the technology, unlicensed,\u201d Arm told The Register today in a statement.\n\u201cThis is an egregious breach of our agreement and ignores the requirements related to IP license assignment that are standard in Arm licensing agreements.\n\"Arm is seeking to enforce Qualcomm\u2019s obligation to destroy and stop using the Nuvia designs that were derived from Arm\u2019s technology under the terminated Nuvia agreements. We believe our argument is clear, and we are confident the court will agree.\u201d\nFrom our point of view, the row seems to be this: Arm wants Qualcomm to stick to the letter of the license agreements, and Qualcomm thinks it hasn't done anything wrong, and if it has, it was at least sticking to the spirit of the text. Until the wording of the ALAs are public at trial, we'll perhaps never know for sure. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Arm\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Qualcomm\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Semiconductor\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Arm\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Qualcomm\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Semiconductor\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Apple M1\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                ASML\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                AWS Graviton\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Broadcom\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Cadence Design Systems\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                CHERI\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Hot Chips\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Loongson\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                NXP Semiconductors\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                RISC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Semiconductor Memory\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Snapdragon\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                STMicroelectronics\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Tachyum\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                United Microelectronics Corporation\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n                    COMMENTS\n            \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Arm\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Qualcomm\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Semiconductor\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Arm\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Qualcomm\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Semiconductor\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Apple M1\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                ASML\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                AWS Graviton\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Broadcom\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Cadence Design Systems\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                CHERI\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Hot Chips\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Loongson\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                NXP Semiconductors\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                RISC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Semiconductor Memory\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Snapdragon\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                STMicroelectronics\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Tachyum\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                United Microelectronics Corporation\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNetwork edge?

Today, large language models, or LLMs, are growing up fast, showing dexterity in all sorts of applications.\nThey\u2019re, for one, speeding drug discovery, thanks to research from the Rostlab at Technical University of Munich, as well as work by a team from Harvard, Yale and New York University and others. In separate efforts, they applied LLMs to interpret the strings of amino acids that make up proteins, advancing our understanding of these building blocks of biology.\nIt\u2019s one of many inroads LLMs are making in healthcare, robotics and other fields.\nA Brief History of LLMs\nTransformer models \u2014 neural networks, defined in 2017, that can learn context in sequential data \u2014 got LLMs started.\nResearchers behind BERT and other transformer models made 2018 \u201ca watershed moment\u201d for natural language processing, a report on AI said at the end of that year. \u201cQuite a few experts have claimed that the release of BERT marks a new era in NLP,\u201d it added.\nDeveloped by Google, BERT (aka Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) delivered state-of-the-art scores on benchmarks for NLP. In 2019, it announced BERT powers the company\u2019s search engine.\nGoogle released BERT as open-source software, spawning a family of follow-ons and setting off a race to build ever larger, more powerful LLMs.\nFor instance, Meta created an enhanced version called RoBERTa, released as open-source code in July 2017. For training, it used \u201can order of magnitude more data than BERT,\u201d the paper said, and leapt ahead on NLP leaderboards. A scrum followed.\nScaling Parameters and Markets\nFor convenience, score is often kept by the number of an LLM\u2019s parameters or weights, measures of the strength of a connection between two nodes in a neural network. BERT had 110 million, RoBERTa had 123 million, then BERT-Large weighed in at 354 million, setting a new record, but not for long.\nAs LLMs expanded into new applications, their size and computing requirements grew.\nIn 2020, researchers at OpenAI and Johns Hopkins University announced GPT-3, with a whopping 175 billion parameters, trained on a dataset with nearly a trillion words. It scored well on a slew of language tasks and even ciphered three-digit arithmetic.\n\u201cLanguage models have a wide range of beneficial applications for society,\u201d the researchers wrote.\nExperts Feel \u2018Blown Away\u2019\nWithin weeks, people were using GPT-3 to create poems, programs, songs, websites and more. Recently, GPT-3 even wrote an academic paper about itself.\n\u201cI just remember being kind of blown away by the things that it could do, for being just a language model,\u201d said Percy Liang, a Stanford associate professor of computer science, speaking in a podcast.\nGPT-3 helped motivate Stanford to create a center Liang now leads, exploring the implications of what it calls foundational models that can handle a wide variety of tasks well.\nToward Trillions of Parameters\nLast year, NVIDIA announced the Megatron 530B LLM that can be trained for new domains and languages. It debuted with tools and services for training language models with trillions of parameters.\n\u201cLarge language models have proven to be flexible and capable \u2026 able to answer deep domain questions without specialized training or supervision,\u201d Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research at NVIDIA, said at that time.\nMaking it even easier for users to adopt the powerful models, the NVIDIA Nemo LLM service debuted in September at GTC. It\u2019s an NVIDIA-managed cloud service to adapt pretrained LLMs to perform specific tasks.\nTransformers Transform Drug Discovery\nThe advances LLMs are making with proteins and chemical structures are also being applied to DNA.\nResearchers aim to scale their work with NVIDIA BioNeMo, a software framework and cloud service to generate, predict and understand biomolecular data. Part of the NVIDIA Clara Discovery collection of frameworks, applications and AI models for drug discovery, it supports work in widely used protein, DNA and chemistry data formats.\nNVIDIA BioNeMo features multiple pretrained AI models, including the MegaMolBART model, developed by NVIDIA and AstraZeneca.\nIn their paper on foundational models, Stanford researchers projected many uses for LLMs in healthcare.\nLLMs Enhance Computer Vision\nTransformers are also reshaping computer vision as powerful LLMs replace traditional convolutional AI models. For example, researchers at Meta AI and Dartmouth designed TimeSformer, an AI model that uses transformers to analyze video with state-of-the-art results.\nExperts predict such models could spawn all sorts of new applications in computational photography, education and interactive experiences for mobile users.\nIn related work earlier this year, two companies released powerful AI models to generate images from text.\nOpenAI announced DALL-E 2, a transformer model with 3.5 billion parameters designed to create realistic images from text descriptions. And recently, Stability AI, based in London, launched Stability Diffusion,\nWriting Code, Controlling Robots\nLLMs also help developers write software. Tabnine \u2014 a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program that nurtures cutting-edge startups \u2014 claims it\u2019s automating up to 30% of the code generated by a million developers.\nTaking the next step, researchers are using transformer-based models to teach robots used in manufacturing, construction, autonomous driving and personal assistants.\nFor example, DeepMind developed Gato, an LLM that taught a robotic arm how to stack blocks. The 1.2-billion parameter model was trained on more than 600 distinct tasks so it could be useful in a variety of modes and environments, whether playing games or animating chatbots.\nThe Gato LLM can analyze robot actions and images as well as text.\n\u201cBy scaling up and iterating on this same basic approach, we can build a useful general-purpose agent,\u201d researchers said in a paper posted in May.\nIt\u2019s another example of what the Stanford center in a July paper called a paradigm shift in AI. \u201cFoundation models have only just begun to transform the way AI systems are built and deployed in the world,\u201d it said.\nLearn how companies around the world are implementing LLMs with NVIDIA Triton for many use cases.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | Computer Vision | Consumer Internet | Conversational AI | Inception | Machine Learning | NVIDIA NeMo \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

The fully electric vehicle sacrifices little in terms of speed and outperforms when it comes to technology.\nIt features an immersive digital cockpit, lengthy battery range of up to 370 miles and autonomous-driving capabilities powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin system-on-a-chip.\nThe Eletre\u2019s autonomous-driving system is designed for more than easier commutes. Lotus plans to train the vehicle to complete the world-famous N\u00fcrburgring racetrack in Germany entirely on its own. Powered by Lotus Group autonomous driving platform ROBO Galaxy, Lotus is able to quickly iterate on deep neural network development to optimize the performance of the high-performance hardware system.\nWith a top speed of 165 miles per hour and an acceleration that starts at 0 to 62 mph in 4.5 seconds for the base trim \u2014 and can be as fast as 2.95 seconds for performance versions \u2014 this isn\u2019t an average SUV.\nIntelligent Performance\nThe Lotus Eletre thinks as fast as it drives.\nIt comes equipped with lidar to comprehensively perceive the surrounding environment. That driving data is processed by two DRIVE Orin systems-on-a-chip, for a total of 508 trillion operations per second of performance.\nWith this level of AI compute, the Eletre can run the deep neural networks and applications necessary for autonomous driving in real time, with additional headroom for new capabilities that can be added over the air.\nDrivers of the performance Eletre S can sit back and enjoy the 23-speaker KEF premium audio system while the SUV\u2019s intelligent-driving capabilities take over.\n\nEventually, they can fire all the proverbial cylinders of the 905 horsepower dual motor \u2014 and dual DRIVE Orin \u2014 and take the autonomous-driving system to the track.\nAhead of the Curve\nLotus is bringing its racing heritage into the software-defined era with the Eletre. This future is arriving in just months.\nCustomer deliveries will begin in China and Europe in the first half of next year, with expansion to North America and other global markets in 2024.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Editor\u2019s note: This post is a part of our Meet the Omnivore series, which features individual creators and developers who use NVIDIA Omniverse to accelerate their 3D workflows and create virtual worlds.\nYizhou Zhao\nWhen not engrossed in his studies toward a Ph.D. in statistics, conducting data-driven research on AI and robotics, or enjoying his favorite hobby of sailing, Yizhou Zhao is winning contests for developers who use NVIDIA Omniverse \u2014 a platform for connecting and building custom 3D pipelines and metaverse applications.\nThe fifth-year doctoral candidate at the University of California, Los Angeles recently received first place in the inaugural #ExtendOmniverse contest, where developers were invited to create their own Omniverse extension for a chance to win an NVIDIA RTX GPU.\nOmniverse extensions are core building blocks that let anyone create and extend functions of Omniverse apps using the popular Python programming language.\nZhao\u2019s winning entry, called \u201cIndoorKit,\u201d allows users to easily load and record robotics simulation tasks in indoor scenes. It sets up robotics manipulation tasks by automatically populating scenes with the indoor environment, the bot and other objects with just a few clicks.\n\n\u201cTypically, it\u2019s hard to deploy a robotics task in simulation without a lot of skills in scene building, layout sampling and robot control,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cBy bringing assets into Omniverse\u2019s powerful user interface using the Universal Scene Description framework, my extension achieves instant scene setup and accurate control of the robot.\u201d\nWithin \u201cIndoorKit,\u201d users can simply click \u201cadd object,\u201d \u201cadd house,\u201d \u201cload scene,\u201d \u201crecord scene\u201d and other buttons to manipulate aspects of the environment and dive right into robotics simulation.\nWith Universal Scene Description (USD), an open-source, extensible file framework, Zhao seamlessly brought 3D models into his environments using Omniverse Connectors for Autodesk Maya and Blender software.\nThe \u201cIndoorKit\u201d extension also relies on assets from the NVIDIA Isaac Sim robotics simulation platform and Omniverse\u2019s built-in PhysX capabilities for accurate, articulated manipulation of the bots.\nIn addition, \u201cIndoorKit\u201d can randomize a scene\u2019s lighting, room materials and more. One scene Zhao built with the extension is highlighted in the feature video above.\nOmniverse for Robotics\u00a0\nThe \u201cIndoorKit\u201d extension bridges Omniverse and robotics research in simulation.\nA view of Zhao\u2019s \u201cIndoorKit\u201d extension\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how accurate robot control was performed prior to Omniverse,\u201d Zhao said. He provides four main reasons for why Omniverse was the ideal platform on which to build this extension:\nFirst, Python\u2019s popularity means many developers can build extensions with it to unlock machine learning and deep learning research for a broader audience, he said.\nSecond, using NVIDIA RTX GPUs with Omniverse greatly accelerates robot control and training.\nThird, Omniverse\u2019s ray-tracing technology enables real-time, photorealistic rendering of his scenes. This saves 90% of the time Zhao used to spend for experiment setup and simulation, he said.\nAnd fourth, Omniverse\u2019s real-time advanced physics simulation engine, PhysX, supports an extensive range of features \u2014 including liquid, particle and soft-body simulation \u2014 which \u201cland on the frontier of robotics studies,\u201d according to Zhao.\n\u201cThe future of art, engineering and research is in the spirit of connecting everything: modeling, animation and simulation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Omniverse brings it all together.\u201d\nJoin In on the Creation\nCreators and developers across the world can download NVIDIA Omniverse for free, and enterprise teams can use the platform for their 3D projects.\nDiscover how to build an Omniverse extension in less than 10 minutes.\nFor a deeper dive into developing on Omniverse, watch the on-demand NVIDIA GTC session, \u201cHow to Build Extensions and Apps for Virtual Worlds With NVIDIA Omniverse.\u201d\nFind additional documentation and tutorials in the Omniverse Resource Center, which details how developers like Zhao can build custom USD-based applications and extensions for the platform.\nTo discover more free tools, training and a community for developers, join the NVIDIA Developer Program.\nFollow NVIDIA Omniverse on Instagram, Medium, Twitter and YouTube for additional resources and inspiration.

Together they produce a powerful new tool called graph neural networks.\nWhat Are Graph Neural Networks?\nGraph neural networks apply the predictive power of deep learning to rich data structures that depict objects and their relationships as points connected by lines in a graph.\nIn GNNs, data points are called nodes, which are linked by lines \u2014 called edges \u2014 with elements expressed mathematically so machine learning algorithms can make useful predictions at the level of nodes, edges or entire graphs.\nWhat Can GNNs Do?\nAn expanding list of companies is applying GNNs to improve drug discovery, fraud detection and recommendation systems. These applications and many more rely on finding patterns in relationships among data points.\nResearchers are exploring use cases for GNNs in computer graphics, cybersecurity, genomics and materials science. A recent paper reported how GNNs used transportation maps as graphs to improve predictions of arrival time.\nMany branches of science and industry already store valuable data in graph databases. With deep learning, they can train predictive models that unearth fresh insights from their graphs.\nKnowledge from many fields of science and industry can be expressed as graphs.\n\u201cGNNs are one of the hottest areas of deep learning research, and we see an increasing number of applications take advantage of GNNs to improve their performance,\u201d said George Karypis, a senior principal scientist at AWS, in a talk earlier this year.\nOthers agree. GNNs are \u201ccatching fire because of their flexibility to model complex relationships, something traditional neural networks cannot do,\u201d said Jure Leskovec, an associate professor at Stanford, speaking in a recent talk, where he showed the chart below of AI papers that mention them.\n\nWho Uses Graph Neural Networks?\nAmazon reported in 2017 on its work using GNNs to detect fraud. In 2020, it rolled out a public GNN service that others could use for fraud detection, recommendation systems and other applications.\nTo maintain their customers\u2019 high level of trust, Amazon Search employs GNNs to detect malicious sellers, buyers and products. Using NVIDIA GPUs, it\u2019s able to explore graphs with tens of millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of edges while reducing training time from 24 to five hours.\nFor its part, biopharma company GSK maintains a knowledge graph with nearly 500 billion nodes that is used in many of its machine-language models, said Kim Branson, the company\u2019s global head of AI, speaking on a panel at a GNN workshop.\nLinkedIn uses GNNs to make social recommendations and understand the relationships between people\u2019s skills and their job titles, said Jaewon Yang, a senior staff software engineer at the company, speaking on another panel at the workshop.\n\u201cGNNs are general-purpose tools, and every year we discover a bunch of new apps for them,\u201d said Joe Eaton, a distinguished engineer at NVIDIA who is leading a team applying accelerated computing to GNNs. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even scratched the surface of what GNNs can do.\u201d\nIn yet another sign of the interest in GNNs, videos of a course on them that Leskovec teaches at Stanford have received more than 700,000 views.\nHow Do GNNs Work?\nTo date, deep learning has mainly focused on images and text, types of structured data that can be described as sequences of words or grids of pixels. Graphs, by contrast, are unstructured. They can take any shape or size and contain any kind of data, including images and text.\nUsing a process called message passing, GNNs organize graphs so machine learning algorithms can use them.\nMessage passing embeds into each node information about its neighbors. AI models employ the embedded information to find patterns and make predictions.\nExample dataflows in three types of GNNs.\nFor example, recommendation systems use a form of node embedding in GNNs to match customers with products. Fraud detection systems use edge embeddings to find suspicious transactions, and drug discovery models compare entire graphs of molecules to find out how they react to each other.\nGNNs are unique in two other ways: They use sparse math, and the models typically only have two or three layers. Other AI models generally use dense math and have hundreds of neural-network layers.\nA GNN pipeline has a graph as an input and predictions as outputs.\nWhat\u2019s the History of GNNs?\nA 2009 paper from researchers in Italy was the first to give graph neural networks their name. But it took eight years before two researchers in Amsterdam demonstrated their power with a variant they called a graph convolutional network (GCN), which is one of the most popular GNNs today.\nThe GCN work inspired Leskovec and two of his Stanford grad students to create GraphSage, a GNN that showed new ways the message-passing function could work. He put it to the test in the summer of 2017 at Pinterest, where he served as chief scientist.\nGraphSage pioneered powerful aggregation techniques for message passing in GNNs.\nTheir implementation, PinSage, was a recommendation system that packed 3 billion nodes and 18 billion edges to outperform other AI models at that time.\nPinterest applies it today on more than 100 use cases across the company. \u201cWithout GNNs, Pinterest would not be as engaging as it is today,\u201d said Andrew Zhai, a senior machine learning engineer at the company, speaking on an online panel.\nMeanwhile, other variants and hybrids have emerged, including graph recurrent networks and graph attention networks. GATs borrow the attention mechanism defined in transformer models to help GNNs focus on portions of datasets that are of greatest interest.\nOne overview of GNNs depicted a family tree of their variants.\nScaling Graph Neural Networks\nLooking forward, GNNs need to scale in all dimensions.\nOrganizations that don\u2019t already maintain graph databases need tools to ease the job of creating these complex data structures.\nThose who use graph databases know they\u2019re growing in some cases to have thousands of features embedded on a single node or edge. That presents challenges of efficiently loading the massive datasets from storage subsystems through networks to processors.\n\u201cWe\u2019re delivering products that maximize the memory and computational bandwidth and throughput of accelerated systems to address these data loading and scaling issues,\u201d said Eaton.\nAs part of that work, NVIDIA announced at GTC it is now supporting PyTorch Geometric (PyG) in addition to the Deep Graph Library (DGL). These are two of the most popular GNN software frameworks.\nNVIDIA provides multiple tools to accelerate building GNNs.\nNVIDIA-optimized DGL and PyG containers are performance-tuned and tested for NVIDIA GPUs. They provide an easy place to start developing applications using GNNs.\nTo learn more, watch a talk on accelerating and scaling GNNs with DGL and GPUs by Da Zheng, a senior applied scientist at AWS. In addition, NVIDIA engineers hosted separate talks on accelerating GNNs with DGL and PyG.\nTo get started today, sign up for our early access program for DGL and PyG.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ExplainerTags: Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | GPU Computing | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | Recommender Systems \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Planes taxiing for long periods due to ground traffic \u2014 or circling the airport while awaiting clearance to land \u2014 don\u2019t just make travelers impatient. They burn fuel unnecessarily, harming the environment and adding to airlines\u2019 costs.\nSearidge Technologies, based in Ottawa, Canada, has created AI-powered software to help the aviation industry avoid such issues, increasing efficiency and enhancing safety for airports.\nIts Digital Tower and Apron solutions, powered by NVIDIA GPUs, use vision AI to manage traffic control for airports and alert users of safety concerns in real time. Searidge enables airports to handle 15-30% more aircraft per hour and reduce the number of tarmac incidents.\nThe company\u2019s tech is used across the world, including at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida and Dubai International Airport, to name a few.\nIn June, Searidge\u2019s Digital Apron and Tower Management System (DATMS) went operational at Hong Kong International Airport as part of an initial phase of the Airport Authority Hong Kong\u2019s large-scale expansion plan, which will bring machine learning to a new, integrated airport operations center.\nIn addition, Searidge provides the Civil Aviation Department of Hong Kong\u2019s air-traffic control systems with next-generation safety enhancements using its vision AI software.\nThe deployment in Hong Kong is the industry\u2019s largest digital platform for tower and apron management \u2014 and the first collaboration between an airport and an air-navigation service provider for a single digital platform.\nSearidge is a member of NVIDIA Metropolis, a partner program focused on bringing to market a new generation of vision AI applications that make the world\u2019s most important spaces and operations safer and more efficient.\nDigital Tools for Airports\nThe early 2000s saw massive growth and restructuring of airports \u2014 and with this came increased use of digital tools in the aviation industry.\nFounded in 2006, Searidge has become one of the first to bring machine learning to video processing in the aviation space, according to Pat Urbanek, the company\u2019s vice president of business development for Asia Pacific and the Middle East.\n\u201cVideo processing software for air-traffic control didn\u2019t exist before,\u201d Urbanek said. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a decade to become mainstream \u2014 but now, intelligent video and machine learning have been brought into airport operations, enabling new levels of automation in air-traffic control and airside operations to enhance safety and efficiency.\u201d\nDATMS\u2019s underlying machine learning platform, called Aimee, enables traffic-lighting automation based on data from radars and 4K-resolution video cameras. Aimee is trained to detect aircraft and vehicles. And DATMS is programmed based on the complex roadway rules that determine how buses and other vehicles should operate on service roads across taxiways.\nAfter analyzing video data, the AI-enabled system activates or deactivates airports\u2019 traffic lights in real time, based on when it\u2019s appropriate for passenger buses and other vehicles to move. The status of each traffic light and additional details can also be visualized on end-user screens in airport traffic control rooms.\n\u201cWhat size is an aircraft? Does it have enough space to turn on the runway? Is it going too fast? All of this information and more is sent out over the Searidge Platform and displayed on screen based on user preference,\u201d said Marco Rueckert, vice president of technology at Searidge.\nImage courtesy of Searidge Technologies\nThe same underlying technology is applied to provide enhanced safety alerts for aircraft departure and arrival. In real time, DATMS alerts air traffic controllers of safety-standard breaches \u2014 taking into consideration clearances for aircraft to enter a runway, takeoff or land.\nSpeedups With NVIDIA GPUs\nSearidge uses NVIDIA GPUs to optimize inference throughput across its deployments at airports around the globe. To train its AI models, Searidge uses an NVIDIA DGX A100 system.\n\u201cThe NVIDIA platform allowed us to really bring down the hardware footprint and costs from the customer\u2019s perspective,\u201d Rueckert said. \u201cIt provides the scalability factor, so we can easily add more cameras with increasing resolution, which ultimately helps us solve more problems and address more customer needs.\u201d\nThe company is also exploring the integration of voice data \u2014 based on communication between pilots and air-traffic controllers \u2014 within its machine learning platform to further enhance airport operations.\nSearidge\u2019s Digital Tower and Apron solutions can be customized for the unique challenges that come with varying airport layouts and traffic patterns.\n\u201cOf course, having aircraft land on time and letting passengers make their connections increases business and efficiency, but our technology has an environmental impact as well,\u201d Urbanek said. \u201cIt can prevent burning of huge amounts of fuel \u2014 in the air or at the gate \u2014 by providing enhanced efficiency and safety for taxiing, takeoff and landing.\u201d\nWatch the latest GTC keynote by NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang to discover how vision AI and other groundbreaking technologies are shaping the world:\n\nFeature video courtesy of Dubai Airports.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Computer Vision | Customer Stories | GPU | Machine Learning | Metropolis | Smart Spaces | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

To that end, here are six methods of fixing \u201cNVIDIA Display settings are not available\u201d or any other issues you have with this software. \n            1. Check the Display Connection\n    \nYour PC generally has two types of display ports; Intel Integrated graphics and NVIDIA graphics hardware. If your monitor is connected to the wrong display port, the NVIDIA Control Panel will fail to detect the graphics card.\nBefore trying out software solutions, you should first identify the display ports and connect your monitor\u2019s display adapter to the NVIDIA graphics hardware (discrete) port. Restart your computer after fixing the connection and check to see that it works. \n            2. Use VGA to HDMI Converter on Your Graphics Card\n    \nIf the problem persists after connecting your display cable to the appropriate slot, you can try using a converter or changing the display adapter. One of the more popular converters is VGA to HDMI, which allows you to use one of the HDMI ports on your computer. \n            3. Update/Reinstall Graphics Card Drivers\n    \nVarious factors can cause your graphics card drivers to stop working, preventing Windows from detecting the graphics card hardware. The drivers could be outdated, corrupted, or uninstalled. Moreover, third-party programs and Windows updates can also affect your drivers.\nThere are several methods of updating your graphics card driver. However, the easiest method is to use the GeForce Experience app. You could also go to NVIDIA\u2019s official driver web page, but this method may require you to search for your graphics card driver manually.\nTo update your drivers, open GeForce Experience and switch to the drivers menu. Click the check for updates button to get the latest drivers for your graphics card. After checking for updates, download the most recent driver and follow the instructions to install it on your PC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have the latest driver for your graphics card, the GeForce Experience app gives you the option to reinstall the driver and fix any problems with the current installation. \n            4. Enable All NVIDIA Services\n    \nNVIDIA has several services running on your computer that manage your display driver and ensure its smooth operation. They serve as an intermediary between your graphics card hardware and the Windows operating system.\nIf one or more of them stop working, your PC, and by extension, the NVIDIA control panel, will not detect the graphics card. To fix this problem, you must enable or restart all NVIDIA services. These services include: \n\n                                        NVIDIA Display Container LS\n                        \n\n                                        NVIDIA Telemetry Container\n                        \n\n                                        NVIDIA LocalSystem Container\n                        \n\n                                        NVIDIA NetworkService Container\n                        \n\nIn order to enable these services, press Win + R to open the Run program, then type services.msc in the search bar and hit Enter. Find any of the services mentioned earlier, right-click, and select properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the Startup type drop box in the properties window and set it to Automatic. If the service is running, click the Stop button, wait a few minutes, and click Start. Next, click Apply then OK to save your changes. Repeat these steps for all the NVIDIA services and check that the NVIDIA control panel is now working. \n            5. Disable and Re-enable the Graphics Card\n    \nWindows updates or third-party software can disable, uninstall or corrupt your NVIDIA graphics card. Consequently, the control panel may not be able to display NVIDIA settings.\nTo try this method of fixing the control panel, press the Windows key and type Device Manager in the search bar. After opening the device manager, expand the display adapters section and look for your NVIDIA graphics card. Right-click on it and select Disable device. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart your PC and open the device manager. Then, right-click on your graphics card and select Enable device. Restart your computer again to save your changes. \n            6. Reinstall the NVIDIA Graphics Drivers and the Control Panel\n    \nIf all else fails, you can uninstall all NVIDIA apps and services from your Windows PC and reinstall them. Doing so will reinstall the NVIDIA Control Panel on your computer.\nFirst off, you need to boot your Windows PC into safe mode.

H100-accelerated servers, when connected with NVIDIA networking across thousands of servers in hyperscale data centers, can be 300x more energy efficient than CPU-only servers.\n\u201cNVIDIA Hopper GPUs are built for solving the world\u2019s tough challenges, delivering accelerated computing with greater energy efficiency and improved performance, while adding scale and lowering costs,\u201d said Ian Buck, vice president of hyperscale and high performance computing at NVIDIA. \u201cWith Meta sharing the H100-powered Grand Teton platform, system builders around the world will soon have access to an open design for hyperscale data center compute infrastructure to supercharge AI across industries.\u201d\nMountain of a Machine\nGrand Teton sports 2x the network bandwidth and 4x the bandwidth between host processors and GPU accelerators compared to Meta\u2019s prior Zion system, Meta said.\nThe added network bandwidth enables Meta to create larger clusters of systems for training AI models, Bjorlin said. It also packs more memory than Zion to store and run larger AI models.\nSimplified Deployment, Increased Reliability\nPacking all these capabilities into one integrated server \u201cdramatically simplifies deployment of systems, allowing us to install and provision our fleet much more rapidly, and increase reliability,\u201d said Bjorlin.\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

NVIDIA CloudXR, built on NVIDIA RTX technology, delivers high-quality, immersive experiences across 5G and Wi-Fi networks.\nThese solutions are easily accessible in an AWS Quick Start, which is an automated reference deployment built by AWS that helps users quickly deploy popular technologies. With the combination of these two technologies, professionals designing in VRED can take advantage of immersive XR powered by CloudXR and NVIDIA RTX GPUs with NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation (vWS) software.\n\nAccelerating Design Workflows With Cloud Streaming\nMany professional designers, including automotive manufacturers, use Autodesk VRED within their design workflows. With CloudXR, Autodesk VRED users can enter a photorealistic, immersive environment and seamlessly interact with large 3D models and scenes.\nThese massive 3D datasets can be used with all-in-one headsets, as they\u2019re streamed with CloudXR from the AWS cloud using NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\nWith NVIDIA RTX vWS software, CloudXR is fully scalable for cloud, data center and edge networks. The CloudXR software development kit comes with an installer for server components and open-source client applications for streaming XR content from OpenVR applications to Android, iOS and Windows mobile devices.\nMany manufacturing professionals attended the recent Autodesk University event, where they learned from David Randle, global head of go to market for Spatial Computing at AWS, about how the CloudXR Quick Start is now streamlining workflows for automotive professionals.\nTry Quick Start today, and learn more about NVIDIA CloudXR.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: CloudXR | Virtual Reality \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s an Inside LooksubscribeExplore Topics:AIBiotechnologyRoboticsComputingFutureScienceSpaceEnergyTechFutureNVIDIA Is Making a Digital Twin of Earth\u2019s Climate. Here\u2019s an Inside LookAaron FrankOct 04, 2022ShareSeveral weeks ago, clima\u00ad\u00adte scientists said an extreme heatwave in China was the worst on record anywhere. Days later, Pakistan declared a national state of emergency due to unprecedented flooding. In Europe, record summer heat included the highest temperature ever recorded in Britain. And, in the US, the worst drought in over a thousand years is draining the country\u2019s two largest reservoirs, forcing water rationing on millions of people.Extreme weather events have become alarmingly common everywhere on Earth. Currently, we mostly react, but in an ideal world, we\u2019d be able to predict, prepare, and adapt to our changing climate.However, that may be easier said than done.Earth\u2019s climate is blindingly complex. Climate and weather patterns are driven by an irreducible web of interactions across a variety of planet-wide systems. Add to that the array of human activities influencing these systems, and you\u2019re left with a painfully elaborate set of variables.So, an essential item on the climate crisis wish list is a way to predict how these systems might behave over time. It\u2019s not enough to monitor the problem like a weather report. We also need to infer how human activities might influence future outcomes. An urban planner may need to know whether their building plans should account for coastal flooding. But city officials granting those permits would need to predict how that same building\u2019s carbon emissions may affect the climate.One exciting proposal called Destination Earth\u2014a project launched in early 2021 by the European Commission\u2014envisions a fully simulated digital twin of Earth\u2019s climate. This software copy of Earth would enable researchers and governments to ask important questions about how human activity today might impact the climate outcomes of tomorrow.Heavily inspired by the idea, NVIDIA announced a similarly ambitious project last year. Their own version will be an interactive digital twin and computing platform called Earth-2.\u201cAt the highest level, the reason we're building Earth-2 is to be able to predict and monitor climate change, but also develop strategies to mitigate and adapt to change,\u201d Karthik Kashinath, principal engineer at NVIDIA and engineering lead for the Earth-2 initiative, recently told Singularity Hub. The more we know what\u2019s coming, the better prepared we\u2019ll be.To appreciate Earth-2\u2019s potential, it\u2019s important to understand the developing landscape of digital twin technologies. What is a digital twin? And how might we make one the size of a planet?Behind the Buzz: Digital TwinsDigital twins are a simulated replica of reality. Reality in this sense might refer to a physical object like a wind turbine or building, a process like the assembly line for manufacturing a car, or a system like the financial system or climate. The idea is that by creating a software-based duplicate of the real thing, digital twins can provide an interactive way to engage with, ask questions of, or make predictions about that object, process, or system.A number of ingredients go into building a digital twin, but a few worth mentioning are 3D interactive interfaces, live data streams, and machine learning models for prediction.Like a Video Game3D interfaces are what give digital twins a distinctive video-game-like quality and why the press will often conflate their coverage of digital twins with the metaverse.One example, for anyone who\u2019s been in a Tesla, is the dashboard visualization tool, in which the car shows a real-time, simulated version of itself in 3D. These 3D gaming environments are useful because they abstract away the complexity of working with the underlying technologies. Because of digital twins, urban planning, facilities management, and cybersecurity are shapeshifting into work that might one day be hard to distinguish from playing a video game.In the case of Earth-2, the project makes use of NVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse platform which can render high-resolution 3D environments. That means users won\u2019t necessarily need complex coding skills to work with Earth-2.\u201cYou're interacting with it through an interface that allows you to move sliders or type things in. It should be simple to ask questions to this digital twin and get answers,\u201d said Kashinath.Mirroring RealityEven if a digital twin has flashy 3D visuals, it\u2019s not useful unless it mirrors the system it\u2019s simulating. To do that, it must include real-time data about what\u2019s happening inside that system.Consider the new Hummer EV, which makes use of the Unreal game engine to give drivers a sense of what\u2019s happening with the vehicle. The dashboard displays 3D information about things like tire pressure, cardinal direction, torque output, g-forces, and pitch and roll angles. The car can do this because it\u2019s equipped with a variety of sensors producing real-time data.In big buildings, occupancy sensors, elevators, lightbulbs, and more are being integrated with data about the weather and traffic conditions outside to create a real-time assessment of the building. Digital twins of buildings are now integrating tens of thousands of data points into a single dashboard, which is why a common way to describe digital twins is \u201ca single source of truth.\u201dExpanding this idea from a building to the entire planet, a digital twin of Earth\u2019s climate would need to behave like the real thing\u2014and to do that it needs a large amount of data.Earth-2 assimilates data from sources including satellite imagery, ground station sensors, ocean buoys, and weather balloons. Of course, these tools don\u2019t provide weather and climate scientists complete coverage of the globe, so data from hundreds of different sources is fused together in a process called \u201creanalysis.\u201d Simplistically, reanalysis is like doing a puzzle. Given the pieces you already have, you can guess what goes in the gaps.\u201cIt's the best representation that we have of the Earth,\u201d said Kashinath.Be Part of the FutureSign up to receive top stories about groundbreaking technologies and visionary thinkers from SingularityHub.100% Free.

A data-driven 3D image of a wind turbine, for example, isn\u2019t as useful as one that can, say, tell a field operator that, due to a variety of reasons, there\u2019s an 80 percent chance it will break down and need repairs today.Earth-2 currently derives its predictive powers from a new AI model called FourCastNet, the first of more models to come. Developed with scientists from Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Caltech, the University of Michigan, and elsewhere, the model is a major departure from traditional weather forecasting.Weather forecasts are still largely driven by a century-old approach called numerical weather prediction (NWP). The process plugs observations about the current weather into equations that can predict what the weather will do next. Thanks to more computing power and access to better data, NWP models have been improving for decades. Today\u2019s seven-day forecasts, for example, are accurate roughly 80 percent of the time (though it\u2019s likely mathematically impossible to predict specific weather events beyond about two weeks).Instead of a numerical approach, FourCastNet combines physics and machine learning trained on roughly 10 terabytes, or 40 years\u2019 worth, of reanalysis data. Once trained, the system can take the same weather observation data and make forecasts comparable to NWP models.To test its accuracy, researchers compared FourCastNet predictions to results from the Integrated Forecast System (IFS), a commonly used NWP model considered to be a gold standard in weather prediction. FourCastNet demonstrated slightly more accurate predictions in shorter timescales and roughly the same accuracy on longer ones. IFS is still superior at giving predictions at a slightly higher resolution (9 square kilometers compared to 25). But with more and better weather data, Kashinath expects FourCastNet will improve its resolution over time.The real improvement, however, is its efficiency. FourCastNet needs far less computing power and time to crunch the numbers than traditional methods.\u201cToday, producing a seven-day forecast takes the European Center for Forecasting about 1,500 CPU nodes, and they run it for tens of minutes,\u201d said Kashinath. \u201cOur model can produce the same forecast with the same fidelity 50,000 times faster, in a fraction of a second, and on a single GPU.\u201dWhile Kashinath says FourCastNet is perhaps already a better option for weather forecasting due to its speed (and an on-brand much smaller carbon footprint), understanding the future of our climate goes beyond simply predicting the weather. Long-term climate models, in contrast to weather forecasts, seek to understand broad trends like average temperatures and wind speeds, sea level rise, and extreme event frequency and severity.Kashinath says that the speedup enabled by AI models like FourCastNet will be especially useful for these types of predictions. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to explore thousands of scenarios very quickly. We are dealing with a problem that has many possible scenarios, and we just can't wait around for a numerical model to crunch through and give us answers slowly one by one,\u201d he said.A Trusted Software AssistantKashinath said that what makes digital twins special is their interactivity. While we\u2019ve had weather forecasts for decades, we\u2019ve never had systems we can easily ask questions of (and quickly).\u201cYou can interact with the digital twin in ways that you simply cannot interact with a weather forecast. And it\u2019s in real time,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's something that distinguishes a digital twin from a weather forecasting or climate model. You're interacting with it and getting responses at a pace that is impossible with traditional models.\u201dThanks to an interactive interface and quick response time, Earth-2 may prove helpful for citizens beyond climate scientists and policymakers.\u201cIf I\u2019m a farmer in Australia, and I want to know what the drought situation is going to look like over the next 20 to 30 years and decide what sorts of crops I might want to grow or how I might want to change irrigation technologies that I use for my farm, I want to be able to ask questions like that to this digital twin and get answers,\u201d Kashinath said.FourCastNet, an open-sou\u00ad\u00adrce project, is the first product of the broader Earth-2 initiative available to researchers. And while there\u2019s no specific date for when the team will launch Earth-2 publicly, Kashinath said it will similarly be open for use by the research community.Hopefully, as tools like Earth-2 emerge, we can better plan for and adapt to our rapidly changing climate.Image Credit: NVIDIAAaron FrankAaron FrankAaron Frank is a researcher, writer, and consultant who has spent over a decade in Silicon Valley, where he most recently served as principal faculty at Singularity University.

That\u2019s because the GPU manufacturer has confirmed its plans to \u201cunlaunch\u201d the previously planned, and cheaper, 12GB RTX 4080 model. Instead, now, only the more expensive and faster 16GB RTX 4080 will launch next month.Suggested ReadingSquare Enix Announces A Big RPG Sale In The Best Way PossibleMaster Mai Shiranui's Ferocious Flame Stocks In Street Fighter 6Assassin's Creed Shadows Is A Game For Animal LoversLive Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'\n\n\n\n\n\nShare Share this VideoFacebookTwitterEmailRedditLinkview videoLive Forever in the Universe of New World: AeternumSuggested ReadingSquare Enix Announces A Big RPG Sale In The Best Way PossibleMaster Mai Shiranui's Ferocious Flame Stocks In Street Fighter 6Assassin's Creed Shadows Is A Game For Animal LoversLive Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'\n\n\n\n\n\nShare Share this VideoFacebookTwitterEmailRedditLinkLive Forever in the Universe of New World: AeternumA few weeks ago, following many rumors and much speculation, Nvidia finally announced its next series of high-end PC graphics cards. The plan then was to launch two different flavors of RTX 4080 GPUs in November: the 16GB RTX 4080 ($1199) and a 12GB RTX 4080 ($899). It also announced a $1600 4090 during that same event. These prices went over about as well as you might expect, with many claiming they were too expensive. And now the \u201ccheapest\u201d of these new, pricey cards isn\u2019t even launching next month.AdvertisementRelated ContentNvidia CEO Makes It Clear That High PC Graphics Card Prices Are Here To StayAfter Much Controversy, Nvidia Brings Back A Budget PC Graphics CardRelated ContentNvidia CEO Makes It Clear That High PC Graphics Card Prices Are Here To StayAfter Much Controversy, Nvidia Brings Back A Budget PC Graphics CardRead More: Nvidia\u2019s New 40-Series PC Graphics Cards Are Too Damn ExpensiveAs announced today by Nvidia, the company is \u201cunlaunching\u201d the 12GB RTX 4080. It claims this is because, while the card is \u201cfantastic,\u201d it\u2019s too \u201cconfusing\u201d to have two different GPUs that are both designated \u201cRTX 4080.\u201d This echoes criticism that arose from many consumers after the recent 40-series announcements; many suggested that the clearly lower specs of the 12GB RTX 4080 were more akin to a theoretical \u201c4070\u201d or \u201c4079\u201d card.AdvertisementKotaku has contacted Nvidia about the cancelation and the future of the 12GB RTX 4080 model.\u201cSo, we\u2019re pressing the \u2018unlaunch\u2019 button on the 4080 12GB,\u201d said Nvidia in a short statement posted on the company\u2019s official website. \u201cThe RTX 4080 16GB is amazing and on track to delight gamers everywhere on November 16th.\u201dAdvertisementOf course, it\u2019s hard not to see this move as a way for Nvidia to push more of its customers\u2014many of whom have been holding off on buying a new GPU for a few years now while cards remained hard to buy\u2014into spending more money on a pricier card. And while initial previews of the cheaper 12GB 4080 had shown it to be considerably slower than the more expensive 16GB version, it was still nice to have at least one option that cost under $1,000. But that\u2019s now gone. What will happen remains to be seen, but perhaps Nvidia will actually end up rebranding the 12GB RTX 4080s into 4070s."

Now, as the dean of the engineering college at Oregon State University, he\u2019s at ground zero of another seismic event.\nIn its biggest fundraising celebration in nearly a decade, Oregon State announced plans today for a $200 million center where faculty and students can plug into resources that will include one of the world\u2019s fastest university supercomputers.\nThe 150,000-square-foot center, due to open in 2025, will accelerate work at Oregon State\u2019s top-ranked programs in agriculture, computer sciences, climate science, forestry, oceanography, robotics, water resources, materials sciences and more with the help of AI.\nA Beacon in AI, Robotics\nIn honor of a $50 million gift to the OSU Foundation from NVIDIA\u2019s founder and CEO and his wife \u2014 who earned their engineering degrees at OSU and met in one of its labs \u2014 it will be named the Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang Collaborative Innovation Complex (CIC).\n\u201cThe CIC and new supercomputer will help Oregon State be recognized as one of the world\u2019s leading universities for AI, robotics and simulation,\u201d said Ashford, whose engineering college includes more than 10,000 of OSU\u2019s 35,000 students.\n\u201cWe discovered our love for computer science and engineering at OSU,\u201d said Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang. \u201cWe hope this gift will help inspire future generations of students also to fall in love with technology and its capacity to change the world.\n\u201cAI is the most transformative technology of our time,\u201d they added. \u201cTo harness this force, engineering students need access to a supercomputer, a time machine, to accelerate their research. This new AI supercomputer will enable OSU students and researchers to make very important advances in climate science, oceanography, materials science, robotics and other fields.\u201d\nA Hub for Students\nWith an extended-reality theater, robotics and drone playground and a do-it-yourself maker space, the new complex is expected to attract students from across the university. \u201cIt has the potential to transform not only the college of engineering, but the entire university, and have a positive economic and environmental impact on the state and the nation,\u201d Ashford said.\nThe three-story facility will include a clean room, as well as labs for materials scientists, environmental researchers and more.\nArtist\u2019s rendering of the Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang Collaborative Innovation Complex.\nAshford expects that over the next decade the center will attract top researchers, as well as research projects potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\u201cOur donors and university leaders are excited about investing in a collaborative, transdisciplinary approach to problem solving and discovery \u2014 it will revitalize our engineering triangle and be an amazing place to study and conduct research,\u201d he said.\nA Forest of Opportunities\nHe gave several examples of the center\u2019s potential. Among them:\n\nEnvironmental and electronics researchers may collaborate to design and deploy sensors and use AI to analyze their data, finding where in the ocean or forest hard-to-track endangered species are breeding so their habitats can be protected.\nStudents can use augmented reality to train in simulated clean rooms on techniques for making leading-edge chips. Federal and Oregon state officials aim to expand workforce development for the U.S. semiconductor industry, Ashford said.\nRobotics researchers could create lifelike simulations of their drones and robots to accelerate training and testing. (Cassie, a biped robot designed at OSU, just made Guinness World Records for the fastest 100-meter dash by a bot.)\nStudents at OSU and its sister college in Germany, DHBW-Ravensburg, could use NVIDIA Omniverse \u2014 a platform for building and operating metaverse applications and connecting their 3D pipelines \u2014 to enhance design of their award-winning, autonomous, electric race cars.\n\nCassie broke a record for a robot running a 100-meter dash.\nBuilding AI Models, Digital Twins\nSuch efforts will be accelerated with NVIDIA AI and Omniverse, software that can expand the building\u2019s physical labs with simulations and digital twins so every student can have a virtual workbench.\nOSU will get state-of-the-art NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD and OVX SuperPOD clusters once the complex\u2019s data center is ready. With an eye on energy efficiency, water that cooled computer racks will then help heat more than 500,000 square feet of campus buildings.\nThe SuperPOD will likely include a mix of about 60 DGX and OVX systems \u2014 powered by next-generation CPUs, GPUs and networking \u2014 creating a system powerful enough to train the largest AI models and perform complex digital twin simulations. Ashford notes OSU won a project working with the U.S. Department of Energy because its existing computer center has a handful of DGX systems.\nAdvancing Diversity, Inclusion\nAt the Oct. 14 OSU Foundation event announcing the naming of the new complex, Oregon State officials thanked donors and kicked off a university-wide fundraising campaign. OSU has requested support from the state of Oregon for construction of the building and seeks additional philanthropic investments to expand its research and support its hiring and diversity goals.\nOSU\u2019s president, Jayathi Murthy, said the complex provides an opportunity to advance diversity, equity and inclusion in the university\u2019s STEM education and research. OSU\u2019s engineering college is already among the top-ranked U.S. schools for tenured or tenure-track engineering faculty who are women.\nAI Universities Sprout\nOregon State also is among a small but growing set of universities accelerating their journeys in AI and high performance computing.\nA recent whitepaper described efforts at University of Florida to spread AI across its curriculum as part of a partnership with NVIDIA that enabled it to install HiPerGator, a DGX SuperPOD based on NVIDIA DGX A100 systems with NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs.\nFollowing Florida\u2019s example, Southern Methodist University announced last fall its plans to make the Dallas area a hub of AI development around its new DGX SuperPOD. And three years ago, the Milwaukee School of Engineering inaugurated Rosie, a supercomputer used to educate undergrads in the application of AI to solve real-world problems, with plans for a graduate certification program in the offing.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of interest in the idea of AI universities from Asia, Europe and across the U.S.,\u201d said Cheryl Martin, who leads NVIDIA\u2019s efforts in higher education research.\nOne of OSU\u2019s autonomous race cars rounds the track.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | NVIDIA Life | RoboticsTags: Agriculture and Food | Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Digital Twin | Education | GPU Computing | Hardware | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | Metaverse | NVIDIA DGX | Omniverse | Science | Simulation and Design | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

This quantum leap in performance comes courtesy of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture\u2019s many innovations, and NVIDIA DLSS 3, which accelerates performance by up to 4X. With a GeForce RTX 4090 or GeForce RTX 4080 in your system, games will run at unbelievable frame rates, and you\u2019ll have the power to experience richer, more immersive fully ray-traced games at 4K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3 is a set of three complementary technologies: Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and NVIDIA Reflex, which combine to deliver great frame rates, latency, and image quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a game already has DLSS 2 Super Resolution, upgrading to DLSS 3 is a simple process and will make both Super Resolution and Frame Generation available. DLSS 3 leverages the same integration points as DLSS 2 (color buffer, depth buffer, engine motion vectors, and output buffers), making upgrades from these existing SDKs easy via our new NVIDIA DLSS 3 Streamline plugin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3 is also coming to the world\u2019s most popular game engines, including Unity, Unreal Engine, and Frostbite Engine, making it simple for games based on these engines to flip DLSS 3 on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 35 DLSS 3 games and apps have already been announced, with the first 3 DLSS 3 games shipping this week, and more coming this month. If you own a previous-generation GeForce RTX graphics card or laptop, you can use DLSS 2 Super Resolution in each DLSS 3 game. DLSS Super Resolution is our new name for the award-winning, AI-powered DLSS 2 tech that has to date accelerated performance in over 216 games and apps, and is now part of DLSS 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the exciting new DLSS 3 integrations, over a dozen new games have added DLSS 2, also known as DLSS Super Resolution, giving all GeForce RTX gamers a big bump in performance this October. With plugins and Software Development Kits (SDKs) available for all major game engines, adding DLSS to a title is quick and easy, allowing developers big and small to give millions of GeForce RTX gamers the definitive experience when playing on PC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead on to learn about the latest implementations of NVIDIA DLSS, and the latest games to leverage GeForce RTX\u2019s RT Cores that accelerate ray tracing workloads to otherwise unobtainable frame rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 3 Multiplies Frame Rates\nNVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is a groundbreaking revolution in AI-powered graphics, increasing performance on GeForce RTX GPUs using dedicated Tensor Cores, while generating beautiful, sharp images.\nPowered by new hardware capabilities of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, DLSS 3 generates entirely new high quality frames, rather than just pixels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough a process detailed in full in our NVIDIA DLSS 3 article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution technology and DLSS Frame Generation to reconstruct 7/8ths of the displayed pixels, accelerating performance to previously unimaginable degrees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn GPU-limited games, DLSS Super Resolution technology can increase your frame rates by up to 2X. With DLSS 3, we can boost them by up to 4X (compared to brute-force rendering) in fully ray-traced worlds like those seen in the incredible Portal with RTX.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertain games make extensive use of the CPU, limiting the benefit of faster graphics cards and DLSS Super Resolution. DLSS 3 operates on the GPU, bypassing CPU bottlenecks and boosting frame rates. In Microsoft Flight Simulator, for example, DLSS 3 boosts frame rates by up to 2X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3 games are backwards compatible with DLSS 2 technology - developers simply integrate DLSS 3, and DLSS 2, also known as DLSS Super Resolution, is supported by default. Additionally, integrations of DLSS 3 also include NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency for all GeForce RTX users, making games more responsive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Plague Tale: Requiem Launches October 18 With DLSS 3\nAfter escaping their devastated homeland in the critically-acclaimed A Plague Tale: Innocence, Amicia and brother Hugo venture south of 14th century France, to new regions and vibrant cities. There, they attempt to start a new life and control Hugo\u2019s curse. But, when his powers reawaken, death and destruction return in a flood of devouring rats. Forced to flee once more, the siblings place their hopes in a prophesized island that may hold the key to saving Hugo.\nSee how their tale continues when the highly anticipated A Plague Tale: Requiem launches October 18th.

And as you can see in our 4K comparison screenshots below, surfaces and textures boast incredible physically-based detail, ensuring these effects naturally and realistically interact, for the highest level of image quality and immersion.

Businesses and governments increasingly require systems that are powerful yet environmentally friendly. And cloud services must respond to global demands without making the grid stutter.\nFor these reasons and more, green computing has evolved rapidly over the past three decades, and it\u2019s here to stay.\nWhat Is Green Computing?\nGreen computing, or sustainable computing, is the practice of maximizing energy efficiency\u00a0and minimizing environmental impact in the ways computer chips, systems and software are designed and used.\nAlso called green information technology, green IT or sustainable IT, green computing spans concerns across the supply chain, from the raw materials used to make computers to how systems get recycled.\nIn their working lives, green computers must deliver the most work for the least energy, typically measured by performance per watt.\nWhy Is Green Computing Important?\nGreen computing is a significant tool to combat climate change, the existential threat of our time.\nGlobal temperatures have risen about 1.2\u00b0C over the last century. As a result, ice caps are melting, causing sea levels to rise about 20 centimeters and increasing the number and severity of extreme weather events.\nThe rising use of electricity is one of the causes of global warming. Data centers represent a small fraction of total electricity use, about 1% or 200 terawatt-hours per year, but they\u2019re a growing factor that demands attention.\nPowerful, energy-efficient computers are part of the solution. They\u2019re advancing science and our quality of life, including the ways we understand and respond to climate change.\nWhat Are the Elements of Green Computing?\nEngineers know green computing is a holistic discipline.\n\u201cEnergy efficiency is a full-stack issue, from the software down to the chips,\u201d said Sachin Idgunji, co-chair of the power working group for the industry\u2019s MLPerf AI benchmark and a distinguished engineer working on performance analysis at NVIDIA.\nFor example, in one analysis he found NVIDIA DGX A100 systems delivered a nearly 5x improvement in energy efficiency in scale-out AI training benchmarks compared to the prior generation.\n\u201cMy primary role is analyzing and improving energy efficiency of AI applications at everything from the GPU and the system node to the full data center scale,\u201d he said.\nIdgunji\u2019s work is a job description for a growing cadre of engineers building products from smartphones to supercomputers.\nWhat\u2019s the History of Green Computing?\nGreen computing hit the public spotlight in 1992, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency launched Energy Star, a program for identifying consumer electronics that met standards in energy efficiency.\nThe Energy Star logo is now used across more than three dozen product groups.\nA 2017 report found nearly 100 government and industry programs across 22 countries promoting what it called green ICTs, sustainable information and communication technologies.\nOne such organization, the Green Electronics Council, provides the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool, a registry of systems and their energy-efficiency levels. The council claims it\u2019s saved nearly 400 million megawatt-hours of electricity through use of 1.5 billion green products it\u2019s recommended to date.\nWork on green computing continues across the industry at every level.\nFor example, some large data centers use liquid-cooling while others locate data centers where they can use cool ambient air. Schneider Electric recently released a whitepaper recommending 23 metrics for determining the sustainability level of data centers.\nData centers need to consider energy and water use as well as greenhouse gas emissions and waste to measure their sustainability, according to a Schneider whitepaper.\nA Pioneer in Energy Efficiency\nWu Feng, a computer science professor at Virginia Tech, built a career pushing the limits of green computing. It started out of necessity while he was working at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.\nA computer cluster for open science research he maintained in an external warehouse had twice as many failures in summers versus winters. So, he built a lower-power system that wouldn\u2019t generate as much heat.\nThe Green Destiny supercomputer\nHe demoed the system, dubbed Green Destiny, at the Supercomputing conference in 2001. Covered by the BBC, CNN and the New York Times, among others, it sparked years of talks and debates in the HPC community about the potential reliability as well as efficiency of green computing.\nInterest rose as supercomputers and data centers grew, pushing their boundaries in power consumption. In November 2007, after working with some 30 HPC luminaries and gathering community feedback, Feng launched the first Green500 List, the industry\u2019s benchmark for energy-efficient supercomputing.\nA Green Computing Benchmark\nThe Green500 became a rallying point for a community that needed to reign in power consumption while taking performance to new heights.\n\u201cEnergy efficiency increased exponentially, flops per watt doubled about every year and a half for the greenest supercomputer at the top of the list,\u201d said Feng.\nBy some measures, the results showed the energy efficiency of the world\u2019s greenest systems increased two orders of magnitude in the last 14 years.\nThe Green500 showed that heterogeneous systems \u2014 those with accelerators like GPUs in addition to CPUs \u2014 are consistently the most energy-efficient ones.\nFeng attributes the gains mainly to the use of accelerators such as GPUs, now common among the world\u2019s fastest systems.\n\u201cAccelerators added the capability to execute code in a massively parallel way without a lot of overhead \u2014 they let us run blazingly fast,\u201d he said.\nHe cited two generations of the Tsubame supercomputers in Japan as early examples. They used NVIDIA Kepler and Pascal architecture GPUs to lead the Green500 list in 2014 and 2017, part of a procession of GPU-accelerated systems on the list.\n\u201cAccelerators have had a huge impact throughout the list,\u201d said Feng, who will receive an award for his green supercomputing work at the Supercomputing event in November.\n\u201cNotably, NVIDIA was fantastic in its engagement and support of the Green500 by ensuring its energy-efficiency numbers were reported, thus helping energy efficiency become a first-class citizen in how supercomputers are designed today,\u201d he added.\nAI and Networking Get More Efficient\nToday, GPUs and data processing units (DPUs) are bringing greater energy efficiency to AI and networking tasks, as well as HPC jobs like simulations run on supercomputers and enterprise data centers.\nAI, the most powerful technology of our time, will become a part of every business. McKinsey & Co. estimates AI will add a staggering $13 trillion to global GDP by 2030 as deployments grow.\nNVIDIA estimates data centers could save a whopping 19 terawatt-hours of electricity a year if all AI, HPC and networking offloads were run on GPU and DPU accelerators (see the charts below). That\u2019s the equivalent of the energy consumption of 2.9 million passenger cars driven for a year.\nIt\u2019s an eye-popping measure of the potential for energy efficiency with accelerated computing.\nAn analysis of the potential energy savings of accelerated computing with GPUs and DPUs.\nAI Benchmark Measures Efficiency\nBecause AI represents a growing part of enterprise workloads, the MLPerf industry benchmarks for AI have been measuring performance per watt on submissions for data center and edge inference since February 2021.\n\u201cThe next frontier for us is to measure energy efficiency for AI on larger distributed systems, for HPC workloads and for AI training \u2014 it\u2019s similar to the Green500 work,\u201d said Idgunji, whose power group at MLPerf includes members from six other chip and systems companies.\nNVIDIA Jetson modules recently demonstrated significant generation-to-generation leaps in performance per watt in MLPerf benchmarks of AI inference.\nThe public results motivate participants to make significant improvements with each product generation. They also help engineers and developers understand ways to balance performance and efficiency across the major AI workloads that MLPerf tests.\n\u201cSoftware optimizations are a big part of work because they can lead to large impacts in energy efficiency, and if your system is energy efficient, it\u2019s more reliable, too,\u201d Idgunji said.\nGreen Computing for Consumers\nIn PCs and laptops, \u201cwe\u2019ve been investing in efficiency for a long time because it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d said Narayan Kulshrestha, a GPU power architect at NVIDIA who\u2019s been working in the field nearly two decades.\nFor example, Dynamic Boost 2.0 uses deep learning to automatically direct power to a CPU, a GPU or a GPU\u2019s memory to increase system efficiency. In addition, NVIDIA created a system-level design for laptops, called Max-Q, to optimize and balance energy efficiency and performance.\nBuilding a Cyclical Economy\nWhen a user replaces a system, the standard practice in green computing is that the old system gets broken down and recycled. But Matt Hull sees better possibilities.\n\u201cOur vision is a cyclical economy that enables everyone with AI at a variety of price points,\u201d said Hull, the vice president of sales for data center AI products at NVIDIA.\nSo he aims to find the system a new home with users in developing countries who find it useful and affordable. It\u2019s a work in progress seeking the right partner and writing a new chapter in an existing lifecycle management process.\nGreen Computing Fights Climate Change\nEnergy-efficient computers are among the sharpest tools fighting climate change.\nScientists in government labs and universities have long used GPUs to model climate scenarios and predict weather patterns. Recent advances in AI, driven by NVIDIA GPUs, can now help model weather forecasting 100,000x quicker than traditional models. Watch the following video for details:\n\nIn an effort to accelerate climate science, NVIDIA announced plans to build Earth-2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to predicting the impacts of climate change. It will use NVIDIA Omniverse, a 3D design collaboration and simulation platform, to build a digital twin of Earth so scientists can model climates in ultra-high resolution.\nIn addition, NVIDIA is working with the United Nations Satellite Centre to accelerate climate-disaster management and train data scientists across the globe in using AI to improve flood detection.\nMeanwhile, utilities are embracing machine learning to move toward a green, resilient and smart grid. Power plants are using digital twins to predict costly maintenance and model new energy sources, such as fusion-reactor designs.\nWhat\u2019s Ahead in Green Computing?\nFeng sees the core technology behind green computing moving forward on multiple fronts.\nIn the short term, he\u2019s working on what\u2019s called energy proportionality, that is, ways to make sure systems get peak power when they need peak performance and scale gracefully down to zero power as they slow to an idle, like a modern car engine that slows its RPMs and then shuts down at a red light.\nResearchers seek to close the gap in energy-proportional computing.\nLong term, he\u2019s exploring ways to minimize data movement inside and between computer chips to reduce their energy consumption. And he\u2019s among many researchers studying the promise of quantum computing to deliver new kinds of acceleration.\nIt\u2019s all part of the ongoing work of green computing, delivering ever more performance at ever greater efficiency.\nDiscover how AI is powering the future of clean energy.\n\n\nCategories: ExplainerTags: Climate | Corporate Responsibility | Energy | GeForce | GPU | GPU Computing | High-Performance Computing | Jetson | NVIDIA A100 | NVIDIA DGX | Public Sector | Science | Social Impact | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

From Alexa helping to keep track of your shopping list to using AI bots for customer service, there\u2019s no doubt that AI is here to stay. Now that we are used to smart home assistants like Siri and Cortana, it\u2019s easy to see how quickly this technology has grown over the past few years.\nInvestors could possibly gain a lot from investing in these businesses. Here, we offer an overview of AI and list nine of the best artificial intelligence stocks.\nIn this guide:What is artificial intelligence?Top 9 artificial intelligence stocks to invest in 2025Artificial intelligence stocks could pay off greatlyFrequently asked questions\nWhat is artificial intelligence?\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a form of computer technology that allows machines to mimic human thinking and problem-solving. It can be used to automate tasks, such as identifying security threats in images or creating custom music playlists based on a user\u2019s preferences.\nWith machine learning, AI can adjust based on new information it collects over time. For example, an AI system could use machine learning to identify objects in an image after being shown thousands of pictures.\nThe benefits of artificial intelligence are broad-ranging. For example, It has the potential to reduce labor costs by automating repetitive tasks, improving efficiency, increasing productivity, and modernizing industries like healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation.\nHowever, there are also risks when it comes to artificial intelligence. It may lead some people out of work due to automation. Furthermore, it may cause other issues involving privacy protection and cybersecurity if not correctly handled by businesses using the technology.\nTop 9 artificial intelligence stocks to invest in 2025\nThe following is a list of nine companies that are working with AI technology.\n\nSponsored\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored\n\n1.

Initially, the stock is noted at a price of $234.36. As the year progresses, there\u2019s a clear upward trajectory in the stock\u2019s value.\nDespite the usual market fluctuations, the overall trend remains positive, culminating in a price of $488.30 by early December 2023. This near doubling in the stock price reflects Nvidia\u2019s strong market performance during this timeframe. Moreover, Nvidia is a graphics chip giant that has heavily invested in the AI market for years. \n\n\u201cThe pace of progress in artificial intelligence (I\u2019m not referring to narrow AI) is incredibly fast. Unless you have direct exposure to groups like Deepmind, you have no idea how fast\u2014it is growing at a pace close to exponential.

We grew up as nine siblings under one roof, and that is a great gift. We enjoyed priceless memories growing up together. Our own experience plays a large part in our mission. We develop homes where families can forge strong relationships,\u201d\u00a0says Tatiana Teh, the group\u2019s Client Relations Director. In today\u2019s digital age where people spend an increasing amount of time in the virtual world, Brand New Land\u2019s approach of connecting families is the guiding principle for the design and construction of their homes. Connecting Families \u201cIn a world where family members tend to shut themselves in their own rooms or disconnect from others by using their phones, we go all-out to provide beautiful spacious homes to inspire families to connect. We aim to help families grow closer and do more things together,\u201d explains Alvina Teh, Business Development Director of the group. To draw the family together in a beautiful environment, Brand New Land homes feature large, central gathering spaces with views of nature. The group\u2019s homes have multiple family areas, so that extended family and friends can all gather under one roof. Beautiful Spaces to Gather and Connect    The coastal-themed Poolside Family Lounge which spills into an Al-Fresco Entertainment Deck @ 1 Jalan Novena    The Shangri-La vibe Clubhouse @ 27 Old Upper Thomson Road, featuring Swimming Pool, Breakfast Bar and Family Lounge    The Family Lounge @ 27 Old Upper Thomson Road, overlooking The Outdoor Pavilion, framed by custom timber-effect screens    The Nature-Inspired Living Hall @ 6 Jalan Sentosa, framed by greenery & water    The All-Purpose Living Hall @ 6 Greenleaf Lane, bathed in ample natural light and hugged by the Swimming Pool\u00a0 Happy Individuals, Happy Family Brand New Land believes that happy individuals help make a happy family. Thus, the group designs their homes with individual needs in place. Super-sized Bedrooms Brand New Land homes incorporate private spaces for family members to retreat for quiet alone time. Bedrooms are always en-suite for privacy and as spacious as possible. Master Suites are often super-sized to include a seating lounge, a spacious walk-in-wardrobe and a luxurious spa bath.   Story continues Each bedroom is also purposefully designed to incorporate courtyards or views of greenery, harnessing the therapeutic effects of nature and fresh air.

If you need to unwind, you can work out, meditate or get a relaxing massage in the comfort and convenience of your own home. We believe it is important to look after yourself, so you could look after others around you even better. Our homes are designed to help you relax, recharge and strengthen. As a mother of 4 young children, this is something that I value too,\u201d says Alvina.  The Spa @\u00a06 Jalan Sentosa, ultimate relaxation  Wellness Studio @ 27 Old Upper Thomson Road  Wellness Studio @ 5 Jalan IsninGrowing your Family\u2019s LegacyBrand New Land Group takes a long-term approach to business decisions, with the aim of growing the wealth of its buyers.\u201cWe love that many of our buyers are thinking of legacy and the next generation when they buy a landed home from us. We do our part by ensuring that our developments have strong capital appreciation potential. It is an integrated approach \u2013 from our choice of locations to the design of our homes,\u201d says Alvina.Premium locations with strong upside valueWhen sourcing for land, Brand New Land gravitates towards peaceful neighbourhoods, near well-established schools, amenities and transport networks.The group\u2019s current collection of homes is found in the landed enclaves of Novena, Bukit Timah, Frankel Estate, Thomson Gardens and Serangoon,\u00a0to name a few.One of the Group\u2019s upcoming homes is located right at the edge of the reservoir.\u201cWe don\u2019t mind paying\u00a0for good plots of land with pleasant surroundings and rare, unique attributes. Research shows that such plots have strong growth potential. This will enhance the wealth of our buyers as time goes by,\u201d explains Alvina.Spacious Homes for greater valueIn spite of rising construction costs, the group veers towards maximising the built areas of their homes, which often have 4 or 5 levels.\u201cIt costs more to build a huge house, but we know that it is worth it to do so. In Singapore, where land is scarce, the data shows that people crave more living space. Big, spacious homes will have greater upside value potential for our buyers, especially in the long run,\u201d explains Alvina.

Our track record shows that our homes have the potential to appreciate greatly in value as time goes by. More importantly, in a world where it is so easy to be disconnected and lose sight of what matters most, we hope that our homes will connect families and create priceless memories just like the ones we have been blessed with.\u201d\u00a0 - says Alvina.For more information and updates on upcoming launches,Call 8893 7602Visit www.brandnewland.com.sgInstagram: @brandnewlandgroup https://www.instagram.com/brandnewlandgroup/Facebook: @brandnewlandgroup https://www.facebook.com/brandnewlandgroup/YouTube: https://youtube.com/channel/UCcPpttOd21pAEepCc0IEE0ALinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/brand-new-land-groupIf you are keen to explore working with the group, or if you have land with potential for redevelopment,\u00a0please\u00a0email:\u00a0comehome@brandnewland.com.sgSee Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Photographer: Roslan Rahman/AFP/Getty Images  \u00b7 Photographer: ROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP (Bloomberg) \u2014 Singapore\u2019s reputation as one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities now extends to one of its cheapest modes of transportation: motorcycles. The cost of a 10-year motorcycle permit in the city-state hit a record S$12,801 ($8,984) this month according to data from the Land Transport Authority, up over 200% in four years and more than the cost of a new, entry-level bike in the Southeast Asian nation. Singapore controls the number of permits, called certificates of entitlement (COE), as a way to limit the number of motorcycles and cars on the road. As of September, the city caps its motorcycle fleet at around 142,000. The number of cars is limited to about 650,000.    At current permit prices, drivers would need nearly S$20,000 to own and ride an entry-level motorcycle worth S$5,000. That\u2019ll eventually trickle down to delivery riders who zigzag the island on low-end bikes, Nathan Peng, a political science lecturer at the Singapore Management University, told Bloomberg. As of now, renewing an existing permit costs more than S$11,000 \u2014 less than a new one, but almost six times more than the price a decade ago.  Those who own their bikes will pay the increased fees directly, and those who rent are likely to see their fees go up. Many delivery drivers rent their vehicles, either from an independent operator or from a food delivery company like Grab. Several motorcycle leasing companies in Singapore are considering rate hikes to make up for the higher permit costs, the Straits Times reported. One company, GigaRider, said it\u2019s likely to raise rent by 10% in the first quarter of 2023 for its corporate clients. Grab notes on its website that rental charges may rise because of COE price hikes. Singapore isn\u2019t only targeting motorcycles. The land-scarce country is also limiting cars on the road \u2014 permits for entry-level cars now cost over S$80,000, nearly triple 2018. Higher prices will add to the already-widening inequality among residents, though it\u2019s difficult to predict the extent of the impact with limited data available, said Peng. For many low-income workers, a motorcycle is one of the very few cost-effective ways to meet work or family responsibilities. \u201cI don\u2019t think motorcycles, for most, are a lifestyle choice,\u201d said Peng. \u201cIf they could afford to take a Grab to work, they may not buy a motorcycle because of concerns like safety and comfort. Why would they take on the extra risk if they had a choice?\u201d Singapore has been trying to narrow its wealth gap, even as the cost of living rises. At an event on Oct. 10, Singapore\u2019s prime minister-in-waiting Lawrence Wong pointed to the housing market as a sign that social stratification is becoming more entrenched, with more families with young children staying in rental flats. \u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.

(Photo: Getty Images)  \u00b7 Mongkol Chuewong via Getty Images By Chanyaporn Chanjaroen (Bloomberg) \u2014 Frangipani plants and coconut trees front the three-story villa on Sentosa Island where Myanmar tycoon Tay Za stays when he\u2019s in Singapore. It\u2019s one of two houses his family owns in a development overlooking the South China Sea known as a playground for the wealthy. A short drive away is the Marina Bay Sands casino, where he would often show up carrying a duffel bag stuffed with cash. On a sunny day in June, a yellow Ferrari F8 Spider and a Mercedes were parked outside one of the villas.  Singapore has long been a haven for sanctioned Myanmar businessmen, including Tay Za, who has been accused by the US and others of supplying arms and equipment to the military. He has maintained the right to live and work in Singapore despite sanctions first imposed by the US in 2007 and has incorporated about 10 companies there with operations in palm oil, teak and aviation. The US sanctions against him and other supporters of the regime were lifted in 2016 after democratic elections in Myanmar, then reinstated earlier this year following a February 2021 coup that forcibly removed Aung San Suu Kyi from leadership. Most Asian countries, including Singapore, don\u2019t support the sanctions. Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said they would only hurt the people of Myanmar and have pushed that country closer to China. When asked about Tay Za and Singapore\u2019s policy on Myanmar, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry pointed to previous statements by Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, who called the situation there \u201ca tragedy.\u201d The minister has said Myanmar needs to resolve its conflicts internally and that people shouldn\u2019t overstate his country\u2019s influence.  That stance is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain as the US ramps up pressure on the junta and global financial regulators weigh blacklisting the country. There are signs Singapore is moving away from its policy of not interfering in the affairs of neighboring countries. It has criticized the military regime, asked banks to heighten their scrutiny of financial flows to Myanmar and stopped authorizing the transfer of any items that may be used to inflict violence against unarmed civilians. But sanctioned arms dealers including Tay Za, who has denied the allegations, continue to operate other businesses openly in the city-state. \u201cSingapore was at first very reluctant to impose sanctions on the military government, fearful of the impact that it would have on the financial sector,\u201d said Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington who specializes in Southeast Asian politics. \u201cIt has started to crack down on some military-linked corporations that are operating in the city-state, but there remain a large number conducting business in Singapore, which provides a financial lifeline for the military as well as a conduit of weapons, munitions and spare parts.\u201d   Story continues Leaked 2007 US State Department cables called Tay Za Myanmar\u2019s \u201c number one crony businessman,\u201d citing his connections with Russian aircraft manufacturers. One of the cables, written by a US embassy official in Yangon and published by WikiLeaks, described how he leveraged his relationship with a Russian ambassador to become the sales representative for companies that supplied Myanmar with arms, ammunition, MI-17 helicopters and MiG-29s.   BloombergThe UK sanctioned Tay Za in September 2021, saying he \u201cis associated with the military through his extensive links with the former and current junta regimes.\u201d The US Treasury added him to its sanctions list in January, saying he had provided weapons and equipment to the armed forces and traveled to Russia in May 2021 with the head of Myanmar\u2019s air force at the time. The US also sanctioned Tay Za\u2019s sons, Pye Phyo and Htoo Htet, who were deemed \u201cinstrumental\u201d to his dealings with the junta, as well as his company, Htoo Group.Russia was second only to China in selling arms to Myanmar over the 10 years ending in 2021, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, or Sipri, which tracks international arms sales. The group said 30 combat-capable aircraft were delivered in the second half of that period, including 20 from Russia and 10 from China. While most countries build up stockpiles for defense, Myanmar\u2019s military, known as the Tatmadaw, has employed them for campaigns against its own citizens and the Rohingya minority, Sipri said.

Source: Getty Images  \u00b7 Photographer: Getty Images/GettySiemon Wezeman, a senior researcher at Sipri\u2019s arms-transfer program, said the use of middlemen like Tay Za is common in countries such as Myanmar. \u201cThey have the knowledge, the contacts and help oil the wheel,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they are doing anything illegal, but they can help facilitate financing and transportation of arms.\u201dAs recently as 2018, when sanctions against Tay Za weren\u2019t in effect, representatives of his Yangon Aircraft Engineering Co. met with Myanmar Air Force delegates to discuss the conversion of ATR 72 aircraft for cargo and troop transport at an approximate cost of $550,000 each, according to leaked minutes of the meeting published by Justice for Myanmar, a group that investigates and campaigns against entities supporting the junta. Another leaked document from November 2017 cited Tay Za\u2019s Myanmar Avia Export Co. as the partner of JSC Russian Helicopters.A 2019 United Nations Human Rights Council report called Tay Za\u2019s Htoo Group, one of \u201cthe largest crony companies\u201d in Myanmar. It was among donors to the Tatmadaw in September 2017, the report said, after the armed forces began what it called \u201cclearance operations\u201d against the Muslim Rohingya population in western Rakhine state that resulted in several thousand deaths and the displacement of an estimated 870,000 people.Major General Zaw Min Tun, lead spokesman for Myanmar\u2019s ruling State Administration Council, declined to answer questions about Tay Za, arms sales or sanctions against the country. \u201cWe can\u2019t answer these,\u201d the council\u2019s information office wrote in an email.\u20181,000% Never\u2019Tay Za denies he\u2019s an arms merchant. In a 90-minute interview from Putao, a picturesque town in the Himalaya foothills where he owns a resort, the 58-year-old businessman said he has provided only transportation equipment, not weapons, to Myanmar\u2019s military. He said he has suffered financial setbacks as a result of the sanctions, including having to close his airline because he couldn\u2019t obtain insurance, and is now semi-retired because of health issues.\u201cI don\u2019t trade arms,\u201d he said, his round face becoming animated on a computer screen. \u201c1,000% never.\u201dHis two sons joined the call. Heir apparent Pye Phyo, 35, dialed in from Yangon in Myanmar, and Htoo Htet, 29, who runs the family bank, was at the W Hotel on Sentosa. Both went to an international school in Singapore, speak excellent English, and chipped in with occasional translations for their father.  Tay Za's son Htoo Htet in 2017. Photographer: Brent Lewin/Bloomberg  \u00b7 Bloomberg\u201cThe media has caricatured my relationship with the armed forces,\u201d Tay Za said, explaining that he had a good rapport with the military until 2011, though his \u201cproximity to the government at the time was exaggerated.\u201d He insisted he didn\u2019t go to Moscow last year because of pandemic travel restrictions, disputing US Treasury allegations and a May 2021 report in the Irrawaddy, a publication run by Myanmar journalists in exile.The publication, citing unnamed sources, said he flew in a private jet from Singapore to Naypyidaw, the capital of Myanmar, for meetings with senior junta officials before attending a military exhibition in Moscow with Myanmar\u2019s then air force chief. \u201cThose allegations were entirely false,\u201d Tay Za said.A copy of Tay Za\u2019s Myanmar passport seen by Bloomberg News bears no stamps for travel since its issuance in April 2020. But holders of a Singapore employment pass like Tay Za can have their passports scanned electronically rather than stamped, according to the website of Singapore\u2019s Immigration & Checkpoints Authority, which processes arrivals and departures. An ICA spokesperson said the agency couldn\u2019t comment about individuals and declined to say whether Tay Za left Singapore in May 2021.Other records provided by a representative for Tay Za, which the person said showed his comings and goings from the gated residence on Sentosa, show that he left the house at 1 a.m. on May 17, 2021, and returned at 4 p.m. on May 21 \u2013 enough time to attend the military exhibition from May 20-22, but not enough to quarantine for 21 days in a designated facility, as he would have been required to do under the city-state\u2019s pandemic rules in effect at the time.Aung Zaw, editor-in-chief of the Irrawaddy, said he stood by his publication\u2019s story. The US Treasury declined to comment.Tay Za said he would meet in Singapore to answer further questions, then withdrew the offer. A representative for his company said in an email that the 2018 plane-conversion project was \u201ccivilian in nature\u201d and did not proceed. He also denied that Myanmar Avia Export was a partner of any international firm.While the latest sanctions haven\u2019t forced the junta to change its policies, they have taken a toll on Tay Za. The UK has banned him from traveling to its territories. A joint venture with Singapore-based Banyan Tree Group for management of 17 hotels in Myanmar has stalled as a result of what a Banyan Tree spokesman describes as \u201cthe present situation.\u201d And earlier this year, the Marina Bay Sands, owned by US-based Las Vegas Sands Corp., told him he\u2019s no longer welcome to gamble there. (That ban may be a boon for Tay Za, who had lost about $70 million at baccarat tables there, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. ) The casino company declined to comment.Still, he is free to come and go as he pleases. \u201cSingapore remains a central business and financial hub in the region, with corporate services of the highest standard,\u201d Tay Za\u2019s representative said. He \u201cenjoys the Singaporean lifestyle, food, and environment, and over time has built strong relationships with friends in Singapore.\u201d The representative declined to comment about Tay Za\u2019s wealth or gambling habits.Family ConnectionsTay Za\u2019s family connections helped pave his way in both the military and business worlds. His father, Myint Swe, took the top job at the Tatmadaw Military Research Unit, an equivalent to the US Central Intelligence Agency, after completing a training course at Fort Benning in Georgia, according to a book published by the family after his 2008 death. Myint Swe\u2019s friendship with Ne Win, the army general who seized power in a 1962 coup, helped his youngest son win the armed forces\u2019 trust.Tay Za married Thida Zaw in the early 1980s after dropping out of a military school. Her family owned Htoo Group, which at the time operated a rice-milling business. Tay Za expanded it into teak trading, aviation, construction, hospitality and banking while making friends with top officials, including Than Shwe, head of state for two decades until 2011.According to one leaked US cable, Tay Za hired the ruling junta\u2019s children, giving them senior roles in his businesses despite their lack of experience. In return, the document said, he was granted lucrative concessions, including one of the few licenses to import cement when the country was building its new capital Naypyidaw. When Tay Za won an exclusive liquor import permit, he gave the 20-year-old son of a former air force chief $200,000 to operate retail outlets, the cable noted.Two years after President Bill Clinton first blacklisted Myanmar in 1997, Tay Za incorporated his first two companies in Singapore, Pavo International Pte and Pavo Trading Pte. Company filings say they were for \u201cwholesale of logs, sawn timber, plywood and related products.\u201d In 2004, a year after President George W. Bush imposed an import ban on products from Myanmar, Tay Za registered Air Bagan Holdings Pte. Another Singapore-based entity, Terrestrial Pte, started in 2007, the year Bush expanded the punitive measures.Oasis of CalmLike many wealthy people, Tay Za was drawn to Singapore because it offers stability and anonymity. The city-state is an oasis of calm compared with its Asian neighbors. Since its separation from Malaysia in 1965, it has been governed by one party, co-founded by Lee Kuan Yew, who developed the country into a global financial and commercial hub.As the world\u2019s third-largest offshore financial center after Switzerland and Hong Kong, Singapore attracts funds from all over. Firms there held $3.5 trillion worth of assets in 2020, about three-quarters of them from overseas, according to a central bank survey. Banks and wealth managers cannot disclose clients\u2019 personal information except to regulators or under court order.Business incorporation is a big industry in Singapore, and more than 560,000 firms were registered there as of July. Serena Lee Chooi Li is among the beneficiaries. The Malaysian lawyer is or has been the corporate secretary of more than 200 companies, according to her 147-page profile at Singapore\u2019s corporate registry. Among the active ones are Tay Za\u2019s Pavo Trading, where Lee has been secretary since 1999. She also serves or has served about a dozen other entities linked to Tay Za and his family, most of them registered at the same business address on the 6th floor of the Bharat Building, where Lee\u2019s firm is located. Lee declined to comment.Pavo Trading has been listed by the US as part of Tay Za\u2019s financial network as far back as 2008. Today, the company remains \u201clive\u201d and solvent on Singapore\u2019s corporate registry, which shows the most recent annual general meeting was held June 30, 2021. Tay Za is listed as managing director, director and majority shareholder. Thida Zaw, from whom he is separated, is the other shareholder. The company is named after El Pavo, one of his favorite cigar brands.While only two of the 10 Singapore-based firms listed under his name are active, the real picture may be more complicated. A dozen other companies were held by his employees or family members as of this year. His sister, Thida Swe, owns Frontier Gold (Singapore), which was active until May. His younger son, Htet Htoo, is a shareholder and director of three Singapore companies. Teo Ah Peng, an employee, is or has been a director of six active companies, some of which have the same address at the Bharat Building.Tay Za\u2019s Sentosa villa was bought with a mortgage from the Singapore unit of Malayan Banking Bhd., Malaysia\u2019s largest bank, according to records at the local land authority. Although the amount of the mortgage isn\u2019t disclosed, a villa of similar size can fetch as much as S$15 million ($10.7 million) in today\u2019s market, according to property firm ERA Singapore. A house held under his sister\u2019s name, facing one of the island\u2019s golf courses, has a mortgage with United Overseas Bank Ltd., Singapore\u2019s third-largest bank. That house was purchased in 2012 for S$15.3 million, public records show. A spokesperson for Maybank said it couldn\u2019t comment about individual customers but that it follows all applicable laws and regulations. UOB didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Singapore is the largest foreign investor in Myanmar with a total of $25 billion flowing into the poorer country since 1989. Keppel Corp., which counts state-investment firm Temasek Holdings Ltd. as its biggest shareholder, has investments in Myanmar, as does sovereign wealth fund GIC Ltd.The money has continued to flow since the 2021 coup, despite the sanctions and the deaths of more than 2,000 civilians, according to an estimate by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a human rights group based in Thailand. Myanmar government records show that $297 million of investments came in from Singapore in the six months ending in March.US PressureThe 10 members of Asean, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, have generally avoided criticizing and interfering in each other\u2019s affairs. But that has been changing since the coup. Asean has taken the position that Myanmar\u2019s leaders have failed to observe an April 2021 agreement to end violence in the country, and it excluded them from a summit in Brunei last October. Earlier this year, Singapore\u2019s foreign ministry called for the release of all political detainees in Myanmar, including Aung San Suu Kyi. At an Asean meeting at the White House in May, an empty chair was put out at a lunch to represent the overthrown civilian government.Singapore usually complies only with sanctions imposed by the United Nations, rather than unilateral measures, and the UN hasn\u2019t taken such action against Myanmar. But Singapore hit Russia with targeted financial sanctions in March after the invasion of Ukraine, even though the UN didn\u2019t act.The US has been pressuring its Asian ally to get tougher on Myanmar, and there are signs that Singapore is responding. Last October, State Department Counselor Derek Chollet visited the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the country\u2019s central bank, and said the city-state has \u201csignificant financial leverage\u201d over Myanmar. His statement came after the central bank said in February 2021 that it didn\u2019t find \u201csignificant funds\u201d from Myanmar companies and individuals at banks in Singapore.That position hasn\u2019t changed, according to a spokesperson for the central bank, who acknowledged that financial institutions in Singapore have been placed on \u201cheightened alert in relation to risks emanating from the situation in Myanmar.\u201d In September, Singapore said in a statement at a United Nations Human Rights Council session that it expects banks \u201cto remain vigilant to any transactions that could pose risks, including dealings with companies and individuals subject to financial sanctions by foreign jurisdictions.\u201dThe Financial Action Task Force, a Paris-based global watchdog, placed Myanmar under increased monitoring in February 2020 for failure to strengthen its anti-money-laundering controls and will consider blacklisting the country at a meeting starting Oct. 18.DBS Group Holdings Ltd., based in Singapore and Southeast Asia\u2019s largest lender, has closed accounts of some Myanmar nationals residing in Singapore, including several who have raised funds to fight the junta, people familiar with the matter said. In a letter sent to some account holders in June, DBS said it had observed \u201cunusual activities\u201d involving the accounts and would be closing them in 30 days. Some of these individuals later were able to open new accounts at other Singapore-based banks, according to the people familiar.A spokesperson for DBS said the bank doesn\u2019t comment about individual clients and doesn\u2019t impose any political views on its customers. Unusual activity, the spokesperson said, \u201ccan be linked to criminal activity, contravenes our policies, or otherwise represents an unusual or suspicious increase in size and volume of transactions.\u201dSingapore\u2019s stricter stance has also affected companies that haven\u2019t been sanctioned and have no obvious connections to the junta. \u201cWe are seeing that banks these days are increasingly strict when it comes to new account openings by Myanmar individuals or entities,\u201d said Chester Toh, a partner at Rajah & Tann, one of Singapore\u2019s largest law firms, who helped set up the firm\u2019s practice in Myanmar. \u201cBanks which used to be quite happy to do business with Myanmar businesses are getting cold feet, and it has been difficult for Myanmar businesses looking to restructure or pivot away from Myanmar.\u201dMeanwhile, Myanmar\u2019s central bank, facing deteriorating economic conditions, plunging local currency and a shortage of dollars, has imposed restrictions, including a requirement that firms earning in foreign currencies convert their revenue into Myanmar kyat within one working day at a fixed rate much lower than the black market price. In July, the regulator asked debtors to halt repayments of foreign loans to defend the nation\u2019s dwindling foreign-exchange reserves.There is no reliable estimate of how much Myanmar money is parked in Singapore, but several individuals sanctioned by the US have long-term employment passes in the city-state and businesses there, according to corporate registry filings.  The Orchard Residences condominium tower in Singapore. Photographer: Wei Leng Tay/Bloomberg  \u00b7 BloombergNaing Htut Aung, accused by the US in March of procuring arms from Chinese companies while having ties to the junta leadership, owns at least two companies registered in Singapore. His address is a 44th-floor apartment at the Orchard Residences, atop a mall on the country\u2019s most famous shopping street. The unit is owned by his wife, Wai Wai Yin, who is not sanctioned and has been a director of his Singapore-based companies, government filings show. He didn\u2019t respond to emails seeking comment.Aung Hlaing Oo, described by the US Treasury as a central figure in planning a weapons-manufacturing plant in Myanmar, owns M C M Pacific Pte, a steel-trading company registered in Singapore since 2006. United Overseas Bank has been the firm\u2019s banker, according to a 2017 filing. Neither Aung Hlaing Oo nor his company responded to requests for comment.Tun Hlaing, director of the Myanmar Directorate for Defense Industries, has been linked to several Singapore companies. His daughter Thet Hnin married Tay Za\u2019s son Pye Phyo in 2020. The wedding was held in a resort town near Mandalay, and the groom arrived in a red Ferrari F8 Spider. Tay Za, wearing a black blazer and matching beret, can be seen in a lavishly produced video posted on YouTube crying during the ceremony before playing on a drum set at the dinner reception held in a glass conservatory lit by hundreds of bulbs.Thet Hnin Hlaing is involved in her father\u2019s business and was a director of two of his Singapore companies, registry filings show. Her father is also a shareholder in a Singapore restaurant business, Vino Vovo Pte, which reported revenue of S$2.93 million in the fiscal year ended November 2019. Tun Hlaing didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\u201cSingapore remains the business hub for military-linked companies,\u201d said Yadanar Maung, a spokesperson for Justice for Myanmar. The organization said it welcomes more vigilance by Singapore banks and the stock exchange regulator, which suspended trading in Emerging Towns & Cities Singapore Ltd. after the group published information about that company\u2019s links to the junta. \u201cBut more needs to be done,\u201d she said, \u201cincluding targeted sanctions against military businesses, and an arms embargo that will stop Singapore-registered companies procuring weapons and dual-use goods for the Myanmar military.\u201dShrinking EmpireTay Za\u2019s Htoo Group has shrunk to about 15,000 employees, according to Pye Phyo, down from the 60,000 reported by the Financial Times in 2011. Corresponding banking relationships for his Asia Green Development Bank Ltd. have been terminated, said his son Htoo Htet, who declined to identify those former counterparties. Gone too is the credit-card business, as Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., both US firms, can no longer do business with the bank.Tay Za can\u2019t start a process for removal from the sanctions list because of \u201cthe current security situation as well as financial constraints,\u201d the company representative said. In an earlier attempt in 2014 to lift sanctions, Tay Za engaged the law firm founded by John Ashcroft, a former US attorney general under George W. Bush. The firm would have been paid between $500,000 and $1 million, depending on how quickly it got results, according to a copy of a previously unreported contract seen by Bloomberg News.Tay Za\u2019s former wife was removed from the US list in 2015 on grounds of their separation. President Barack Obama lifted sanctions against Myanmar and Tay Za the following year. The representative for his company declined to disclose what if any fees were paid to Ashcroft\u2019s firm. Neither Ashcroft not his firm responded to requests for comment.The removal of sanctions led to a flood of foreign investment. That year, Myanmar\u2019s economy was among the fastest growing in the world at 10.5%. But conflicts erupted with ethnic groups seeking independence, and in 2017 the armed forces responded to an attack by a militant Rohingya group that resulted in what the UN called \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201dThe sanctions imposed after the 2021 coup have pushed the junta closer to Russia and China. New arms dealers have emerged, including Kyaw Min Oo, 40, who used to work for Tay Za, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Now managing director of Yangon-based Sky Aviator Co., he registered at least five companies in Singapore from 2015 through 2017 but stepped down from all of them in April, after Justice for Myanmar published an August 2019 letter he wrote to the Myanmar air force saying Sky Aviator is the \u201cexclusive local representation\u201d of Russian Helicopters. In June, the UK added Sky Aviator to its sanctions list. Sky Aviator and Russian Helicopters didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Chollet, the US State Department official, says Singapore has been a good partner in helping isolate Myanmar\u2019s military regime. But Hunter Marston, an adjunct research fellow at La Trobe University in Melbourne who has followed developments in Southeast Asia since 2007, takes a dimmer view.\u201cSanctions have never worked in Myanmar, or arguably anywhere else,\u201d Marston said. \u201cThey have almost always hurt the people of Myanmar, while the generals have found ways to park the money overseas and distribute the spoils of wealth to their own loyalists within the country. The regime will not cave due to sanctions.\u201d\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.

Maybank Securities analyst Eric Ong has kept his \u201cbuy\u201d call on HRnetGroup after the group announced that it was acquiring a 51% stake in FinTech startup Octomate for $676,500 from an unrelated third party. The move will facilitate the integration of Octomate\u2019s instant payment solution with HRnet\u2019s Ease Works app which allows contractor employees to be paid instantly after the approval of their timesheets.  Octomate currently has over 3,000 daily active users with blue-chip customers such as Amazon, H&M and Hyundai Motor Group. There is a one-time implementation/activation fee charged to customers to go live, as well as recurring subscription fees by tier or volume of transactions, depending on its clients\u2019 nature of business, Ong notes. Following the acquisition, Octomate\u2019s CEO and co-founder Zoey Tong will become the 37th business co-owner of the group. \u201cWhile there is no material impact on our earnings per share (EPS) forecasts, we think Octomate is in a sweet spot to extract potential synergies as it enables cross-selling to the group\u2019s new and existing clients,\u201d says Ong who has kept his target price of $1.07, based on an FY2023 P/E of 15x. On HRnetGroup\u2019s future prospects, the analyst sees the group\u2019s professional recruitment business segment as set to benefit as Singapore goes all out to attract more highly skilled foreigners to strengthen its position as a global talent hub. From Jan 1, 2023, applicants for Singapore\u2019s new work pass will need a monthly salary of at least $30,000, which is comparable to the top 5% of Singapore\u2019s employment pass holders.  To this end, Ong says the higher remuneration packages should help HRnet offset slower placement volume growth amid the current uncertain economic outlook. In his report dated Oct 10, Ong deems the faster-than-expected organic growth in existing markets, particularly in Singapore where its market dominance is perceived to leave limited headroom for further growth, as one of the upside factors in HRnetGroup\u2019s favour. Another upside factor is HRnetGroup\u2019s successful and swift execution of its mergers and acquisitions (M&A) strategy in acquiring accretive businesses. Finally, the expansion of other fee-generating services like payroll processing and HR consulting that can augment its core services and customer \u2018stickiness\u2019 is another factor that\u2019ll benefit the group. Meanwhile, a slower-than-expected organic growth in existing markets as well as margin pressure from increased competition in its key markets, as well as execution missteps in its M&As are downside factors. Another downside factor identified by Ong is staff turnover among its key performers and customer relationship managers.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

The higher earnings was mainly attributable to the higher revenue and higher share of profits of associated and joint venture companies, and offset by the higher group expenditure.  Earnings per share for the six-month period came in at 2.88 cents on a fully diluted basis. This is up 29.7% y-o-y from the previous period of 2.22 cents. The group recorded revenue of $362.2 million for the 1HFY2022/2023, up 37.5% y-o-y by $98.7 million, largely driven by the increase in flight activities with all segments recording higher revenue. Group expenditure increased at a higher rate of 38.0% to $373.0 million y-o-y mainly due to the stepping down of government wage support. Expenditure increase was 21.2% excluding wage support, with manpower costs and material costs rising in tandem with higher business activities. As revenue growth was not sufficient to offset the increase in expenditure, SIA Engineering incurred a higher operating loss of $10.8 million as compared to the operating loss of $6.7 million in the same period last year. During the six-month period, SIAEC saw its share of profits of associated and joint venture companies increase by 54.5% y-o-y to $41.4 million, which was attributable to the higher contribution from the group\u2019s engine and component segment and its airframe and line maintenance segment.  Excluding wage support, the group\u2019s profit was $21.4 million, Cash and cash equivalents were at $606 million at the end of 1HFY2022/2023, down from $686 million in the previous year. No interim dividend was declared due to the group\u2019s operating losses and uncertainties in macroeconomic conditions. In its business update, the group says the number of flights handled by its Line Maintenance unit in Singapore doubled y-o-y during the 1HFY2022/2023, representing around 55% of its pre-pandemic volume. The increase in flight activities also led to an increase in demand for maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services with operators looking to return grounded aircraft back to service. During the 1HFY2022/2023, SIAEC\u2019s base maintenance also secured new customers and a long-term contract. In May, the group acquired a 75% stake in SR Technics Malaysia, with the acquisition expanding their component repair and overhaul capabilities. In a Nov 1 release, the outlook for the group is revealed to be uncertain due to an elevated risk of a global recession and geopolitical tensions, though recovery of the aviation industry continues to gain traction in recent times. In addition, high inflation, wage pressure and cessation of wage support will pose challenges.   Story continues Looking ahead, the group says the outlook is uncertain in spite of the recovery of the aviation industry. This due to the heightened risk of a global recession and geopolitical tensions. The high inflationary environment, wage pressure and the lack of wage support will also pose challenges. That said, the group says it will remain vigilant and nimble in managing its costs.Shares in SIAEC closed at 6 cents up or 2.78% higher at $2.22 on Nov 1.See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore SIA Engineering, SingPost and SingTel to benefit from Singapore's reopening: CGS-CIMB  Broker's Digest: Yangzijiang Shipbuilding, Grab Holdings, SIA Engineering and Singapore Exchange SIA Engineering preferred proxy to ride Singapore\u2019s aviation recovery: UOBKH Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

Such questions are usually followed by a multi-level marketing (MLM) pitch, a link to a questionable Western Union account, or both.\n(Hang on while I tell this West African prince that I\u2019m busy).\nBut when it comes to the stock market, 10x gains do happen\u2026 even if only occasionally.\nSince 2016, 22 companies of the Russell 3000 have risen such an amount, according to data from Thomson Reuters.\n$10,000 invested in these firms would be worth $190,000 today.\nAnd over longer periods, plenty more companies make the cut. Of the 500 companies in the S&P 500 index, 137 have gone up 10x since 1990.\nSo, how can investors find these moonshots without risking the farm?\n\nThe Power of High Growth Rates\nConsider the stocks that have bested the Russell 3000 since 2016.\n\nEnphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH). +83x\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). +35x\nImmunomedics (IMMU). +27x, acquired by Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) in 2020\nLantheus Holdings (NASDAQ:LNTH). +25x\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). +23x\n\nThese companies have several elements in common:\nHigh Estimated Earnings Growth. The median 10x company had an estimated growth rate of 39% at the time, compared to 20% for 5x picks and 12.6% for all shares.\n\n\nSource: Chart by InvestorPlace\n\nLow Margins. Return on Capital Invested averaged 6%, compared to 9.7% for all stocks. Net income margin of 3.8% was also lower than the 5.8% median.\n\n\nSource: Chart by InvestorPlace\n\nHigh Earnings Quality. Except for Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), these 10x companies earned high scores in their ability to convert revenues into cash flow, as measured by Thomson Reuters\u2019 StarMine model. As a group, they average a score of 68 \u2014 well above the 50-point median.\n\n\nSource: Chart by InvestorPlace\n\nThese are elements you would expect from hypergrowth companies. Management teams that are willing to sacrifice near-term earnings for growth\u2026\n\u2026while juggling a solid, cash-generating business at the same time.\nBut running the formula in reverse doesn\u2019t necessarily yield good results. Taking the top 10% EPS growers in 2016 would have returned only 37.1%, not much different from the 37.6% of the broader market. And selecting the companies with the lowest decile of net margins would have lost investors 13%\u2026 a poor showing indeed.\nThe \u2018X\u2019 Factor of 10x Stocks\nSo, what separates these high-returning companies from those that fizzle out?\nThough many theories exist, an examination of the 22 stocks that rose 10x since 2016 reveals one commonality:\nAlmost every company existed in a growth market.\nNine of the firms were info-tech related, including Digital Turbine (NASDAQ:APPS), Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) and Paycom Software (NYSE:PAYC). Another six concentrated in renewables or clean energy, and four focused on healthcare.\nIn 2016, these sectors represented some of the fastest-growing areas of the American economy. Firms like Nvidia and AMD would ride a massive wave of chipmaking and AI applications to become top performers. Lantheus Holdings and STAAR Surgical Company (NASDAQ:STAA) would do the same in healthcare.\nMeanwhile, only one deep value play made the list \u2013 iron mining firm Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF). The firm narrowly escaped bankruptcy in 2016, but continues to trade 85% below its peak in 2008.\nIt\u2019s why of the 10 stocks I covered that could rise 10x, eight of them exist in high-growth areas\u2026\n\nDesktop Metal (NYSE:DM): 3D printing.\nGinkgo Bioworks (NYSE:DNA): Bioengineering.\nSoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI): Fintech\nRealReal (NASDAQ:REAL): Discount e-commerce\nPOSaBIT Systems (OTCMKTS:POSAF): Legal cannabis\nUpstart Holdings (NASDAQ:UPST): Cloud-based AI lending\nShoals Technologies Group (NASDAQ:SHLS): Solar\nGentex (NASDAQ:GNTX): Autonomous driving.\n\n\u2026and none are deep value plays.\n\nFinding the Next 10x Winner\nIf this seems like a lot of information, I get it. Finding 10x stocks can seem like searching for a needle in a haystack of Ponzi schemes.\nPromising companies like crypto exchange Voyager Digital (OTCMKTS:VYGVQ) can seem like the next best thing\u2026\n\u2026right until they declare bankruptcy and make billions of investor dollars disappear.\nAnd even firms that do go up 10x can often remain there only temporarily. My stock pick of Longeveron (NASDAQ:LGVN) managed to rise 10x on a meme stock frenzy, only to settle back at a 2x return.\nThat\u2019s why investors should focus so heavily on cash-earning companies. Firms like Gentex generate 11 cents of free cash flow for every dollar of sales. And some like blue-chip cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) do even better.\nFinding stocks that will rise 10x is still risky at best. But following some tried-and-true methods can help your chance at landing a home run.\nTom Yeung is a market analyst and portfolio manager of the Omnia Portfolio, the highest-tier subscription at InvestorPlace.

The two 30-storey, high-rise towers that make up the 99-year leasehold development are striking to look at. Designed by the principal of ip:li Architects, Yip Yuen Hong, in collaboration with ADDP Architects, they feature a distinctive fa\u00e7ade consisting of corrugated, pre-cast concrete panels that provide a rugged look. According to Yip, a four-time President\u2019s Design Award Winner, the rawness of the design pays homage to the site\u2019s history. In the past, the area was part of a warehouse district that serviced the nutmeg plantations that existed then.    Martin Modern, GuocoLand\u2019s 450-unit luxury development along Martin Place, received its temporary occupation permit last year (Picture: GuocoLand) The strong architectural design of the buildings provides a sharp contrast to the lush, verdant landscapes that surround them. Up to 80% of Midtown Modern\u2019s 171,535 sq ft site is dedicated to greenery, with 15 curated gardens that house over 200 species of plants and 50 species of trees and palms. The visually arresting design of Martin Modern\u2019s architecture and its artful landscaping are among the various features of the development that impressed the judges at this year\u2019s EdgeProp Singapore Excellence Awards. Martin Modern scored an outstanding five wins at the awards ceremony held on Oct 21, clinching the titles of Design Excellence, Landscape Excellence, Sustainability Excellence, Innovation Excellence and Top Development.

Envisioned as a botanical garden in the city, Midtown Modern was designed to be a peaceful enclave that residents can retreat to.   Story continues This philosophy is apparent from the minute one enters the grounds. Residents and visitors are greeted by tall walls and expansive green spaces, which the developer says help them adjust from the hustle and bustle of the city to the more tranquil, relaxed environment of Martin Modern.Tang Kok Thye, associate partner at ADDP Architects, says that the meticulous care taken to ensure a memorable arrival experience is one of the reasons why the development stands out to visitors. \u201cThe lush landscape is something that people who go to Martin Modern appreciate,\u201d he observes.  There are 15 gardens at Martin Modern, spread across three levels (Picture: GuocoLand)Showcasing botanic heritageMartin Modern\u2019s landscape was designed by award-winning landscape architecture practice ICN Design International, whose inspiration for the development was shaped by the site\u2019s sloping terrain. Guided by the surroundings, ICN Design decided to create a multi-tiered landscape, spreading the development\u2019s 15 gardens across three levels.The firm also crafted a landscape design that showcased Singapore\u2019s botanical heritage. Taking inspiration from parks and gardens in Singapore, including Fort Canning Park, the Singapore Botanic Gardens and Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, ICN Design created a variety of green spaces such as a forest trail, a maze, rain gardens and a bamboo grove path. Each garden was designed to have a distinct look\u00a0and feel, using a variety of plants with different shades and textures.  The drop-off area (Picture: GuocoLand)Tucked within the grounds are the condominium\u2019s facilities, which include a tennis court, a 50m lap pool, a jacuzzi, a gym and a function room. Gardens were also created at the crown of each tower. Dubbed \u201csecret gardens\u201d, the rooftop landscaping provides residents with a serene space overlooking scenic views. The roof gardens also have reading areas as well as dining pavilions that can be used to host private parties.Designed with occupiers in mindUnits at Martin Modern comprise two- to four-bedroom apartments measuring from 764 to 1,798 sq ft. Space and functionality were key considerations when it came to layout design. While unit sizes for residential developments tend to average around 753 sq ft, units at Martin Modern have an average size of around 1,066 sq ft, according to the developer.  The dining lounge (Picture: GuocoLand)Common bedrooms were designed to be big enough for a queen-sized bed, with the master bedroom able to accommodate a kingsized bed. For units that come with a study, a single bed can fit in the room, allowing it to double as a guest room.Care was also taken in deciding the orientation of the tower blocks. As such, all 450 units have unobstructed views of either the gardens, the city or the Singapore River. Generous balconies were provided for each unit, which can serve as an extension of the living space. Select units at the development have two balconies, allowing residents to enjoy two different views while also enhancing cross-ventilation.  The fa\u00e7ade of the development features corrugated, pre-cast concrete panels that provide a rugged look (Picture: GuocoLand)Refined finishesBeyond layout efficiency, GuocoLand ensured that the interiors and fit-out of apartments reflect \u201cthe modern aesthetics and refined tastes\u201d\u00a0of those residing at Martin Modern.Luxurious materials were integrated into the design, including full marble wall and flooring for the bathrooms and mosaic marble flooring for the balcony. The balcony also features a perforated aluminium screen that allows for more privacy while ensuring better light and ventilation.All units are decked out with luxury fittings including Miele kitchen appliances, a SMEG refrigerator, Laufen sanitaryware, Axor bathroom accessories, and a Geberit smart water closet. To enhance residents\u2019 convenience and comfort, every unit comes with a wireless smart home-ready hub, which allows for the integration of multimedia systems that can be used to remotely control lighting and air-conditioning.  The two towers each feature a roof garden that offers scenic views (Picture: GuocoLand)\u2018Modern\u2019 livingWhen Martin Modern was launched for sale in July 2017, the project saw robust response, with about 90 units sold during its launch weekend. Since then, the luxury development has been fully taken up, with an average transacted price of $2,506 psf based on caveats lodged.The success of the project also marked the beginning of GuocoLand\u2019s \u201cModern\u201d series of residences. In March 2021, the developer launched Midtown Modern, the 558-unit integrated development along Tan Quee Lan Street in Bugis. More recently, Lentor Modern, the 605-unit integrated development in the up-and-coming Lentor Hills Estate, became the third project to debut under the series.According to GuocoLand, the series defines a modern luxury lifestyle through the use of architecture that is timeless and classic; efficient and adaptable layouts that support living, working and entertaining at home; a strong focus on wellness through accessibility to nature; and shared amenities to promote social activities.

The Singapore Exchange (SGX) Group announced, on Oct 27, that it has partnered with MSCI to licence the newly-launched MSCI Climate Action Indexes for listed futures contracts.  The indexes, which include companies taking concrete steps to reduce their emission reduction targets, were launched on Oct 25. The companies in the indexes were evaluated based on a range of climate indicators that assess their current carbon intensity and potential to lead in the climate transition, relative to their peers. According to SGX, the exchange recognises the importance of strengthening the ecosystem with relevant solutions to support climate transition. The group adds that it will be working with market participants to develop a range of climate-related products including futures contracts to help investors reduce their portfolio carbon footprints in a bid to strengthen its current suite of climate products. \u201cAs a leading international exchange in Asia, we have a unique responsibility to lead the market in managing climate risks. We need to quicken the pace of transition and our work with MSCI seeks to address the pressing need for more targeted solutions in the market,\u201d says Loh Boon Chye, CEO of SGX.  \u201cGiven the growing influence of investors over companies, these indexes coupled with related products in the pipeline will facilitate climate engagement and accelerate the flow of funds to directly support companies in their transition efforts. We will continue to work with all our partners to identify and develop suitable climate-related solutions to meet investor needs,\u201d Loh adds. \u201cThrough this agreement, SGX Group and MSCI will help the finance and investment industry accelerate progress toward net-zero carbon emissions and a more sustainable future. This industry has a key role to play in reaching net zero, and MSCI is proud to do our part in making innovative climate tools more widely available,\u201d says Henry Fernandez, chairman and CEO of MSCI. To Gillian Tan, assistant managing director (development and international) and chief sustainability officer at The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the move to combat climate change requires a \u201ccoordinated global response\u201d. \u201cSGX Group and MSCI are key players in the global financial ecosystem and this collaboration will harness private capital to drive change. MAS welcomes the listing of MSCI Climate Action products on SGX to provide a transparent offering for investors seeking to decarbonise their equity portfolios,\u201d Tan adds.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorOct 11, 2022, 09:00am EDTShareSaveCommentThis article is more than 2 years old.Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has lifted the embargo on its new flagship graphics card the $1,600 monster that is the GeForce RTX 4090 is now able to have its performance laid bare for all to see. The question is, just how fast is this hugely expensive card in games and can it get anywhere near justifying its price tag?\nNvidia's GeForce RTX 4090Antony Leather\n\nThat's maybe a silly question, because Nvidia's flagship models have rarely been about value and cost far more today than they did just a few years ago - it's 60% more than the RTX 2080 Ti cost at launch. Still, this is a step above that, with the RTX 4080 and it's two variants will different memory amounts the more comparable products.\n\n\n\n\nWho\u2019s it for?\nThe RTX 4090 is for those that have a suitably large wallet and either have some serious need for it - perhaps high refresh rate monitors, smooth frame rates at 4K with all the eye-candy turned on or just because they want the best. Today, we're mostly disregarding value and seeing instead how fast this enormous graphics card is.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\nNvidia's GeForce RTX 4090Antony Leather\n\nIs my PSU powerful enough?\nFirstly, a word about power supplies. Despite early rumors, most power supplies will be able to handle the RTX 4090, with Nvidia saying you'll need a minimum of 850W. The second requirement is a minimum of four 8-pin power connectors, since the RTX 4090 comes with a 4-way splitter cable and ideally you'll want to feed separate cables into these rather than daisy chaining.\n\n RTX 4090 PSU and cable requirementsNvidia\nYou do not need to connect 8-pin cables to all four connectors, though. Nvidia states that three will suffice for standard operation with four needed if you're overclocking.RTX 4090 PCIe 5.0 power connector requirementsNvidia\nAlternatively, you can use a PSU with a new PCIe 5.0 connector such as the one included with the Thermaltake Toughpower GF3 power supply I used for testing.Thermaltake's Toughpower GF3 PSU has a PCIe 5 connector that can power the RTX 4090 using a single ... [+] cableAntony Leather \nThis cable can dish out up to 600W on its own and looks a heck of a lot nicer too. Nvidia states either the 450W or 600W versions of this new power connector are compatible with the RTX 4090.The 4-way 8-pin splitter cable for the RTX 4090 alongside a Thermaltake Toughpower GF3 1350W PSU ... [+] with PCIe 5 connector that can replace the splitter cable included with the RTX 4090Antony Leather\nMy test system drew around 600W in games, so 850W is a bare minimum with an RTX 4090, with 1000W+ providing more headroom and also likely seeing the PSU fan spin up less frequently.\nIs my case big enough?\nThis is a big graphics card. it's 5.4in wide, requires three PCI slots and plenty of clearance underneath for cooling. It's also 12in long. Most standard cases will be fine, but it's worth checking these requirements, especially with smaller cases.RTX 4090 dimensions for case compatibilityNvidia\nTest system and benchmarksTest systemAntony Leather\nThe test system uses the Nvidia release driver for the RTX 4090 and the latest drivers as of October 8th for other Nvidia and AMD cards along with a fully up to date version of Windows 11. I used an Intel Core i9-12900K, Asus ROG Strix Z690 Apex motherboard, Kingston 6,000MHz Fury DDR5 memory, a Kingston Fury Renegade SSD and Thermaltake Toughpower GF3 1350W PSU.\nOther GPUs were the RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti OC, courtesy of Palit in the form of its GameRock models and AMD RX 6950 XTPalit RTX 3090 TiPalit\nI started testing at 2,560 x 1,440 as the RTX 4090 makes no sense for 1080p gaming, and used a mixture of ray tracing/DXR tests, enabling DLSS mostly at the top of the resolution scale to show fps scaling.\nBenchmarks\nBelow you can see Rainbow Six Extraction, which is fairly easy to achieve high playframe rates. The RTX 4090 saw some of its best gains here over other cards, offering nearly double the frate rates of the RTX 3090 at 1440p.RTX 4090 performanceantony leather\nStepping up to 4K and it's a similar story with near 100 percent gains over the RTX 3090 and RX 6950XT with the RTX 3090 Ti a long way behind. A very impressive showing from the new flagship.RTX 4090 performanceantony leather\nAdding DLSS into the mix saw the AMD card fall away and over 100fps added to the minimum 99th percentile of the RTX 4090, again with huge leads over the other cards.RTX 4090 performanceantony leather\nForza Horizon 5 was quite as easy to run or as competitive for the RTX 4090, but it was still a long way ahead of the RX 6960 XT and even further than the two other Nvidia cards.\nIf you chucked out your RTX 3090 and installed an RTX 4090, you'd probably be pleased with the increased frame rates at 4K below too, easily smashing the 100fps barrier and managing a healthy average of 157fps, even with ray tracing enabled.RTX 4090 performanceantony leather\nWatch Dogs: Legion, despite being an elderly title, remains a tough one to achieve smooth frame rates in, but the RTX 4090 is the first card to hit 100fps average at 1440p with DXR enabled - double that of the RX 6950 XT.\nStepping up to 4K and it was till the RTX 4090 with a massive lead over the other cards, with the RX 6950 XT struggling here, but even the RTX 3090 Ti was barely able to manage half the RTX 4090's average frame rate.\nDLSS makes a sizeable difference here and the RTX 4090 offered nearly identical frame rates at 4K to it's 1440p results, dominating the field and staying above 50fps on both results.RTX 4090 performanceantony leather\nMetro Exodus is still a tough game to achieve high frame rates in but the RTX 4090 did an excellent job here, doubling the average frame rate of the RX 6950 XT and offering a huge amount more performance than the other Nvidia cards at 1440p.RTX 4090 performanceantony leather\nStepping up to 4K and with more load on the GPUs, the RTX 4090 edged out a more significant lead, more than doubling the average frame rate of every other card and nearly doubling the 99th percentile minimum frame rate of the RTX 3090.RTX 4090 performanceantony leather\nWith DLSS enabled it was much the same although the other Nvidia cards benefitted too here, closing the gap in percentage terms, but still a long way behind.\nFar Cry 6 is a relatively easy game to play at high frame rates which can see it lean more on the CPU than some other titles, but the RTX 4090 still edged out a decent lead over the other cards, albeit not by a significant amount.RTX 4090 performanceantony leather\nThere was more of a difference at 4K, though, with it being the only card to top 100fps on the 99th percentile and an average frame rate at least 40 percent higher than the rest.RTX 4090 performanceantony leather\nWith DXR reflections turned on, this lead increased, with the RTX 3090 and 3090 Ti not even managing to stay within 30fps of the 4090's minimum 99th percentile and sitting nearly 40fps below its average frame rate.RTX 4090 performanceantony leather\nFlight Simulator is a tough game to run at very high frame rates and there are usually bottlenecks elsewhere in a PC, especially below 4K. Interestingly, DLSS 3 could help here as it generates entirely new frames independent of the CPU. As we can see here, even with a Core i9-12900K, there's very little difference between the cards here.RTX 4090 performanceantony leather\nAt 4K, things lean more towards being CPU-bound, but we're still not seeing the kind of benefits you'd expect given the performance on offer. Clear other bottlenecks are at work, although the RTX 4090 does at least now have a lead.RTX 4090 performanceantony leather\nDLSS in its current guise still doesn't improve things much, although all Nvidia cards saw some gains. More on DLSS 3 in a minute.RTX 4090 performanceantony leather\nHalo's multiplayer popularity has certainly been in the news, but the Campaign is just as rewarding, even if it lacks the wow-factor of the original Combat Evolved. It's a relatively easy game to achieve high frame rates in on a high-end GPU, but the RTX 4090 was again streaking out ahead of the field here.RTX 4090 performanceantony leather\n4K looked great and the RTX 4090 smashed the 100fps barrier again, getting close to double the frame rates of other cards.RTX 4090 performanceantony leather\nDLSS 3 testing\nNvidia provided beta access to several games that were DLSS 3 -enabled, albeit in fairly locked-down form. This works alongside DLSS 2/DLSS Super Resolution and for now is only compatible with RTX 40 series GPUs.\nDLSS 3 differs from its predecessor in that it generates entirely new frames using AI. This works independently of the usual graphics pipeline and also of the rest of the system, so it can boost frame rates even when the game is bottlenecked by the CPU.\nAs RTX 40-seires GPUs are needed to run DLSS 3, there's no way to run comparison numbers with older cards. The Flight Simulator beta - the key game I'd been hoping to test, didn't allow me to run my usual benchmark either and with review samples of other Nvidia cards having been returned before I got this far, I was sadly unable to add those into the mix. Still, the key comparisons are here - the improvements DLSS 3 can make.RTX 4090 performanceantony leather\nCyberpunk 2077 sees an enormous benefit here, with the settings I used resulting in four times the 99th percentile frame rate compared to no DLSS and nearly double that of DLSS 2 with little to no difference in image quality.RTX 4090 performanceantony leather\nFlight Simulator seemed to have DLSS either on or off, with DLSS being on equating to DLSS 3. It saw a massive improvement in frame rates and finally the game was regularly sticking well above 100fps and was silky smooth even at 4K. Once the game is updated to have DLSS 3 support as standard, I'll be returning to this test to grab results with the RTX 4090 with my own benchmark for more comparison numbers.\nThe power consumption, while high, wasn't exactly devastating. In fact, the RTX 4090 drew less power than the Palit RTX 3090 Ti GameRock I used for comparison. 600w is still a huge amount for a PC to draw in games, though, so 850W is certainly a bare minimum here as far as power supplies go and I'd highly recommend 1000W, especially if you do anything that sees high load on the GPU and CPU at the same time.\nConclusions\nValue is always of little concern when talking about Nvidia's flagship graphics cards, but it seems to be getting even less so with each new generation and higher prices. At $1600, the RTX 4090 is more than many people spend on their entire PC, indeed more than most spend on their CPU, GPU and motherboard too. However, there is still a market for cards like this for people that can afford it, otherwise Nvidia wouldn't produce them.The RTX 4090 has three DisplayPort outputs and one HDMI outputAntony Leather\nI still lament the loss days when flagship GPUs cost less than $600, but ultimately we're here to work out whether this monstrous graphics card is worth buying for anyone that has this kind of cash laying around. Ultimately, if money is of little consequence, the answer is yes.Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4090Antony Leather\nIt's hugely powerful and had a huge edge over previous generation cards in practically every situation. Even when it doesn't, for example in CPU or otherwise non GPU-limited games, DLSS 3 can potentially solve that issue too. There are down sides, though, aside from cost, such as as the huge size that will limit its case compatibility. You'll also need a powerful GPU and to avoid your PC looking like a mass of spaghetti, you'll likely want to opt for a PSU with a PCIe 5.0 power connector too.\nTHe RTX 4090 is a graphics card that the vast majority of us can only dream about owning, but that doesn't stop us lusting after super cars and hyper cars for the same reasons. It's also without doubt the new fastest graphics card on the planet, with a price to match of course.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Andrew Button   Thu, Oct 13, 2022, 4:00 a.m. 3 min read          In This Article:    NVDA        MU            5G chip   Written by Andrew Button at The Motley Fool Canada NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a stock that\u2019s seen better days. Down 61% for the year and 65% from its all-time highs, the stock is getting hit hard. Investors who bought NVIDIA many months ago will probably have to wait some time until they break even. But what about the investor of today?   If you\u2019re just looking at NVIDIA for the first time ever, then you\u2019re looking at a stock that\u2019s cheaper now than it has been in recent memory. Which is not to say it\u2019s actually cheap: NVIDIA still trades at 39 times earnings and 12.6 times book value \u2013 extremely expensive. However, it is less expensive than it was in the past, which may make it worth looking at. Chips out of favour The first thing you need to know about NVIDIA is that it\u2019s a chip stock. By \u201cchip\u201d, I mean computer processing units, specifically graphics cards. NVIDIA produces the high-powered graphics cards that gamers use to play high-powered games on PCs. It also provides chips for servers and data centers, and helps market laptops that use its chip sets. NVIDIA\u2019s business was massively in favour during the 2020/2021 tech bubble, and its stock rose in that period. The problem is that now it is out of favour. Every single one of the big chip stocks is down heavily for the year. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is down the least, at 46%! AMD, Intel, NVIDIA and Taiwan Semiconductor are all down more than 50%. Why all this bleeding? Because the kinds of products these companies sell are less in demand compared to last year. Computer sales are declining this year, so companies now have more chips than they need. As a result, they\u2019re buying fewer chips, leading to lower sales and price competition. Micron\u2019s guidance \u2013 not a good sign One bad sign for NVIDIA is Micron Technology\u2019s recent guidance. \u201cGuidance\u201d is the term for a company\u2019s forecast of how it will do in the next quarter. Companies usually release guidance along with their earnings. In its most recent quarterly release, Micron forecast that its revenue would decline 25% and earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) would barely be above $0. In fact, it forecast a range of possibilities for EPS, the lower end of which involves losing money! NVIDIA uses Micron to supply the memory used in its chips. If Micron is forecasting lower sales, then some of its clients are going to see their sales decline as well. Perhaps it\u2019s not NVIDIA that\u2019s buying fewer Micron chips, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on that. NVIDIA\u2019s most recent quarter saw revenue decline 19% compared to the previous quarter, so you could argue that the damage to NVDA is already occurring.   Story Continues   Foolish takeaway Having looked at all the different factors impacting NVIDIA stock this year, it\u2019s time to answer the question: Is it a buy? Unless you\u2019re a technology insider with deep insights on when the chip industry will recover, the answer is no. NVIDIA\u2019s performance is deteriorating and it has admitted that it will continue to deteriorate. Eventually, tech companies will ramp up their buying of chips, but nobody knows when that\u2019s going to happen. You probably don\u2019t want any more exposure to NVDA stock than what you\u2019d get in a broad market index fund.   The post Is Nvidia Stock a Buy Now? appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.

As spring sunshine warms the fields, Konen, 65, and other barley farmers worry tariffs will take away crucial export markets and increase the cost to grow the grains, even as sinking U.S. beer consumption has slashed demand for barley.  Roughly half of Konen's barley is destined for Mexico, where it will be turned into beer.   Reuters \u2022 8 hours ago            Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo. All rights reserved.

That's sky-high compared to other top-tier, fast-growing chip stocks. AMD\u00a0(NASDAQ: AMD), for instance, trades for 24 times earnings and 27 times EV to free cash flow. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) trades for just 10 times earnings and 20 times EV to free cash flow.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor many investors, Nvidia's current valuation means that the stock is still too expensive. What's more, the company is also facing a host of challenges that are contributing to its plunging share price.\nBut Nvidia is already making strides to address many of those troubles, as evidenced by its decision to offload an excess of gaming chip inventory last quarter on the cheap. So, the question remains: How expensive is Nvidia stock today?\u00a0\nContinue reading\nSource Fool.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike:\n 0\n\n\n\nNVDA\n\n\n\nShare\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheMotleyFool\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPrevious article\n\n\nWhy Pot Stocks Could Be Your Best Bear Market Buy\n\n \n13.10.22\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNext article\n \n\n\nWarner Bros.

Why now?\u00a0Blogs /  October 16, 2022 \n\n\nA Q&A on soup throwing on Van Gogh Sunflowers\nQ: On Friday 14 October, two young Just Stop Oil supporters entered the National Gallery and threw a tin of tomato soup over one of Europe\u2019s most famous and beloved paintings: Van Gogh\u2019s Sunflowers.\u00a0\nThe painting is unharmed \u2013\u00a0 the action was planned knowing it was properly protected. But there\u2019s still been a huge outcry with people asking: why attack art? Why go after something as precious as human creativity, culture and beauty?\u00a0\nA: Yes \u2013 art is precious. We share that love deeply. What we want to do is salvage a future where human creativity is still possible. We\u2019re terrifyingly close to losing that, so we have to break the rules. And that means pushing cultural buttons to provoke, challenge and shock. There\u2019s no other way.\u00a0\nThis action makes people confront what is a justified response to the threats we now face, what is sacred and what should we do to protect it.\nIt enables a conversation \u2013 you are outraged about this, where is your outrage of 33 million people in Pakistan losing their livlihoods, 1000 million crabs gone from our oceans, the fire service pushed to breaking point due to 40C heat. What should we protect, the conditions that allow humanity to make art, to be creative \u2013 or the masterpieces that will have no one to gaze on them.\nQ: This action came after 14 days of Just Stop Oil roadblocks around the capital. So why the sudden shift to an art action? Aren\u2019t Just Stop Oil supporters already pushing enough buttons by disrupting traffic around London?\nA: We had a choice to make. We could have relentlessly stuck to the roadblocks \u2013 hoping that by dint of sheer repetition our message would cut through. The Met Police, the Home Office \u2013 all these people were starting to talk about us and discuss what to do. Relentlessness is definitely a viable strategy. It\u2019s how Greta eventually got her message to land so powerfully.\u00a0\nBut we were still only hitting page eight or nine of the national press. We needed to switch things up and take the media by surprise. The art action was exactly the change of pace we needed. It shocked people as it was so unexpected.\u00a0\nMost of all, it shocked people as attacking art is a huge act of cultural transgression. It breaks a taboo. Art is sacred in our culture \u2013 to attack it feels almost blasphemous.\u00a0\nQ:\u00a0 But why attack what is sacred for people? Isn\u2019t that really hurtful and alienating?\nA:\u00a0 Actually, attacking what people really care about pushes them to ask hard questions. For example: do I really care more about a work of art than about the basic planetary support systems that make art possible in the first place? Does that make any sense? There\u2019s an apocalyptic, climate-driven famine in Somalia, which hasn\u2019t pushed me to say anything. But I\u2019m venting my anger now over a work of art in a gallery. Does any of this add up? What do I really value here?\nThese are hard questions but we\u2019re all asking them together of each other, and of ourselves. In fact, one of the biggest intended audiences for this action was allies \u2013 as well as adversaries! Our allies and supporters were fine with the idea of disrupting oil terminals and traffic, but many were still outraged by this action.\u00a0\nWhat we\u2019re trying to do is push them further \u2013 asking them to question their own comfort zone, and what they really feel the stakes are. If you claim to value art so highly, what are you doing to protect it?That\u2019s one of the big questions we want people to ask. Look at this tweet, from Professor Julia Steinberger: she\u2019s asking us exactly that \u2013\u00a0 to question whether we have our priorities right.\nQ: People have accused Just Stop Oil of being stupid and \u2018philistine\u2019 over this action, not really getting the true value of art. What would you say to this?\nA: Well, there\u2019s actually a long history of people (including artists themselves!) \u201cattacking\u201d art in galleries. Art is about communication and change, as well as contemplation and beauty. Van Gogh himself was a disruptor and a rebel. Art galleries aren\u2019t just places to admire pretty pictures: they should challenge our comfortable view of things. Especially at a time like this where staying in our comfort zone will lead to the destruction of everything we value.\nQ: The two supporters involved in the action were young people in their early 20s. Isn\u2019t Just Stop Oil exploiting them and ruining their future by putting them up to an action which has seen them held on remand?\nA: They stepped up to do this \u2013 after all, climate breakdown will wreak more havoc on their future than a police record. But with this kind of argument, you have to realise that no matter what your age or social class, hostile journalists will attack you for it. If you\u2019re an older person, you\u2019ll be attacked for being a privileged retiree. If you\u2019re working class, you\u2019ll be called \u2018knuckle-boned\u2019 (yes, this really happened to one of our spokespeople). If you\u2019re young, you\u2019ll be called vulnerable and exploited. There\u2019s no way around this one: hostile journalists will always find an angle to get at you.\u00a0\nQ: What about the argument that civil resistance is a numbers game \u2013 all about getting more and more people into action because \u2018they can\u2019t arrest all of us\u2019? If these kinds of actions drive people away from Just Stop Oil,isn\u2019t that counter-productive?\nA: You have to look at where people are. For some people who are put off by an action like this, it could be that they\u2019re not ready for what we are saying. Many people are still in a place where they want everything to be OK and to keep going as it is. Unconsciously many of us still hope someone else is going to come and sort it all out, so we don\u2019t have to go to these extremes.\nRecognising that\u2019s not the case is a hard step to take. No-one is coming to save us, so we need to push every cultural button we can to get our message through. And these buttons need to be as transgressive as possible, within the framework of non-violence, to get us to wake up and save ourselves.\nQ: Thank you and finally, if people are inspired, what should they do next?\u00a0\u00a0\nA: If you\u2019re new to Just Stop Oil, you can find out more about non-violent direct action (NVDA) at one of our regular on-line meetings. Or if you\u2019re already in a regional team, get yourself on an NVDA training day. We also need funds to keep our actions going, so\u00a0 if you can donate, fantastic.\nYou can also meet us every day, 11am, at Downing Street, to join our call for no new oil and gas. We won\u2019t give up until the madness stops.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\u2190 Previous PostNext Post \u2192\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Just Stop Oil\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook-f\n \n\n\n\nTwitter\n \n\n\n\nYoutube\n \n\n\n\nInstagram\n \n\n\n\nTiktok\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on social media. \n\n\n\nAbout us \n\n\n\nJust Stop Oil is a nonviolent civil resistance group in the UK.

Civil resistance works.Our new demand: That the UK Government sign up to a Fossil Fuel Treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030.Our governments must work together to establish a legally binding treaty to stop extracting and burning oil, gas and coal by 2030 as well as supporting and financing other countries to make a fast, fair, and just transition.This can be accomplished by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative and seeking a negotiating mandate to establish the treaty.FAQs\u00a0 \u00a0| \u00a0\u00a0Research \n\n\n\nContact us \n\n\n\nPress enquiries: juststopoilpress@protonmail.comGeneral enquiries: info@juststopoil.orgDonation enquiries: juststopoilgiving@protonmail.comVolunteer enquiries: gettinginvolvedjso@protonmail.comBook a speaker: contact@juststopoil.org \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAttribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International LicenceJust Stop Oil Privacy Policy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHome\nMeetings & Events\nResearch\nAbout Us\n\nMenu Toggle\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nNews\n\nMenu Toggle\n\n\n\n\n\nPress Releases\n\n\nCourt & Prison\n\n\nBlogs\n\n\nVideo\n\n\nScience Updates\n\n\n \n\nDonateDonate \n\n\n\n\nSearch for:\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

These include Newegg (US) and LaptopsDirect (UK). Both retailers have listed down the 16 GB variant as we know that the RTX 4080 12 GB variant had been \"unlaunched\" just a few weeks back. So that's going to make it easy for consumers to distinguish the card rather than trying to differentiate the two similarly named cards with a huge disparity in performance.\nRelated Story NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDPStarting with the Newegg listings, we have the PNY XLR8 Gaming VERTO GeForce RTX 4080 cards that come in both non-OC and OC flavors. These models are listed for a starting price of $1199.99 US for the non-OC variant while the OC variant should retail for slightly higher. Both cards have been listed but there's no pre-order link and users will be able to make their purchases on the 16th of November.\n\nPNY GeForce RTX 4080 XLR8 VERTO - $1199.99 US (Newegg)\nPNY GeForce RTX 4080 XLR8 VERTO OC - TBD (Newegg)\n\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4080 16 GB graphics card listed at Newegg US.\nUK retailer, LaptopsDirect, lists down three Palit GeForce RTX 4080 graphics cards in GameRock and OmniBlack custom flavors. The prices start at 1449 Pounds and go up to 1529 Pounds. The pricing of the cheapest model converts to $1682 US which is a 40% premium over the MSRP by NVIDIA. There are two reasons why the pricing is so high, first of all, this is a preliminary listing & second, the UK retailers also include VAT which is around 22% for the region. So that should be enough to explain the higher pricing.\n\nPalit GeForce RTX 4080 GameRock OC - 1529.97 Pounds\nPalit GeForce RTX 4080 GameRock - 1499.97 Pounds\nPalit GeForce RTX 4080 OmniBlack - 1449.97 Pounds\n\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4080 16 GB graphics card listed at LaptopsDirect UK. (Image Credits: Videocardz)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 16 GB 'Official' Specifications\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 16 GB graphics card is expected to utilize a cut-down AD103-300 GPU configuration with 9,728 cores or 76 SMs enabled of the total 84 units whereas the previous configuration offered 80 SMs or 10,240 cores. While the full GPU comes packed with 64 MB of L2 cache and up to 224 ROPs, the RTX 4080 might end up with 48 MB of L2 cache and lower ROPs too due to its cut-down design. The card is expected to be based on the PG136/139-SKU360 PCB. The graphics card is said to offer a peak clock rate of 2505 MHz.\n\nAs for memory specs, the GeForce RTX 4080 is expected to rock 16 GB GDDR6X capacities that are said to be adjusted at 22.5 Gbps speeds across a 256-bit bus interface. This will provide up to 720 GB/s of bandwidth. This is still a tad bit slower than the 760 GB/s bandwidth offered by the RTX 3080 since it comes with a 320-bit interface but a lowly 10 GB capacity. To compensate for the lower bandwidth, NVIDIA could be integrating a next-gen memory compression suite to make up for the 256-bit interface.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 16 GB \"Official\" TBP - 320W\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 12 GB \"Official\" TBP - 350W\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series Official Specs:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 DNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAda Lovelace AD102-300Ada Lovelace AD102-250Ada Lovelace AD103-300Ada Lovelace AD104-400Ada Lovelace AD104-250Ada Lovelace AD106-350Ada Lovelace AD107-400\n\n\nProcess NodeTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4N\n\n\nDie Size608mm2608mm2378.6mm2294.5mm2294.5mm2190.0mm2146.0mm2\n\n\nTransistors76 Billion76 Billion45.9 Billion35.8 Billion35.8 Billion22.9 BillionTBD\n\n\nCUDA Cores163841459297287680588843523072\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs512 / 176TBD320 / 112240 / 80184 / 64136 / 48TBD\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores512 / 128456 / 128304 / 76240 / 60184 / 46136 / 34TBD\n\n\nL2 Cache72 MB72 MB64 MB48 MB36 MB32 MB24 MB\n\n\nBase Clock2230 MHz2280 MHz2210 MHz2310 MHz1920 MHz2310 MHz1830 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock2520 MHz2520 MHz2510 MHz2610 MHz2475 MHz2535 MHz2460 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute83 TFLOPsTBD49 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs29 TFLOPs22 TFLOPs15 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPs191 TFLOPsTBD113 TFLOPs82 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs51 TFLOPs35 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPs1321 TOPsTBD780 TOPs641 TOPs466 TOPs353 TOPs242 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity24 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X16 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X8-16 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus384-bit384-bit256-bit192-bit192-bit128-bit128-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed21.0 Gbps21.0 Gbps23.0 Gbps21.0 Gbps21.0 Gbps18.0 Gbps17.0 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth1008 GB/s1008 GB/s736 GB/s504 GB/s504 GB/s288 GB/s\n(554 GB/s Effective)272 GB/s\n(453 GB/s Effective)\n\n\nTBP450W425W320W285W200W160-165W115W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$1599 US / 1949 EU12,999 RMB (China-Only)$1199 US / 1469 EU$799 US$599 US$399-$499 US$299 US\n\n\nPrice (Current)$1599 US / 1859 EU12,999 RMB (China-Only)$1199 US / 1399 EU$799 US$599 US$399-$499 US$299 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)12th October 202228th December 202316th November 20225th January 202313th April 202324th May / 18th July 202329th June 2023\n\n\n\n\nNews Source: Videocardz\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs;

Yes, DLSS 3 is the real deal. And no, neither of those make the RTX 4090 good value for money, even if it makes a compelling argument for Nvidia's latest upscaling tech.\r\n\n\n\r\nThe Zotac Gaming GeForce RTX 4090 Amp Extreme Airo model that I\u2019ve used for testing costs \u00a31960 / $1700; both substantial premiums, especially in the UK, on the already lofty RTX 4090 base RRP/MSRP of \u00a31679 / $1599. To many, if not most PC owners, that ALL probably looks like unfathomable riches. Especially with the fastest Nvidia GPUs of the last generation, the RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti, now going for less than \u00a31100 and \u00a31200 respectively.\r\n\n\n\n\nCd Projekt Red Are Making A New Witcher Trilogy, A Sequel To Cyberpunk 2077 & More\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\nZotac Gaming GeForce RTX 4090 Amp Extreme Airo specs:\n\nCUDA Cores: 16,384\nBase Clock Speed: 2235MHz\nBoost Clock Speed: 2580MHz\nVRAM: 24GB GDDR6X\nPower: 450W\nRecommended System Power: 1000W\nPrice: \u00a31960 / $1700 (RTX 4090 starts at \u00a31679 / $1599) \n\n\r\nAnd for your better-part-of-two-grand, you get a graphics card that may not even fit in your PC's mid-tower case. The RTX 4090 Amp Extreme Airo, at 355.5mm long and 165.5mm wide, followed in the steps of the Zotac RTX 3090 Ti I reviewed by only squeezing into my test PC\u2019s NZXT H510 chassis after I removed the AIO cooler and fans \u2013 leaving the latter spinning outside the case like a Dead Space environmental hazard. Even if that weren't necessary, the honking great circuit board and triple-fan cooler are so wide that trying to reinstall the case's glass side panel would have half-crushed the PSU cable adapter on the edge. The adapter that needs no fewer than four 8-pin power cables to fuel the card, which has the same mahoosive 450W consumption rating as the stock RTX 4090.\r\n\n\r\nIt's a high-maintenance component, then, though at least the specs are appropriately monstrous. The RTX 4090 packs in 16,384 CUDA cores, over 6,600 more than the next-best RTX 4080 16GB. It also overkills the VRAM even harder, with 24GB of 384-bit GDDR6X, and on this model, Zotac has upped the boost clock speed from 2520MHz to 2580MHz. A small overclock, but then remember that the RTX 3090 Ti has about 5,600 fewer CUDA cores, and only boosted them to 1860MHz at stock.\r\n\r\n\n\n \nThis is dumb. Do not do this.\n\nThen there are the less listable specs, like the underlying upgrades that form the RTX 40 series\u2019s Ada Lovelace architecture. All RTX 40 GPUs get these, not just the RTX 4090, but with redesigned RT cores and Tensor cores promising enhanced ray tracing performance and improved DLSS performance, it\u2019s clear that Nvidia doesn\u2019t just want faster framerates in traditional rasterised games. The graphics megacorp is also taking its AI machine learning further than ever with DLSS 3, a distinct new upscaler that can pump out bigger FPS boosts than previous DLSS versions could ever hope for. In specific, supported games, of course.\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 review: 4K performance\n\r\nMore on that to come, but first, here\u2019s the core performance lowdown on the RTX 4090\u2019s favourite resolution.\r\n\nThe RPS test PC:\n\nCPU: Intel Core i5-11600K\nRAM: 16GB Corsair Vengeance LPX\nMotherboard: Asus TUF Gaming Z590-Plus WiFi\nPSU: Corsair RM850x\n\n\r\nThanks to the higher-end GPUs in the RTX 30 and AMD Radeon RX 6000 series, you already have a range of graphics card options for hitting 60fps at 4K without sacrificing much in terms of settings quality. Even so, the RTX 4090 represents a truly generational leap, averaging 100fps or above in all but a couple of our rasterised (non-ray traced) benchmarks. And even where it didn\u2019t, it still put in record-setting scores, like 79fps in Cyberpunk 2077 and 84fps in Watch Dogs Legion.\r\n\n\r\nThe latter is 14fps higher than what the RTX 3090 Ti managed, which might disappoint given the price difference. But the RTX 4090 stomped all over the Ampere GPU elsewhere, especially in the demanding Total War: Three Kingdoms Battle benchmark. On Ultra quality, the RTX 4090 cruised to 100fps, a 40fps advantage over the RTX 3090 Ti. That should please anyone who owns one of the best 4K gaming monitors with a 120Hz or 144Hz refresh rate.\r\n\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider also saw a big jump, from 75fps on the RTX 3090 Ti (on the Highest preset with SMAA x4 anti-aliasing) to 125fps on the RTX 4090. That\u2019s a 67% improvement! Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla also got a respectable boost from 73fps to 100fps, while Horizon Zero Dawn climbed from 98fps to 127fps on Ultimate quality.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nAgain, you\u2019ll need to have splurged on a 4K display with a heightened refresh rate to see these differences, but they're wide enough to be visible. As is the case with Final Fantasy XV, especially if you switch on the full set of Nvidia-exclusive bonuses like HairWorks and TurfEffects. With these added to the Highest preset, the RTX 4090 averaged 88fps, comfortably out-smoothing the RTX 3090 Ti and its 61fps result. Without these features, the RTX 4090 averaged 108fps, beating the RTX 3090 Ti\u2019s 89fps by a similar proportion.\r\n\n\nMetro Exodus was another big win for the RTX 4090, with it turning out 107fps on Ultra quality; 24fps faster than the RTX 3090 Ti. Hitman 3\u2019s Dubai benchmark also had the RTX 4090 racking up a blazing 174fps average on Ultra quality, though since the RTX 3090 Ti scored 135fps in the same settings, you\u2019d need a 240Hz monitor and eagle eyes to tell the difference there.\r\n\n\r\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that in Forza Horizon 4, both GPUs actually scored evenly: 159fps apiece. That suggests that the two cards were in fact bumping up against the limits of the test PC\u2019s Core i5-11600K CPU, so between that and the game being four years old at this point, I\u2019m probably going to phase it out of our benchmarking regimen in favour of Forza Horizon 5. I don\u2019t have RTX 3090 Ti results for that but the RTX 4090 did average 111fps on the Extreme preset, so it\u2019s evidently still capable of liquid smooth framerates even with the sequel's tougher technical demands.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nAda Lovelace\u2019s ray tracing optimisations \u2013 which also include a new \u201cShader Execution Reordering\u201d feature that lets RTX 40 GPUs crunch the numbers on RT rendering more efficiently \u2013 do indeed bear fruits as well. Take Metro Exodus: with both the Ultra preset and Ultra-quality ray tracing, the RTX 4090 averaged 80fps, or a 25% drop from its non-RT performance. The Ampere-based RTX 3090 Ti? That dropped from 83fps  to 53fps with RT, a 36% loss. So not only is the RTX 4090 much faster with ray traced effects in a straight FPS race, but these fancy visual upgrades also levy a proportionally lower tax on overall performance.\r\n\n\r\nThe same was true in Watch Dogs Legion, where adding Ultra-quality RT effects dropped the RTX 4090 from 84fps to 58fps and the RTX 3090 Ti from 70fps to 39fps. That\u2019s a 31% reduction for the newer GPU, and a 44% reduction for the older one. \r\n\n\r\nI won\u2019t say Nvidia have completely cracked ray tracing \u2013 we\u2019ll have to wait for more affordable RTX 40 cards to see if that\u2019s really true \u2013 but their success in cutting down its FPS cost is encouraging.\r\n\n\r\nI wish I could be similarly impressed by the supposed DLSS improvements, but weirdly, the RTX 4090 actually seems to lack affinity with older versions like DLSS 2.0, 2.3 and 2.4. Some tests still produced good results, like Shadow of the Tomb Raider: with DLSS on its highest \u2018Quality\u2019 setting, I could turn on Ultra ray tracing and still get a faster 137fps average than with RT-less, native 4K. But on several occasions, the gains from upscaling were unexpectedly tiny. Metro Exodus, with ray tracing on, only got a single lousy frame per second with DLSS in the mix, and Horizon Zero Dawn\u2019s Quality DLSS setting only produced a scant 8fps boost up to 135fps. That 58fps in ray-traced Watch Dogs Legion also rose just slightly, to 63fps, after the addition of Quality DLSS. In all three cases, DLSS made proportionally higher FPS gains on the RTX 3090 Ti.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nThis is less of a problem when the same games run drastically faster at native resolution, which gives them enough of a lead that the RTX 3090 Ti can\u2019t catch up even with the power of upscaling. DLSS 3, as we\u2019ll see shortly, also works a hell of a lot better \u2013 and you can\u2019t get that on any GPUs outside of the RTX 40 series. Still, I wonder if the lower rendering demands of DLSS (combined with the GPU's already fearsome strength) might be proving too much for the Core i5-11600K to handle - even if it's not the RTX 4090's fault, it's not ideal to get bottlenecked by a gaming-focused, usually very capable CPU that's barely two years old.\r\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 review: 1440p performance\n\r\nDropping the resolution to 2560x1440 presents another performance oddity. 1440p isn\u2019t exactly where the RTX 4090 sees itself in five years, but then why is it sometimes slower than the RTX 3090 Ti at this res? 163fps in Forza Horizon 4 isn\u2019t just merely 4fps faster than it was at 4K, but it\u2019s 16fps slower than the RTX 3090 Ti managed with the same Ultra settings. Final Fantasy XV was off as well, averaging 111fps with the vanilla Highets setting and 84fps with all the extra Nvidia settings enabled. That's 9fps and 3fps behind the RTX 3090 Ti respectively, with both  results only 3-4fps higher than at 4K.\r\n\n\r\nWith 88fps in Watch Dogs Legion, 115fps in Metro Exodus, and 177fps in Hitman 3, the RTX 4090 continued to finish below the RTX 3090 Ti at 1440p. Its 147fps in Horizon Zero Dawn also only beat the last-gen GPU by an invisible 5fps, and a 136fps result in Total War: Three Kingdoms\u2019 Battle benchmark puts it just 16fps ahead. Still technically an improvement, then, but nothing like the 40fps gain that the RTX 4090 provides at 4K.\r\n\n\r\nOf all the games I tested, only two \u2013 Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla \u2013 really showed a big uptick in 1440p performance. That includes SoTR with Ultra-quality ray tracing: with this engaged alongside SMAA x1, the RTX 4090\u2019s 145fps easily outran the RTX 3090 Ti\u2019s 128fps. Over in Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, 1440p on the Ultra High preset allowed for the RTX 4090 to reach a 130fps average. On 144Hz monitors, that will look even slicker than the RTX 3090 Ti\u2019s 103fps. \r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nNot that these make up for the RTX 4090 struggling with 1440p elsewhere. I've tried rebooting, reinstalling, verifying caches, measuring thermals, monitoring power usage and more to ascertain if this was an outright technical problem, all to no avail. That leaves CPU bottlenecking as the most likely cause, but then if that was the deciding factor, why could the RTX 3090 Ti sometimes shift more frames on the same Core i5-11600K? \r\n\n\r\n(Side note: the RTX 4090 does need a lot of power, but at least on this Zotac model, that energy usage doesn\u2019t result in excessive heat. During benchmarking, GPU temperatures generally stayed between 50\u00b0c and 60\u00b0c, with couple of very brief peaks at 70\u00b0c.)\r\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 review: DLSS 3\n\r\nMysteries aside, what could make it more tempting to splash out is this card\u2019s DLSS 3 support. I intend to put together a more detailed guide to this in the future, as right now it\u2019s only test-ready in a handful of software, but what I\u2019ve seen of DLSS 3 in Cyberpunk 2077 is mightily convincing. \r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nHere\u2019s how DLSS 3 works: in addition to rendering frames at a lower resolution then upscaling them, just as older DLSS versions do to enhance performance, DLSS 3 has the graphics card insert completely new, AI-generated frames in between the traditionally rendered ones. These new frames \u2013 generated, interpolated, fake, whatever you want to call them \u2013 are still subject to the excellent AI-based anti-aliasing that DLSS includes, and provide an even greater FPS boost to what the upscaling process delivers by itself.\r\n\n\r\nAnd what a boost it is. Running at 4K, with maxed-out High/Ultra settings and Psycho-quality ray tracing, Cyberpunk 2077 only averaged 39fps on the RTX 4090 without any upscaling. But with DLSS 3, on its highest Quality setting and with frame generation enabled, that shot up to 99fps. That\u2019s 153% faster, and by dropping DLSS 3\u2019s upscaling quality to Performance mode, it becomes a 223% improvement. That\u2019s incredible stuff. I also tried old-timey DLSS 2.4 before updating Cyberpunk 2077 to its DLSS 3-supporting version, and got 67fps with its Quality mode - good, but nothing on DLSS 3, particularly if you\u2019ve got a faster monitor to take advantage of.\r\n\n\r\nThe 'fake' frames usually look surprisingly accurate, too. My main experience with AI art is comprised of scrolling past anatomically abominable JPGs on Twitter, but DLSS 3 does a reasonable job at drawing data from surrounding, \u2018real\u2019 frames to generate its own. Here\u2019s a fake frame from some Cyberpunk 2077  footage I recorded, along with the traditionally rendered frame that immediately followed it:\r\n\n\n\n \n3840x2160, High textures, Psycho RT, DLSS 3 Quality, AI generated frame\n\n\n\n \n3840x2160, High textures, Psycho RT, DLSS 3 Quality, rendered frame\n\n\r\nHaving trouble playing spot the difference? Here\u2019s both of them zoomed in using Nvidia ICAT:\r\n\n\n\n \nLeft: generated frame. Right: rendered frame\n\n\r\nYep, only thing wrong in this AI-generated scene is the occasional bit of mushy UI. And to stress, this tiny imperfection is as bad as it gets when there are no sudden changes or camera cuts. Most fake frames look even more like the real thing, and since so many frames are appearing per second, it's essentially impossible to spot little differences like this when the game is in motion.\nHell, it's hard to spot when there are big differences. The frame generation's weakness is sudden transitions: when the on-screen image is completely different to the previous frame. This generated frame, for instance, came immediately after I changed the driving camera position:\n\n\n \n3840x2160, High textures, Psycho RT, DLSS 3 Quality, AI generated frame\n\nMuch worse, right? The algorithm is getting properly confused due to the lack of data from similar-looking frames nearby. But again, this is one frame out of dozens upon dozens per second, and DLSS 3 quickly can quickly self-right itself after analysing just one traditionally rendered frame. The result is that this blurry mess becomes as nigh-invisible as the minor UI hiccups. I was actively looking for this exact kind of flaw when I recorded the frame, and it went by so quickly that I didn't register it until watching and pausing the footage later. It's fine, honestly.\nThere is one actual drawback, in that frame generation inflicts a higher input lag increase than 'standard' DLSS. You also don't feel the AI-added frames in the sense of control smoothness - it's a purely visual upgrade - so I can\u2019t see it catching on with twitchy shooters. Cyberpunk at 100fps-plus does look grand, but to me, aiming and driving felt closer to how it would at 60fps.\nStill, I don't think that's a ruinous problem for DLSS 3. Games like your Counter-Strikes and your Valorants and your Apex Legendseses are built to run smoothly on much lower-end GPUs, so something like an RTX 4090 would provide more than enough frames without the need for upscaling in the first place. And every game with DLSS 3 support also has Nvidia Reflex built in, and its whole purpose is to reduce system latency - so the lag is, at least, kept under control. And  Cyberpunk felt smooth enough to me - mouse and keyboard controls that feel 60fps-ish are hardly sluggish, and remember that other, less demanding games will produce more 'real' frames, so will seem even smoother.\n\r\nOverall, it's a good start for DLSS 3, and anyone who remembers DLSS 1.0 will know to expect further performance and clarity improvements in the future. Really, it's a compelling enough feature that it could make an RTX 40 GPU seem like a much sounder investment, all by itself. Only a few dozen games are confirmed to support it so far, but that number is bound to rise, just like how DLSS originally launched with just a couple of compatible games before finding its way into over 200. \r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nAs for the RTX 4090 specifically, I can at least see the point of it. I couldn\u2019t do the same with the RTX 3090 Ti: when that GPU launched, it was majorly more expensive than the RTX 3090 despite being only slightly faster. Although the RTX 4090 makes even wilder demands of your finances, it\u2019s also a significantly better 4K card, regularly surpassing 100fps on max-quality rasterised performance and 60fps with ray tracing. Add DLSS 3, and it\u2019s the truly imposing PC conqueror that the RTX 3090 Ti never was. \r\n\n\r\nAnd yet\u2026 how much? For a GPU that gets confused and upset running at resolutions below 4K, and seems to have trouble with older DLSS versions unless it's paired with  similarly bleeding-edge CPU? There might be a tiny core of enthusiasts hungry for the best performance at any cost, but for everyone else, the RTX 4090's barriers to entry will rule it out as a serious upgrade option.\r\n\n\r\nTo my fellow members of the great un-rich, though, all is not lost. The most appealing thing here is clearly DLSS 3, and although it\u2019s the preserve of the RTX 4090 and two RTX 4080 variants for now, more affordable RTX 40 GPUs are surely on the way. Give it a few months and you should be able to enjoy the best part of the RTX 4090\u2019s architecture without needing to sell your bone marrow to afford it.\r\n\r\n\n\nTo see this content please enable targeting cookies.\n\nManage cookie settings\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor.

Plus, just because a gaming machine doesn't boast the ridiculous might of an RTX 3080 Ti doesn't mean an RTX 3060 can't hold its own. In fact, you'll find the latter comes with an affordable price tag. \n\nBut the power of an RTX GPU is all for naught if a gaming laptop can't match its strength. As part of Laptop Live, Laptop Mag's week-long celebration of all things tech, we're bringing you the best gaming laptops with Nvidia GeForce RTX GPU power.\u00a0What are the best Nvidia GeForce RTX gaming laptops?For superb performance, a dazzling 16-inch display is a sleek form factor, and the might of an RTX 3070 Ti GPU, the Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 (2022) is the best all-round Nvidia GeForce RTX gaming laptop.

Today we're about to find out all you need to know about this next generation graphics card \u2013 most importantly its gaming performance.\nThe new GeForce RTX 4090 is baked on the AD102 silicon which measures 608.4 mm2, about 3% smaller than the GA102 used by the RTX 3080 and 3090. Nvidia has moved from the Samsung 8N process with Ampere to TSMC's 4N process for Ada Lovelace. Quite incredibly, this has seen transistor count increase by 170% from 28.3 billion to an insane 76.3 billion.\n\nWhen compared to the RTX 3090 Ti, there's 52% more streaming multiprocessors, CUDA cores, Tensor cores and RT cores and texture units. The ROP count has increased by 57% and the boost clock has been wound up by 35%. The same 21 Gbps GDDR6X memory is in use and there's still 24GB of it on a 384-bit wide memory bus, resulting in the same 1008 GB/s of memory bandwidth. The GPU also keeps the same the PCI Express 4.0 x16 interface.\nNvidia claims a total graphics power rating of 450 watts for the RTX 4090, the same rating given to the 3090 Ti, though the maximum GPU temperature has been slightly downgraded from 93C to 90C. The minimum power supply requirement is 850 watts, which is what we'll be using for all of our testing.\n\n\nIn terms of design, the Founders Edition 4090 looks similar to the 3090 with some fairly significant changes. The most noticeable is the graphics card's width. On paper, Nvidia claims a triple-slot form factor for both models which is accurate, but where the 3090 measures 52mm wide, the new RTX 4090 is 17% wider at 61mm. Despite the size increase, both models weigh about the same at 2190 grams.\nThat's surprising, but what's not all that surprising is the absence of the NVLink connector which Nvidia has now killed off and will instead rely on the PCIe 4.0 bus. The only other major change is the 16-pin power input which has been upgraded to the PCIe 5.0 spec, otherwise known as the super catch 12VHPWR power connector.\nA single PCIe 5.0 power connector can deliver up to 600 watts, whereas previously that would require four 8-pin power connectors. You won't require a new PCIe 5.0 compliant PSU though as the RTX 4090 comes with a 4x 8-pin to single 16-pin adapter, similar to the 3x 8-pin to 16-pin adapter supplied with 3090 Tis.\n\n\nWe should note that it was falsely reported that the 12VHPWR power connector could only survive 30 cycles (30 connect and disconnects), but that's not the case and the connector longevity will be similar to that of the 8-pin connectors, which is to say you're never going to wear one out.\nBesides the increase in cores, inclusion of 4th-gen tensor cores and 3rd-gen RT cores, GeForce 40 also introduces DLSS 3, a feature that for now is exclusive to the GeForce 40 series.\n\nThis new upscaling/frame rate multiplying technology is exciting and while we'll briefly show some results in this review, our full analysis of DLSS 3 is coming up soon. DLSS 3 requires a significant amount of testing and analysis which is far beyond the scope of a day-one review.\nFor testing, all GPUs were set to run at the official clock specifications (no factory overclocking), the CPU powering the test system is the Ryzen 7 5800X3D with 32GB of dual-rank, dual-channel DDR4-3200 CL14 memory on the MSI MPG X570S Carbon Max WiFi motherboard.\nBenchmarks\nStarting with Watch Dogs: Legion at 1440p, the GeForce RTX 4090 doesn't look that impressive here (...wait for it). Sure, it's the fastest GPU we've ever seen but a 9% boost over the 6950 XT is hardly awe-inspiring.\nWe saw a more substantial 22% uplift over the RTX 3090 Ti, but given today's GPU prices that's not amazing. Having said that, the issue appears to be less with the RTX 4090 and more with the 5800X3D which has become the primary system bottleneck...\n\n\nTherefore when increasing the resolution to 4K we get to see how brutally fast the RTX 4090 really is. We're now looking at a monstrous 60% boost over the 6950 XT and a 64% uplift from the RTX 3090 Ti, that's unbelievable and a truly high refresh rate experience at 4K.\n\n\nIt appears as though we have a lot more CPU headroom in Rainbow Six Extraction at 1440p and so the RTX 4090 is 59% faster than the RTX 3090 Ti and 71% faster than the RTX 3090 and 6950 XT. This is a serious performance uplift.\nJumping up to 4K didn't change the results radically as we weren't CPU limited at 1440p. The RTX 4090 was once again ~60% faster than the 3090 Ti, though the margin against the Radeon 6950 XT kept growing and now we're looking at a 102% deficit here for AMD. That's brutal to say the least.\n\n\nFar Cry 6 tends to like Radeon GPUs and at 1440p we're heavily CPU limited, so the RTX 4090 was only able to push forward by a 9% margin, rendering 187 fps on average over the 6950 XT, though the 1% lows were boosted by 13%.\nJumping up to 4K unleashes the RTX 4090, resulting in massive gains and averaging an impressive 164 fps. That's a 34% uplift from the 6950 XT, very much a commanding lead.\nThe jump up from the RTX 3090 Ti was more sizable as we're looking at a 50% boost and almost 60% over the standard 3090.\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla is another title that works well with Radeon and the excellent support for Resizable BAR certainly helps the red team. As a result, at 1440p the RTX 4090 was 27% faster than the 6950 XT which is a decent gain but far less stunning than other margins we've seen so far.\nIt was also just a 37% improvement from the 3090 Ti and not the typical 60% margin we see at 4K.\nSpeaking of which, at 4K the RTX 4090 rendered 116 fps on average making it 33% faster than the 6950 XT and 38% faster than the 3090 Ti.\n\n\nHunt: Showdown fans going after ultimate performance will love what the RTX 4090 has to offer. Serving up over 300 fps at 1440p with 1% lows of over 260 fps.\nThat's a massive 62% increase from the 3090 Ti, 67% from the standard 3090 and a 71% increase over AMD's 6950 XT. The RTX 4090 is super fast again, even at 1440p where we've often run into CPU limitations with the 5800X3D.\nUnexpectedly, the margins shrink at 4K and the RTX 4090 is 50% faster than the 3090 Ti and 62% faster than the 3090. The margin to the 6950 XT remained the same at 70%. Those are big margins and it means that those wanting to play Hunt Showdown at 4K will receive a high refresh rate experience without reservation with the RTX 4090.\n\n\nThe Outer Worlds saw a 55% performance increase for the RTX 4090 over the 3090 Ti at 1440p and a mega 71% increase over the 6950 XT. Not sure you need 268 fps in The Outer Worlds, but it's now possible using the highest quality preset at 1440p.\nThe 4K results are just as impressive, even if the gap to the 3090 Ti has shrunk slightly to 51%. That's because we're now able to receive a truly high refresh rate experience at 4K when using the RTX 4090, whereas most other GPUs struggle to hit 100 fps.\n\n\nHitman 3 results at 1440p are clearly CPU limited, we often use this title for CPU testing as it is very demanding on the processor. When compared to the RTX 3090 Ti we're looking at a small 7% uplift, so this will be a good configuration for testing CPUs such as Zen 4 and Intel's Raptor Lake.\nMoving to 4K shows the expected boost as the RTX 4090 pulls ahead of the 3090 Ti by a massive 60% margin, while pulling a similar margin on the 6950 XT.\n\n\nMoving on to Horizon Zero Dawn, we find another game where the CPU becomes a bottleneck at 1440p and we're using the highest visual quality preset. About 212 fps is the limit of the 5800X3D when running the new RTX 4090, which is a 20% increase from the 6950 XT and 31% from the 3090 Ti.\n4K is required to better demonstrate the power of the RTX 4090 and here the new GeForce GPU was good for 157 fps on average, or 54% faster than the 3090 Ti and 67% over the 6950 XT.\n\n\nWe haven't upgraded our GPU data to F1 22, so for now let's stick with F1 2021 numbers which are based on the maximum quality preset with the default level of ray tracing enabled. Here the GeForce RTX 4090 pumped out 245 fps making it almost 60% faster than the 3090 Ti and 76% faster than the 6950 XT. A mega result at 1440p.\nJumping up to 4K extended the margin as the GeForce RTX 4090 delivered 71% more frames than the 3090 Ti, and an insane 104% more than the 6950 XT. AMD's weak RT performance will be letting down the Radeon GPU no doubt.\n\n\nWe know that Cyberpunk 2077 is both CPU and GPU demanding, but with the RTX 4090 installed we're almost certainly CPU bound at 1440p. Here the RTX 4090 was good for 145 fps on average, making it 33% faster than the 6950 XT and 36% faster than the 3090 Ti.\nThe margins seen at 4K are not as extreme as we were expecting, but a 51% improvement over the 3090 Ti is nothing to scoff at, especially given the RTX 4090 pushed well past 60 fps while all other GPUs fell short of that target.\n\n\nIn Dying Light 2, the RTX 4090 was 51% faster than the 6950 XT at 1440p and a massive 68% faster than the 3090 Ti. Another incredible generational jump there. And it's much the same story at 4K, 49% faster than the 6950 XT and 58% faster than the 3090 Ti.\n\n\nHalo Infinite shows fairly typical gains at 1440p: 52% faster than the RTX 3090 Ti and 60% faster than the 6950 XT.\nAt 4K those margins are extended to 72% faster than the 3090 Ti, and 86% faster than the 6950 XT, which is an extraordinary performance leap over previous generation flagships.\n\n\nIn Shadow of the Tomb Raider for our Zen 4 CPU testing we found this game was GPU limited at 1080p with the RTX 3090 Ti. Moving to the RTX 4090 we see that this will no longer be an issue as this cranked out an insane 237 fps at 1440p, using the highest quality preset.\nThat's a 55% boost over the 6950 XT and a 59% increase over the 3090 Ti.\nSpeaking of jaw dropping results, at 4K the RTX 4090 is an incredible 70% faster than the RTX 3090 Ti and 84% faster than the 6950 XT. Pumping out 160 fps at 4K is pretty amazing, more so when you consider previous-gen GPUs couldn't even reach 100 fps.\nPerformance Summary: 13 Game Average\nHere's a look at the 13 game average which is calculated using the geomean. The GeForce RTX 4090 pumped out 219 fps making it on average 44% faster than the 6950 XT and 45% faster than the 3090 Ti.\nThose are huge margins but still under-represent the RTX 4090 as the 5800X3D (a pretty fast gaming CPU) was limiting performance on multiple occasions.\n\nIt's crazy to think that one of the fastest gaming CPUs out there can be a serious bottleneck for the RTX 4090 at 1440p, and in many cases we're using the highest visual settings for testing.\nWe may finally be reaching the point where ray tracing becomes truly viable, and we'll look at that in a moment. Before we do, here's the 4K data...\n\nThe GeForce RTX 4090 is on average 59% faster than the RTX 3090 Ti and 71% faster than the 6950 XT at 4K gaming. Those are massive margins. Just as impressive is the fact that the RTX 4090 averaged 145 fps at 4K. This is truly the first 4K GPU capable of delivering a high refresh rate gaming experience. Very impressive stuff by Nvidia.\n\nWe haven't touched on 1080p results for the 13 games tested, though we did gather all that data even if the results were often heavily CPU limited. Overall, the RTX 4090 was 28% faster than the 3090 Ti at 1080p using the Ryzen 7 5800X3D and 24% faster than the 6950 XT, so it's still faster and if anything, a great tool for testing next-gen CPU performance.\nRay Tracing Performance + DLSS\nFor ray tracing and upscaling results we'll start with F1 22. At 1440p, the RTX 4090 was just 11% faster than the 3090 Ti and 24% faster than the 6950 XT, when comparing standard rasterization performance (ultra high quality preset but with RT effects disabled).\nWith RT + DLSS enabled the RTX 4090 was 17% faster than the 3090 Ti and 29% faster than the 6950 XT which was using FSR for upscaling.\n\n\nThen with just RT enabled with no upscaling involved, the RTX 4090 was 78% faster than the 3090 Ti and 167% faster than the 6950 XT. In short, while the 6950 XT was able to deliver playable performance with more than 60 fps, the RTX 4090 provided a true high refresh rate experience.\nThe RTX 4090 also affords you the ability to enjoy max visual quality at 4K with RT enabled. Comparing the standard rasterized results, the 4090 was 61% faster than the 3090 Ti, and then 86% faster with RT and DLSS enabled, and a breathtaking 91% faster with just RT and no DLSS.\nGoing from 54 fps with the 3090 Ti to 103 fps for the RTX 4090 is amazing. That's also over 3x the performance you'll get with the Radeon 6950 XT.\n\n\nIn Watch Dogs: Legion we see a fairly small margin between the 6950 XT and RTX 4090 at 1440p data due to a CPU bottleneck. This game doesn't support FSR and therefore the 6950 XT lacks upscaling support, so we've just tested two RT modes.\nComparing the RTX 3090 Ti and RTX 4090 sees no difference in performance using DLSS with RT enabled. The DLSS bottleneck appears to be 109 fps in this title. Interestingly, the RTX 4090 doesn't even require DLSS as it produced the same performance with ultra quality ray traced effects enabled, making it 33% faster than the 3090 Ti and 91% faster than the 6950 XT.\nAs expected, we get a better picture of how powerful the RTX 4090 is at 4K. This time using DLSS with ray tracing saw a 43% boost for the 4090 over the 3090 Ti, and then with upscaling disabled the 4090 was 68% faster, and 155% faster than the 6950 XT.\n\n\nPlaying Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy at 1440p we find another game where DLSS does very little for the already mighty impressive RTX 4090. As a result, when comparing the ray tracing ultra quality + DLSS results between the 3090 Ti and 4090, the new Ada Lovelace GPU was just 13% faster. However, if we ditch the upscaling we see that the 4090 is 47% faster.\nAt 4K we see bigger margins and this time DLSS is of benefit for the RTX 4090, pushing it ahead of the 3090 Ti by a 54% margin and 131% faster than the 6950 XT using FSR. With no upscaling but RT ultra enabled, the RTX 4090 is 58% faster than the 3090 Ti and 88% faster than the Radeon 6950 XT.\n\n\nRay tracing performance in Dying Light 2 is quite brutal, especially without the aid of DLSS. For example, at 1440p the 3090 Ti is only good for 52 fps on average, though that can be bumped up to 86 fps using the DLSS quality mode. Still that means when using DLSS with RT enabled the 4090 was 98% faster than the 3090 Ti and a huge 117% faster without the aid of upscaling.\nThe 4K data is just as impressive, We're not sure why but the 3090 Ti does poorly using the 'Ray Tracing Quality' preset in Dying Light 2, but with the RT settings turned off. So what should be standard rasterization performance using DX12 sees the 3090 delivering 122% greater performance, again we're sure why that is. Even with DLSS enabled, the RTX 4090 was 110% faster and then 115% faster with upscaling disabled.\n\n\nIn Cyberpunk 2077 at 1440p, the RTX 4090 with RT effects disabled was 36% faster than the 3090 Ti. That margin remains with RT Ultra + DLSS quality enabled, but blows out to a massive 69% margin when using RT without DLSS.\nThen at 4K the RTX 4090 crushes the RTX 3090 Ti delivering 72% greater performance with RT and DLSS enabled and 80% with just ray tracing enabled, though we're only looking at 45 fps on average.\nDLSS 3.0 on Cyberpunk\nCyberpunk is one of the first games to support DLSS 3, and here's a look at that performance. Please note we are currently preparing a detailed analysis of DLSS 3, which we'll feature on TechSpot very soon.\n\nAt 1440p using the high quality preset, the RTX 4090 was good for 145 fps on average in Cyberpunk 2077, making it ~35% faster than both the 3090 Ti and 6950 XT. However, with DLSS 3 enabled, performance was boosted by 90% to 276 fps. With limited testing involved, the game felt smooth, but of course we'll see what we can dig up in our later testing.\n\nThe real advantage of DLSS 3.0 can be seen with ultra quality ray tracing enabled as here the RTX 4090 was good for 191 fps on average, making it almost 70% faster than DLSS 2. Then at 4K, the GeForce RTX 4090 pumped out 113 fps using DLSS 3 with ultra RT effects, a 43% boost over DLSS 2.\nPower Consumption\nWe measured total system power consumption when playing Halo at 1440p and as you can see the RTX 4090 actually isn't that bad. In fact, it's very good delivering 50% more performance than the RX 3090 Ti while using less power. Both the RTX 4090 and 3090 Ti are 450w graphics cards, so technically they should consume about the same amount of power.\n\nThe possible reason the RTX 3090 Ti can be seen pushing total system usage about 50 watts higher is because there's no Founders Edition of the 3090 Ti, instead we're using an MSI card which uses above spec voltage. Although we've clocked it down to the official Nvidia spec, which shaves a few percent off in terms of performance, the higher voltage means power consumption is still higher than it'd be for a base model.\nThe key takeaway here is that the RTX 4090 is a 450w product, so power consumption isn't anything we haven't seen before from flagship graphics cards.\nHere's a look at just how power efficient the RTX 4090 is, by locking the frame rate at 90 fps we can see how much power each GPU uses.\n\nAt this frame rate, the RTX 4090 consumed just 215 watts, and that means for the same level of performance the 3090 Ti required 93% more power and the 6950 XT 40% more power. So despite all the talk of the RTX 4090 being an out of control beast, it's actually very impressive when it comes to efficiency.\nCooling\nNow when it comes to cooling, the Founders Edition RTX 4090 peaked at 83C for the hot spot after an hour of load in a 21C room installed inside an ATX case with the doors closed. The average GPU temperature peaked at 72C and the memory temperature peaked at 84C, so all those temperatures are acceptable, especially given the low operating volume.\n\nWith a fan speed of just 1600 RPM, the operating volume was just 42 dBA, which is quieter than most high-end and even mid-range graphics cards we've tested in the past. During this test, the core clock speed held pretty steady at 2730 MHz, of course, the memory ran at 21 Gbps, and finally the GPU power draw averaged 415 watts.\nOverclocking\nWe did try some overclocking and were able to push the 4090 Founders Edition cores up to 2895 MHz, for a fairly typical 6% boost, and the memory hit 24.5 Gbps. This increased the GPU power to 470 watts on average which is a 13% increase, though the fan speed didn't change much, but the hotspot temperature did climb to 88C (a 5C increase) and the memory also jumped up by 4C.\n\n\nPerformance when overclocking resulted in a fairly mild 7% boost in Hitman, taking the RTX 4090 from 182 fps up to 194 fps. It's a similar story in Watch Dogs Legion, where the overclocked 4090 was 6% faster going from 141 fps to 150 fps and we also saw a 6% boost in Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nNothing crazy to report on here and as you'd expect from a product like the RTX 4090, it's pushed pretty hard out of the box already.\nCost per Frame (MSRP)\nFor our cost per frame analysis, we'll start with the 1440p data using the suggested pricing for each GPU. Do note some of this performance is skewed due to the CPU bottlenecking at this mainstream gaming resolution. Using the $1,600 MSRP, the RTX 4090 looks very good though for such an expensive piece of hardware...\n\nIn terms of cost per frame, it's roughly on par with the Radeon 6950 XT and 6900 XT, but over 30% more costly than what we believed to be the sensible options for previous-gen high-end GPUs in the RTX 3080 and 6800 XT \u2013 actually it's ~50% more expensive than the 6800 XT.\n\nThe 4K cost per frame is more favorable and here the RTX 4090 appears far better value than the Radeon 6950 XT and 6900 XT, offering ~15% greater value. It remains 16% more costly per frame when compared to the RTX 3080 and 21% more costly than the 6800 XT.\nConsidering the card does have 24 GB of VRAM, when compared to the RTX 3090 we're looking at significantly better value with a saving of 38% per frame.\nCost per Frame (Retail)\nNow looking beyond MSRPs and focusing on current retail pricing (Newegg listings), the RTX 4090 is less attractive. Using the 1440p performance data we see that it's slightly worse than the 3090 Ti in terms of value, making it the most expensive GPU on the market in terms of cost per frame and overall price...\n\nThe 4K data better represents the GeForce RTX 4090 though, but even here we see that at $1,600 it's slightly more costly than the 6950 XT, though slightly better than the heavily discounted RTX 3090, so that's pretty good for a premium class product.\n\nYou're looking at a 21% premium in terms of price to performance over the RTX 3080, which isn't great, but we're comparing a brand new product to a two-year-old GPUs that's now selling below MSRP. So while a valid comparison for those of you looking to buy right now, older products are almost always going to represent better value.\nWhat We Learned\nThe GeForce RTX 4090 is very fast, brutally fast. A key concern people seemed to have with the RTX 4090 was pricing and power consumption. It's clear now though that the rumors of insane power consumption were wrong, the 4090 isn't absurd in that sense, using less power than the 3090 Ti in our testing.\nIt's still a very hungry GPU, but it's nothing we haven't seen before from flagship products and given the exceptionally high performance, the performance per watt you're getting with the RTX 4090 is incredibly good. We saw that we when capped frame rates and the RTX 4090 consumed almost 50% less power than the 3090 Ti and almost 30% less than the 6950 XT when gaming.\nThe GeForce RTX 4090 is very fast, brutally fast.\n\nThat leaves the issue of pricing, and that's not an easy one to get around. Based on the 4K data using MSRPs, the RTX 4090 is 16% more costly per frame than the RTX 3080, which isn't far off the margin seen in a previous generation when comparing the RTX 3090 and 2080. That means the new RTX 4090 is similar in terms of value to the 3090, which wasn't a great value, but when looking strictly at ultra high-end GPU pricing, the RTX 4090 isn't terrible.\nFor people with deep pockets who buy premium-priced GPUs, that's a win. Of course, what made Ampere great in our eyes was the GeForce RTX 3080, but the crypto boom spoiled all that fun. So now the hope is the GeForce RTX 4080 represents better value at a more accessible price point for most gamers, and that's something we'll explore at a later date.\nUntil more RTX 40 Ada Lovelace GPUs arrive \u2013 and of course, competing AMD RDNA3 GPUs \u2013 it's hard to say just how good, bad or dumb the value of the RTX 4090 is for this new generation.\n\nMoving past cost per frame or any kind of value analysis to just look at the RTX 4090 for what it is: a brutally fast GPU, how excited should extreme gamers be?\nWe're honestly very excited about the RTX 4090. It's the first time we've enjoyed a true high refresh rate gaming at 4K without having to compromise on visuals. Ray tracing is finally a carefree option, and while DLSS is still important, enjoying games like Dying Light 2, Cyberpunk 2077 and Watch Dogs Legion at 4K with ultra quality ray tracing, while frame rates stay well above 60 fps is a special experience.\nDLSS 3 is an exciting new feature but we'll need to delve more into it before we can comment on that further and how much of a selling point it is.\n\nBottom line, the gaming experience with the GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition is breathtaking, and surprisingly practical as well. We were able to run it just fine with our old Corsair RM850x 850w PSU using the included adapter. The FE model running under full load for extended periods of time is very quiet, no louder than a quality mid-range graphics card, and as we've said power consumption wasn't outrageous.\nThat's not to say the RTX 4090 is for everyone. It cannot be at $1,600, but we won't discourage those who plan on buying an RTX 4090 from doing so. There's clearly a market for these extreme high-end GPUs, and if enough people are willing to part with that kind of money for the RTX 4090, then this segment will continue to exist. By the way, based on what we're hearing you shouldn't have too much trouble buying a 4090, should you decide to go that way, stock is apparently plentiful.\nFor everybody else (and me personally), I can enjoy gaming just as much with a GPU that costs 2x or 4x less, and if you're in that camp, you should wait to see what kind of performance is on offer by the GeForce RTX 4080, and of course, AMD's upcoming RDNA 3 series.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4080 on Amazon (soon)\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 5 7600X on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 7 7700X on Amazon\n\nFurther Testing\nSince we published this day-one review of the GeForce RTX 4090, we have run additional benchmarks and comparisons you may be interested in:\n\nGeForce RTX 4090 vs. Radeon 7900 XTX: Is the Premium Worth It?\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Desktop vs. Laptop GPU\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 104\n\n\n Got something to say?

However, given the vast disparity in performance between the 16 GB and 12 GB models, NVIDIA decided to cancel the 12 GB variant while keeping the 16 GB variant on track for a 16th November launch.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSGiven how close this cancellation occurred to the launch, AIBs definitely received a batch of the Ada AD104 GPUs to prepare their custom models and we know from our own sources that these cards were definitely ready to ship out to retailers and distributors. Now despite the cancellation, gaming and synthetic benchmarks from these samples are starting to leak out.\n\nThere are no details such as the model number for this specific GeForce RTX 4080 12 GB graphics card but it does feature a max GPU clock as high as 2820 MHz and consumes 262W of power. The GPU was able to deliver a peak FP32 compute power of 42 TFLOPs in the AIDA64 GPGPU test. We cannot say for sure if these are reference or overclocked specs but the card wasn't going to launch in FE variants anyways and since we are talking custom model, it is likely to be a factory overclock.\n\n\nFP32 Compute Horsepower Comparisons (Higher is Better)\n\nCompute Power\n\n\n04080120160200240\n\n\n\n\n\n04080120160200240\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090 OC\n\n101\n\n\nRTX 4090 Stock\n\n83\n\n\nRTX 4080 12 GB\n\n42\n\n\nRTX 3090 Ti\n\n40\n\n\nRX 6900 XTX\n\n25\n\n\nXbox Series X\n\n12\n\n\nPlayStation 5\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nAs for other synthetic benchmarks, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 12 GB graphics card scored 5382 points in 3DMark Speed Way, 10794 points in 3DMark Time Spy Extreme, 13472 points in 3DMark Fire Strike Ultra, and 66.98 FPS in the DXR Feature Test.\n\n\n3DMark Speed Way\n\nScore\n\n\n04000800012000160002000024000\n\n\n\n\n\n04000800012000160002000024000\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090 OC\n\n10.7k\n\n\nRTX 4090\n\n10.2k\n\n\nRTX 3090 Ti\n\n6.7k\n\n\nRTX 3090\n\n6.2k\n\n\nRTX 4080 12 GB\n\n5.4k\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3DMark Firestrike Ultra Graphics\n\nScore\n\n\n050001000015000200002500030000\n\n\n\n\n\n050001000015000200002500030000\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090 OC\n\n26.5k\n\n\nRTX 4090\n\n24.9k\n\n\nRX 6950 XT\n\n14.9k\n\n\nRX 6900 XT\n\n13.6k\n\n\nRX 6800 XT\n\n13.5k\n\n\nRTX 4080 12 GB\n\n12.8k\n\n\nRTX 3090 Ti\n\n12.8k\n\n\nRTX 3090\n\n12.5k\n\n\nRTX 3080 Ti\n\n12.1k\n\n\nRX 6800\n\n10.5k\n\n\nRTX 3080 12 GB\n\n10.5k\n\n\nRTX 3080 10 GB\n\n10.1k\n\n\nRTX 2080 Ti\n\n8k\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3DMark Time Spy Extreme Graphics\n\nScore\n\n\n050001000015000200002500030000\n\n\n\n\n\n050001000015000200002500030000\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090 OC\n\n20.4k\n\n\nRTX 4090\n\n19.2k\n\n\nRTX 3090 Ti\n\n11.2k\n\n\nRTX 4080 12 GB\n\n10.8k\n\n\nRTX 3090\n\n10.1k\n\n\nRTX 3080 Ti\n\n9.8k\n\n\nRX 6950 XT\n\n9.4k\n\n\nRX 6900 XT\n\n9.3k\n\n\nRTX 3080 12 GB\n\n9.1k\n\n\nRTX 3080 10 GB\n\n8.9k\n\n\nRX 6800 XT\n\n8.6k\n\n\nRX 6800\n\n7.2k\n\n\nRTX 2080 Ti\n\n6.6k\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's also the Cyberpunk 2077 in-game benchmark which was tested at 4K with Ray Tracing enabled. The GPU scored an average of 67.52 FPS.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 12 GB 'Official' Specifications (Now Cancelled)\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 will also feature a 12 GB variant that is expected to utilize the AD104-400 GPU configuration with 7,680 cores or 60\u00a0 SMs enabled which is the full-fat SKU. The GPU will be packing 48 MB of L2 cache and features a 192-bit bus interface so that's why we are getting up to 12 GB of GDDR6X capacities. The memory is said to be running at 21 Gbps speeds for a memory bandwidth of 504 GB/s. The card is said to be clocked at a 2610 MHz boost clock however the peak frequency will be higher.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 12 GB \"Official\" TBP - 285W\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 10 GB \"Official\" TBP - 320W\n\nFor power, the TBP is now set to be rated at 285W which is a 35W decrease versus the RTX 3080 10 GB model. The card is expected to offer better performance than the RTX 3080 but given the specs cut over the 4080 16 GB, there will be a big gap between both models. The maximum BIOS TGP is said to be rated at 366W.\nThe huge performance gap between the RTX 4080 16 GB and RTX 4080 12 GB was made evident when NVIDIA published its own gaming benchmarks showing us both native & DLSS performance numbers. As per the benchmarks, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 12 GB graphics card was around 11% slower than the RTX 3090 Ti in gaming and you can also see in the synthetic benchmarks that the card is barely on par with the RTX 3090 Ti while costing $900 US. So the RTX 4080 12 GB had to be canceled and now we can expect a new card to take its place and offer better value to gamers.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series Official Specs:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 DNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAda Lovelace AD102-300Ada Lovelace AD102-250Ada Lovelace AD103-300Ada Lovelace AD104-400Ada Lovelace AD104-250Ada Lovelace AD106-350Ada Lovelace AD107-400\n\n\nProcess NodeTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4N\n\n\nDie Size608mm2608mm2378.6mm2294.5mm2294.5mm2190.0mm2146.0mm2\n\n\nTransistors76 Billion76 Billion45.9 Billion35.8 Billion35.8 Billion22.9 BillionTBD\n\n\nCUDA Cores163841459297287680588843523072\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs512 / 176TBD320 / 112240 / 80184 / 64136 / 48TBD\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores512 / 128456 / 128304 / 76240 / 60184 / 46136 / 34TBD\n\n\nL2 Cache72 MB72 MB64 MB48 MB36 MB32 MB24 MB\n\n\nBase Clock2230 MHz2280 MHz2210 MHz2310 MHz1920 MHz2310 MHz1830 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock2520 MHz2520 MHz2510 MHz2610 MHz2475 MHz2535 MHz2460 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute83 TFLOPsTBD49 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs29 TFLOPs22 TFLOPs15 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPs191 TFLOPsTBD113 TFLOPs82 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs51 TFLOPs35 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPs1321 TOPsTBD780 TOPs641 TOPs466 TOPs353 TOPs242 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity24 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X16 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X8-16 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus384-bit384-bit256-bit192-bit192-bit128-bit128-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed21.0 Gbps21.0 Gbps23.0 Gbps21.0 Gbps21.0 Gbps18.0 Gbps17.0 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth1008 GB/s1008 GB/s736 GB/s504 GB/s504 GB/s288 GB/s\n(554 GB/s Effective)272 GB/s\n(453 GB/s Effective)\n\n\nTBP450W425W320W285W200W160-165W115W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$1599 US / 1949 EU12,999 RMB (China-Only)$1199 US / 1469 EU$799 US$599 US$399-$499 US$299 US\n\n\nPrice (Current)$1599 US / 1859 EU12,999 RMB (China-Only)$1199 US / 1399 EU$799 US$599 US$399-$499 US$299 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)12th October 202228th December 202316th November 20225th January 202313th April 202324th May / 18th July 202329th June 2023\n\n\n\n\nNews Source: Olrak\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n129\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n92\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n59\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales;

We expect a centralized approach to the powerful processors that will be needed to manage the data flowing from the various sensors, and running machine learning (ML) models for safe automated driving.NVIDIA and Qualcomm have pivoted their business to address the automotive opportunity as the traditional car is becoming an extension of computers and smartphones. Both companies are working to exploit autonomous driving and the in-vehicle experience. As the car becomes more intelligent, these two areas have the highest growth opportunities.NVIDIA recently held its GTC event and Qualcomm an investor day focusing on its automotive business. In this blog, we will look at key announcements from both players in relation to autonomous driving and the digital cockpit.NVIDIA GTC 2022From September 19 to September 22, 2022, NVIDIA held its bi-annual event called GTC, where it announced a new SoC \u2013 Drive Thor \u2013 which will replace Drive Orin. Earlier, at GTC 2021, NVIDIA unveiled its plan for Drive Atlan SoC to target 2025 models and replace Drive Orin. But Atlan appears to have been scrapped. So, Thor will be ready for vehicles arriving in 2025. The Thor processor is packed with high-power computing to support the idea of having a single chip to handle autonomous driving and cockpit functions. To put this into perspective, Thor can handle 2,000 trillion operations per second (TOPS), which is twice the speed of Atlan and eight times the speed of the current Orin processor. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0NVIDIA DRIVE SoC RoadmapNVIDIA has already announced its first partnership for Drive Thor with Chinese car company Zeekr. Thor will be first used in an EV model from Zeekr in 2025. Currently, the Drive Orin chip is used in models including the Li Auto L9, Nio ET7 and the recently launched Xpeng G9.Qualcomm Automotive Investor DayQualcomm held its first-ever Automotive Investor Day in New York immediately after the conclusion of NVIDIA\u2019s GTC. Qualcomm, whose automotive business is flourishing thanks to its connectivity and digital cockpit solutions, has seen the majority of the design wins since the launch of its Snapdragon Digital Chassis. During the event, the company introduced the Snapdragon Ride Flex SoC portfolio, which Nakul Duggal, Qualcomm's Senior Vice President and General Manager of Automotive, called the \u201cindustry\u2019s first super-compute class SoC portfolio\u201d. This will be a family of chips that helps Qualcomm to scale down from high tier to entry tier. The software architecture of the chips will be Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) compliant. The company has not revealed much information on the Flex SoC, but the graphics displayed during the event show that the Flex SoC will have around 2,000 TOPS of computing power to handle operations like the cockpit, driver assistance, automated driving, and connectivity functions. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Snapdragon Ride Flex Soc Family \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Central Compute Scalable ArchitectureAnother announcement that underscores Qualcomm\u2019s strong position in digital cockpit solutions is that starting in 2023, Mercedes-Benz\u2019s in-vehicle infotainment (MBUX) will be powered by a Snapdragon chip.\u00a0 Currently, Mercedes\u2019 S-class MBUX is powered by NVIDIA chips. In the last 10 months, 20 models have been launched with Qualcomm\u2019s digital cockpit solutions.

Qualcomm integrates all these services under one umbrella term called Snapdragon Digital Chassis. NVIDIA, on the other hand, offers solutions for the cockpit and autonomous driving but does not have a portfolio in connectivity. Hence, the battleground for the two semiconductor companies is autonomous driving and smart cabin features. NVIDIA calls its offerings for the automotive industry DRIVE.FinancialsIn the second quarter of the fiscal year 2023 (FY23), NVIDIA\u2019s automotive segment had the best quarter with revenue of $220 million, an increase of 59% QoQ and 45% YoY. FY20 saw the highest ever automotive revenue of $700 million, achieved due to the success of the Tegra processor, which once powered Tesla\u2019s infotainment (media control unit) and instrument cluster. The automotive business has already reached the $358-million mark in the first half of FY23. With more models, like the Polestar 3 and Volvo EX90, driven by Orin chip ready to be launched this year, it is likely to cross $700 million by the end of FY23. During the Q2 earnings call, the company described Q2 FY23 as the inflection point for its automotive revenue. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0NVIDIA Automotive Quarterly RevenueQualcomm also recorded its highest ever automotive revenue in the third quarter of FY22 by reaching the $350-million mark. The automotive revenue is mainly driven by connectivity and an increase in demand for its digital cockpit products. This year, Qualcomm launched 20 new models with a digital cockpit. The future growth in the automotive business will be mainly driven by the digital cockpit. From FY26, the company is expecting its ADAS/AD services to scale up and experience a ramp-up starting in 2026. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Qualcomm Automotive Quarterly RevenueQualcomm is expecting to finish FY22 with $1.3 billion in automotive revenue, up from $975 million in FY21. At present, the cumulative automotive revenue for FY22 stands at $945 million. Qualcomm is realizing the segment\u2019s growth potential with the current and future product roadmap. As a result, the company has increased its targets for FY26 from $3.5 billion to $4 billion. For FY31, it has revised its forecast revenue from $8 billion to more than $9 billion. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Revenue ForecastDesign-win pipelineNVIDIA announced that its design-win pipeline had reached over $11 billion (in FY23) for the next six years from over $8 billion in FY22 due to the traction earned by the Drive Orin SoC.

As the automobile industry is moving towards more advanced driving systems and highly automated driving, most of the design wins are coming from ADAS/AD, followed by the digital cockpit. With over 50+ customers for the digital cockpit, ADAS/AD has not been able to mark its presence or gain traction from car companies or robotaxis like NVIDIA, barring a few customers like BMW, Stellantis, VW, Renault and Great Wall Motor. Qualcomm will announce the design win for the new Flex SoC at CES 2023. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Snapdragon Ride Design-Win \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Qualcomm Automotive PartnershipsConclusionNVIDIA has enjoyed early success with its chips like Parker (1 TOPS) and Xavier (30 TOPS), required to perform Level 2 and 2+ functions. The Xavier SoC can be seen on models like the Xpeng P7 and IM L7. NVIDIA, known for its high-power computing chips for gaming and data centers, leverages its technology to introduce high-power computing chips like Orin and now Thor. Due to the legacy of its GPU, AI chips and the availability of a high-power computing platform to support autonomous driving, it has generated interest from car manufacturers, robotaxi companies and self-driving truck companies like Kodiak.Compared to its competitor, Qualcomm entered the ADAS/AD market late. During CES 2020, the company entered the self-driving market by unveiling its Snapdragon Ride Platform. The platform ranges from 30 TOPS for Level 1/2 functions to 700 TOPS for Level 4/5 applications. GM is the first company to use Snapdragon Ride for its hands-free assisted driving. The Ultra Cruise will be powered by two Snapdragon SA8540P SoCs and one SA9000 AI. The platform will be making its debut in the Chinese market in October as Great Wall Motor will start selling its Mocca DHT-PHEV LiDAR variant fitted with Snapdragon Ride. So far, Qualcomm has managed wins with few OEMs and has not been able to win any robotaxi or self-driving truck customers. With its latest announcement of Flex SoC, which will directly compete with Drive Thor, we expect Qualcomm to remedy this gap.Both companies are adopting a similar approach of taking all their technologies and integrating them into a single chip to make it a central computing hub for the vehicle. However, the major difference is that NVIDIA is at the top of its game when it comes to advanced computing, while Qualcomm brings in a more integrated solution, from connectivity to cockpit to ADAS/AD, to get closer to NVIDIA in terms of compute capabilities but at relatively very low power. We believe that extreme low-power high computations with a very scalable architecture for battery-powered devices is Qualcomm\u2019s biggest advantage over NVIDIA which has helped the company attract a design win pipeline almost triple of NVIDIA, as power efficiency for future EV-based vehicles is going to be the key.It would be great to hear more about the power-versus-performance metrics which Qualcomm can achieve against NVIDIA in the months running up to CES 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nCategory\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs \n\n\nPublished\nOct 4, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam Counterpoint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                                                Counterpoint research is a young and fast growing research firm covering analysis of the tech industry.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has posted its first official performance numbers for its GeForce RTX 4080 12GB and GeForce RTX 4080 16GB graphics cards. The version with 16GB of memory appears to be 21% \u2013 30% faster than its 12GB counterpart. Meanwhile, Nvidia's previous generation flagship GeForce RTX 3090 Ti is still faster than the GeForce RTX 4080 12GB \u2014 at least without any DLSS enabled.\u00a0Nvidia compared its latest\u00a0GeForce RTX 40-series\u00a0graphics cards (including the flagship\u00a0GeForce RTX 4090) against each other and against its previous-generation GeForce RTX 30-series products in\u00a0Microsoft Flight Simulator,\u00a0A Plague Tale: Requiem, and\u00a0F1 22.\u00a0The comparison focused primarily on performance advantages provided by the company's latest DLSS 3 technology (with optical multi frame generation, resolution upscaling, and Nvidia Reflex), but the Nvidia also included performance numbers without any enhancements. Furthermore, it included its first official GeForce RTX 4080 12GB and GeForce RTX 4080 16GB performance comparison.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)Traditionally, Microsoft's\u00a0Flight Simulator\u00a0games are tough on both CPUs and GPUs and the latest version is no exception. Both DLSS 2 and DLSS 3 bring significant performance uplift to the game, but so does Nvidia's new Ada Lovelace GPU architecture (perhaps courtesy of enhanced ray tracing performance).\u00a0With DLSS 3 on, the GeForce RTX 4080 16GB is 21% faster than the GeForce RTX 4080 12GB; without DLSS 3 the 16GB version is 26% faster than the 12GB. The GeForce RTX 4080 12GB offers the same performance as the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti 24GB without DLSS 3 \u2014 not bad at all, and this is still one of the\u00a0best\u00a0gaming\u00a0graphics cards\u00a0today.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)For some reason Nvidia decided to test\u00a0A Plague Tale: Requiem\u00a0without enabling ray tracing, but with DLSS technologies enabled. DLSS 3 brings even more tangible performance enhancements than DLSS 2, so all GeForce RTX 40-series boards are substantially faster than their predecessors.\u00a0In this test, the GeForce RTX 4080 16GB is 21% faster than the GeForce RTX 4080 12GB with DLSS 3 enabled, and is 30% faster with DLSS 3 disabled. Meanwhile, the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti is 19% faster than the GeForce RTX 4080 12GB without DLSS enabled. Also, the new GeForce RTX 4080 12GB is only 4 frames per second (fps), or about 12%, faster than the original GeForce RTX 3080 in this test.\u00a0Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.(Image credit: Nvidia)In\u00a0F1 22\u00a0you want to get all the framerates you can possibly have, so both DLSS 2 and DLSS 3 are helpful. The new version is somewhat more efficient with its optical multi frame generation, and Ada Lovelace boards are clearly faster than Ampere boards in this title.\u00a0With DLSS 3 enabled, the GeForce RTX 4080 16GB is 27% faster than its 12GB sibling, and is 24% faster without DLSS 3 enabled. Also, the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti turns out to be 7% faster than the GeForce RTX 4080 12GB without DLSS enabled. Still, the GeForce RTX 4080 12GB is consistently faster than the original GeForce RTX 3080.\u00a0While Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4080 12GB and GeForce RTX 4080 16GB carry the same model number, they are based on completely different graphics processors (AD104 vs. AD103) and feature different CUDA core counts (7680 vs. 9728). When combined with distinctive memory bandwidth (504 GB/s vs. 717 GB/s), the two models offer very different performance levels than you would typically expect from graphics boards carrying the same model number.\u00a0For an easier comparison, we've combined the relative performance differences between Nvidia's latest desktop GPUs into a table.Performance of GeForce RTX 40 and GeForce 30-Series Graphics Cards (without DLSS)Swipe to scroll horizontallyRow 0 - Cell 0 GeForce RTX 4080 12GBGeForce RTX 4080 16GBGeForce RTX 3090 Ti 24GBGeForce RTX 4090 24GBMS Flight Simulator100%126%101%142%A Plague Tale: Requiem100%130%119%251%F1 22100%124%107%172%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce RTX 3090\nAda Lovelace\nGeForce RTX 4080\nGeForce RTX 4090\nBenchmark\nGeForce\nrtx\nray tracing\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (37)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

This is on the premise that the elephant in the room, the 4090 ti, is 15%+ more powerful than the 4090. I support my conclusion by comparing die sizing with the 3000 series equivalents and the performance disparity between the 4080 16gb and the 4090. The 4080 12gb comes in at 295 mm\u00b2 and the 3060 is at 276 mm\u00b2, the 4080 16gb comes in at 379 mm\u00b2 and the 3060 ti / 3070 is at 392 mm\u00b2, the 4090 is a 608 mm\u00b2 chip while the 3080 ti / 3090 / 3090 ti is at 628 mm\u00b2. There is plenty of room for a 4080 ti card and a 4090 ti card.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhelper800\n\n\n-Fran- said:Hm... I'll nitpick this, sorry: \"DLSS3 doubles the performance\". No...

Now we get similar tier parts for 700+ dollars. Its like Moores law has infected not only the performance, but the price too.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-Fran-\n\n\nhelper800 said:Seems we have already been conditioned to pay double for similar tier parts of 7+ years ago. gone are the days of getting a XX70 tier part like the 970 or 1070 for less than 400 dollars.

Its like Moores law has infected not only the performance, but the price too.Well, in regards to the specific bit of Moore's Law: Intel was very explicit in telling nVidia/Jensen to STFU with that, no?\n\nAnd this is not their first rodeo with the die naming/size and card naming relative to pricing tiers. They know they can get away with it.\n\nI think it was Gordon from PCWorld* that said it best: \"as long as you keep buying these at those price points, whining won't do diddily squat\". And he's absolutely right. It appears to me there's plenty of people with enough money to just accept these price hikes like nothing, as nVidia keeps doing it, so... Not sure what else to say or do here.

See, the previous-generation 8-pin connectors were no longer enough to satiate the GPU\u2019s hunger. Once cards started getting into the hands of users, surprisingly, we began seeing pictures of melted 12VHPWR plugs and sockets online \u2014 specifically, involving ATX 8-pin GPU power to 12VHPWR adapters that NVIDIA provided with their cards.\nNow, [Igor Wallossek] of igor\u2019sLAB proposes a theory about what\u2019s going on, with convincing teardown pictures to back it up. After an unscheduled release of plastic-scented magic smoke, one of the NVIDIA-provided connectors was destructively disassembled. Turned out that these connectors weren\u2019t crimped like we\u2019re used to, but instead, the connectors had flat metal pads meant for wires to solder on. For power-carrying connectors, there are good reasons this isn\u2019t the norm. That said, you can make it work, but chances are not in favor of this specific one.\nThe metal pads in question seem to be far too thin and structurally unsound, as one can readily spot, their cross-section is dwarfed by the cross-section of cables soldered to them. This would create a segment of increased resistance and heat loss, exacerbated by any flexing of the thick and unwieldy cabling. Due to the metal being so thin, the stress points seem quite flimsy, as one of the metal pads straight up broke off during disassembly of the connector.\nIf this theory is true, the situation is a blunder to blame on NVIDIA. On the upside, the 12VHPWR standard itself seems to be viable, as there are examples of PSUs with native 12HPWR connections that don\u2019t exhibit this problem. It seems, gamers with top-of-the-line GPUs can now empathize with the problems that we hackers have been seeing in very cheap 3D printers.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted in computer hacks, NewsTagged 12VHPWR, crimp connectors, NVIDIA, overheating \n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\u2190\u00a0Gesture Controlled Filming Gear Works Super IntuitivelyThis Week In Security: IOS, OpenSSL, And SQLite\u00a0\u2192 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            57 thoughts on \u201cNVIDIA Power Cables Are Melting, This May Be Why\u201d        \n\n\n\n\n\nwibble says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 28, 2022 at 4:02 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nexasperated, eh? !\n\n\nReport comment \nReply \n\n\n\n\n\nArya Voronova says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 28, 2022 at 4:07 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nouch, in my draft too!

Sure, they should have paid more attention to the cables they got from their supplier before putting them in the box.  However, I tend to think the bulk of the fail is with Nvidia\u2019s supplier for selling them a poorly designed product.\nI tend to agree with Jayztwocents on this, they should have just added another 8pin to it to make the connection bigger to handle the higher load. Not smaller.  That\u2019s more on pci-sig though.  I hope NVIDIA issues replacement cables for the issue which are at least properly wired like Jay showed from CableMod.  Do we need a better solution than just adding a 3rd 8pin? Certainly. No doubt Molex and Foxconn probably already have a suitable connector on the market.  Either way though, it needs more conductor, not less.\n\n\nReport comment \nReply \n\n\n\n\n\nWill says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 28, 2022 at 9:20 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nExactly.

Even if it is from some other manufacturer, how do they squeeze nearly twice the current capacity out of the same sized terminals?\n\n\nReport comment \nReply \n\n\n\n\n\nDennis says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 28, 2022 at 6:03 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nAh, someone on Reddit pointed out the connector is Amphenol Minitek Pwr3.0 High Current Connector: https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/yc9mzc/comment/itm5qng/ . It sounds like they use a different copper alloy that can carry higher current (and maybe slightly different electromechanical design in the terminals) to get to that current rating.\nBut Amphenol\u2019s product family datasheet and the datasheet for the terminals is not very self consistent: \nProduct family datasheet at https://cdn.amphenol-cs.com/media/wysiwyg/files/documentation/datasheet/boardwiretoboard/bwb_minitek_pwr_cem_5_pcie.pdf says the rating is 9.5A per contact for 12 pins, and\nthe gs-12-1706 general specification linked directly on page 2 https://cdn.amphenol-icc.com/media/wysiwyg/files/documentation/gs-12-1706.pdf says the same. \nHowever, if you click on the 10132447 receptacle terminal part number link, it brings up a few parts, among which https://www.amphenol-cs.com/minitek-pwr-hybrid-3-0-hcc-receptacle-10132447121plf.html shows up as preferred part. The product specification it links to at https://cdn.amphenol-cs.com/media/wysiwyg/files/documentation/gs-12-1291.pdf says the current rating is 7.5A per contact for 12 pins\u2026\nIn any case the PCIe specs are pushing those connectors to the limit or over the limit. And anyone using a compatible sort of a terminal e.g. the Molex ones, or other cheaper terminals, will surely run over the limit a lot. It sounds disastrous, especially considering there are already many dodgy adapters on Amazon\u2026 Not sure why they decided to push the specs this much this time around.\n\n\nReport comment \nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 28, 2022 at 7:25 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m looking at the pictures of those (relatively) large wires soldered to those poor little thin & flimsy stamped pins, and I\u2019m both in disbelief that this was the \u201csolution\u201d from a company as experienced and large as nVidia, and thinking \u201cyeah, that\u2019s totally something I\u2019d have done when I was 14.\u201d LoL\n\n\nReport comment \nReply \n\n\n\n\n\nshod says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 29, 2022 at 10:18 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t an engineering issue, this is a \u2018let\u2019s go with the cheapest option adapter to throw in the box\u2019 issue and they just asked Foxconn or some such to mass produce this crap for them at a budget.\nAnd it makes sense, they are already basically giving away these cards at a mere 2 freaking grand after all..\n\n\nReport comment \nReply \n\n\n\n\n\nreyhan says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 28, 2023 at 2:29 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nnice thanks\n\n\nReport comment \nReply \n\n\n\nLeave a ReplyCancel reply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

Here are the instructions how to enable JavaScript in your web browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nEditor's note: This post is part of our weekly In the NVIDIA Studio series, which celebrates featured artists, offers creative tips and tricks, and demonstrates how NVIDIA Studio technology accelerates creative workflows. \nViral creator turned NVIDIA 3D artist Lorenzo Drago takes viewers on a jaw-dropping journey through Toyama, Japan\u2019s Etch\u016b-Daimon Station this week In the NVIDIA Studio.\nDrago\u2019s photorealistic recreation of the train station has garnered over 2 million views in under four months, with audiences marveling at the remarkably accurate detail.\n  \n\u201cReality inspires me the most,\u201d said Drago. \u201cMundane, everyday things always tell a story \u2014 they have nuances that are challenging to capture in fantasy.\u201d\n\nDrago started by camera matching in the fSpy open-source software. This process computed the approximate focal length, orientation and position of the camera in 3D space, based on the defined control points chosen from his Etch\u016b-Daimon reference image. \nThe artist then moved to Blender software to begin the initial blockout, a 3D rough-draft level built with simple 3D shapes without details or polished art assets. The goal of the blockout was to prototype, test and adjust the foundational shapes of the level. \n  \n Drago tests and adjusts foundational shapes of the level in Blender during the blockout phase of the project.\nFrom there, Drago measured the height of a staircase and extrapolated those proportions to the rest of the 3D scene, ensuring it fit the grid size. The scene could then be built modularly, one model at a time. He modeled with lightning speed using NVIDIA RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in the Blender viewport.\nIncredibly, the entire scene is a combination of custom-textured assets. Drago\u2019s texturing technique elevated the sense of realism by using tileable textures and trim sheets, which are textures that combine separate details into a single sheet. Mixing these techniques proved to be profitable in creating original, more detailed textures, as well as keeping good pixel density across the scene. Textures never exceeded more than 2048x2048 pixels in size. \n\n \nDrago created his textures in Adobe Substance 3D Painter, taking advantage of NVIDIA Iray rendering for faster, interactive rendering. RTX acceleration enabled him to quickly bake ambient occlusion and other maps used in texturing, before exporting and applying the textures to the models inside Unreal Engine 5.\nFinal frame renders came quickly with Drago\u2019s GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER GPU doing the heavy lifting. Drago stressed the necessity of his graphics card. \n\u201cFor a 3D artist, probably the majority of the work, excluding the planning phases, requires GPU acceleration,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing able to work on scenes and objects with materials and lighting rendered in real time saves a lot of time and headaches compared to wireframe or unshaded modes.\u201d\n\n \nDrago moved on to importing and assembling his textured models in Unreal Engine 5. Elated with the assembly, he began the lighting process. Unreal Engine 5\u2019s Lumen technology enabled lighting iterations in real time, without Drago having to wait for baking or render times.\nUnreal Engine\u2019s virtual-reality framework allowed Drago to set up a virtual camera with motion tracking. This gave the animation its signature third-person vantage point, enabling the artist to move around his creative space as if he were holding a smartphone. \n  \n The GPU-accelerated NVDEC decoder in Premiere Pro enabled smooth playback and scrubbing of high-resolution video for Drago.\nWith the renders and animation in place, Drago exported the scene to Adobe Premiere Pro software, where he added sound effects. He also sharpened image details in the animation, one of the many GPU-accelerated features in the software. Drago then deployed GPU-accelerated encoding, NVENC, to speed up the exporting of final files. \nSubtle modifications allowed Drago to create ultra-realistic renders. \u201cMimicking a contemporary smartphone camera \u2014 with a limited dynamic range, glare and sharpening artifacts \u2014 was a good way of selling the realism,\u201d he said. \n\u201cRTX features, like DLSS and ray tracing, are amazing, both from a developer\u2019s point of view and a gamer\u2019s,\u201d Drago stated. \n  \n NVIDIA 3D artist Lorenzo Drago.\nDrago recently imported Etch\u016b-Daimon Station into NVIDIA Omniverse, a 3D design platform for collaborative editing, which replaces linear pipelines with live-sync creation. Drago noted the massive potential within the Omniverse Create App, calling it \u201ca powerful tool capable of achieving extremely high-fidelity results.\u201d\nNVIDIA GTC, a global AI conference running online Sept. 19-22, will feature Omniverse sessions with industry experts to demonstrate how the platform can elevate creative workflows. Take advantage of these free resources and register today. \n  \nFollow Lorenzo Drago and view his portfolio on ArtStation. \nContinue Your Creative Journey\nDrago is a self-taught 3D artist, proof that resilience and dedication can lead to incredible, thought provoking, inspirational creative work.\nIn the spirit of learning, the NVIDIA Studio team is posing a challenge for the community to show off personal growth.

(Image Credits: Moore's Law is Dead)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4070 has once again been pictured in brand new graphics card renders that show off the dual-slot & dual-fan cooling.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Card Renders Give A Close Look At Dual-Slot & Dual-Fan Cooling\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card renders are once again revealed by Moore's Law is Dead in his latest video where he talks in detail about the upcoming product. The TechTuber had previously shown off a teaser of the RTX 4070 graphics card but now gives us a better look. albeit through renders.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB MemoryWhile NVIDIA has introduced its top-end \"Ada Lovelace\" lineup which includes the GeForce RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16 GB, the company didn't reveal anything about its mid-tier offerings such as the RTX 4070 & RTX 4060. It looks like the design may have been finalized now that we are looking at an alleged picture of the Founders Edition cooler that is to be used by the RTX 4070.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Card Renders (Image Credits: Moore's Law is Dead):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nCurrently, NVIDIA has introduced two Founders Edition variants, the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16 GB. The RTX 4080 12 GB was never supposed to get a Founders Edition variant but that doesn't matter since the card has been canceled anyways. But for the RTX 4070, NVIDIA may indeed be preparing a new Founders Edition design that is slightly bigger than its RTX 3070 Founders Edition graphics card and also slightly smaller than the RTX 3080 FE.\nThe main difference is that while the GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition utilized a front-facing dual fan design, the RTX 4070 would utilize a dual-axial flow-through design like its bigger siblings and as such, there will be a fan on the front and at the bottom of the shroud. The fans also seem to have been updated to the newer design that is featured on the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16 GB FE cards.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Card Renders (Image Credits: Moore's Law is Dead):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nWe currently don't have any information regarding the specifications of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card but it was supposed to utilize the same PCB as the RTX 4080 12 GB since both featured the AD104 GPU. The AD104 GPU for the RTX 4070 will be severely cut-down and it is likely that we get a 160-bit bus for 10 GB or retain the 192-bit bus for 12 GB memory because 128-bit 8 GB on a 70-series card or 6 GB 192-bit just seems way too underwhelming and unattractive. That depends on NVIDIA. The RTX 4070 is expected to be announced early next year.\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n129\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n92\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n59\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

You can also read our full review of the card here.\nBreaking The 100 TFLOPs Barrier! NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Becomes The Fastest Gaming Graphics Card For Compute & Fastest Gaming Graphics Card, Period!\nBreaking the 100 TFLOPs barrier is no easy feat. Before today, NVIDIA's fastest gaming graphics card, the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti, only delivered 40 TFLOPs of compute horsepower. With the launch of the GeForce RTX 4090, we get close to the 100 TFLOPs barrier but not officially. NVIDIA states that the GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition offers 83 TFLOPs at default settings. This means that the card is 17 TFLOPs shy of that 100 TFLOPs mark.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nSo we decided it was time to test how far we can push the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition with some overclocking. To get to 100 TFLOPs, we first pushed the power limit and temp limit slider all the way to the max and upped the Core and Memory clocks by +275 and +1100 MHz, respectively. This wasn't enough as the card was being limited by its power design. That is when we landed our hands on MSI's latest Afterburner which allowed us to raise the core voltages. At 100%, we saw some performance regression so we had to stick with +55% which showed us some good results.\n\nWith the overclock applied on our NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card, we saw a maximum GPU core clock of 3150 MHz on the AD102 Ada GPU, a maximum power draw of 547W and our temps peaked at 69C. All of this was done on air and with no exotic liquid cooling, chillers or LN2 were used.\nAnd behold, we saw the magical number of not 100 but almost 101 TFLOPs right in front of our eyes. To put things into perspective, this is a 22% compute boost over the stock RTX 4090 and a 2.5x compute performance boost over the RTX 3090 Ti. The AD102 GPU also ripped apart the data-center-focused Hopper H100 GPUs by offering over 50% better FP32 performance. Ada Lovelace is truly a game changer and we can definitely see it become a popular compute and AI graphics card when Quadro variants of the said chip launch as the RTX 6000 ADA and L60.\n\n\nFP32 Compute Horsepower Comparisons (Higher is Better)\n\nCompute Power\n\n\n04080120160200240\n\n\n\n\n\n04080120160200240\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090 OC\n\n101\n\n\nRTX 4090 Stock\n\n83\n\n\nRTX 3090 Ti\n\n40\n\n\nRX 6900 XTX\n\n25\n\n\nXbox Series X\n\n12\n\n\nPlayStation 5\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 'Official' Specifications - $1599 US Pricing\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 will use 128 SMs of the 144 SMs for a total of 16,384 CUDA cores. The GPU will come packed with 72 MB of L2 cache and a total of 176 ROPs which is simply insane.\n\nAs for memory specs, the GeForce RTX 4090 will feature 24 GB GDDR6X capacities that will be clocked at 21 Gbps speeds across a 384-bit bus interface. This will provide up to 1 TB/s of bandwidth. This is the same bandwidth as the existing RTX 3090 Ti graphics card and as far as the power consumption is concerned, the TBP is rated at 450W.

The 12GB variant of the latest GeForce RTX 4080 card isn\u2019t just a dip in memory, as the name implies, it also lowers several other key specs. Some gamers (including yours truly) said that it would be more appropriately called the RTX 4070, and priced as such. Nvidia seems to agree on the former point, if not necessarily the latter: The GPU maker is canceling the 12GB version of the card, for now. \n\u201cThe RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it\u2019s not named right,\u201d admits Nvidia in a short-but-sweet blog post. \u201cHaving two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing.\u201d The company is referring obliquely to the fact that the 12GB version of the card has a different chip design with markedly fewer CUDA cores and a more restricted memory interface, plus a very slightly boosted base clock. The price for the 16GB version of the card is $1,199 and seems to be unchanged, while the 12GB version was formerly set at $899, both considerably more than their RTX 30-series equivalents. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\u201cSo we\u2019re pressing the \u2018unlaunch\u2019 button on the 4080 12GB,\u201d says Nvidia. Exactly what it plans to do with presumably thousands of ready-to-ship graphics cards isn\u2019t specified, though the company notes that the 16GB version of the RTX 4080 is ready to go for its retail debut on November 16. \nWhatever its plans, Nvidia certainly isn\u2019t going to throw away huge batches of expensive graphics cards. This is pure speculation on our part, but perhaps Nvidia will hang on to them and make the 12GB 4080 the RTX 4070 it should have been in the first place. Maybe it will even deign to lower that price a bit\u2014with Intel and AMD poised to take advantage of Nvidia\u2019s hubristically high prices, it couldn\u2019t hurt. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Michael Crider, Staff Writer, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael is a 10-year veteran of technology journalism, covering everything from Apple to ZTE.

Our first performance look will revolve around rendering, and once you see the results, you\u2019ll understand why. Whereas Ampere itself brought huge rendering gains over Turing, Ada Lovelace does the same over Ampere. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA had some bold claims when it announced its Ada Lovelace GeForce generation a couple of weeks ago. If you were to ignore those claims, and just stick to the paper specs, even that implied that we\u2019d be seeing an effective doubling of ray tracing performance. After testing a range of popular render engines, we can confirm that the hype converts to reality in this case.\nWe\u2019re not quite through benchmarking the nine additional graphics cards that will be piled on top of results published in our Intel Arc A750 and A770 review from last week, so we wanted to dedicate this first GeForce RTX 4090 performance look to rendering. With such large gains, it almost deserves a dedicated piece.\n\nWhile this article revolves around rendering performance in 3D design software, our future looks are going to expand the creator angle to involve encoding, photogrammetry, AI, and math workloads, and naturally, gaming tests are in store, as well. There\u2019s only so much time in the day, and only so much benchmarking that can get done in any given day.\nAs covered before, the Ada Lovelace generation brings 4th-gen Tensor cores and improved Optical Flow to the table. In creation, these accelerate things like denoising, while for gaming use, they\u2019re taken advantage of for upscaling through DLSS \u2013 which is now at version 3. On the ray tracing core side, Ada Lovelace introduces the 3rd-gen implementation, which promises (and largely delivers) a 2x performance boost over the Ampere generation.\nOther features worth noting is Shader Execution Reordering, which further improves ray tracing performance, including in games, where one such example shows a 44% bump in Cyberpunk 2077. Also, Intel was first to market with an AV1 accelerated GPU encoder, and NVIDIA wasn\u2019t far behind, as Ada Lovelace packs one in, as well. Intriguingly, NVIDIA offers dual encoders on-board, which it claims will quite literally halve encode times. We\u2019ll explore this with our upcoming full creator performance look.\nBefore jumping into a look at rendering performance with NVIDIA\u2019s newest flagship, let\u2019s take a look at the hardware, with NVIDIA\u2019s Founder Edition:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the RTX 4090 looks large, that\u2019s because it is. When the RTX 3090 launched two years ago, we were amazed at just how bulky the FE card was \u2013 and here, the RTX 4090 is even larger. Thankfully, it\u2019s just the width of the card that\u2019s increased, not length (or else we would have been in trouble with our test machine).\nSpec\u2019d at 450W, the RTX 4090 is a power-hungry GPU, and thus the bigger the PSU, the better. NVIDIA\u2019s stated minimum is 850W, and as we\u2019ve peaked at 650W while running an intensive 3DMark test, we\u2019d say that\u2019s accurate. If you\u2019re building a new machine around the RTX 4090, however, we\u2019d highly suggest going for at least a 1,000W model.\nBecause the RTX 4090 demands so much juice, 3x 8-pin power connectors are required, or a single power connector provided with a new PCIe 5-supported PSU. As our test rig\u2019s PSU just matches the minimum requirement, we\u2019ll be shifting to a bigger one in the future.\nWith regards to the RTX 4090\u2019s cooler, the design remains similar to that seen on the last generation with the RTX 3090, but under-the-hood improvements have benefited temperatures. The latest model has a larger fan, and at the same time reduces the number of blades. We haven\u2019t done thorough temperature testing yet, but we have tested the RTX 4090 enough to see that it draws an additional 100W over the 3090 (650W total) during a 3DMark Fire Strike Ultra test.\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s GeForce Gaming & Creator GPU Lineup\n\n\n\nCores\nBoost MHz\nPeak FP32\nMemory\nBandwidth\nTDP\nSRP\n\n\nRTX 4090\n16,384\n2,520\n82.6 TFLOPS\n24GB 1\n1008 GB/s\n450W\n$1,599\n\n\nRTX 4080 16GB\n9,728\n2,510\n48.8 TFLOPS\n16GB 1\n717 GB/s\n320W\n$1,199\n\n\nRTX 4080 12GB\n7,680\n2,610\n40.1 TFLOPS\n12GB 1\n504 GB/s\n285W\n$899\n\n\nRTX 3090 Ti\n10,752\n1,860\n40 TFLOPS\n24GB 1\n1008 GB/s\n450W\n$1,999\n\n\nRTX 3090\n10,496\n1,700\n35.6 TFLOPS\n24GB 1\n936 GB/s\n350W\n$1,499\n\n\nRTX 3080 Ti\n10,240\n1,670\n34.1 TFLOPS\n12GB 1\n912 GB/s\n350W\n$1,199\n\n\nRTX 3080\n8,704\n1,710\n29.7 TFLOPS\n10GB 1\n760 GB/s\n320W\n$699\n\n\nRTX 3070 Ti\n6,144\n1,770\n21.7 TFLOPS\n8GB 1\n608 GB/s\n290W\n$599\n\n\nRTX 3070\n5,888\n1,730\n20.4 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n448 GB/s\n220W\n$499\n\n\nRTX 3060 Ti\n4,864\n1,670\n16.2 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n448 GB/s\n200W\n$399\n\n\nRTX 3060\n3,584\n1,780\n12.7 TFLOPS\n12GB 2\n360 GB/s\n170W\n$329\n\n\nRTX 3050\n2,560\n1,780\n9.0 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n224 GB/s\n130W\n$249\n\n\nNotes\n1 GDDR6X; 2 GDDR6\nRTX 3000 = Ampere; RTX 4000 = Ada Lovelace\n\n\n\nWhile the RTX 4090 is the first Ada Lovelace GeForce to release, NVIDIA\u2019s already announced the next two: RTX 4080 16GB, and RTX 4080 12GB. Despite sharing the same model name, the 16GB 4080 is going to be much faster than the 12GB variant, in both raw performance and even with memory bandwidth. The 4080 12GB has a 192-bit memory bus width, which seems extraordinarily odd for a premium product. We\u2019ll have to wait until that SKU gets benchmarked so we can see how much of a limitation that will ultimately be.\nUpdate: NVIDIA has sinced \u201cunlaunched\u201d its 12GB RTX 4080 variant. \nDuring testing, one thing caught us off-guard with the RTX 4090: it features ECC memory. At first, we thought the option in the driver could have been a bug, but not so. It enables just fine:\n\nAfter pinging NVIDIA about this, we realized that the RTX 3090 Ti also included ECC memory. We\u2019re not entirely sure why the company decided to put ECC memory in a card focused on creator and gaming, but we suppose it\u2019d be a nice feature for those who truly need it, and can score it on a GPU that\u2019s not a more expensive workstation or Tesla card.\nIn quick tests, enabling ECC memory dropped the benchmarked bandwidth from 845 GB/s down to 742 GB/s. Comparatively, enabling ECC memory on the Quadro RTX 6000 dropped bandwidth from 513 GB/s to 433 GB/s.\nWith that all covered, let\u2019s take a quick look at our test PC\u2019s specs:\n\n\n\n\nTechgage Workstation Test System\n\n\nProcessor\nAMD Ryzen 9 5950X (16-core; 3.4GHz)\n\n\nMotherboard\nASRock X570 TAICHI (EFI: P4.80 03/02/2022)\n\n\nMemory\nCorsair Vengeance RGB Pro\n(CMW32GX4M4C3200C16) 8GB x 4\nOperates at DDR4-3200 16-18-18 (1.35V)\n\n\nAMD Graphics\nAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT (16GB; Adrenalin 22.9.1)\nAMD Radeon RX 6800 XT (16GB; Adrenalin 22.9.1)\nAMD Radeon RX 6800 (16GB; Adrenalin 22.9.1)\nAMD Radeon RX 6700 XT (12GB; Adrenalin 22.9.1)\nAMD Radeon RX 6600 XT (8GB; Adrenalin 22.9.1)\nAMD Radeon RX 6600 (8GB; Adrenalin 22.9.1)\nAMD Radeon RX 6500 XT (4GB; Adrenalin 22.9.1)\n\n\nIntel Graphics\nIntel Arc A770 (16GB; Arc 31.0.101.3435)\nIntel Arc A750 (8GB; Arc 31.0.101.3435)\nIntel Arc A380 (6GB; Arc 31.0.101.3430)\n\n\nNVIDIA Graphics\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 (24GB; GeForce 521.90)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 (24GB; GeForce 516.94)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (12GB; GeForce 516.94)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 (10GB; GeForce 516.94)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti (8GB; GeForce 516.94)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 (8GB; GeForce 516.94)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti (8GB; GeForce 516.94)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (12GB; GeForce 516.94)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 (8GB; GeForce 516.94)\n\n\nAudio\nOnboard\n\n\nStorage\nSamsung 500GB SSD (SATA) (x3)\n\n\nPower Supply\nCorsair RM850X\n\n\nChassis\nFractal Design Define C Mid-Tower\n\n\nCooling\nCorsair Hydro H100i PRO RGB 240mm AIO\n\n\nEt cetera\nWindows 11 Pro build 22000 (22H1)\nAMD chipset driver 4.08.09.2337\n\n\nAll product links in this table are affiliated, and help support our work.\n\n\n\nOur look at rendering performance will revolve around seven different solutions. Both Blender and LuxCoreRender can be run on all three graphics vendors, while Arnold, KeyShot, Octane, Redshift, and V-Ray are currently NVIDIA-only.\nTo kick off our look at rendering performance with the RTX 4090, we couldn\u2019t help but test a few generations of top-end GPUs to highlight how far we\u2019ve come in a relatively short amount of time. To do this, we grabbed a handful of 24GB GPUs, and the Chaos V-Ray project Winter Apartment, which requires over 16GB of VRAM to render. Here are those results:\n\nThis is one of those times when a picture\u2019s worth a thousand words. In four generations, NVIDIA\u2019s top-end SKU slices this project\u2019s render times to almost 10% of what we saw with a top-end Pascal card. When we reviewed that Quadro P6000 in 2017, we called it the \u201cfastest graphics card ever\u201d. Well, it\u2019s now clear that if you\u2019re still rocking that class and generation of GPU, you\u2019re sorely missing out on huge rendering performance gains.\nA couple of other V-Ray projects show tremendous gains, as well. It\u2019s not quite an exact halving of render times vs. RTX 3090, but it\u2019s close:\n\n\nWith OctaneRender, the performance advantage of the RTX 4090 across two projects is about 70%, and obviously quite a bit better when opting to use OptiX over CUDA:\n\n\nWith Arnold, we see similar leaps in performance as we did with Octane; not quite double, but still a massive reduction in render times:\n\n\nContinuing on to a look at Blender, the Cycles engine also benefits heavily from NVIDIA\u2019s latest architecture:\n\n\nA couple of years ago, we adjusted some of our long-standing Blender projects because they were rendering too quickly on new high-end hardware, and we\u2019re starting to see the same thing happen again here. The overall performance gains across these four projects are not as pronounced as some of the others, but they\u2019re still undeniably huge. Especially when you\u2019re rendering multiple frames for a given scene, the overall time savings adds up.\nWith Eevee, which doesn\u2019t take advantage of accelerated ray tracing, we still see notable gains. They\u2019re not quite as stark as the rest in this article, but viewed on their own, the upticks in rendering performance is still impressive:\n\nOur Redshift testing shows that the gains with RTX 4090 might not be on the same level with some projects as others; the more complex Cyberpunk scene saw relatively modest (in comparison to the rest) gains between RTX 4090 and 3090, but the simpler Car scene saw a much more impressive leap ahead.\n\n\nIt\u2019s been some time since we\u2019ve been able to give KeyShot a fresh test, and as far as we can remember, this is the first such test since version 11 came out. As we saw with Redshift above, different projects will vary in the level of performance gain between the 4090 and 3090. With the Character scene, a literal halving of render time is seen, while the Circuit Board render drops to 2/3rd of the total render time.\n\n\nTo wrap up this performance look, we turn to LuxCoreRender, via the LuxMark benchmark:\n\nIt seems obvious at this point that Ada Lovelace is going to offer a huge leap in performance over Ampere, no matter the renderer. We just tested seven different ones, and all of them showed tremendous leaps in performance, gen-over-gen. We hoped also to have Radeon ProRender here, but because the latest version doesn\u2019t support Blender 3.3, we shelved it for now.\nFinal Thoughts\nAs alluded to in the intro, NVIDIA made some huge promises when it announced its Ada Lovelace GeForce generation, so we went into benchmarking holding our breath, because we really wanted those promises to live up. As the myriad results above highlight, we feel safe in saying that they have indeed.\nAdmittedly, we felt the same when we reviewed the first Ampere GeForces. The Turing generation was NVIDIA\u2019s first that brought accelerated ray tracing (and denoising) into the mix, and when Ampere launched, we didn\u2019t really expect to see the level of gain in rendering that we did. We also didn\u2019t expect to see Ada Lovelace pull the same thing off, only because a literal doubling of GPU performance isn\u2019t exactly what we\u2019re used to seeing.\nWhat\u2019s really impressive is that in some cases, the RTX 4090 performed even faster than 2x the RTX 3090. The Winter Apartment V-Ray project in particular revealed that.\n\nSo, it\u2019s clear that Ada Lovelace is a beast of a rendering architecture, and those who adopt one of the new GeForces will enjoy huge upticks in performance over the previous generation. That said, we\u2019ve only tested the RTX 4090 so far, so it\u2019s hard to suggest right now that the dual 4080 options will leap ahead over their respective predecessors just the same \u2013 but we hope to find out sooner than later.\nAnother thing that\u2019s clear is that the Ada Lovelace generation is more expensive than the last. The RTX 4090 itself carries a $100 price premium over the RTX 3090, which to be honest, doesn\u2019t even seem that bad, given the leaps in rendering performance. We\u2019re still talking about a GPU that packs 24GB of memory in, and it effectively halves the rendering times that the RTX 3090 can muster. In that particular match-up, the price increase doesn\u2019t sting too much.\nAs for the 4080 and 3080-class cards, however, the verdict remains out on how their price premiums will convert to an uptick in performance. The RTX 4080 16GB follows in the footsteps of the $1,199 RTX 3080 Ti, while the RTX 3080 12GB carries a $200 price premium over the RTX 3080 10GB.\nAll told \u2013 if you care about rendering performance to the point that you always lock your eyes on a top-end target, then the RTX 4090 is going to prove to be an absolute screamer. You can effectively look at it as being equivalent to having two RTX 3090 cards in the same rig. That\u2019s a lot of horsepower.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport our efforts!

RTX Remix, specifically, is a free expansion of the older Nvidia Omniverse system that massively improves what modders can do with DirectX 8 and DirectX 9 video games. Support for raytraced lighting and various additional visual enhancements is its most obvious new feature. \nThough Nvidia immediately admitted that there are some limitations in place with RTX Remix, such as the fact that it will only support games without any shader-based APIs, its feature set should prove perfect for old games such as The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind and Mount & Blade: Warband. In fact, this particular question was partially answered as part of the aforementioned Q&A, giving modders and players a better idea of what to expect down the line.\nRELATED: Video Shows The Witcher 3 Running Over 100 Mods on an Nvidia RTX 4090\nAfter Nvidia showed off its RTX-based enhancement of TES 3: Morrowind in real-time, promising to empower modders with all the tools necessary to make such projects a reality, there was a lot of discussion surrounding the specific manner in which such a seemingly monumental job was completed. Now, with the Nexus Mods Q&A session discussing RTX Remix specifically, a number of Nvidia's own engineers have provided in-depth responses to modders' questions on how the whole system will work. \n\n\n\"To make RTX Remix work,\" said an Nvidia engineer, \"we have to be able to understand, parse, and re-create everything the original game does.\" This is why fixed function pipeline titles such as Morrowind are perfect candidates for modders to work on. The upcoming RTX remaster of Portal is, on the other hand, an example of the sort of approach Nvidia is taking with video games that are a bit newer still. \"As games start to rely on shaders, it becomes even harder to accurately capture light data, texture info, and asset models,\" said Nvidia.\nIn effect, this does mean that the first iteration of RTX Remix will only really be useful for a limited number of old games. Still, the Q&A session suggests that Nvidia's engineers may be looking at ways to expand Remix's functionality in the future, potentially introducing features that are every bit as impressive as Cyberpunk 2077's DLSS 3.0 implementation. This new suite of tools could, therefore, grow even more interesting as time goes on.\nRTX Remix is supposed to launch sometime early in 2023, but Nvidia's docket is far from empty up until then. While the incredible performance uplift of RTX 4090 has been making headlines following its initial reveal, the \"unlaunching\" of the RTX 4080 12 GB model has taken over the limelight as of late.\nMORE: PS1-Era Graphics Have Found New Life Through Indie Horror Games\nSource: Nexus Mods \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming News\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPC Gaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS2 is No Longer the Best-Selling Video Game Console of All Time in the US\n\t\t\n\n\nPS2\n\nSony's beloved PlayStation 2 is no longer the best-selling console in video game history as new sales figures reveal a new industry leader.\n\n\nPosts\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nAaron McKinley\n\n\nDec 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhy Microsoft is Not Releasing an Xbox Rival to the PS5 Pro\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nAdam Corsetti\n\n\nOct 27, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS5 Pro Launch Sales Numbers Compared to PS4 Pro\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nGabriel Machado Pureza\n\n\nNov 16, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThere's a New Catch to Consider With the PS5 Pro\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nJ Brodie Shirey\n\n\nOct 30, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3:03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS5 Pro is Even More Expensive Outside the US\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nDalton Cooper\n\n\nSep 13, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSome PS5 Pro 30th Anniversary Edition Pre-Orders Are Being Canceled\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nMatthew Schomer\n\n\nSep 27, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tReignbreaker: Best Resolve Upgrades to Unlock Early\n\t\t\n\n\nReignbreaker\n\nThe Resolve Upgrades in Reignbreaker can significantly improve your abilities.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the past few years, the best gaming monitors have enjoyed something of a renaissance. Before Adaptive-Sync technology appeared in the form of Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync, the only thing performance-seeking gamers could hope for was higher resolutions or a refresh rate above 60 Hz. Today, not only do we have monitors routinely operating at 144 Hz and higher, Nvidia and AMD have both been updating their respective technologies. In this age of gaming displays, which Adaptive-Sync tech reigns supreme in the battle between FreeSync vs. G-Sync?\n\nWe've also got next-generation graphics cards arriving, like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 and Ada Lovelace GPUs with DLSS 3 technology that can potentially double framerates, even at 4K. AMD's RDNA 3 and Radeon RX 7000-series GPUs are also slated to arrive shortly, and should also boost performance and make higher quality displays more useful.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)For the uninitiated, Adaptive-Sync means that the monitor\u2019s refresh cycle is synced with the rate at which the connected PC\u2019s graphics card renders each frame of video, even if that rate changes. Games render each frame sequentially, and the rate can vary widely depending on the complexity of the scene being rendered. With a fixed monitor refresh rate, the screen updates at a specific cadence, like 60 times per second for a 60 Hz display. What happens if a new frame is ready before the scheduled update?\n\nThere are a few options. One is to have the GPU and monitor wait to send the new frame to the display, which increases system latency and can make games feel less responsive. Another option is for the GPU to send the new frame to the monitor and let it immediately start drawing it onto the screen \u2014 this is called tearing and the result is shown in the above image.\n\nG-Sync (for Nvidia-based GPUs) and FreeSync (AMD GPUs and potentially Intel GPUs as well) aim to solve the above problems, providing maximum performance, minimal latency, and no tearing. The GPU sends a \"frame ready\" signal to a G-Sync or FreeSync monitor, which draws the new frame and then awaits the next \"frame ready\" signal, thereby eliminating any tearing artifacts.\n\nToday, you\u2019ll find countless monitors \u2014 even non-gaming ones \u2014 boasting some flavor of G-Sync, FreeSync, or even both. If you haven\u2019t committed to a graphics card technology yet or have the option to use either, you might be wondering which is best when considering FreeSync vs. G-Sync. And if you have the option of using either, will one offer a greater gaming advantage than the other?\u00a0FreeSync vs. G-SyncSwipe to scroll horizontallyFreeSyncFreeSync PremiumFreeSync Premium ProG-SyncG-Sync UltimateG-Sync Compatibility\u00a0No price premiumNo price premiumNo price premiumHDR and extended color supportRefresh rates of 144 Hz and higherValidated for artifact-free performanceRefresh rates of 60 Hz and higherRefresh rates of 120 Hz and higherRefresh rates of 120 Hz and higherFrame-doubling below 30 Hz to ensure Adaptive-Sync at all frame ratesFactory-calibrated accurate SDR (sRGB) and HDR color (P3) gamut supportG-Sync Compatible monitors also run FreeSyncMany FreeSync monitors can also run G-SyncLow Framerate Compensation (LFC)HDR and extended color supportUltra-low motion blur\"Lifelike\" HDR supportRow 2 - Cell 5 May have HDR supportMay have HDR supportLow Framerate Compensation (LFC)Row 3 - Cell 3 Variable LCD overdriveRow 3 - Cell 5 Row 4 - Cell 0 Many FreeSync Premium monitors can also run G-Sync with HDRNo specified peak output, but most will deliver at least 600 nitsRow 4 - Cell 3 Optimized latency Row 4 - Cell 5 Row 5 - Cell 0 Row 5 - Cell 1 Many FreeSync Premium Pro monitors can also run G-Sync with HDRRow 5 - Cell 3 Row 5 - Cell 4 Row 5 - Cell 5 Fundamentally, G-Sync and FreeSync are the same. They both sync the monitor to the graphics card and let that component control the refresh rate on a continuously variable basis.\u00a0To meet each certification, a monitor has to meet the respective requirements detailed above, but a monitor can also go beyond the requirements. For example, a FreeSync monitor isn't required to have HDR but some do, and some FreeSync monitors reduce motion blur via a proprietary partner tech, like Asus ELMB Sync.\n\nCan the user see a difference between the two? In our experience, there is no visual difference in FreeSync vs. G-Sync when frame rates are the same and the monitor quality is the same. Achieving such parity however is far from guaranteed.\n\nWe did a blind test in 2015 and found that when all other parameters are equal between FreeSync vs. G-Sync monitors, G-Sync had a slight edge over the still-new-at-the-time FreeSync. But a lot has happened since then. Our monitor reviews have highlighted a few things that can add or subtract from the gaming experience that have little to nothing to do with refresh rates and Adaptive-Sync technologies.\n\nThe HDR quality is also subjective at this time, although G-Sync Ultimate claims to offer \"lifelike HDR.\"\u00a0It then comes down to the feature set of the rival technologies. What does all this mean? Let\u2019s take a look.G-Sync Features(Image credit: Nvidia)G-Sync monitors typically carry a price premium because they contain the extra hardware needed to support Nvidia\u2019s version of adaptive refresh. When G-Sync was new (Nvidia introduced it in 2013), it would cost you about $200 extra to purchase the G-Sync version of a display, all other features and specs being the same. Today, the gap is closer to $100.\n\nHowever, FreeSync monitors can be also certified as G-Sync Compatible. The certification can happen retroactively, and it means a monitor can run G-Sync within Nvidia's parameters, despite lacking Nvidia' proprietary scaler hardware. A visit to Nvidia\u2019s website reveals a list of monitors that have been certified to run G-Sync. You can technically run G-Sync on a monitor that's not G-Sync Compatible-certified, but the quality and experience are not guaranteed. For more, see our articles on How to Run G-Sync on a FreeSync Monitor and Should You Care if Your Monitor's Certified G-Sync Compatible?\n\nThere are a few guarantees you get with G-Sync monitors that aren\u2019t always available in their FreeSync counterparts. One is blur-reduction (ULMB) in the form of a backlight strobe. ULMB is Nvidia\u2019s name for this feature; some FreeSync monitors also have it under a different name. While this works in place of Adaptive-Sync, some prefer it, perceiving it to have lower input lag. We haven\u2019t been able to substantiate this in testing. However, when you run at 100 frames per second (fps) or higher, blur is typically a non-issue and input lag is super-low, so you might as well keep things tight with G-Sync engaged.\n\nG-Sync also guarantees that you will never see a frame tear even at the lowest refresh rates. Below 30 Hz, G-Sync monitors double the frame renders (thereby doubling the refresh rate) to keep them running in the adaptive refresh range.FreeSync Features\u00a0(Image credit: AMD)FreeSync has a price advantage over G-Sync because it uses an open-source standard created by VESA, Adaptive-Sync, which is also part of VESA\u2019s DisplayPort spec.\u00a0Any DisplayPort interface version 1.2a or higher can support adaptive refresh rates. While a manufacturer may choose not to implement it, the hardware is there already, so there\u2019s no additional production cost for the maker to implement FreeSync. FreeSync can also work with HDMI 2.0b and later.\u00a0(For help understanding which is best for gaming, see our DisplayPort vs. HDMI analysis.)\n\nBecause of its open nature, FreeSync implementations vary widely between monitors. Budget displays will typically get FreeSync and a 60 Hz or greater refresh rate. The lowest-priced displays likely won\u2019t get blur-reduction, and the lower limit of the Adaptive-Sync range might be just 48 Hz. However, there are FreeSync (as well as G-Sync) displays that operate at 30 Hz or, according to AMD, even lower.\n\nFreeSync Adaptive-Sync works just as well as G-Sync in theory. In practice, the cheapest FreeSync displays (particularly older models) may not look quite as nice. Pricier FreeSync monitors add blur reduction and Low Framerate Compensation (LFC) to compete better against their G-Sync counterparts.And, again, you can get G-Sync running on a FreeSync monitor without any Nvidia certification, but performance may falter.\u00a0These days, monitors are opting for FreeSync support because it's effectively free, and higher quality displays work with Nvidia to ensure they're also G-Sync compatible.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.FreeSync vs. G-Sync: Which Is Better for HDR?\u00a0To add even more choices to a potentially confusing market, AMD and Nvidia have upped the game with new versions of their Adaptive-Sync technologies. This is justified, rightly so, by some important additions to display tech, namely HDR and extended color.(Image credit: Nvidia)On the Nvidia side, a monitor can support G-Sync with HDR and extended color without earning the \u201cUltimate\u201d certification. Nvidia assigns that moniker to monitors with the capability to offer what Nvidia deems \"lifelike HDR.\" Exact requirements are vague, but Nvidia clarified the G-Sync Ultimate spec to Tom's Hardware, telling us that these monitors are supposed to be factory-calibrated for the HDR color space, P3, while offering 144Hz and higher refresh rates, overdrive, \"optimized latency\" and \"best-in-class\" image quality and HDR support.\n\nMeanwhile, a monitor must support HDR, extended color, hit a minimum of 120 Hz at 1080p resolution, and have LFC for it to list FreeSync Premium on its specs sheet. If you\u2019re wondering about FreeSync 2, AMD has supplanted that with FreeSync Premium Pro. Functionally, they are the same.\n\nHere\u2019s another fact: If you have an HDR monitor (for recommendations, see our article on picking the best HDR monitor) that supports FreeSync with HDR, there\u2019s a good chance it will also support G-Sync with HDR \u2014 and both can function without HDR as well.(Image credit: AMD)And what of FreeSync Premium Pro? It\u2019s the same situation as G-Sync Ultimate in that it doesn\u2019t offer anything new to the core Adaptive-Sync tech. FreeSync Premium Pro simply means AMD has certified that monitor to provide a premium experience with at least a 120 Hz refresh rate, LFC, and HDR.\n\nNaturally, the higher quality components necessary for FreeSync Premium Pro cost more than basic components. That means that while FreeSync technically doesn't come with a cost, FreeSync Premium Pro monitors will be more expensive than lesser monitors.\n\nChances are that if the FreeSync monitor supports HDR, it will likely work with G-Sync (Nvidia-certified or not) too.ConclusionSo which is better: G-Sync or FreeSync? With the features being so similar there is no inherent reason to select a particular monitor. Both technologies produces similar results, so the contest is mostly a wash at this point. There are a few disclaimers, however.\n\nIf you purchase a G-Sync monitor, you will only have support for its adaptive-sync features with a GeForce graphics card. You're effectively locked into buying Nvidia GPUs as long as you want to get the most out of \u00a0your monitor. With a FreeSync monitor, particularly the newer, higher quality variants that meet the FreeSync Premium Pro certification, you're often free to use AMD or Nvidia graphics cards.\n\nThose shopping for a PC monitor will have to decide which additional features are most important to them. How high should the refresh rate be? How much resolution can your graphics card handle? Is high brightness important? Do you want HDR and extended color?\n\nIt\u2019s the combination of these elements that impacts the gaming experience, not simply which adaptive sync technology is in use. Ultimately, the more you spend, the better gaming monitor you\u2019ll get. These days, when it comes to displays, you do get what you pay for. But you don't have pay thousands to get a good, smooth gaming experience.MORE:\u00a0Best Gaming MonitorsMORE:\u00a0Best 4K Gaming MonitorsMORE:\u00a0How We Test MonitorsMORE:\u00a0All Monitor Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nFreeSync\nHardware\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (25)\n\n\n\nChristian EberleSocial Links NavigationContributing EditorChristian Eberle is a Contributing Editor for Tom's Hardware US.

Neither GSync or Freesync will make one bit of difference on the desktop. This is an anti tearing technology - which happens at high resolution and high frame rates.\n\nI have had a real G Sync monitor since the original that only worked with the Asus monitor... It has improved greatly and is very noticeable - would not expect anything with a Free Sync monitor that is G Sync \"compatible\" - just won't be a big deal at all.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit_user\n\n\nI still don't see a single 2560x1440 monitor that's compatible with both FreeSync Premium Pro and G-Sync HDR.

Three cards were unveiled, all based on different slices of silicon, the GeForce RTX 4080 12GB (AD104), the RTX 4080 16GB (AD103), and the top-end GeForce RTX 4090 (AD102). The dynamic duo of GeForce RTX 4080s are due to arrive next month, but today \u2013 one day before cards are set to hit store shelves \u2013 we get to show you exactly what the flagship GeForce RTX 4090 can do, and wow is this thing a powerful beast.\n\r\nBased on the specifications and new features Jensen revealed, we came into this article knowing that GeForce RTX 4090 was going to be one heck of graphics card. But over and above whatever gaming performance gains come by way of the massive 76B transistor GPU and new architectural efficiencies, many of the key features exclusive to the Ada Lovelace architecture are meant to further boost performance in both gaming and content creation workloads, and enhance the overall gaming experience too.\n\r\nHere's a quick hands-on tour of a couple of GeForce RTX 4090 cards, one from MSI and the other directly from NVIDIA. After that, we\u2019ll get some particulars out of the way, check out NVIDIA\u2019s Founder\u2019s Edition card, and then we\u2019ll dive in a little deeper and see how the RTX 4090 performs. If times are tight at the moment, we\u2019re going to go ahead and warn you to hide your credit cards right now. When you see what this thing can do, even GeForce RTX 3090 Ti owners are going to be green with envy...\n\n\n\n\n\r\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Features & Specifications\n\n\n\nFind NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Cards @ Amazon\n\r\nThough NVIDIA has branded this card the GeForce RTX 4090, like its predecessor the RTX 3090, it fits into the same category previously held by NVIDIA's Titan RTX and older Titan-branded cards. As such, the GeForce RTX 4090 isn\u2019t solely a product targeted at gamers. Of course, powerful GPUs with thousands of cores, high clocks, gobs of memory, and the latest media engines are typically well-suited to content creation and gaming, so we did some testing across an array of workloads in an attempt to paint a complete picture of GeForce RTX 4090 performance. But we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves.\n\n\nUnder The Hood Of Ada Lovelace And The AD102 GPU\r\nBefore we go any further, we want to highlight a couple of previous articles:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Architecture Overview: Ada's Special Sauce Unveiled\nNVIDIA Unveils Beastly GeForce RTX 4090 And RTX 4080 Lovelace Graphics Cards With Big Gains\nNVIDIA To Fuel Metaverse, Cars, And Robots With Powerful Omniverse Updates, Thor Superchip, Grace CPU And More\n\r\nWe have already covered much of the underlying technology at the heart of the GeForce RTX 4090, so we won\u2019t be doing so again here. If you want the full scoop on Ada Lovelace and the new features it brings to the RTX 40 series, we recommend checking out our coverage of the architecture and of NVIDIA\u2019s other GTC 2022 announcements. Once you\u2019ve got all of that meat digested, you\u2019ll better understand what the GeForce RTX 4090 we\u2019ll be showing you here today is all about.\n\n\n\r\nThe new AD102-powered GeForce RTX 4090 is beefed-up and enhanced versus the previous-gen GA102-based GeForce RTX 3090/3090 Ti in almost every way. The AD102 at the heart of the GeForce RTX 4090 is packing 11 GPCs, 42 TPCs, and 84 SMs, versus 7, 42, and 84 in the AD102, respectively. All told, the AD102 has more CUDA Cores (16,384 vs. 10,752), more RT Cores (512 vs. 336), and more Tensor Cores (128 vs. 84) versus GA102, and all of those cores are of a newer-generation as well.\n\r\nThe AD102 on the GeForce RTX 4090 also has a whopping 12\u00d7 more L2 cache than the GA102, as well as more texture units and ROPs. In addition to having significantly more resources in the GPU, the AD102 further operates at much higher frequencies than the GA102. Whereas the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti offered a typical Boost Clock around 1,860MHz, the GeForce RTX 4090 operates above 2,520MHz and higher, temperatures and power permitting. As such, the RTX 4090\u2019s texture fillrate and peak compute performance are is more than double the RTX 3090 Ti\u2019s.\n\n\n\r\nAll of those new cores and much larger cache require transistors to build, and the AD102 is definitely on another level over the GA102 in that regard. NVIDIA's Ampere-based, previous-gen GA102 is comprised of roughly 28B transistors, however, the new Ada Lovelace AD102 features a massive jump to over 76 billion. NVIDIA was able to pack in so many transistors by moving to TSMC\u2019s advanced 4N node, versus the custom Samsung 8nm process employed for Ampere. In addition, though it\u2019s packing roughly 3X the transistors, the AD102 is actually smaller than GA102. The AD102 GPU has a die size of 608 mm2 versus 628.4mm2 for the GA102. Keep in mind, the AD102 on the GeForce RTX 4090 isn\u2019t fully enabled \u2013 16 SMs are disabled here. Factor in those 16 additional SMs and a theoretical RTX 4090 Ti would have even more CUDA and RT cores.\n\r\nThe GeForce RTX 4090 does, however, have a similar memory configuration to its predecessors. 24GB of GDDR6X memory is linked to the GPU via a 384-bit memory interface, operating at an effective data rate of 21.2Gbps. That equates to just over 1TB/s of peak memory bandwidth. Though NVIDIA didn\u2019t talk much about any new memory compression technologies, we suspect the much larger caches in Ada reduce transactions out to frame buffer memory, and ultimately improve efficiency as it relates to memory bandwidth utilization.\n\r\nIn addition to increasing cores and cache, those additional transistors were also used to enable many new features in the Ada Lovelace architecture, like Shader Execution Reordering (SER), Displaced Micro-Meshes, Opacity Micro-Masks, FP8 inferencing, a much faster Optical Flow Accelerator, and DLSS 3 with AI Frame Generation. The AD102 also features a new 8th-gen media engine which incorporates dual AV1 encoders along with all of the encoding / decoding capabilities of previous-gen architectures. For details on these features, please check our previous coverage here.\n\r\nDespite all of the new technology at play here, we should also mention that GeForce RTX 40 series cards like the RTX 4090 are native PCIe 4.0 \u2013 not PCIe 5. However, we are still not saturating the current PCIe 4 interface with these graphics cards, so the additional bandwidth that would have been afforded by PCIe 5 probably wouldn\u2019t mean much at this point. \n\r\nSomething new on the cards that is somewhat similar to the RTX 30 series is a small PCIe Gen 5 power connector. This single 12-pin connection is able to scale up to 600 watts for power delivery, and shrinks the overall connector footprint versus existing 6/8-pin PCIe power connectors. NVIDIA includes an adapter with the RTX 4090 that converts a quartet of traditional 8-pin PCIe connectors to the new mini-12-pin design, should you need one, though ATX 3.0 power supplies are also coming down the pipeline that will natively sport the mini PCIe 5.0 connector and are able to supply enough power to beasts like the RTX 4090 through a single cable. We should point out, however, not all of NVIDIA\u2019s board partners have adopted the mini-12-pin connector on their designs; some will stick with full-sized 8-pin connectors on their cards.\n\r\nIn addition to being able to feed the cards with copious power, NVIDIA has also optimized the VRM on the GeForce RTX 4090 for better performance, and the cards\u2019 cooling solution has been optimized to better manage the heat that comes with using all that power.\n\r\nThe GeForce RTX 4090\u2019s PCB is outfitted with 23 power phases (20 for the GPU, 3 for the memory). And full PID transient control is supported, for what NVIDIA claims is a 10x increase in power management response times. These advancements allow GeForce RTX 40 series cards to respond to workload demands much faster than previous-gen cards, and overall power delivery should be more reliable and consistent. \nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Card And Cooler\r\nAlthough the cooling solution on the GeForce RTX 4090 looks similar to the RTX 3090\u2019s, it has been internally redesigned. The GeForce RTX 4090 has slightly larger, higher-performing fans, a new vapor chamber design, and a new heatsink layout. The new design results in 20% more airflow and it pulls heat away from the GPU more efficiently, without generating more noise. By using higher density, more power efficient memory (built by Micron on a more advanced process) NVIDIA was able to situate all of the RAM on one side of the PCB. The new cooler design also makes better contact with the memory. All told, memory temperatures should remain roughly 10\u00b0C cooler than previous-gen cards and, as you\u2019ll see a little later, the GPU doesn\u2019t get particularly warm either, even after hours of sustained load.\n\r\nSimilar to previous high-end Founder\u2019s Edition cards, the GeForce RTX 4090\u2019s cooler is outfitted with dual axial fans, and it features a split, pass-through heatsink design. The pass-through cooler on the GeForce RTX 4090 is partially enabled by its dense, short PCB. One end of the heatsink is attached to a vapor chamber, that\u2019s mounted directly to the GPU and memory. The fan above that section directs air through the heatsink and immediately funnels it out of the chassis through large vents in the RTX 4090\u2019s case bracket. The heatsink on the back half of the card, which is linked to the front vapor chamber via multiple heat-pipes, allows air from the second fan to pass all the way through the card, where it is propelled upward and is eventually exhausted from a system, assuming it\u2019s got decent ventilation.\n\r\nLike the RTX 3090, the new GeForce RTX 4090 is one heck of a big graphics card. In fact, it\u2019s slightly wider than a 3090 and measures in at 304mm (L) x 137mm (H) and requires 3-slots (61mm). As we\u2019re sure you\u2019ve seen in the many memes floating around the last couple of weeks, many partner boards are even larger.\n\r\nThe GeForce RTX 4090 has triple full-sized DisplayPorts (1.4a) and a single HDMI 2.1 output, also similar to previous-gen cards.  Ada\u2019s display engine hasn\u2019t been updated significantly versus Ampere, mostly due to timing according to NVIDIA. The Ada Lovelace design was locked in before newer display output standards had been finalized.\n\r\nIn terms of feature support, there\u2019s a lot more to mention like, NVIDIA Reflex latency reduction technology, NVIDIA Broadcast, Ansel, G-SYNC, Omniverse, optional Studio drivers, and GeForce Experience, to name just a few. Almost everything supported by previous-gen cards is also supported by Ada Lovelace and the RTX 40 series \u2013 except NVLink. You\u2019ll notice there\u2019s no NVLink connector on the RTX 4090, so traditional SLI setups are no more.\n\r\nWhen you see how fast the GeForce RTX 4090 is, however, you probably won\u2019t care...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, graphics, GPU, PC gaming, (nasdaq:nvda), ada-lovelace, geforce rtx 4090\n\n\n\nRelated content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Review: Ada Dominates PC Graphics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel Arc A770 And A750 Limited Edition Review: Putting Alchemist To The Test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel 13th Gen Core Processors Revealed: Raptor Lake Unleashed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 7900X And 7950X CPU Review: Fantastic Zen 4 Performance Gains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Architecture Overview: Ada's Special Sauce Unveiled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT STUFF IN PC COMPONENTS\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Review: Ada...\nIntel Arc A770 And A750 Limited Edition...\nIntel 13th Gen Core Processors Revealed:...\nAMD Ryzen 9 7900X And 7950X CPU Review:...\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Architecture...\nAdata Elite SE880 External SSD Review:...\nDrop+ LOTR Mechanical Keyboard Review: A...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEEP INFORMED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSITE\n\nHome\n\n\nReviews\n\n\nNews\n\n\nBlogs\n\nFull Site\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nPC Components\n\n\nSystems\n\n\nMobile\n\n\nIT Infrastructure\n\n\nLeisure\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nCOMPANY\n\nAbout\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nNews Tips\n\n\nContact\n\n\nPrivacy And Terms\n\n\nHotTech\n\n\n\nMORE\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nShop\n\n\n\nSTAY CONNECTED\n\nTwitter\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            As an Amazon and Howl Technologies Associate, HotHardware earns a commission from qualifying purchases made on this site.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Dave Altavilla is a Tech Analyst covering chips, compute and AI.Follow AuthorOct 11, 2022, 03:58pm EDTShareSaveCommentThis article is more than 2 years old.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition Graphics Card In Retail BoxDave Altavilla\nWhen NVIDIA stepped out with its new GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards and Ada Lovelace GPU architecture back in September, it was widely anticipated that these next-gen GeForce cards would bring newfound levels of performance for PC gamers. And indeed that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve seen. My colleague Marco\u2019s GeForce RTX 4090 review at HotHardware shows how NVIDIA has laid down the gauntlet, delivering a huge uplift in gaming performance across the board, sometimes by as much as 2 or 3X. However, GPUs aren\u2019t just great for gaming workloads, and NVIDIA\u2019s new GeForce RTX 4090 is also one beastly content creation machine with serious GPU-compute chops as well.\n\n\nYes, NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 4090 Is A Beastly Card For Gamers\nI\u2019ve previously covered the GeForce RTX 40 Series and Ada Lovelace GPUs here on Forbes, so I\u2019d invite you to check that out if you\u2019d like a quick-take refresh on what comprises NVIDIA\u2019s Ada architecture. These new cutting-edge GPUs and software bring real innovation for PC gamers, from DLSS 3 upscaling to advancements in ray tracing acceleration.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Vs GeForce RTX 4090 Speeds, Core Counts And FeedsNVIDIA\n\nAnd of course, the new $1599.99 GeForce RTX 4090 also brings a ton of brute force silicon and clock speed-derived performance gains in gaming as well...\nGeForce RTX 4090 F1 2022 Game Benchmark PerformanceHotHardware.com\nGeForce RTX 4090 Is Also A Monster Engine For Creator And Designer WorkloadsNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Display Outputs And Cooler Close-UpDave Altavilla\n\n\nBeyond gaming, however, NVIDIA\u2019s new flagship Founders Edition graphics card also brings massive gains in rendering and GPU compute-accelerated content creation. For example, when you look at the very popular open source 3D creation and rendering suite, Blender, the results are stark and stunning...\n\nGeForce RTX 4090 Blender Render Benchmark ResultsHotHardware.com\n\n\nBlender harnesses RT (ray tracing) cores on board GeForce cards and the NVIDIA OptiX framework that further accelerates these workloads, hence why AMD is so far behind here. However, when you compare the gen-on-gen performance, we\u2019re treated to over a 2X gain versus NVIDIA\u2019s fastest GeForce RTX 30 series card, the RTX 3090 Ti.GeForce RTX 4090 LuxMark Benchmark ResultsHotHardware.com\nLuxMark is an OpenCL accelerated 3D rendering benchmark as well. The LuxRender rendering engine, that\u2019s available as a free license plugin for software suites like Maya and 3DS Max, supports high dynamic range (HDR) lighting and various material types for photo-realistic scenery and artwork. As you scan see here, the competition is a little tighter between NVIDIA and AMD, except for when it comes to the GeForce RTX 4090 scores, which leave all the others in the dust.\nAda Delivers Lower Power Consumption Versus The Previous Gen As WellNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090Dave Altavilla\nFinally, what\u2019s perhaps most impressive to me is that NVIDIA\u2019s new AD102 GPU that powers the GeForce RTX 4090 is comprised of roughly 2.7X the number of transistors (28 billion in Ampere GA102 vs 76 billion in Ada AD102) but yet still has a physically smaller die size (608mm2 vs 628mm2) on TSMC\u2019s 4N process node. And it delivers these major performance gains at less average power consumption than the previous-gen GeForce RTX 3090 Ti, despite its voracious need for 3 or 4 8-pin PCIe power connectors feeding its 12-pin PCIe 5 power dongle connector.\nThis to me is the mark of true design elegance and process optimization. I\u2019m looking forward to testing the more mainstream GeForce RTX 4080 series cards as well, to see what kind of performance-per-watt gains they bring.\nThe next testing battleground will be to see what NVIDIA\u2019s new GeForce RTX 40 series can do versus AMD\u2019s next-gen RDNA 3-based Radeon RX 7000 series. It\u2019s sure to be a slugfest in the trenches that\u2019s for sure, but we\u2019ll have to see if Team Radeon can measure up to the kind of GPU brains and brawn NVIDIA has delivered today.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

The Founders Edition graphics cards will exist alongside the huge lineup of custom models which we also have prepped and ready for our review. But today, we can only provide you with our unboxing and first look at these cards.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition is an absolute mammoth of a design. It is heavier and also features several optimizations to the heatsink that allow the Ada Lovelace GPUs sitting in it to run cool and quiet.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 \"Ada Lovelace\" Founders Edition Graphics Card Unboxing\nSo let's get started by unboxing this behemoth of a graphics card and start by taking a look at the packing first.\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition comes within a large box that weighs around 6Kg and has a rectangular shape. The whole box features a matte black color with the NVIDIA logo on the top left corner and the GeForce RTX 4090 logo below it.\n\nIf you flip the box vertically, you will see that it resembles an Xbox Series X console and it is also the same height. The side features an outline of the Founders Edition cooler.\n\nThe box will come as a standard with all NVIDIA RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16 GB Founders Edition cards.\n\nThe top and bottom of the box are two separate compartments. The top opens up and the end result looks like a rectangle.\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition graphics card rests at the center of the packaging & you can see the creative take from NVIDIA in designing this package.\n\nOnce the box is open, you finally get to lay your eyes on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card which looks as spectacular as ever.\n\nThe card may look like it is the same design as the RTX 3090 Ti Founders Edition but it is a slightly updated version which we will explain in a bit.\n\nA cover that exposes a lid sits underneath the card and can be easily pulled to reveal another package.\n\nThis package contains a few manuals and also one of the most important accessories that NVIDIA ships with its Founders Edition card.\n\nif you guessed the 16-pin (12VHPWR) connector, then you guessed right. This is an NVIDIA-branded adapter and comes with a single 16-pin to four 8-pin connectors. This is rated to provide up to 600 Watts of power to the chip.\n\nFollowing is what the 16-pin connector looks like. You may have already seen and heard about it in several articles from us but you can note that there are 12 standard pins and four smaller pins on the connector.\n\nOut of the box, we can finally start taking a much better look at the Ada Lovelace powerhouse/\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 \"Ada Lovelace\" Founders Edition Graphics Card Close Up\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition is a true BFGPU. A big chunky card that will take a good amount of room within your PC.\n\nThe card comes in a triple-slot design and you can see the several exhaust vents that are there to push air out of the chassis.\n\nOn the bottom of the shroud, you can see three plastic panels that cover the main heatsink and the largest one features the \"RTX 4090\" branding on it.\n\nThe back of the card is encircled by the large die-cast aluminum piece, forming an \"X\" shape in the center.\n\nThe card features a dual-axial flow-through design. This design incorporates two fans placed on different sides of the shroud (one front and one back) and perpendicular to one another.\n\nThe fan at the bottom pushes air out of the aluminum fins on the backplate.\n\nAs you can see, the card is super thick in terms of design and all of this thickness is there to hold the massive aluminum fins and heat pipes that run through the shroud.\n\nYou can find a nice \"GeForce RTX\" logo on the card which features LEDs. A similar LED can also be found within the shroud on the back.\n\nThe card comes with a single 16-pin power connector that uses the aforementioned 12VHPWR plug that's bundled with the card.\n\nThe new Founders Edition cooler comes with 10% larger fan sizes and 10% larger fin volume. This is all to help the card running super cool and also super quiet.\n\nOnce again, you can lay your eyes on the RTX 4090 logo which comes with a new font style. This will be applicable across all RTX 40 series cards.\n\nNVIDIA has taken away some of that aluminum frame room and cut out the corners to make space for the larger fans.\n\nThe front side of the card is an aluminum heatsink. These large heatsink block show that there's some serious cooling involved to keep the card running.\n\nThere's a nice little \"RTX 4090\" logo carved out on one of the four aluminum arms on the front of the shroud.\n\nLastly, we can just tell you that the card feels very premium and very awesome when running on the PC. We can't talk about any temps, noise, power, or performance figures at the moment but be assured that those will be coming in real soon too.\nWe also want to give you a small taste of the few custom models that we have with us right now. We will have at least four custom models ready for review day but enjoy these two for now:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 'Official' Specifications - $1599 US Pricing\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 will use 128 SMs of the 144 SMs for a total of 16,384 CUDA cores. The GPU will come packed with 96 MB of L2 cache and a total of 512 TMUs and 176 ROPs which is simply insane. The clock speeds are rated at 2230 MHz base and 2520 MHz boost considering that the TSMC 4N process is being used. NVIDIA is claiming over 3 GHz speeds with overclocking which you can read more about here. The card can deliver up to 83 TFLOPs of FP32 horsepower at stock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nAs for memory specs, the GeForce RTX 4090 features 24 GB GDDR6X capacities that are clocked at 21 Gbps speeds across a 384-bit bus interface. This will provide up to 1 TB/s of bandwidth. This is the same bandwidth as the existing RTX 3090 Ti graphics card and as far as the power consumption is concerned, the TBP is rated at 450W. The card will be powered by a single 16-pin connector which delivers up to 600W of power. Custom models will be offering higher TBP targets.\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU officially launches\u00a0on October 12th, when NVIDIA and custom card partners' designs become available to the public.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series Official Specs:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 DNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAda Lovelace AD102-300Ada Lovelace AD102-250Ada Lovelace AD103-300Ada Lovelace AD104-400Ada Lovelace AD104-250Ada Lovelace AD106-350Ada Lovelace AD107-400\n\n\nProcess NodeTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4N\n\n\nDie Size608mm2608mm2378.6mm2294.5mm2294.5mm2190.0mm2146.0mm2\n\n\nTransistors76 Billion76 Billion45.9 Billion35.8 Billion35.8 Billion22.9 BillionTBD\n\n\nCUDA Cores163841459297287680588843523072\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs512 / 176TBD320 / 112240 / 80184 / 64136 / 48TBD\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores512 / 128456 / 128304 / 76240 / 60184 / 46136 / 34TBD\n\n\nL2 Cache72 MB72 MB64 MB48 MB36 MB32 MB24 MB\n\n\nBase Clock2230 MHz2280 MHz2210 MHz2310 MHz1920 MHz2310 MHz1830 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock2520 MHz2520 MHz2510 MHz2610 MHz2475 MHz2535 MHz2460 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute83 TFLOPsTBD49 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs29 TFLOPs22 TFLOPs15 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPs191 TFLOPsTBD113 TFLOPs82 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs51 TFLOPs35 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPs1321 TOPsTBD780 TOPs641 TOPs466 TOPs353 TOPs242 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity24 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X16 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X8-16 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus384-bit384-bit256-bit192-bit192-bit128-bit128-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed21.0 Gbps21.0 Gbps23.0 Gbps21.0 Gbps21.0 Gbps18.0 Gbps17.0 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth1008 GB/s1008 GB/s736 GB/s504 GB/s504 GB/s288 GB/s\n(554 GB/s Effective)272 GB/s\n(453 GB/s Effective)\n\n\nTBP450W425W320W285W200W160-165W115W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$1599 US / 1949 EU12,999 RMB (China-Only)$1199 US / 1469 EU$799 US$599 US$399-$499 US$299 US\n\n\nPrice (Current)$1599 US / 1859 EU12,999 RMB (China-Only)$1199 US / 1399 EU$799 US$599 US$399-$499 US$299 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)12th October 202228th December 202316th November 20225th January 202313th April 202324th May / 18th July 202329th June 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs;

The lowest-end of the initially announce RTX 40 series cards, the RTX 4080 12GB had attracted significant criticism since it\u2019s announcement for bifurcating the 4080 tier between two cards that didn\u2019t even share a common GPU. Seemingly bowing to the pressure of those complaints, NVIDIA has removed the card from their RTX 40 series lineup, as well as cancelling its November launch.\nNVIDIA\u2019s brief message reads as follows:\n\nThe RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it\u2019s not named right. Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing.\n\r\nSo, we\u2019re pressing the \u201cunlaunch\u201d button on the 4080 12GB. The RTX 4080 16GB is amazing and on track to delight gamers everywhere on November 16th.\n\r\nIf the lines around the block and enthusiasm for the 4090 is any indication, the reception for the 4080 will be awesome.\n\nNVIDIA is not providing any further details about their future plans for the AD104-based video card at this time. However given the circumstances, it\u2019s a reasonable assumption right now that NVIDIA now intends to launch it at a later time, with a different part number.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nRTX 4090\nRTX 4080 16GB\nRTX 4080 12GB\r\n\t\t\t(Cancelled)\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n16384\n9728\n7680\n\n\nROPs\n176\n112\n80\n\n\nBoost Clock\n2520MHz\n2505MHz\n2610MHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n21Gbps GDDR6X\n22.4Gbps GDDR6X\n21Gbps GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n384-bit\n256-bit\n192-bit\n\n\nVRAM\n24GB\n16GB\n12GB\n\n\nSingle Precision Perf.\n82.6 TFLOPS\n48.7 TFLOPS\n40.1 TFLOPS\n\n\nTensor Perf.

While both RTX 4080 parts shared a common architecture, they did not share a common GPU. Or, for that matter, common performance.\nThe RTX 4080 12GB, as it was, would have been based on the smaller AD104 GPU, rather than the AD103 GPU used for the 16GB model. In practice, this would have caused the 12GB model to deliver only about 82% of the former\u2019s shader/tensor throughput, and just 70% of the memory bandwidth. A sizable performance gap that NVIDIA\u2019s own figures ahead of the launch have all but confirmed.\n\nNVIDIA, for its part, is no stranger to overloading a product line in this fashion, with similarly-named parts delivering unequal performance and the difference denoted solely by their VRAM capacity. This was a practice that started with the GTX 1060 series, and continued with the RTX 3080 series. However, the performance gap between the RTX 4080 parts was far larger than anything NVIDIA has previously done, bringing a good deal more attention to the problems that come from having such disparate parts sharing a common product name.\n\nOf equal criticism has been NVIDIA\u2019s decision to sell an AD104 part as an RTX 4080 card to begin with. Traditionally in NVIDIA\u2019s product stack, the next card below the xx80 card is some form of xx70 card. And while video card names and GPU identifiers are essentially arbitrary, NVIDIA\u2019s early performance figures painted a picture of a card that would have performed a lot like the kind of card most people would expect from the RTX 4070 \u2013 delivering performance upwards of 20% (or more) behind the better RTX 4080, and on-par with the last-generation flagship, the RTX 3090 Ti. In other words, there has been a great deal of suspicion within the enthusiast community that NVIDIA was attempting to sell what otherwise would have been the RTX 4070 as an RTX 4080, while carrying a higher price to match.\nIn any case, those plans are now officially scuttled. Whatever NVIDIA has planned for their AD104-based RTX 40 series card is something only the company knows at this time. Meanwhile come November 16th when the RTX 4080 series launches, the 16GB AD103-based cards will be the only offerings available, with prices starting at $1199.\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n100 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nnandnandnand - Friday, October 14, 2022 - link\nIt is now safe to upgrade to the RTX 4070 12 GB.\n\n\n\nTheRealArdrid - Friday, October 14, 2022 - link\nNot if it's still priced at $900.\n\n\n\nhaukionkannel - Friday, October 14, 2022 - link\nNo...

Microsoft chose NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs, along with NVIDIA Mosaic and Quadro Sync technology, which provided support for the demanding visualizations across displays and enabled viewers to see everything as one unified visual.\nAll images courtesy of Microsoft.\nPutting High-Quality Graphics on Full Display\nThe display walls in Microsoft Experience Centers feature many detailed visuals and scenes that require powerful graphics-computing performance. The HD walls display changing, detailed renders of various Microsoft products. These graphics are created with custom camera angles and fly-throughs.\nOnce the visuals were created, the team had to synchronize the graphics and ensure the systems were appearing in unison. In each Microsoft Experience Center, the team uses a visualization cluster of up to six systems, with a pair of RTX A6000 GPUs in each. Unreal Engine with nDisplay technology was used to make the Microsoft Video Player work in a cluster setting.\n\n\u201cNVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs provide the smooth and powerful performance that is required to run high-quality visuals across a large number of displays,\u201d said Chris Haklitch, principal PM lead at Microsoft. \u201cThe enterprise reliability and support NVIDIA provides, along with the software and hardware only available with professional RTX GPUs, helped make our vision possible.\u201d\nWith NVIDIA Mosaic multi-display technology, Microsoft can treat multiple displays as a single desktop, without application software changes or visual artifacts. This enabled the walls of HD displays to be shown as a single unified visual.\nNVIDIA Quadro Sync II is a key technology that enables all displays to appear as a single continuous image. Designed for flexibility and scalability, Quadro Sync helps connect and synchronize the NVIDIA RTX GPUs to its attached displays.\nMicrosoft also used an NVIDIA Enterprise Management Toolkit called NVWMI, which lets IT administrators create scripts and programs for many administrative tasks and functions. With NVWMI, Microsoft can remotely monitor the GPU-powered display environments, ensuring simple access to adjust display settings. Microsoft also used NVWMI to monitor the GPU thermals and performance to meet the demands of ongoing store operation.\nNVIDIA Mosaic, Quadro Sync and NVWMI are professional software features that are only available with NVIDIA RTX professional GPUs.\nLearn more about NVIDIA RTX professional solutions for deploying scalable visualizations.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | Graphics | NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nWatch On \nNvidia's RTX 4090 Founders Edition has arrived and is primed for testing and benchmarks, getting ready to take on the best graphics cards and lay claim to the pole position in our GPU benchmarks hierarchy. How fast can Ada Lovelace run, and how much does she weigh? Those are not questions you're supposed to ask a lady! Shame on you. (2186g, if you really want to know.)\n\nCard dimensions are nearly the same as the previous generation RTX 3090 Founders Edition, 305x136x61mm. The RTX 3090 Founders Edition by way of reference was 313x138x54mm (those are my measurements), so the two designs definitely aren't identical. Ada is apparently 8mm shorter and 7mm thicker, though the 3-gram difference in weight certainly won't be noticed.\n\nAlong with a slight change in dimensions, the fans on the RTX 4090 Founders Edition are much larger. The \"back\" fan (on the side with the larger RTX 4090 logo) is 115mm in diameter, where the same fan on the 3090 FE was 110mm. The \"front\" fan (on the side with with all the fins and closest to the video ports) also measured 115mm in diameter on the 4090, compared to 110mm on the 3090 FE. But it's not just the diameter that have changed, as the inner hub is smaller as well \u2014 38mm diameter on 4090 vs 42mm on 3090. All told, Nvidia says the new fans improve airflow by 20%.Image 1 of 15(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)We're not going to walk through the unboxing process, as the embedded video will do a better job if you want more detail, but Nvidia clearly isn't skimping on packaging. Suffice it to say that the RTX 4090 Founders Edition comes in a new, larger box with plenty of padding to keep it safe during shipping.\n\nSuperficially, it's easy to come to the conclusion that nothing much has changed with the 4090 design compared to the 3090. The card does have a larger volume, however, and there's a slight curvature to the silver sides (top and back, mostly). That has to be for aesthetic reasons rather than something that will make the card run cooler.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)One interesting tidbit is that Nvidia mentioned at one point that the 4090 FE would include a triple-8-pin to 16-pin power adapter for those that don't have an ATX 3.0 power supply with the new 12VHPWR 16-pin connector. Opening up the packaging, however, we find a quad-8-pin to 16-pin adapter. You have to wonder if Nvidia was thinking about going with a 600W TBP and decided to tone things down, or if the extra connector is to provide overclocking headroom.\n\nElsewhere, the card still comes with the usual triple DisplayPort and single HDMI video outputs. We're frankly surprised that Nvidia stuck with DP 1.4a and HDMI 2.1, rather than upgrading to DisplayPort 2.0. Except, as we noted in our Intel Arc A770 review, there are no DisplayPort 2.0 monitors yet, and the specifications have become a bit muddled. Intel opted for UHBR 10 \u2014 Ultra High Bit Rate, 10 Gb/s per lane, 40 Gb/s maximum \u2014 on it's DP 2.0 ports, omitting both UHBR 13.5 and UHBR 20 support.\n\nThe RTX 4090 and other Ada Lovelace GPUs can still support 8K at 60 Hz, or 4K at 165 Hz, but they require DSC (Display Stream Compression) to get there \u2014 and while DSC is \"visually lossless,\" that's not the same as truly lossless. Without DSC, DP1.4a maxes out at 3840x2160 and 98Hz with full 8-bit RGB color. UHBR 20 would have allowed up to 8K and 92 Hz with uncompressed signals and 8-bit color, or 74 Hz with 10-bit HDR color, and DSC could have pushed 8K and 120 Hz or higher. But again, we need the monitors and TVs before that would really matter, and that might not happen for several more years.Image 1 of 5(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Here's a gallery of side-by-side photos comparing the RTX 3090 FE with the RTX 4090 FE. (Don't mind the dust on the RTX 3090 card; it's been well-loved over the past two years!) It's far more obvious in these shots how the fans and dimensions of the cards have changed.\n\nIf your PC already has an RTX 3090 Founders Edition (or a 3090 Ti FE for that matter), you're probably fine with the RTX 4090 FE, unless you're really cramped on clearance. But if you're cramped on clearance, that's not a good thing with cards that can consume 350W or more power. Basically, we recommend using a more spacious ATX case for extreme GPUs like the 3090 and 4090 \u2014 leave the mini-ITX stuff behind.\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nWatch On \nImage 1 of 16(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Do you prefer something other than Nvidia's reference design Founders Edition? We wouldn't blame you, as anyone spending this much money on an RTX 4090 will likely want factory overclocks, enhanced cooling, and maybe some other extras.\n\nThe MSI RTX 4090 Suprim Liquid X ticks all of those boxes, with a 240mm radiator helping to keep the card frosty. One of the nice things about liquid-cooled graphics cards is that the radiator effectively moves a lot of the weight away from the PCIe slot and over to the case. It also allows for a relatively svelte dual-slot graphics card, though the total size of the card plus radiator ends up being even larger.\n\nMSI doesn't have the GPU clocks listed on its specifications page yet... and we're not sure we're allowed to tell you. It also doesn't list a TBP (Total Board Power), but it includes a quad-8-pin to 16-pin adapter, so we might actually see a 600W card. \u00a0We're also waiting to find out the official price for this liquid cooled monster. Hint: not cheap!\n\nWe'll be testing the card and posting the review next week, though, so hang tight.\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nWatch On \nNext up is the Asus RTX 4090 ROG Strix OC. This card actually \"wins\" in the bigger is better battle, tipping the scales at 2508g and with dimensions of 357.6x149.3x70.1mm according to Asus. It's also a factory overclock with a default Gaming mode boost clock of 2610 MHz (90 MHz higher than the Founders Edition) and an OC mode boost clock of 2640 MHz.\n\nAs with other RTX 4090 models, the Strix card comes with a quad-8-ping to 16-pin adapter. These adapters all appear to come direct from Nvidia, as the company's name is on the part. Asus doesn't list a specific TBP for the Strix but does recommend a 1000W PSU. Asus also notes that it assumes both CPU and GPU overclocks when it makes that recommendation, so perhaps the card \"only\" uses around 500W.\n\nOne thing that sets the Asus card apart from the other 4090 models we've seen so far is it's inclusion of two HDMI 2.1 outputs along with three DisplayPort 1.4a outputs. Only four displays can be active at the same time, but giving users two HDMI connections provides a bit more flexibility.\n\nWe're still waiting for the official word on pricing from Asus, but we typically expect about a $200 premium for ROG Strix models in the upper echelon, sometimes more. Then again, with the collapse of cryptocurrency mining on GPUs, perhaps there's a chance we'll start to see prices trend back toward some semblance of normalcy.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)We have some additional RTX 4090 graphics cards from AIB (add-in board) partners slated to arrive in the near future. We'll update this article with additional unboxing photos and videos as they come, while we look forward to the actual launch date.\n\nWe're not allowed to give benchmarks or any indication of independent performance testing yet, though Nvidia has already shared some of its own benchmarks. Big ticket items for the Ada Lovelace GPUs include support for the new DLSS 3 algorithm, over 50% more GPU shaders, and other enhancements to the architecture that could potentially boost performance by 2X or more \u2014 that's according to Nvidia.\n\nThe launch date is set for October 12, with a starting price of $1,599 for the RTX 4090 Founders Edition. We can only hope that supply is sufficient to keep scalpers from ruining the launch party. Meanwhile, if you're not already running an 850W or better PSU, it might be time for an upgrade should you plan on adding an RTX 4090 to your PC.

EVGA leaving thanks to mistreatment, the PSU confusion, the lying about their 4070/4060ti actually being a 4080 (lol) and now this insult to anyone who doesn't like having a massive setup. \n\nI am buying parts for an ATX system right now in the Define 7, but the plan is to build in the Lian Li Q58 next, which is a mini-ITX case, because I love SFF builds I've seen online. It's just not going to be possible with cards of this size, especially if it's a custom loop that has to accommodate a res, a rad, the pipes, etc.\n\nThis is not how you give your community faith in your business, guys...\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 12 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsus' mini supercomputer taps Nvidia Grace Blackwell chip for 1,000 AI TOPS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHP's new Omen 16 Slim goes up to an RTX 5070 and is 16% slimmer than its predecessor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHP updates its OmniBook X line with a lattice-free keyboard, processors from AMD and Intel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Jensen Huang\u2019s Nvidia GTC 2025 keynote here \u2014 Blackwell 300 AI GPUs expected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU meets PCIe-based hard drives: Seagate and Nvidia demo NVMe HDDs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD's beastly Ryzen AI Max+ 395 comes to a new GMKTec mini-PC, and AMD's Lisa Su appears to approve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel finally releases the XeSS 2.0 SDK for developers \u2014 Technology still gated by closed-source barriers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070-series GPU supply to stabilize after April claims AIB partner Yeston\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew undersea cable tech listens for sabotage \u2014 can be retrofitted to existing fiber optic lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm debuts new Snapdragon G handheld gaming PC chips to compete with Intel and AMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Nvidia is still launching its RTX 4080 16GB model in November.by  Tom WarrenOct 14, 2022, 4:30 PM UTCLinkFacebookThreadsIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.Image: NvidiaTom Warren is a senior editor and author of Notepad, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.Nvidia is pausing the launch of its upcoming 12GB RTX 4080 graphics card. After originally unveiling the 12GB RTX 4080 last month alongside a much more powerful 16GB model, Nvidia now admits it messed up with the naming. \u201cThe RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it\u2019s not named right,\u201d says Nvidia in a blog post. \u201cHaving two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing.\u201dNvidia is now pausing the launch of the 12GB RTX 4080 model but will still go ahead and launch the 16GB version on November 16th.Criticism had been building over Nvidia\u2019s decision to label the 12GB model as an RTX 4080, particularly when the 16GB model was so different. The RTX 4080 12GB was supposed to start at $899 and include 7,680 CUDA Cores, a 2.31GHz base clock that boosts up to 2.61GHz, 639 Tensor-TFLOPs, 92 RT-TFLOPs, and 40 Shader-TFLOPs. The 16GB RTX 4080 is much more powerful, with 9,728 CUDA Cores, a base clock of 2.21GHz that boosts up to 2.51GHz, 780 Tensor-TFLOPs, 113 RT-TFLOPs, and 49 Shader-TFLOPs of power.It now means that anyone hoping for a more reasonably priced RTX 40-series card is now going to have to wait longer. The RTX 4080 16GB model will debut next month, priced from $1,199, and Nvidia hasn\u2019t revealed when it plans to relaunch the 12GB RTX 4080 under a different name.See More: EntertainmentGamingNewsNvidiaPC GamingTechMost PopularMost PopularAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsLeaked Apple meeting shows how dire the Siri situation really isThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

However, as the launch comes close, the company has now updated the specifications to reflect more realistic expectations and as it turns out, the flagship and fastest chip for the AI segment is, even more, faster now.\nRelated Story Chinese AI Lab DeepSeek Has 50,000 NVIDIA H100 AI GPUs, Says AI CEO\n\nOne reason why the compute numbers have seen a boost is because when the chip goes through production, the GPU manufacturer can finalize the numbers based on actual clock speeds. It is likely that NVIDIA used conservative clock figures to provide the preliminary performance figures and as the production hit full swing, the company saw that the chip can offer much better clocks.\nLast month at GTC, NVIDIA confirmed that their Hopper H100 GPU was under full production and partners will be rolling out the first wave of products in October this year. It was also confirmed that the global rollout for Hopper will include three phases, the first will be pre-orders for NVIDIA DGX H100 systems & free hands of labs to customers directly from NVIDIA with systems such as Dell's Power Edge servers which are now available on NVIDIA LaunchPad.\nNVIDIA Hopper H100 GPU Specifications At A Glance\nSo coming to the specifications, the NVIDIA Hopper GH100 GPU is composed of a massive 144 SM (Streaming Multiprocessor) chip layout which is featured in a total of 8 GPCs. These GPCs rock total of 9 TPCs which are further composed of 2 SM units each. This gives us 18 SMs per GPC and 144 on the complete 8 GPC configuration. Each SM is composed of up to 128 FP32 units which should give us a total of 18,432 CUDA cores.\n\nFollowing are some of the configurations you can expect from the H100 chip:\nThe full implementation of the GH100 GPU includes the following units:\n\n8 GPCs, 72 TPCs (9 TPCs/GPC), 2 SMs/TPC, 144 SMs per full GPU\n128 FP32 CUDA Cores per SM, 18432 FP32 CUDA Cores per full GPU\n4 Fourth-Generation Tensor Cores per SM, 576 per full GPU\n6 HBM3 or HBM2e stacks, 12 512-bit Memory Controllers\n60 MB L2 Cache\nFourth-Generation NVLink and PCIe Gen 5\n\nThe NVIDIA H100 GPU with SXM5 board form-factor includes the following units:\n\n8 GPCs, 66 TPCs, 2 SMs/TPC, 132 SMs per GPU\n128 FP32 CUDA Cores per SM, 16896 FP32 CUDA Cores per GPU\n4 Fourth-generation Tensor Cores per SM, 528 per GPU\n80 GB HBM3, 5 HBM3 stacks, 10 512-bit Memory Controllers\n50 MB L2 Cache\nFourth-Generation NVLink and PCIe Gen 5\n\nThis is a 2.25x increase over the full GA100 GPU configuration. NVIDIA is also leveraging more FP64, FP16 & Tensor cores within its Hopper GPU which would drive up performance immensely. And that's going to be a necessity to rival Intel's Ponte Vecchio which is also expected to feature 1:1 FP64. NVIDIA states that the 4th Gen Tensor Cores on Hopper deliver 2 times the performance at the same clock.\n\nThe following NVIDIA Hopper H100 performance breakdown shows that the additional SMs are only a 20% performance increase. The main benefit comes from the 4th Gen Tensor Cores and the FP8 compute the path. Higher frequency also adds a decent 30% uplift to the mix.\n\nAn interesting comparison that points out GPU scaling shows that a single GPC on a Hopper H100 GPU is equivalent to a Kepler GK110 GPU, a flagship HPC chip from 2012. The Kepler GK110 housed a total of 15 SMs whereas the Hopper H110 GPU packs 132 SMs and even a singular GPC on the Hopper GPU features 18 SMs, 20% more than the entirety of SMs on the Kepler flagship.\n\nThe cache is another space where NVIDIA has given much attention, upping it to 48 MB in the Hopper GH100 GPU. This is a 20% increase over the 50 MB cache featured on the Ampere GA100 GPU and 3x the size of AMD's flagship Aldebaran MCM GPU, the MI250X.\nRounding up the performance figures, NVIDIA's GH100 Hopper GPU will offer 4000 TFLOPs of FP8, 2000 TFLOPs of FP16, 1000 TFLOPs of TF32, 67 TFLOPs of FP32 and 34 TFLOPs of FP64 Compute performance. These record-shattering figures decimate all other HPC accelerators that came before it. For comparison, this is 3.3x faster than NVIDIA's own A100 GPU and 28% faster than AMD's Instinct MI250X in the FP64 compute. In FP16 compute, the H100 GPU is 3x faster than A100 and 5.2x faster than MI250X which is literally bonkers.\nThe PCIe variant which is a cut-down model was recently listed over in Japan for over $30,000 US so one can imagine that the SXM variant with a beefier configuration will easily cost around $50 grand.\nNVIDIA HPC / AI GPUs\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Tesla Graphics CardNVIDIA B200NVIDIA H200 (SXM5)NVIDIA H100 (SMX5)NVIDIA H100 (PCIe)NVIDIA A100 (SXM4)NVIDIA A100 (PCIe4)Tesla V100S (PCIe)Tesla V100 (SXM2)Tesla P100 (SXM2)Tesla P100\n(PCI-Express)Tesla M40\n(PCI-Express)Tesla K40\n(PCI-Express)\n\n\n\n\nGPUB200H200 (Hopper)H100 (Hopper)H100 (Hopper)A100 (Ampere)A100 (Ampere)GV100 (Volta)GV100 (Volta)GP100 (Pascal)GP100 (Pascal)GM200 (Maxwell)GK110 (Kepler)\n\n\nProcess Node4nm4nm4nm4nm7nm7nm12nm12nm16nm16nm28nm28nm\n\n\nTransistors208 Billion80 Billion80 Billion80 Billion54.2 Billion54.2 Billion21.1 Billion21.1 Billion15.3 Billion15.3 Billion8 Billion7.1 Billion\n\n\nGPU Die SizeTBD814mm2814mm2814mm2826mm2826mm2815mm2815mm2610 mm2610 mm2601 mm2551 mm2\n\n\nSMs160132132114108108808056562415\n\n\nTPCs806666575454404028282415\n\n\nL2 Cache SizeTBD51200 KB51200 KB51200 KB40960 KB40960 KB6144 KB6144 KB4096 KB4096 KB3072 KB1536 KB\n\n\nFP32 CUDA Cores Per SMTBD128128128646464646464128192\n\n\nFP64 CUDA Cores / SMTBD128128128323232323232464\n\n\nFP32 CUDA CoresTBD16896168961459269126912512051203584358430722880\n\n\nFP64 CUDA CoresTBD16896168961459234563456256025601792179296960\n\n\nTensor CoresTBD528528456432432640640N/AN/AN/AN/A\n\n\nTexture UnitsTBD528528456432432320320224224192240\n\n\nBoost ClockTBD~1850 MHz~1850 MHz~1650 MHz1410 MHz1410 MHz1601 MHz1530 MHz1480 MHz1329MHz1114 MHz875 MHz\n\n\nTOPs (DNN/AI)20,000 TOPs3958 TOPs3958 TOPs3200 TOPs2496 TOPs2496 TOPs130 TOPs125 TOPsN/AN/AN/AN/A\n\n\nFP16 Compute10,000 TFLOPs1979 TFLOPs1979 TFLOPs1600 TFLOPs624 TFLOPs624 TFLOPs32.8 TFLOPs30.4 TFLOPs21.2 TFLOPs18.7 TFLOPsN/AN/A\n\n\nFP32 Compute90 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs800 TFLOPs156 TFLOPs\n(19.5 TFLOPs standard)156 TFLOPs\n(19.5 TFLOPs standard)16.4 TFLOPs15.7 TFLOPs10.6 TFLOPs10.0 TFLOPs6.8 TFLOPs5.04 TFLOPs\n\n\nFP64 Compute45 TFLOPs34 TFLOPs34 TFLOPs48 TFLOPs19.5 TFLOPs\n(9.7 TFLOPs standard)19.5 TFLOPs\n(9.7 TFLOPs standard)8.2 TFLOPs7.80 TFLOPs5.30 TFLOPs4.7 TFLOPs0.2 TFLOPs1.68 TFLOPs\n\n\nMemory Interface8192-bit HBM45120-bit HBM3e5120-bit HBM35120-bit HBM2e6144-bit HBM2e6144-bit HBM2e4096-bit HBM24096-bit HBM24096-bit HBM24096-bit HBM2384-bit GDDR5384-bit GDDR5\n\n\nMemory SizeUp To 192 GB HBM3 @ 8.0 GbpsUp To 141 GB HBM3e @ 6.5 GbpsUp To 80 GB HBM3 @ 5.2 GbpsUp To 94 GB HBM2e @ 5.1 GbpsUp To 40 GB HBM2 @ 1.6 TB/s\nUp To 80 GB HBM2 @ 1.6 TB/sUp To 40 GB HBM2 @ 1.6 TB/s\nUp To 80 GB HBM2 @ 2.0 TB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 1134 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 900 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 732 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 732 GB/s\n12 GB HBM2 @ 549 GB/s24 GB GDDR5 @ 288 GB/s12 GB GDDR5 @ 288 GB/s\n\n\nTDP700W700W700W350W400W250W250W300W300W250W250W235W\n\n\n\n\nNews Source: Videocardz\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces GB200 NVL4 With Quad Blackwell GPUs & Dual Grace CPUs, H200 NVL Now Generally Available\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell Up To 2.2x Faster Than Hopper In MLPerf v4.1 AI Training Benchmarks, New World Records Set & Hopper Now Even Better\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Gets The \u201cGreen Signal\u201d By US To Sell Cutting-Edge H100 AI GPUs To The UAE Firm G42\n\nMuhammad Zuhair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon\u2019s \u2018Colossus\u2019 Supercomputer Built With 100K H100 NVIDIA GPUs Goes Online, H200 Upgrade Coming Soon\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n290\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n144\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n97\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n46\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales;

Log in.\n\n\n\n\nThis year Nvidia has seen sinking gaming revenue and a failed acquisition of the chip designer Arm.\nJensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, pledged new raises and no layoffs in a recent email to employees.\nInsider analyzed hundreds of H-1B visa applications to see how much Nvidia pays different employees.\n\n\nNvidia has experienced a difficult 2022 so far.\nThe graphics-card maker's takeover of the chip designer Arm, which was initially valued at $40 billion, fell through in February, and the corporation announced during its second-quarter earnings call that gaming revenue plummeted by nearly 50% from the previous quarter. Following this bleak news, Nvidia's stock price hit a 52-week low in late September.\n\n\nStill, the company is doubling down on investing in its workforce, offering raises, and pledging no layoffs, according to a leaked email from Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, obtained by Insider.\nAlthough Nvidia does not share how much it pays employees, it is required to disclose salary offers in work-visa applications submitted to the US Office of Foreign Labor Certification. Insider combed data from the office, which authorizes hiring non-US employees and then publicly releases the data.\nThe data does not include stock grants that can significantly increase total compensation, but it is a valuable guide to Nvidia salaries for a variety of positions. Insider dug through the hundreds of disclosed salaries that represent engineers, managers, and more.\n\n\nThe analyzed salaries from the second quarter of 2022 mainly represent workers in California. The highest-paid person in the data set is a distinguished engineer in California whom the company offered $320,000, while the lowest-paid person in the data is a public-relations specialist in California whom the company offered offered \u200b\u200b$78,582.\nHere's a breakdown of what Nvidia pays many other employees. The broad categories are taken from filings by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification. Roles are listed below only if there are at least two candidates.\nWhen you are done checking out the data below, take a look at Insider's Big Tech salary database to see how much Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and other companies pay their workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEngineers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Glassdoor\n

AMD has yet to show its hand with its next-gen graphics cards, but Nvidia and even Intel already have, and there's a lot to talk about. Different approaches, yes, but extremely interesting nonetheless. Nvidia, true to form, has gone right for the jugular with its new flagship, the GeForce RTX 4090. \nWe're running out of cliches to use when describing whatever Nvidia does next in GPU tech. The RTX 30 series was already pretty incredible, from the low end right up to the massive, power-hungry RTX 3090 family. The RTX 4090 is something else, though.\nNaturally, the new generation is more powerful than the old. But the promises made of gains over the previous generation are mind-blowing. The new architecture promises to be another monumental leap forward. For years we've been talking about ray tracing and 4K gaming, and the RTX 4090 has arrived to make both of those the norm, and to provide a GPU unlike anything we've seen before.\nGames have never had it so good.\nAbout this review: This review was conducted using the RTX 4090 Founders Edition, provided by Nvidia for the purposes of testing. Nobody at Nvidia has had any input on the content of this review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNvidia RTX 4090 Founders Edition\n\t\t\t\n\n\nNothing comes close to the performance on offer here, with team green's newest destroying the last generation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$1600 at Best Buy\n\n\n\n                        Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 pricing and availability\n                \n\n                                        The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is available at major retailers\n                        \n\n                                        It starts at $1,599 in the U.S. for the Founders Edition and some third-party cards with extra features\n                        \n\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 went on sale on Oct. 12, 2022, at major retailers such as Amazon, Newegg, and Best Buy. Prices start at $1,599 in the U.S. for the Founders Edition and a selection of third-party cards.\nSome third-party versions with extra features like custom cooling or factory overclocks cost more than the base price, but this will vary. As a high-demand item, the early stocks sold very quickly, but restocks will continue to happen. \n                        Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 specs, hardware, and design\n                \n\n                                        The graphics card is so big it might block slots on your motherboard\n                        \n\n                                        Despite its size, there wasn't any noticeable sagging\n                        \n\n                                        It has lighting, but we're not sure what triggers it\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecification\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU\n\n\nAda Lovelace | AD102\n\n\n\n\nGPU Cores\n\n\n16,384\n\n\n\n\nBase Clock\n\n\n2235 MHz\n\n\n\n\nBoost Clock\n\n\n2520 MHz\n\n\n\n\nMemory\n\n\n24GB GDDR6X\n\n\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n\n\n1,018 GB/s\n\n\n\n\nMemory Interface Width\n\n\n384-bit\n\n\n\n\nRT Cores\n\n\n128\n\n\n\n\nTDP (W)\n\n\n450\n\n\n\n\nRequired System Power (W) \n\n\n850\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything about the RTX 4090 is huge. The spec table is huge, the price is huge, and the actual graphics card is huge. The Founders Edition actually seems to be the smallest of the bunch, but don't let that fool you.\nAs we discovered when comparing it to a selection of other items, the size is potentially a problem. It takes up officially three PCIe slots in a PC case, and depending on your motherboard layout, you may lose the use of actual PCIe x16 slots. On my ASUS Prime Z690-P, for example, with the RTX 4090 in the top slot, I lose the use of a full-sized PCIe 4.0 expansion slot simply due to this card's thickness. And custom coolers on third-party versions could be even worse.\nThe depth is also an issue, though not entirely just down to the size of the card. Coupled with the necessity (for many of us, at least for a while) of using the 16-pin to 4 x 8-pin adapter cable to provide power, well, you need a deep case. In my Lian Li Lancool 205 Mesh, I simply cannot get the glass side panel on when using the adapter. With a dedicated cable, I might, but realistically, Cablemod's right-angled adapter is going to be the way for a lot of us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PCB itself isn't particularly large. It's just all heatsink. The Founders Edition is essentially one giant piece of metal with fins on both sides to help airflow. It's got two big fans at opposing ends and on opposing sides of the card. One thing it doesn't suffer with, surprisingly, is sag. Despite its overall size and weight, it's remarkably rigid. Indeed, my old MSI RTX 2080, which is significantly smaller than the RTX 4090, suffered much, much worse. I was expecting a support bracket to be necessary, but that hasn't been the case. I still have one, just in case, but I am very surprised.\n\n\n\nDespite being massive, the Founders Edition doesn't suffer from any sagging. \n\n\nThe Founders Edition also has very subtle lighting, but I'm not entirely sure what triggers it. The GeForce RTX logo lights up, as does a strip between the fan and the RTX 4090 logo. But the logo lighting was sporadic and would turn off randomly, and the strip never came on at all until I installed Corsair iCue for something completely unrelated. Regardless of how it turns on, it looks quite nice when it does.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRectifying the power adapter mess doesn't necessarily require a new power supply. While there are ATX 3.0 units starting to appear from brands such as MSI and Thermaltake, many more are already starting to offer a 12VHPWR to 8-pin cable that you can use on your existing unit. Check with your power supply manufacturer to find out more.\nThe RTX 4090 also falls behind a little in its lack of support for the latest display outputs. While it does have HDMI 2.1, it doesn't have DisplayPort 2.0. That's not a huge deal right now, but it's not like you can add it down the road when it does become more relevant. This is a graphics card that could and should last for many, many years, and it's a little hamstrung by not having the latest and greatest. Even Intel has DisplayPort 2.0 on its sub-$400 graphics cards. \n                        Gaming performance\n                \n\n                                        Literally nothing else on the market compares to the RTX 4090 right now in terms of performance\n                        \n\n                                        It's so powerful that it practically demands you play games at 4K\n                        \n\n                                        You can even play games at 8K \u2014 if you have a display that can support it\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The RTX 4090 is part of the GeForce family, which means it's targeted primarily at gamers. However, I would question whether your average PC gamer would ever need to consider one of these graphics cards.\nThe performance is ludicrous. Absolutely ludicrous. I love it, but I'm not sure I need it. I'm not sure anyone's really ready for it.\n\n\n\nThe performance from the RTX 4090 is ludicrous and I love it. \n\n\nWhen talking about the RTX 4090's performance, there's absolutely nothing to compare it to. Everything we've seen so far suggests as much as a 70% performance gain over the RTX 3090 in some scenarios. AMD will have to throw some serious heat to keep up, and until the RTX 4080 arrives, the 4090 is almost in a vacuum.\nEither way, let's look at some benchmarks. The tables below show what kind of performance you'll get from the RTX 4090 in a range of games at both 1440p and 4K. In all cases, every single graphics setting was set to its highest, and we identified where ray tracing was involved. In some cases, you'll see comparison data from the Intel Arc A770 16GB, a recently reviewed 1440p graphics card. The two aren't remotely competitive, but it's an indicator of just how far out front the RTX 4090 really is. \n\n\n\n\nBenchmark\n\n\nIntel Arc A770 16GB\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFire Strike Ultra\n\n\n7,106\n\n\n24,473\n\n\n\n\nTime Spy (DX12)\n\n\n13,412\n\n\n35,278\n\n\n\n\nTime Spy Extreme (DX12)\n\n\n6,334\n\n\n19,275\n\n\n\n\nDirectX Ray Tracing\n\n\n31.5 FPS\n\n\n136.73 FPS\n\n\n\n\n\nToss in scores of 9,921 in the new 3DMark Speed Way test and a whopping 25,520 on the Port Royal ray tracing test, and the GeForce RTX 4090 is just making all the numbers go brrr. It's without equal right now, and the DXR test between the A770 and the RTX 4090 shows that if you actually care about ray tracing at all, you still need to go for a high-end GPU. On that same test, the RTX 4090 is about 10x better than the old RTX 2080, the original high-end ray-tracing graphics card. So you can see how far we've come.\nNext, let's examine some games. \n\n\n\n\nGame\n\n\nRTX 4090 Founders Edition (1440p)\n\n\nRTX 4090 Founders Edition (4K)\n\n\nIntel Arc A770 16GB (1440p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForza Horizon 5\n\n\n\n\n                                        180 FPS\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\n                                        153 FPS\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\n                                        71 FPS\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\nMarvel's Spider-Man Remastered\n\n\n\n\n                                        94 FPS (max RT, no DLSS)\n                        \n\n                                        190 (max RT + DLSS 3.0)\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\n                                        78 FPS (max RT, no DLSS)\n                        \n\n                                        159 FPS (max RT, DLSS 3.0)\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\n                                        68 FPS\n                        \n\n                                        49 FPS (w/ RT)\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\nGears 5\n\n\n\n\n                                        161 FPS\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\n                                        125 FPS\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\n                                        N/A\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\nMetro Exodus: Enhanced Edition\n\n\n\n\n                                        113 FPS (w/ RT max settings)\n                        \n\n                                        130 FPS (w/ RT + DLSS)\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\n                                        72 FPS ( w/ RT max settings)\n                        \n\n                                        114 FPS (w/ RT + DLSS)\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\n                                        61 FPS (w/ RT normal settings )\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\n\n\n\n\n                                        205 FPS (w/ RT)\n                        \n\n                                        234 FPS ( w/ RT + DLSS)\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\n                                        121 FPS (w/ RT)\n                        \n\n                                        198 FPS (w/ RT + DLSS)\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\n                                        87 FPS\n                        \n\n                                        106 FPS (w/ XeSS)\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\nHitman 3\n\n\n\n\n                                        116 FPS (Dubai w/ RT)\n                        \n\n                                        141 FPS (Dubai w/ RT + DLSS)\n                        \n\n                                        92 FPS (Dartmoor w/ RT)\n                        \n\n                                        110 FPS (Dartmoor w/ RT + DLSS)\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\n                                        64 FPS (Dubai w/ RT)\n                        \n\n                                        118 FPS (Dubai w/ RT + DLSS)\n                        \n\n                                        55 FPS (Dartmoor w/ RT)\n                        \n\n                                        93 FPS (Dartmoor w/ RT + DLSS)\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\n                                        114 FPS (Dartmoor)\n                        \n\n                                        125 FPS (Dubai)\n                        \n\n                                        119 FPS (XeSS Ultra, Dartmoor)\n                        \n\n                                        55FPS (China, XeSS Ultra, RT)\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077\n\n\n\n\n                                        159 FPS\n                        \n\n                                        85 FPS (w/ RT Ultra)\n                        \n\n                                        128 FPS (w/ RT Ultra + DLSS 2.0)\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\n                                        121 FPS\n                        \n\n                                        77 FPS (w/ RT Ultra)\n                        \n\n                                        121 FPS (w/ RT Ultra + DLSS 2.0)\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\n                                        N/A\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Dogs Legion\n\n\n\n\n                                        99 FPS (w/ RT)\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\n                                        61 FPS (w/ RT)\n                        \n\n                                        99 FPS (w/ RT + DLSS)\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\n                                        N/A\n                        \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RTX 4090 almost makes 4K mandatory. I game at 1440p, and I have a really fantastic Dell 165Hz 1440p gaming monitor that I see no reason to part with. And yet, it's completely beaten by the RTX 4090. There are games, such as Hitman 3, where you can really crank up the ray tracing, or leave DLSS off, and you're within that 165Hz at 1440p. But most of the time, the RTX 4090 is crying out for more pixels to push.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n It also makes 8K gaming a reality for the first time. Not just that it can do it, but it can do it at frame rates you might actually want to play at. I don't have an 8K display to test on, and I don't intend to buy one soon, but the information is out there. \n            Thermals and performance tuning\n    \nWhat is somewhat surprising is how well, the Founders Edition at least, handles, everything. Thermals, memory speed, fan speed \u2014 everything is great. OK, it draws plenty of power, but on stock settings, I haven't seen it rise above 400W.\nBut there is so much headroom. The stock power limit is the 450W you see on the box, but the actual maximum power limit of the Founders Edition seems to be a ridiculous 600W \u2014 even with that sketchy looking, but I'm sure still perfectly safe, adapter. Tools like MSI Afterburner will allow the usual tweaks, increasing memory speed, core speed, and the power limit within whatever boundaries your particular card allows.\nNo matter what I've tried, on stock settings, temperatures will peak around 60-65 degrees Celsius, even when pulling 420W and using as much of the GPU as it can. Those two big fans and the giant heatsink do a pretty good job of keeping things cool without sounding like a jet engine. On past Nvidia graphics cards, I've often found the stock fan curves to be great for keeping the noise down but useless at cooling the GPU, but the RTX 4090 seems to have struck a happy medium. The fans will also stop turning at idle because the GPU will run cool enough that it just doesn't need them. When you're working for the day, you won't hear endless fan noise in your ears.\nThere does seem to be some mileage that can be extracted from the RTX 4090, though. The graph below shows a set of results from the Unigine Superposition benchmark on the 8K optimized preset. In this instance, the core clock was fixed, but the memory speed was increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The almost linear scaling indicates that while Ada Lovelace seems to be memory bandwidth starved when GPU bound, there are performance gains to be had. At the minimum, we'd expect all RTX 4090 cards to be able to add between 1,000 and 1,500 offset with as much as 2,100 possible. Rough estimates in the same test put performance up to 75% improved on the RTX 3090. But that's also taking into account a seriously overclocked, liquid-cooled RTX 3090 and a fresh-out-of-the-box RTX 4090.\nFor gaming, you can increase your benchmark scores and average FPS in the same way. For example, adding +1,000 to the memory added about 10 FPS average to Borderlands 3, while taking its power up to 450W. It will be up to you if you think that's worth it. The unit I have seemed to run into stability issues when increasing the core clock up to 3 GHz, though its gains up to that point were minimal in games anyway. Even so, the Founders Edition didn't come close to the 600W absolute limit, nor did temperatures ever exceed the low 70s. So if you're into tinkering, you've got a playground to enjoy yourself in. \n            DLSS 3.0\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The launch of the RTX 4090 isn't just about the gargantuan power of the hardware. Nvidia has also launched the latest iteration of its DLSS upscaling technology, which requires a 40 series GPU to even run. There's plenty to get into with it, but the tl;dr is more frames per second \u2014 sort of. According to Nvidia: \nBuilding upon DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS 3 adds Optical Multi Frame Generation to generate entirely new frames, and integrates NVIDIA Reflex low latency technology for optimal responsiveness. DLSS 3 is powered by the new fourth-generation Tensor Cores and Optical Flow Accelerator of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, which powers GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards.\nThe DLSS Frame Generation convolutional autoencoder takes 4 inputs \u2013 current and prior game frames, an optical flow field generated by Ada\u2019s Optical Flow Accelerator, and game engine data such as motion vectors and depth.\n\nSome have questioned whether it's a true FPS increase or some kind of trickery. All I can say is that if you go on the results, then it works as intended. If you look really closely side-by-side with DLSS 3.0 on and off, you will be able to find faults. Edges can be softer, there can be a little more flickering akin to a DLSS performance mode, and you can probably pick out areas where detail has suffered. But here's the kicker: You can only find these issues if you scrutinize really hard.\n\n\n\nDLSS 3.0 seems capable of doubling frame rates, which is astonishing. \n\n\nBut if you play a game like a normal person, it's almost indistinguishable, in part because you're going to be getting some serious FPS. I haven't tested Cyberpunk 2077 yet because it was only available as a pre-launch update through Steam, and it hasn't been made available in the GOG version yet, but it has been added to Spider-Man Remastered, and the results speak for themselves. The visuals are still excellent, but the reported frame rates double. And when you're stepping up to 4K (or even 8K) and using ray tracing, this kind of magic is welcome.\nThe list of titles getting DLSS 3.0 is currently fairly small, but there's a good selection, including everyone's favorite, The Witcher 3. I'm not really sure The Witcher 3 needs DLSS 3.0, at least not for the RTX 4090, but never turn down a little help in the performance department. \n                        Encoding performance\n                \n\n                                        This card has an NVENC encoder and an AV1 encoder\n                        \n\n                                        We found the RTX 4090 can render out a 4K60 clip at a 40,000 bitrate in under two and a half minutes\n                        \n\n                                        The 24GB VRAM makes using any piece of software a breeze\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n As a gamer rather than a content creator, I can appreciate the sheer monstrous power of the RTX 4090, but also that I could probably live happily without it. But its professional applications place this graphics card in a league of one. OK, so does the gaming performance, but it's still mind-blowing.\nFor starters, besides the excellent NVENC encoder that many have become reliant upon, the RTX 4090 takes it up a notch with a hardware AV1 encoder. Decoding has been possible on RTX cards for a while, but this is the first time we've been able to go the other way. Our explainer on AV1 will help you understand why it's a big deal. But what you're not necessarily getting from AV1 on the RTX 4090 is faster encoding, since it's about the same as regular old h.264 using NVENC.\n\n\n\nWhether using AV1 or NVENC, the RTX 4090 is an encoding juggernaut. \n\n\nThat's not to say the encoding performance of this thing isn't supremely impressive. In DaVinci Resolve 18 Studio, the RTX 4090 can render out a 4K60 clip at a 40,000 bitrate in under two and a half minutes. Comparing the h.264 and AV1 exports in ICAT, it's impossible to tell the difference in quality. The AV1 export is, of course, a much smaller file.\nBeyond just exporting, the combination of the GPU power and the massive 24GB of VRAM makes using software like Resolve 18 a breeze. Even with high-resolution footage and timelines, there's no sign of slowdowns or sluggishness. It simply devours everything as if it were nothing.\nI also tried out AV1 encoding in OBS Studio. The feature is coming in a future update but can be tried out early in the version 28.1 beta. The sample clip below was captured at the \"indistinguishable\" quality setting (for the sake of a smaller file than a true lossless capture) at 1440p using AV1. Since the hardware encoders are separate from the bits of the GPU pushing the game, there's no noticeable impact on its performance. And the RTX 4090 is such a beastly thing that it has absolutely no problem juggling both tasks.\n\n\n\nThe end result is fantastic as well. The file is smaller than a comparable non-AV1 encode but still retains all the detail.\nThose are just two applications that make good use of the non-gaming parts of the RTX 4090. Others to add AV1 support soon include Discord, while XSplit also supports it. The simple explanation is that if you already use NVENC, the RTX 4090 will turn that performance up a good few notches. For content creators, this is a serious but smart investment. What may have taken more than one PC before can easily be achieved by a single machine with an RTX 4090. Just the horsepower alone makes workflows easier and quicker. \n                        Should you buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090?\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I know that you want to buy an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, but should you? That's more complicated than a simple yes or no answer.\nYou should buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 if: \n\n                                        You're an enthusiast looking for the best of the best\n                        \n\n                                        You're into overclocking\n                        \n\n                                        You're a content creator or professional who can leverage GPU power\n                        \n\n                                        You intend to game at 4K or even 8K\n                        \n\nYou shouldn't buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 if: \n\n                                        Your sole purpose is gaming\n                        \n\n                                        You aren't gaming at 4K\n                        \n\n                                        The price is offputting\n                        \n\nThere are plenty of reasons to buy an RTX 4090 but those aren't necessarily reasons why you should buy one. To most people reading this, I can quite confidently say you don't need one. You could spend the money more wisely and build an entire PC for the same price. As exciting as it is, it's completely overkill.\nYou have to game consistently at 4K if you're entertaining buying one. There are still times that you can trip it up mildly at 1440p with a lot of ray-traced reflections. But largely, if you play games on this below 4K resolution, it's just going to laugh at you. Nothing you can throw at this graphics card right now will truly phase it.\n\n\n\nMoving to an RTX 4090 is like getting out of a Volvo and into a Lamborghini. \n\n\nIt's also not necessarily the smartest buy if your sole purpose is gaming. It's just so ridiculously powerful. Enthusiasts and those who enjoy overclocking and pushing hardware to its breaking point will absolutely love it, and largely need no justification to buy one. But even if it is up to 70% better at times than the RTX 3090, no games exist right now that are remotely challenging to it.\nThe RTX 4090 makes the most sense when combined with something else, whether you're leveraging GPU acceleration in machine learning or creative work, or you're looking for something to game and stream with on a single machine. When you step back from just gaming and appreciate everything else you get with this graphics card, it's easier to make it make sense.\nGeneration on generation, the RTX 4090 is a huge leap and hasn't come with a huge price increase. But it's still very expensive and quite probably not what you need. But if you fall into owning one, you'll have an insane experience. It's like getting out of a Volvo and into a Lamborghini. Nothing can touch this graphics card right now.

But Nvidia\u2019s new generation powerhouse, the GeForce RTX 4090, comes at a time when those problems are mostly behind us, and we can get back to marveling at ridiculously high frame rates at top-end but not outrageous prices. It feels good! I\u2019ve spent the last week putting the RTX 4090 Founders Edition through its paces, testing performance in both synthetic benchmarks and real-world gaming. The new Nvidia graphics card is a big fella, and it comes with an even bigger price tag \u2013 $1,599, to be specific \u2013 but when we\u2019re talking about a piece of gaming hardware capable of running something like Cyberpunk 2077 in 4K (with ray tracing) at a frame rate that can actually take advantage of a 240Hz monitor, it\u2019s hard to argue that it isn\u2019t worth every penny. Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition \u2013 Photos14 ImagesNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 \u2013 Design and FeaturesFirst up, we have to address the elephant in the room \u2013 that is, the RTX 4090 itself. This is a massive graphics card, roughly the same size as the equally huge 3090 Ti before it. It\u2019s a three-slot graphics card, and weighs just over five and a half pounds. But it is big and beautiful, with the same silver-and-black color scheme that debuted on Nvidia\u2019s 30-series cards two years ago. Nvidia\u2019s engineers have turned in an impressive spec sheet, even compared against the still-awesome RTX 3090 Ti. It features 16,384 CUDA cores, up from 10,752 on the RTX 3090 Ti. It has a base clock of 2.23GHz that boosts up to 2.52Ghz, and 24GB of GDDR6 VRAM, making it capable of 83 shader teraflops of compute power, up from 40 on the 3090 Ti; 1,321 Tensor teraflops, up from 320; and 191 ray tracing teraflops, up from 78.Those are all huge jumps. However, as we\u2019ve seen many times before, simply doubling the core or shader counts doesn\u2019t automatically mean that you\u2019ll see double the performance in games. In this case, though, Nvidia has produced some substantial results, and the improvement I\u2019ve seen in most of my tests is definitely more than just an incremental upgrade. This is a real generational leap forward.Clearly, this is a card designed to dominate 4K gaming, but creators and professionals should find a lot to love in its 24GB of GDDR6X video memory. It\u2019s overkill for even the most demanding PC games today, but if you\u2019re creating 3D models, that capacity pays dividends in rendering time. At 24GB, OctaneRenderer will rarely have to tap into your system\u2019s memory and will instead utilize the faster frame buffer of the card itself, dramatically increasing its rendering speed. Likewise, in Blender, you\u2019ll be free to continue to work in the viewport while your render completes in the background. Working within these applications is also significantly improved. Denoising renders is much faster, thanks to the GPU\u2019s AI cores. But if you\u2019re a game developer working in Unity, Unreal Engine, or Nvidia Omniverse, the most impressive improvement may just be the support for DLSS 3. The same benefit to games applies here: real-time, ray-traced renders at a fraction of the performance cost. Nvidia claims up to four times faster rendering performance compared to the RTX 3090 Ti. If you\u2019re a professional 3D artist, a dedicated workstation GPU will still be the best fit. In the same way RTX cards are optimized for gaming, Nvidia\u2019s workstation cards have specific optimizations for professional creators. But those optimizations come at tremendous price increases. If you\u2019re working for a small firm or are flying solo on a work-from-home project, the RTX 4090 is an excellent middle-ground that will save you thousands of dollars compared to its workstation equivalent. Are you planning to upgrade your GPU?Yes, I'm getting an RTX 4090Yes, but I'm waiting for the 4080 or AMD's new cardsYes, I'm getting a 30-series card on sale.Nope, I'm happy with my current card.AnswerSee ResultsAnother major upgrade this generation is support for AV1 encoding. AV1 is a compression codec that allows you to render and stream video at a higher quality with less bandwidth. While the RTX 30-series supported AV1 decoding, encoder support is huge for the creation process. It\u2019s incredibly efficient, so you can increase the video quality of your live streams without also increasing your bandwidth. Likewise, video rendering times in DaVinci Resolves can be cut by up to 50%. With great power comes great heat, but Nvidia has made advancements in its cooler design too. From the outside, things look mostly the same. It\u2019s a similar dual-axial design to what we saw last generation with the large, overlapping heatsink. This allows the rear fan to blow straight through and shed hot air up and out of the case. This time around, Nvidia has opted for larger, fluid-bearing fans to increase airflow and decrease noise. The space between the fins has also been optimized to increase airflow by up to 15%. We were impressed by this design when it debuted on the 30-series. It worked well then, and the same is true now. In our testing, the 4090 peaked at 64.7C, which is impressive for such a high performance card using an OEM cooler.Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 \u2013 Gaming PerformanceTest system: Z390 Asus ROG Maximus XI Extreme Motherboard, Intel Core i9-9900K CPU (stock), Corsair H115i PRO RGB 280mm AIO CPU Cooler, 32GB Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro DDR4-3200, 1TB Samsung EVO Plus NVMe SSD, Corsair HX1200 1200-watt power supply.Starting off with our synthetic benchmarks, the 4090 didn\u2019t just arrive on the scene \u2013 it positively crashed through the wall like the Kool-Aid Man hopped up on his own juice. In 3DMark Fire Strike Ultra, the 4090 delivered an eye-watering score of 21,872. To put that in perspective, it\u2019s around 50 percent more than the RX 6950 XT\u2019s score of 14,512 \u2013 the best that we\u2019ve recorded in house up til now \u2013 and about on par with the previous overclocking world record for Fire Strike Ultra for not just one, but two GPUs at once. Unigine Heaven tells the same story: the 4090 scored leaps and bounds ahead of every card we\u2019ve ever tested, with an improvement of 26% at 1080p, 39% at 1440p, and 31% at 4K compared to the 3090 Ti. The ray tracing synthetics continue the trend, with the 4090 nearly doubling \u2013 and in some cases actually doubling \u2013 the scores of the 3090 Ti. These are some seriously impressive numbers.Moving on to our gaming benchmarks, the 4090 continues to dominate. Our standard four-game test suite consists of Borderlands 3, Gears Tactics, Metro Exodus, and Total War: Three Kingdoms. All tests are run at the highest available graphics preset, with ray tracing and DLSS enabled, if available. Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition \u2013 Gaming Benchmarks4 ImagesJust as in the synthetic tests, the 4090 takes a considerable lead ahead of every other card we\u2019ve tested, across every game and resolution tested. Of course, it should. This is the top of the line card of a new generation, so only the 3090 Ti \u2013 which is the half-step upgrade over the 4090\u2019s generational predecessor \u2013 should even have a chance at staying competitive with the new card. The question is, how much of a lead does the 4090 jump out to? Looking at a wider selection of games specifically at 4K, the 4090 holds a large margin over the 3090 Ti, ranging from a 14% improvement in Metro Exodus all the way up to a 90% margin in Shadow of the Tomb Raider. That means framerates all around or above 100 fps \u2013 and remember, this is at 4K, max settings, with ray tracing turned on. Again, those are some seriously impressive numbers.Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 \u2013 DLSSThe 4090 undoubtedly owes some of its success to Nvidia\u2019s continued improvements to DLSS, or Deep Learning Super Sampling. That\u2019s the AI-enabled tech that lets games render at a lower resolution, in this case 1440p, but still output 4K with visual quality that is nearly indistinguishable from native 4K. Early versions of DLSS came with some sacrifices in fidelity due to the AI upsampling wizardry happening behind the curtain, but the tech has since advanced now to a point where games look as good, if not better, when you\u2019re using DLSS than when you\u2019re not.The latest version, DLSS 3, is exclusive to the 40-series cards, but it offers a new feature that literally generates frames by itself. There\u2019s an extremely technical explanation on Nvidia\u2019s site if you\u2019re interested, but in short the GPU looks at two sequential frames, calculates the differences between them, and then uses its AI chops to generate a frame in between them. Source: NvidiaThis is a major advancement compared to last generation and can be downright game changing for fps performance. While DLSS 2 looked at motion vector data and individual frames to intelligently upscale images and improve performance, the RTX 4090\u2019s optical flow accelerator determines paths of motion and creates new frames all by itself, separate from the native frames of the game engine. It works in tandem with Nvidia Reflex, removing any latency that might make the game feel sluggish. Nvidia\u2019s figures claim that DLSS 3 has the potential to deliver up to 4x the fps when it\u2019s turned on.  In testing Cyberpunk 2077 running at 4K resolution with max settings, including ray tracing, I saw a significant uplift when using DLSS versus not, and even more so with frame generation turned on. With DLSS disabled, the 4090 scored 41.9 fps in the in-game minute-long benchmark. With DLSS enabled, but frame generation turned off, the score jumped up to 84 fps. With frame generation on\u2026an incredible 136 fps, while still looking absolutely magnificent. Playing a game as visually demanding as Cyberpunk 2077 \u2013 at 4K, with ray tracing \u2013 at framerates in excess of 120 is truly impressive.\u201cNow, frame generation does come with a slight tradeoff, which is that since the GPU is generating additional frames, it introduces a tiny bit of latency as it inserts those frames into the stream. Remember, these are GPU frames being created outside the game engine. On its own, DLSS 3 could potentially look 120 fps while feeling like 60. But fear not: Nvidia Reflex compensates for this latency and then some. In fact, the added latency was imperceptible to me in the bit of Cyberpunk I played with frame generation turned on. But that might not be the case in other games, and it might be more problematic in fast-twitch esports games where every millisecond counts. Still, playing a game as visually demanding as Cyberpunk \u2013 at 4K, with ray tracing \u2013 at framerates in excess of 120 is truly impressive.Another thing to be aware of is the fairly steep system requirements Nvidia recommends for the RTX 4090. To push the GPU to its potential, Nvidia suggests that you run the latest processor and DDR5 memory. It also requires DirectX 12, hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling, and is incompatible with v-sync (G-Sync is fine). As you can tell from our test bench, the hardware requirements are not a hard rule and you, like us, can still benefit if you haven\u2019t upgraded your system recently. The final piece of the puzzle is, of course, price. Typically new graphics card generations launch with the top end of what I\u2019d consider the mainstream cards \u2013 in Nvidia\u2019s case, the 3080, 2080, and 1080 of generations past. This time, though, the 4090 is the first to arrive, meaning I only have the previous generation as a point of comparison. And while we know how the 4080 will be priced \u2013 $1,199 for the 16GB variant, $899 for the 12GB variant \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to know how those cards will perform until we\u2019ve had a chance to test them ourselves.PlaySo of course the 4090 is going to blow everything out of the water \u2013 it\u2019s the enthusiast-level card of a brand-new generation. But is it a good value? That remains to be seen when there are some decent budget GPUs.Still, comparing to everything else you can buy right now, including the 3090 Ti, its numbers are impressive, and that card only just launched earlier this year with a retail price of $2,000, though it has since seen its price drop to as low as $1,100 on sale. I said before that the 4090 holds a lead of at least 15 and up to 90 percent over the 3090 Ti at 4K. Considering those numbers, a price premium of 45% over the former king doesn\u2019t seem so bad.

That\u2019s a little unfair because it\u2019s currently the only card of this new generation that\u2019s available, so we only have cards from the past few years to compare it to. But until the rest of the pack can catch up, between its impressive hardware specs and its DLSS 3 AI wizardry, even the $1,599 price doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable for the unrivaled frame rates that this card can crank out.In This ArticleGeForce RTX 4090NVIDIANvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition Review8Review scoringgreatThe RTX 4090 bursts onto the scene as the new king of consumer graphics cards. It's big and beautiful, capable of pushing 4K framerates well into the 100s \u2013 but its $1,599 price tag puts it out of reach of all but the most dedicated enthusiasts.

See our ethics statement.Photo by Sam Byford / The VergeTom Warren is a senior editor and author of Notepad, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.Nvidia says it\u2019s investigating two reports of RTX 4090 cards that have had power cables burn or melt. Reddit user reggie_gakil was the first to post details about their Gigabyte RTX 4090 issues yesterday, showing burn damage on the new 12VHPWR adapter cable that Nvidia ships with the RTX 4090. The connection on the actual card was also damaged and melted.A second Reddit poster replied to the same thread showing off similar damage to an Asus RTX 4090 graphics card power connector.\u201cWe are investigating the reports,\u201d says Nvidia spokesperson Bryan Del Rizzo in a statement to The Verge. \u201cWe are in contact with the first owner and will be reaching out to the other for additional information.\u201dA melted RTX 4090 power connector. Image: reggie_gakil (Reddit)Nvidia initially moved to this new 16-pin power connector for its own RTX 3090 Ti cards, and it has now become a standard on the RTX 40-series GPUs across vendors. There are concerns that the 12VHPWR power connector, which is designed for new ATX 3.0 power supplies, could cause issues if it\u2019s bent a certain way.The 12VHPWR connector and terminals are a lot smaller than the previous generation, and cablemod warns that \u201cit appears that bending the wires too close to the connector could result in some of the terminals coming loose or misaligning within the connector itself.\u201d The site recommends not bending a connector vertically or horizontally, and instead having a minimum distance of 35mm from the connector before any bends occur.That\u2019s rather difficult in practice, with Nvidia\u2019s adapter hitting the side panel in most modern cases. The original Reddit poster vertically mounted their RTX 4090, which means the cable could have bent before the minimum distance.Burn damage to the power connector on the RTX 4090. Image: reggie_gakil (Reddit)YouTuber JayzTwoCents, who has been warning about this new connector for weeks, calls it \u201cdangerous,\u201d but says Nvidia doesn\u2019t agree. \u201cI think you\u2019re worrying about issues that don\u2019t exist,\u201d said Brandon Bell, a senior technical marketing manager at Nvidia, in an email to Jay last month.In early September, PCI-SIG \u2014 an industry consortium responsible for developing standards around peripheral component I/O data transfers \u2014 warned that some implementations of the 12VHPWR connector \u201chave demonstrated thermal variance, which could result in safety issues under certain conditions.\u201dImages supplied by PCI-SIG show multiple ways a connector could melt or burn, and are the result of extreme bends during testing. The melting looks very similar to what has occurred with both of the Reddit posters\u2019 RTX 4090 cards this week.PCI-SIG\u2019s observations on 12VHPWR connectors. Image: PCI-SIGThe solutions to these issues might be to avoid Nvidia\u2019s power adapter altogether, or be very careful about how you position or bend it. It\u2019s a bulky adapter that\u2019s supplied with RTX 4090 cards, and needs up to four 8-pin power connectors. Power supply vendors are starting to ship 12VHPWR cables that ditch the bulky connector for a single cable that terminates into two 8-pin power connectors on a PSU. Corsair sells its own for $19.99.These cables should help avoid the awkward bends we\u2019re seeing with these new connectors, particularly against the sides of cases. New ATX 3.0 power supplies will help too, but there aren\u2019t many on the market and not many PC gamers will want to spend extra to replace a working PSU just to get a native implementation of the 12VHPWR connector.RelatedNvidia RTX 4090 review: a 4K beastNvidia\u2019s \u201cpriority access\u201d program is one way to get your hands on an RTX 4090See More: NewsNvidiaTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
