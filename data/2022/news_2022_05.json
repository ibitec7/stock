[+] smartphone. (Photo Illustration by Sheldon Cooper/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock price rose 5x from $33 in 2018 end to around $167 currently, primarily due to favorable changes in its sales and P/S multiple. During this period, the company witnessed a strong 130% rise in revenues, and combined with a more than 80% rise in its P/S multiple, the company\u2019s stock price has rallied despite a marginal rise in the outstanding share count. Further, over the same period, the S&P 500 returned around 60%, meaning that NVDA stock has managed to strongly beat the index since 2018-end.\n\n\nIn our interactive dashboard, Why Nvidia Stock Moved: NVDA Stock Has Gained 400% Since 2018, we break down the factors behind this move.\n\nNVDA\u2019s Total Revenue has grown 130% from $11.7 billion in FY 2019 to $26.9 billion in FY 2022\n\n\n\n\nNVDA\u2019s total revenue initially dropped from $11.7 billion in FY \u201919 to $10.9 billion in FY \u201920, but demand has picked up since the pandemic and sales have risen strongly to $26.9 billion in FY \u201922, and currently stand at the same level (NVDA\u2019s fiscal year ends in January).\nNvidia is a major player in the GPU market, with its sales being driven by gaming processors and data centers.\nNvidia\u2019s largest segment is the graphics segment, bringing in $15.9 billion as of FY \u201922, making up around 59% of the company\u2019s total sales.\nFor additional details about NVDA\u2019s revenues and comparison to peers, see Nvidia Revenue Comparison\n\n\nFactors of NVDA Stock Price ChangeTrefis\nRevenue per share increased 124% from $4.81 in FY 2019 to $10.75 currently\n\n\nNVDA\u2019s revenue rose from $11.7 billion in FY 2019 to $26.9 billion currently, while the outstanding share count rose from 2.4 billion in FY 2019 to around 2.5 billion currently.\nDue to this, RPS has jumped more than 2x from $4.81 in FY \u201919 to $10.75 currently.\n\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Tax Software Of 2022Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes\n\nPrice-To-Sales (P/S) multiple for NVDA rose strongly from 14.8x in 2019 to 52.1x by 2021 end, but has pulled back to 15.5x currently, still slightly higher than its 2019 level\n\n\nNVDA\u2019s P/S multiple rose strongly to around 52.1x by late 2021, on the back of rising investor expectations surrounding increased demand for its graphic processors, leading to a rise in the company\u2019s sales.\nHowever, due to the current geopolitical tensions and increased economic uncertainty weighing on the broader markets, the P/S multiple has pulled back, currently standing at around 15.5x.\nFor additional details about the company stock returns and comparison to peers, see Nvidia Stock Return Comparison.\n\n\n\nWith stock prices falling precipitously across sectors, we seem to be heading toward a bear market for the first time since March 2020 when the Covid-19 outbreak triggered a market crash.

By Aoyon AshrafUpdated May 11, 2023, 4:19\u202fp.m.  UTCPublished May 25, 2022, 9:45\u202fp.m.  UTC(Christinne Muschi/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) said its contribution from sales of cryptocurrency mining processor (CMP) was \u201cnominal\u201d for its 2023 fiscal first quarter ended May 1, 2022, constituting a drag on year-over-year revenue for its OEM business unit.Nvidia\u2019s said first-quarter revenue for its \u201cOEM and Other\u201d business unit fell 52% to $158 million from the same quarter last year due to a decline in its cryptocurrency mining processor sales, according to a filing.The chip maker didn\u2019t disclose the specific amount of sales for its mining processor unit in the first quarter, but labeled it as \u201cnominal\u201d and down from $155 million a year ago.This comes after the sales of the CMP unit continued to decline with the price of cryptocurrencies in general. In Nvidia\u2019s previous quarter, CMP revenue fell 77% from the previous quarter.Nvidia\u2019s total first-quarter revenue was $8.29 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $8.12 billion, according to FactSet. Its \u201cOEM and Other\u201d unit contributed only about 2% of the first quarter revenue.Adjusted earnings per share of $1.36 beat consensus estimates of $1.30. However, Nvidia gave fiscal second-quarter sales guidance of $8.10 billion, which missed the consensus estimate of $8.399 billion.The shares of the chip maker were down about 7% in after-hours trading on Wednesday.On May 6, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Nvidia failed to disclose that crypto mining was a significant contributor to its 2018 revenue and the company agreed to pay a $5.5 million fine to settle the charges.NvidiaCrypto-MiningEarningsAoyon AshrafAoyon Ashraf is CoinDesk's managing editor for Breaking News.

Trading\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\nRecently, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) \u2014 two of the largest companies by market capitalization \u2014both announced 20:1 stock splits. More recently, GameStop Corp (GME), potentially the most famous of the 2021 retail \u201cmeme\u201d stock phenomenon ,\u201d announced a 10:3 split. Investors responded positively, as the price of the underlying securities rallied in the trading sessions immediately following the announcement. With stock splits making headlines, Cboe\u2019s North American Execution Consulting Team analyzed potential changes to underlying securities, pre- and post-split, from a market structure perspective in both equities and options markets. The team used unique data sets from Cboe Data Shop to examine the market structure behavior of all stocks that performed a forward split since 2020. Out of 61 stocks across all market capitalization categories, three mega-cap stocks (companies with market capitalization above $200 billion dollars) have split since 2020: Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA). The team chose to analyze all stock splits by market cap in aggregate, as well as Apple\u2019s 4:1 split individually, as a representative of mega-cap stocks. For each category, the team studied how stock splits impact securities over time, then how the splits impact various factors that impact a security\u2019s value, including volume, notional exposure and volatility.Time HorizonsFirst, the team analyzed how stocks trade differently, if at all, in the immediate week after the split became effective and up to six months following for both equites and options. The week before the effective date of the split was used as the \u201cpre-split\u201d period. We measured changes in market structure behavior for these securities via a basket of metrics: volume, retail volume, notional exposure, trade size, odd-lot volume and volatility.The team found that, on average, splitting a security does not necessarily increase liquidity or attract investors\u2019 interest proportionally to the ratio at which the security was split. In some cases, the research shows such stock splits have an adverse effect on the notional value traded on the securities. However, the evidence suggests that stock-split events drive additional participation from retail investors, especially in securities with larger market capitalization.The Impact on Overall Volume We then analyzed trading volume, particularly executed shares in equities and executed contracts in options, to understand the impacts of a split on the market structure behavior of the underlying security. Exhibits 1 and 2 below show the median percentage change in equities executed shares and options contracts traded before and after the effective date of the split. Volume in mega-cap equities initially spiked 342% the week immediately after the split (Exhibit 1). This initial growth declined during the six months following the split. From an options market structure perspective, mega-cap securities traded modestly in higher volume initially following the split and peaked at six months post-split (Exhibit 2). Large cap stocks also traded moderately higher initially, but, again, the effect declined with time. Volume was only marginally higher following the split in mid- and small-cap securities. In some small-cap securities, volume decreased sharply. These changes indicate that investors\u2019 have a lukewarm appetite taking on risks in the options markets for mid- and small-cap securities following a stock split.However, is there indeed a notable change in how a security is traded after a split as the raw, unadjusted data suggested? In theory, a stock split makes the security more affordable for investors with limited capital to deploy. Consequently, the affordability would attract more interests to trade the security post-split. To understand these changes better, we introduced \u201csplit-adjusted\u201d calculations to our metrics, which normalizes the metrics by the split ratio. For example, 400 Apple shares traded post-4:1 split would equate to 100 split-adjusted shares traded. After applying this calculation, that the data shows that median volume traded did not see a substantial increase following the split. In equities, split-adjusted volume in mega-cap securities increased slightly one-week post-split. However, in the two-week to six-month period post-split, the median executed shares volume decreased about 48%,compared to volume a week pre-split (Exhibit 3). The options market followed a similar trend, with a decrease in the number of split-adjusted options contracts traded in the weeks and months following the split across all market cap groups. The median number of contracts traded in mega-cap stocks decreased approximately 49% one week post-split (Exhibit 4). This evidence contradicts the affordability theory above Preliminary evidence suggests that post-split lower prices do not necessarily attract significant additional interest in trading the securities.To put these findings in clearer focus, we reviewed Apple\u2019s 2020 forward split as a case study. Apple announced a 4:1 stock split on July 30, 2020, which became effective on August 31, 2020. On August 31, Apple\u2019s share price went from $502 per share to $129 per share. Executed shares volume increased 382%. from 47 million shares the day before the split to 225 million shares on August 31.However, after applying split-adjusted calculations, we see that executed shares volume remained flat (Exhibit 5). Likewise, in the options markets, there was a 52% decrease in the split-adjusted number of contracts traded, averaging 0.9 million contracts traded daily post-split compared to 1.9 million contracts traded daily pre-split (Exhibit 6).The Impact on Retail VolumeRetail market structure was an integral part of this analysis, as retail investors on average tend to trade in smaller sizes due to their limited capital, relative to institutional investors. Theoretically, if the theory that stock splits would attract more investors due to lower security price holds true, we should expect higher split-adjusted retail volume post-split. However, empirical evidence shows that, with the exception of mega-cap securities, in which initial Cboe retail-attested executed share volume increased, securities from other cap groups traded with less retail volume on an adjusted basis post-split. This effect is more pronounced in options markets. Split-adjusted OCC-defined customer volume \u2014 a proxy for retail trading volume \u2014 mostly decreased across all periods post-split (Exhibit 8). The changes in both the equities and options markets signal that retail and retail-proxy trading volume do not change in proportion to the ratio that the securities were split.The trading behavior of Apple stock following its 2020 split aligned with the behavior observed in the overall equities and options markets. In options markets, Apple\u2019s unadjusted post-split customer volume increased by 92%, averaging 1.7 million daily contracts executed, compared to 0.9 million contracts pre-split (Exhibit 10). Applying split-adjusted calculations shows that adjusted customer volume post-split only averages 0.4 million daily contracts executed, a 52% decrease compared to pre-split volume.The Impact on Notional ExposureNotional value traded is a traditional benchmark to help understand whether stock splits renew interest from new investors who could not previously invest in certain stocks due to higher security prices. Our team posits that if the stock splits brought in new investors and existing investors are indifferent, on average, investors\u2019 overall notional value traded to the security should increase. Empirical evidence, however, showed that notional value traded mostly decreased after stock-splits. In equities markets, mega-cap securities experienced an initial boost one week after the stock split went into effect, but declined significantly in the weeks and months following, decreasing up to 40% at three and six months later (Exhibit 11). Large-cap securities experienced marginal boosts in investor interest, from a notional perspective, but also declined following the initial boost (Exhibit 12). Mid- and small-cap securities never gained traction, and instead saw declines in investors\u2019 net exposure immediately post-split and in the months thereafter. In the options markets, the decline in investors\u2019 notional exposure is more pronounced. In mega-cap securities, investors\u2019 net exposure increased initially but declined up to 60% in the following months, compared to pre-split levels.The Apple case study validates our empirical findings above as we see net notional value traded in the security declined immediately post-split and more sharply in the weeks and months following, averaging $15 billion daily, a 9% decrease compared to pre-spit levels (Exhibit 11). This effect is more pronounced in options markets. Investors\u2019 average daily net notional value traded in Apple declined 47% post-split to $45 billion, compared to pre-split notional value traded (Exhibit 12). While splitting a security makes it more affordable, the evidence shows that it may unintentionally decrease additional investor interest.The Impact on Trade SizeFor a more in-depth picture of how stock-splits impact market structure, we analyzed \u00a0\u201ctrade size\u201d and \u201cnotional trade size\u201d metrics, which measure the number of shares or contracts traded and the gross dollar amount of exposure that investors take on with each trade, respectively. Exhibit 15 and 17 illustrate that investors executed a higher number of shares per trade post-split in equities markets but the notional exposure of those trades \u00a0declined. This aligns with our observation that stock splits provide additional liquidity to markets as more shares and contracts change hands, but they do not necessarily inject a proportional amount of additional investments to the ratio that the security is split.The results of the same analysis in the options markets were mixed. More contracts changed hands each trade post-split in mega-, large- and mid-cap securities, but the response was different in small cap securities (Exhibit 16). From a notional exposure perspective, investors risked less per trade in mega-, large- and small-cap securities post-split. There was a more immediate appetite for risks in mid-cap securities as the amount of notional per trade increased substantially in the week following the split (Exhibit 18).The Impact on Odd LotsLikely due to growth of zero-commission trading and increased retail participants, \u00a0odd lot trading now comprises over 55% of all equity trades. As an important segment of overall equities trading, we also examined the potential impact of stock splits on odd lots trading. Exhibit 19 below shows that there were a significantly higher number of odd lots trades pre-split (23% - 36%) compared to post-split (15% - 23%) across all market capitalization groups.Similarly, in Apple, the number of odd-lot trades \u00a0increased from 60% pre-split up to 70% post-split (Exhibit 20). This increase, in addition to the change in retail volume noted above, indicates that stock splits do drive increased retail participation in equities markets, despite the fact that the number of executed shares did not increase proportionately to the security\u2019s split ratio.The Impact on Volatility Finally, we studied how stock splits impact volatility in split securities. Volume-weighted-implied volatility \u00a0in mega-cap securities climbed in the immediate weeks following the split but drastically tapered off in the months following, then climbed again six months later (Exhibit 21). Large-cap securities, however, were consistently more volatile post-split. Mid- and small-cap securities mostly traded in less volatile manners following the split. These results may signal that investors\u2019 renewed interests are mostly focused on securities with larger market capitalization.The changes in implied volatility in Apple following its split were consistent with the aggregate changes in mega-cap securities. Exhibit 22 shows an initial spike in volatility, but the effect mostly tapered off with time. As the initial excitement of the split event wears off, so does the security\u2019s volatility.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What These Effects MeanOn average, stock splits do not lead to increased liquidity that is proportional to the split ratio and appear to lead to a decrease in investors\u2019 overall capital exposure to the split security. However, it is clear that stock-split events may drive additional participation from retail investors. As the retail trading community continues to grow, stock splits may interest companies seeking to make trading in their stock more accessible, however splits may be to the detriment of existing shareholders.Cboe provides robust and resilient markets that bring together buyers and sellers across numerous asset classes.

It\u2019s available in the most popular multiplayer and esports games, supported on GeForce graphics cards dating back to the 900 Series, and it takes only a single click to enable.\nThe word\u2019s getting out about Reflex\u2019s benefits, as it\u2019s now used by over 20 million players each month, making it one of NVIDIA\u2019s most successful technologies. And as more players jump on board, more developers do, too. Each month, more add NVIDIA Reflex to their games, with over 35 available already, and another four coming soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt COMPUTEX 2022, we\u2019re announcing the addition of NVIDIA Reflex to ICARUS, My Time At Sandrock, Soda Crisis, and Warstride Challenges. And to help you achieve the lowest system latency possible, we\u2019re debuting next-generation 500Hz display technology.\nFor all the details, read on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex Coming Soon To ICARUS\nICARUS, RocketWerkz\u2019s 8-player co-op PvE survival game, receives new content updates every week. In June, one of these drops will introduce NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency, making gameplay more responsive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX gamers can further enhance their experience in ICARUS by enabling NVIDIA DLSS and RTX Global Illumination, which launched alongside ICARUS last December. Increase performance by up to 80%, and marvel at realistic lighting with just a few clicks in the options menu. Learn more here, and stay tuned for the release of NVIDIA Reflex in ICARUS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Time At Sandrock Early Access Launches With NVIDIA Reflex On May 26\nPathea Games\u2019 My Time At Sandrock is the much-anticipated follow-up to the breakout farming and life sim, My Time At Portia. You\u2019ll travel to the eponymous desert community of Sandrock and take on the role of a fledgling Builder. Use your trusty toolset to gather resources, construct machines, and turn your run-down workshop into a well-oiled production facility to save the town from the jaws of economic ruin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt launch on May 26th, My Time At Sandrock Early Access will feature support for NVIDIA Reflex. With NVIDIA Reflex, gamers of GeForce GPUs dating back to the 900 Series can reduce system latency by up to 34% at 1440p.\nBy enabling NVIDIA Reflex in the settings menu, your extensive time at Sandrock will be more responsive, giving you the definitive experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoda Crisis Available Now With NVIDIA Reflex\nTeam Soda and bilibili\u2019s Soda Crisis is a fast-paced side-scrolling shooter, with devilishly challenging encounters that\u2019ll have you reaching for the instant restart button over and over again. Where pixel-perfect precision is required to succeed, high system latency can literally get you killed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoda Crisis launched today, and gamers with a GeForce GPU will discover out-of-the-box support for NVIDIA Reflex, which reduces system latency by up to 23%:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith greatly reduced system latency, controls and gameplay will be far more responsive, helping you conquer Soda Crisis\u2019 challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex Available Now In Warstride Challenges\nBlast hordes of demons at lightning speed in bloody gunfights, and race against the clock to overcome everything that comes your way, in the recently released Early Access shooter, Warstride Challenges. Die and retry to get the highest score in increasingly intense trials, create and share your own runs, and attempt to be the best at the hundreds of levels created by the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this twitch shooter where speed and aim precision are at the core of the experience, NVIDIA DLSS and NVIDIA Reflex have been added to unlock your full potential. With both enabled, you\u2019ll more than double your frame rates at 1440p, and lower system latency by up to 53%:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Next-Gen 500Hz Esports & NVIDIA Reflex Gaming Monitors\nEver since we revolutionized gaming monitors with the launch of G-SYNC in 2013, we\u2019ve worked with our OEM partners, and panel manufacturers such as AU Optronics, to craft faster and even-better displays. Less than a decade later, we\u2019ve now got G-SYNC gaming monitors and TVs in every combination of size, speed and resolution that you could want, but progress still doesn\u2019t stop.\nAt COMPUTEX 2022, we\u2019re introducing the newest member of the NVIDIA G-SYNC family - the ASUS ROG Swift 500Hz Gaming Monitor. This 500Hz display has been designed from the ground up for esports, using a brand new E-TN (Esports TN) panel for maximum motion clarity. It also boasts NVIDIA G-SYNC Esports Mode with adjustable esports vibrance and of course, complete NVIDIA Reflex Analyzer support, allowing users to measure end-to-end system latency when using a NVIDIA Reflex mouse and GeForce GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n500Hz G-SYNC Esports displays are even faster, have even lower response times, and are specifically tuned for competitive games such as CS:GO, Valorant, Overwatch, and Rainbow Six Siege. Load up the video below to see how this new, cutting-edge display technology further improves target tracking and allows competitive gamers to spot enemies even sooner:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning at fast frame rates on equally fast G-SYNC gaming monitors greatly reduces system latency, making controls and gameplay more responsive. And paired with a NVIDIA Reflex-compatible game, you can further reduce system latency, something that can be measured using the capabilities of NVIDIA Reflex Analyzer-compatible G-SYNC esports monitors.\nThis benefits every game and gamer, not just competitive games and esports pros.\nIn December, we teamed up with The Meta and their popular aim trainer, Kovaaks, to give everyone a chance to jump in and feel the difference between high and low latency, and to see for themselves how it improved their gameplay. We called it the System Latency Challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe challenge was conducted at three latency levels: 85ms, 55ms, and 25ms in a random order per user. The results showed several clear trends.\nFirst, latency improves your score regardless of aiming skill. If we compare the percentile markers at 85ms, 55ms, and 25ms, each percentile shifts to the right as latency decreases. This shows that everyone\u2019s scores improved with lower latency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, lower latency unlocks player potential. Not only did the curve shift towards higher scores, the range of achieved scores increased. At 85ms, players scored between 0 and 35 points. At 55ms, players scored between 0 and 41 points. And at 25ms, players scored between 0 and 55 points. This shows that as latency decreases, a wider range of scores become possible.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, lower latency can make difficult aiming tasks possible. In Latency Flicking, we saw that 7.5% of players couldn\u2019t hit a single shot at 85ms, however at 25ms, only 4% couldn\u2019t hit a shot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe System Latency Challenge was open to everyone on Steam, not just pros, showing that lower system latency benefits everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACER Predator X28 G-SYNC Monitor Available Now\nIf you\u2019re looking for a high refresh rate monitor that you can add to your setup today, check out the new ACER Predator X28. This 28\u201d 4K IPS, super slim bezeled monitor runs at a rapid 152Hz, has NVIDIA G-SYNC, and includes NVIDIA Reflex Analyzer support, so you can measure end-to-end system latency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like a full list of Reflex-compatible G-SYNC gaming monitors and displays, head here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Mice With NVIDIA Reflex Analyzer Support Available Now\nNVIDIA Reflex has become synonymous with esports - Reflex is present in the best competitive games, G-SYNC Monitors with Reflex have the highest refresh rates with excellent image clarity, and Gaming Mice with Reflex are primed to up your game. To fully measure end-to-end system latency, from click to game, to display, you need a Reflex game, monitor, and mouse.\nThis month sees the launch of two new NVIDIA Reflex mice, the Cooler Master MM310, and the Cooler Master MM730. Both come fully equipped to work with G-SYNC Reflex monitors to measure end-to-end system latency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about measuring system latency with compatible NVIDIA Reflex accessories, follow our guide here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore To Come\nNew NVIDIA Reflex games, monitors, and mice are on the way, so stay tuned to GeForce.com to see the news when it drops.\nAlso, be sure to check out our COMPUTEX 2022 News Roundup.

It wasn't easy to come up with a shortlist - but NVIDIA was on it.\nWhy? Because NVIDIA is knee deep in solving supply chain problems that flummox organizations. Plus: I knew NVIDIA had an SAP Business Network story - something I haven't covered in prior SAP pieces.\nNVIDIA's Ron McCutchen, VP of IT Business Applications & Engineering, was in Orlando to deliver his session, \"Build Resiliency Across Your Global Supply Chain with SAP Business Network.\" The event gods aren't always kind; I was doubled-booked during his presentation. So I asked McCutchen: what did I miss?\nNVIDIA's business network story - fueled by the Mellanox acquisition\nNVIDIA's business networks story picks up steam after their $6 billion acquisition of Mellanox in 2019. NVIDIA's ambitious move into \"high-performance interconnect technology\" expanded their scope - and their challenges. The Mellanox acquisition gave NVIDIA the confidence to state:\nWith Mellanox, NVIDIA will optimize datacenter-scale workloads across the entire computing, networking and storage stack to achieve higher performance, greater utilization and lower operating cost for customers.\n\nAt the time, NVIDIA's CEO said that the emergence of AI and data science fueled \"skyrocketing demand on the world's data centers.\" He added:\nAddressing this demand will require holistic architectures that connect vast numbers of fast computing nodes over intelligent networking fabrics to form a giant datacenter-scale compute engine.\n\nBut to get there also requires an optimal supply chain architecture - and that's where McCutchen's team comes in. As he told me in Orlando:\nA lot of people think of our GPU and the graphics and gaming and all that, but the company really has moved way beyond that last five years to full stack, all the way through software, to the hardware platforms... So we acquired Mellanox two years ago; we've now fully integrate them into our ecosystem.\nWe've been using the SAP Business Network for our contract manufacturers. It's a fabulous environment. We leverage the network with different companies for the making of the wafers, the assembly test, the packaging - all those types of things. So we have a very connected global network that we use.\n\nSAP Business Networks - another go-live on deck\nMcCutchen continues:\nThe business network allows us to connect into all of those suppliers and vendors. With Mellanox, you have some different contract manufacturers and suppliers. Part of the integration process - and our go-live here at the end of this month - is onboarding those vendors onto the network so we could leverage them. So for us, why we use it overall is really speed and agility.\n\nI'm not going to knock speed and agility. But we've heard plenty of that from the keynote stage. How does that result happen? McCutchen explains:\nThe business network provides a solid platform for us that we don't have to build ourselves; we don't have to customize. It comes with standard adapters; it comes with a multitude of ways to integrate. Your vendors are not all the same. Some are using XML; some are using files; some are using real-time integration. So we've really leveraged that to be able to integrate Mellanox.\n\nFor the Mellanox integration, this supply network is required. But it's more than that. In today's constrained/volatile environment, a different level of agility must be achieved:\nThe broader picture is we really use it to manage our network of all our global suppliers and vendors. It gives us a great deal of speed and agility. We're in a very constrained environment from a supply perspective. We need the ability to quickly be able to expand with an existing partner or onboard another partner in weeks, to be able to support the changes - based on the very constrained environment that we're in.\n\nThis isn't a pandemic economy disruption anymore. Upheavals will be a constant; legacy approaches will fail. McCutchen agrees:\nAbsolutely. Every month, every quarter, something new comes up. Suez Canal gets shut down, a new tariff or regulation; a new export control happens. Or some other geopolitical event... a city the size of Shanghai gets shut down, or some other massively disruptive event. We have to manage to the best that we can.\n\nHave NVIDIA's network investments made a difference here?\nOur speed to market can be weeks, not months, to be able to onboard partners on the network. Many of them are already on the network. Many of them are familiar with the network. Having the base platform there for you, with the options to integrate, is a huge advantage. We're not recreating the wheel each time; we're leveraging something existing, in many cases, that partners already know. So that helps tremendously.\n\nOn SAP IBP, open platforms, and the single source of truth\nThen the interview took a twist. McCutchen dropped an intriguing line about his other SAP Sapphire presentation: co-innovating on AI/ML with SAP IBP (Integrated Business Planning). How did that come about? Before McCutchen's team moved to IBP, it was that classic planning story: Excel files everywhere. McCutchen:\nA lot of our planning processes involve Excel and a variety of other tools. So we had all the common problems that have been around forever: single source of truth [issues], latency in the data, redundancy of information, people massaging information, 'My numbers don't agree with your numbers' - you name it.\nSo just moving to IBP to start with, to consolidate a single data source for demand planning, was huge... I've been working with SAP products for 30 years. Two things SAP has not been known for is a great user interface, and open platforms. With IBP, you get that.\n\nEven better: planners don't have to give up their attachment to their trusty spreadsheets.\nThe Excel data integrates right back into IBP. So it's still the still the same single data source, and the planners love Excel, so they can still do it in Excel.\n\nA cloud-based planning system is a huge plus for McCutchen's team:\nThey didn't just take APO and stick it in the cloud. It's a rewrite from the bottom up - it's cloud native. So you get all the advantages of a cloud-based application. The quarterly releases, enhancements, all those things come right out of the box, the performance you get and all the rest of it.\n\nAnd where does AI fit in?\nWe have all kinds of demand signals that come into our channel, buying habits and different things we use to sense demand. And then on top of that, we can go back actually ten years, and look at certain things - recessions, economic slowdowns. The buying habits repeat themselves. IBP really can't absorb the volume of data that we have over such a long time period, and be able to run AI and ML against that.\nSo we use our own GPU and AI and ML technology against some of those demand signals. We eventually then loaded those at a kind of a higher level, into IBP, to help some of the demand signals on the planning. We run our statistical models and the algorithms, and all that good stuff.\n\nHas this additional data paid off?\nYes - we got better visibility into the channel and predictive models. Just being able to run the what-if scenarios that feed into our request build plan, as we call it, has been tremendously helpful. It will get even better over time.\n\nSounds nifty, but I need proof points. McCutchen had a good one: by applying these demand signals, McCutchen's team was able to largely anticipate the surge in NVIDIA equipment demand caused by the crypto craze - not too shabby. McCutchen:\nI think we've been able to pretty well control it, even anticipate at the macro level, there's always kind of smaller adjustments to that. Nobody wants to surprise the CEO with a 'We screwed up, and we totally blew that demand.' That's what we're trying to avoid.\n\nI'm guessing other SAP customers were very interested in this presentation?\nWe got a lot of questions afterwards.\n\nThe wrap - NVIDIA, SAP, and... the metaverse?\nI was struck by the impact of gaming culture on NVIDIA. As much as I poke fun at the metaverse as a future framework for the enterprise, I respect how gamers push tech to its limits. McCutchen told me that keeping up with gamers changed NVIDIA's culture for the better:\nBuilding an architecture which is more agile and flexible to change, and not highly customized, you're right - gaming forces us to do that. I think that pays off in other parts of our business like data center, which is now really our largest business group.\n\nLooking ahead, is there anything McCutchen needs from SAP? That question brought an unexpected answer: the enterprise metaverse.\nWe've had a good partnership with SAP. We're looking at a number of co-innovation opportunities with them. Some exciting things with S/4, and potentially our Omniverse. The release of our CPU Grace, which is ARM-based. There's opportunities for SAP to run on ARM; there's opportunities for us to go to market with our Omniverse, and not only the planning tools but supply chain...\nAs NVIDIA moves core systems to S/4, the Omniverse could play a role. I told SAP, 'We're going to go build our whole supply chain in Omniverse first and optimize it, and then we'll go build out our configuration processes in S/4.' A lot of companies would benefit from doing that, being able to model everything first, optimize it, and then go build and configure it in SAP.\n\nI bash the metaverse hype for lacking enterprise use cases. However, what McCutchen is talking about here is an enterprise use case for sure, perhaps an evolution of the digital twins concept - one of the few so-called \"metaverse\" scenarios that already has enterprise credibility. Another one to watch.\n\n\n\n\nImage credit - Photo of Ron McCutchen of NVIDIA at SAP Sapphire Orlando 2022 by Jon Reed.\n\n\nDisclosure - SAP paid the bulk of my travel expenses to attend SAP Sapphire Orlando 2022.

Don\u2019t buy it until the trend changes.\n\n\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe\u2019re in a baby-and-bathwater market, where seemingly good companies with solid growth numbers are seeing their share prices swoon. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a prime example of this. With Monday\u2019s market massacre, NVDA stock is officially 50% off its 52-week high.\nThe halving hasn\u2019t come as a result of poor management or a mass deterioration in the company\u2019s fundamentals. On the contrary, its February earnings report revealed a 53% revenue increase year-over-year (YOY), among other rosy metrics and upbeat forward guidance. Instead, Nvidia\u2019s woes are born from a broader shift in investor sentiment as high inflation and soaring interest rates have investors re-thinking stock market valuations.\nIn short, investors have looked into the not too distant future and seen a hawkish Fed solving inflation by pushing the economy into a recession. Were that to happen, Nvidia\u2019s growth path would slow and demand a lower share price. Of course, as equities are wont to do, they aren\u2019t waiting around for the earnings decline to arrive before reacting. True to their discounting and forward-looking nature, stocks are sliding now.\n\n\n\nNVDA\nNvidia\n$1775.99\n\n\n\n\nIs Nvidia Stock Now Cheap?\n\n\nSource: yCharts.com\n\nThe halving in NVDA stock has transpired while its earnings per share have continued marching higher. As a result, the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) has shrunk considerably.\nAt its richest point, Nvidia\u2019s P/E ratio topped 100. Now, it\u2019s in the mid-40s. Fans will point to the steep discount as a reason to gobble up shares now while the flames of the fire sale are burning bright.\nOn the one hand, they may be right. As economist Paul Samuelson joked, the stock market has predicted nine of the past five recessions. Sometimes stocks see a bogeyman that simply isn\u2019t there. Perhaps the pendulum of pessimism has swung too far. There\u2019s a chance the Federal Reserve won\u2019t over-tighten, will successfully get inflation under control, and will deliver the much-desired but all-too-rare soft landing.\nIn that case, Nvidia is indeed a rousing buy here \u2014 as are most stocks, for that matter. Only time will tell. As for pinning your hopes on Nvidia\u2019s seemingly cheap valuation, remember it can get far cheaper before all is said and done.\nThat illustrates one of the critical problems with using a valuation metric to time your purchases. It\u2019s unwieldy and lacks precision. No doubt some investors scooped up NVDA stock when the P/E ratio sank from 100 to 70 or 60, reasoning it was \u201ccheap enough.\u201d If you are interested in bottom fishing here, then let technical analysis be your guide. In the case of Nvidia, it simplifies the story considerably.\n\nLet the NVDA Stock Chart Be Your Guide\n\n\nSource: The thinkorswim\u00ae platform from TD Ameritrade\n\nIf you want to buy shares with greater conviction, wait for evidence that the downtrend is turning. The weekly trend is below the 20-week and 50-week moving averages. The daily is following suit with prices below the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages.\nGiven the multitude of broken support zones overhead, ample resistance threatens to halt future rallies. Breaking one of them will at least signal a short-term change in character. For now, I have my eye on $204.\nThe old pivot high needs to be breached before the daily trend turns higher. Beyond that, a push above the 50-day moving average would signal a more significant reversal is in place. Until then, patience is warranted. And if you must acquire Nvidia, do yourself a favor and at least buy partial shares so you can add more at lower prices in the likely event the downtrend persists.\nOn the date of publication, Tyler Craig did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

However, the California-based company has not admitted or denied the findings of the SEC.Just a note that you'll see the SEC refer to Nvidia's fiscal year 2018 in the SEC filings [PDF warning], but that roughly correlates to human earth year 2017\u2014Nvidia's financial calendar is weird. That's actually an important detail, as 2017/18 was the peak of the major cryptocurrency mining boom prior to the more recent one in 2020/21. Just like the previous 18 months, it was difficult to buy a graphics card during 2017 as the profitability of cryptocurrency mining, namely ethereum, was sky high.It didn't end well for Nvidia, though. The company responded to the high demand for GPUs by making more of them\u2014too many, in fact. By 2019, the company had admitted to excessive inventory of mid-range GPUs due to the previous years' cryptocurrency boom, and its share price went into a sharp decline for a short period.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Nvidia bounced back harder than ever over the next few years, however, quickly making the 2018 share price mountain (peaking around $70) look like a mole hill by comparison. During late 2021, the company's shares were valued at their highest yet, at $330. Today its shares are worth $190 a piece, though the effect of this SEC filing may cause a turbulent few days for the company.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest gaming motherboard: The right boards\nBest graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the restStrangely enough, Nvidia recently succeeded in having a class action lawsuit against it dismissed for similar claims of deception by its investors. In that lawsuit, it was claimed \"economists determined that Nvidia had earned at least $1.728 billion from sales to miners from May 2017 through July 2018\u2014meaning that Defendants understated Nvidia\u2019s crypto-related GPU sales by $1.126 billion during the Class Period, all of which was contained in the Company\u2019s Gaming segment.\"The class action lawsuit claimed investors were unable to see the whole picture and prepare better for the volatility of Nvidia's revenue at the time, much like the charges made by the SEC. Yet this class action suit was unsuccessful; a California judge threw the case out.\u00a0The class action would've likely run Nvidia a lot more money than $5.5 million had it been successful, however.Ultimately, a $5.5 million fine is merely a slap on the wrist for a company like Nvidia. The company made $26.91 billion in 2021, up a whopping 61% over the previous year. Though it does appear to have learned a lesson from the major cryptocurrency mining goldrush of 2017/18: it appeared to play it a lot safer with its response to the more recent boom of 2020/21, launching specially produced cryptocurrency cards and seemingly keeping inventory a little leaner, too.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nCryptocurrency\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

Now he\u2019s turning his attention to underserved amateurs in the clubs and community teams he says make up \u201cthe bigger opportunity\u201d among the world\u2019s 250 million soccer players.\n\u201cAlmost everyone in professional sports uses data analytics today. Now we\u2019re trying to enable any team at any level to capture their own data and analytics, and the only way to do it is leveraging AI,\u201d he said.\nA Kickoff Down Under\nIn April, the company launched its Coach160 software in Australia, where it\u2019s getting kudos from amateur soccer clubs in Victoria and Queensland. It uses computer vision to let teams automatically generate rich reports and annotated videos with an off-the-shelf camera and a connection to the cloud.\n\u201cThe analysis and data provided by Track160 will prove a wonderful resource for our coaches and players,\u201d said Vaughn Coveny, a retired pro soccer player now working with multiple youth teams in the region.\nStartup With an AI Heritage\nMiky Tamir, a serial entrepreneur in sports tech, co-founded Track160 in 2017. The company\u2019s investors include the Deutsche Fussball Liga, Germany\u2019s national soccer league, which contributed annotated datasets from several of its seasons.\n\u201cThat helped set a baseline, then we applied transfer learning and developed an ever-growing internal database,\u201d said Tamir Anavi, Track160\u2019s CTO.\nUsing video from a single camera, the company\u2019s software identifies and tracks players as 3D skeletons, then tags events and actions as they move.\n\u201cWe use deep learning in every step to understand where the camera is, where the pitch is and where the players are on it,\u201d Anavi said.\nWith that information, the software delivers detailed analytics and more. It constructs a 3D model so players and coaches can view any part of the game from any perspective, providing what Ben-Ari calls \u201ca metaverse experience.\u201d\nSoftware Certified by the Pros\nThe Coach160 software got high scores for speed and accuracy in a benchmark for electronic tracking systems created by FIFA, the global federation of more than 200 pro soccer leagues. \u201cWe delivered the same performance as others who used six times more cameras,\u201d said Anavi.\nOne pro league uses the code to get real-time data on game days.

He\u2019s also worked with clients including Autodesk, Discovery Channel, Google, Netflix and the World Wildlife Fund.\nA sampling of Righi\u2019s impressive 3D animal collection.\nA native of Italy, Righi now lives in Thailand, a move he says was artistically inspired as he\u2019s an avid lover of animals and nature. This is evident from his stunning portfolio of animal renders renowned for their lifelike photorealism and individualistic tone.\n\nThe story behind Waiting for the Year of the Tiger is a personal one for the artist.\n\u201cIn my illustrations, I try to show the iconic image of that specific animal, or at least what\u2019s my personal idea of that,\u201d Righi says. \u201cIt\u2019s a mix of my childhood vision with added real-life experience.\u201d\nRighi\u2019s dedication to the craft means he often visits animal sanctuaries to observe and take pictures and video footage to use as reference.\nThe creative process begins in Autodesk Maya.\nRighi\u2019s creative workflow begins in Autodesk Maya on a Lenovo laptop powered by a GeForce RTX 3080 GPU. He creates a base model and unwrapping UV, translating 3D mesh into 2D data so a 2D texture can be wrapped around it.\nRighi then uses custom brushes in ZBrush to sculpt the tiger in finer detail. With a mix of photos and custom brushes, Righi creates the main textures in Adobe Photoshop, using AI-powered Enhance Details technology, one of over a dozen GPU-accelerated features, to sharpen photo details before returning to Maya and applying new textures to the 3D model.\nDeploying spline primitives across 10 different sections unlocks profound realism.\nRighi prioritizes achieving a highly photorealistic look with detailed, lifelike fur, created with the XGen interactive groom editor within Maya. \u201cBefore starting, it\u2019s very important to study the fur flow so that I can decide how many fur descriptions I would need,\u201d Righi says. \u201cThe tiger, for example, has been made with 10 descriptions, such as main body, head, cheeks and whiskers.\u201d\nRighi\u2019s fur creation technique adds stunning realism to his virtual animals.\nRighi uses spline primitives \u2014 predefined shapes which provide a method for freehand drawing \u2014 manually placing and shaping the guides. Righi notes, \u201cI usually create three or four clump modifiers and break them up with a few noise cuts, stray and maybe curl modifiers.\u201d\nThe artist tinkers and tests in real time until he meets the desired output, then bakes the fur consisting of millions of spline primitives. This process is accelerated by a factor of 6x with his GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, saving valuable time.\nGetting the lighting just right.\nWith the model in a good place, Righi animates the scene in 3D using Blendshapes to interpolate the different sets of geometry. According to Righi, getting the little details right is critical to capturing the essence of lifelike movement. \u201cResearching anatomy is equally important,\u201d he says. \u201cTo get the right shapes and sculpt every detail, you need to take your time and study.\u201d\nRighi begins to test scene lighting. Here, the GPU-accelerated viewport enables incredibly smooth, interactive 3D modeling \u2014 another benefit of using the GeForce RTX 3080 GPU. Righi can tinker with the lighting, shadows, animations and more in real time, without having to wait for his system to catch up.\nWaiting for the Year of the Tiger is complete.\nOnce final renders are ready to export, AI denoising with the default Autodesk Arnold renderer produces incredibly photorealistic renders that export up to 6x faster on Righi\u2019s GPU-accelerated laptop than on a comparable unit with integrated graphics.\nAnd like that, the year of the tiger is upon us.\nRighi\u2019s NVIDIA Studio-powered creative zone.\nView Righi\u2019s portfolio on ArtStation and his 3D models marketplace to see more of his work.\nAnimals and Creatures Inspire In the NVIDIA Studio\nTalented artists who share Righi\u2019s passion for design join us In the NVIDIA Studio. They share their artist and character-inspired 3D journeys, passing along valuable tips and tricks through tutorials.\n\nRingling College of Art and Design Professor Ana Carolina injects Greek mythology and lore in her fantasy-style Studio Session, How to Model & Render A 3D Fantasy Hippocampus Creature, offering an inside look at sculpting in Zbrush and applying colors in Adobe Substance 3D Painter.\n\nCharacter concept artist Tadej Bla\u017ei\u010d\u2019 shares his Blender tips and tricks in a two-part Studio Session tutorial. Part 1, Blender Tutorial: Create a Cute 3D Character Animation Part 1: Character Concept, covers 3D character animations, while Part 2, Modeling & Hair, demonstrates hair and fur techniques similar to Righi\u2019s.\n\nFreelancer Wesley Trankle\u2019s six-part Studio Session tutorial, How to Create a 3D Animation Video, provides an in-depth look at the 3D journey. Videos cover a wide range of topics: Modeling Main Character, Character Rigging, Creating Environment, Animation, Texturing & Materials & Lighting and Final Touches.\u00a0\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

Page 1 of 4. 54 Comments.\n\nAs outlined in yesterday's extensive article about NVIDIA's new open-source Linux kernel GPU driver, currently for consumer GeForce RTX GPUs the driver is considered of \"alpha quality\" while NVIDIA's initial focus has been on data center GPU support. In any event with having lots of Turing/Ampere GPUs around, I've been trying out this new open-source Linux kernel driver on the consumer GPUs. In particular, I've been curious about the performance of using this open-source kernel driver relative to the default, existing closed-source kernel driver. Here are some early benchmarks.\nLooking at the license information from modinfo nvidia will tell whether you are using the open-source (MIT/GPL dual licensed) driver or not.\nMy testing of the NVIDIA 515.43.04 beta driver while opting for the open-source kernel driver has been going well. I've tried several different GeForce RTX GPUs while for this article I am benchmarking with the high-end GeForce RTX 3090.\n\nThe quick primer on opting to use this open-source kernel driver with the closed-source driver components is passing the -m=kernel-open argument to the NVIDIA driver installer. This will build the open-source kernel driver for your system rather than using the default binary modules. In addition to that though, you need to set the NVreg_OpenRmEnableUnsupportedGpus=1 module option so this \"alpha quality\" driver will load for the consumer/workstation GPUs. With these two alterations made, the NVIDIA Turing/Ampere GPUs should successfully initialize with the open-source kernel driver build.\n\nOne additional tip is that if you normally just use \"nomodeset\" at the kernel command-line for preventing the Nouveau DRM driver from loading so you can gracefully use the NVIDIA proprietary driver stack, this interferes with using the open-source kernel driver. On one of my systems nomodeset was set and worked fine with the closed driver but when booting with the open driver, the screen wouldn't light up and when SSH'ing in there were many NVRM messages around \"RmInitAdapter failed\" and \"rm_init_adapter failed\", etc. Switching to just blacklisting the Nouveau DRM driver rather than using the nomodeset option works around that issue.\n\nWith the GeForce RTX 3090 I was quite curious to see how the performance was for this open-source kernel driver code against the closed-source driver... All while using the same OpenGL/Vulkan/OpenCL/CUDA NVIDIA 515.43.04 user-space driver components each time. Since, again, the consumer GPU support is currently considered \"alpha quality\" and NVIDIA acknowledging that there would be performance issues to ultimately address with this open-source kernel driver -- including some power management features yet to be implemented.\n\nSo I fired up a number of Linux gaming benchmarks followed by GPU compute benchmarks for looking at the RTX 3090 difference between these two kernel driver options.\n\n\n54 Comments \u00a0 - \u00a0 Next Page\n\nTweet\n\n\n \n\nPage 1 - IntroductionPage 2 - Linux Gaming PerformancePage 3 - Linux Gaming PerformancePage 4 - Linux GPU Compute Performance\n\n\nPage:  \u00a0 1 \u00a0  \u00a0 2 \u00a0  \u00a0 3 \u00a0  \u00a0 4 \u00a0  \u00a0 Next Page \u00a0  \n\n\n\nRelated Articles\nIntel Battlemage Showing Off Nice OpenCL Gains With Newest Open-Source Compute StackWindows 11 vs. Linux Benchmarks For Intel Arc B-Series \"Battlemage\" Shows Strengths & WeaknessesIntel Compute Runtime 24.45 vs. AMD ROCm 6.3 vs. NVIDIA R565 Linux GPU Compute BenchmarksNVIDIA's Open-Source Linux Kernel Driver Performing At Parity To Proprietary DriverRADV vs. AMDVLK Radeon Vulkan Ray-Tracing Performance For Mid-2024AMD vs. NVIDIA Vulkan Ray-Tracing Performance On Linux With Breaking Limit\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Linux News\nBLAKE3 1.7 Turns To Intel's oneTBB For Parallelizing C Code - Similar Perf To Rust+Rayon\n\n\nFinal Draft Of PCI Express 7.0 Specification Published\n\n\nBlender 4.4 Released With Vulkan Improvements & AMD HIP RT No Longer Experimental\n\n\nOpenJDK Java 24 Released With Garbage Collector Improvements, Deprecating x86 32-bit\n\n\nFedora 42 Beta Released With Countless Improvements\n\n\nLinux Kernel's Zstd Code Gets A Co-Maintainer\n\n\nARM64 SMT Run-Time Controls Staged Ahead Of Linux 6.15\n\n\nTheora 1.2 Beta Released After 16 Years\n\n\nollama 0.6.2 Released WIth Support For AMD Strix Halo\n\n\nNginx Rejects Dark Mode Support For Error Pages\n\n\nBig Rust Update Merged For GCC 15 - Lands The Polonius Borrow Checker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Your Support, Go Premium\nPhoronix Premium allows ad-free access to the site, multi-page articles on a single page, and other features while supporting this site's continued operations.\n\n\nLatest Featured Articles\nAMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D Linux Performance\n\n\nAMD's 3D V-Cache Optimizer Driver For Squeezing More Ryzen 9 9950X3D Performance\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D Delivers Excellent Performance For Linux Developers, Creators & Technical Computing\n\n\nAMD EPYC 9845 Makes For A Persuasive Upgrade With Performance & Energy Efficiency\n\n\nSiFive HiFive Premier P550 RISC-V Linux Performance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSupport Phoronix\nThe mission at Phoronix since 2004 has centered around enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModern compute GPUs are tailored to deliver incredible performance at any cost, so their power consumption and cooling requirements are pretty enormous. Nvidia's latest H100 compute GPU based on the Hopper architecture can consume up to 700W in a bid to deliver up to 60 FP64 Tensor TFLOPS, so it was clear from the start that we were dealing with a rather monstrous SXM5 module design. Yet, Nvidia has never demonstrated it up and close.\u00a0Our colleagues from\u00a0ServeTheHome, who were lucky enough to visit one of Nvidia's offices and see an H100 SXM5 module themselves, on Thursday published a photo of the compute GPU. These SXM5 cards are designed for Nvidia's own\u00a0DGX H100 and DGX SuperPod\u00a0high-performance computing (HPC)\u00a0systems\u00a0as well as machines designed by third parties. These modules will not be available separately in retail, so seeing them is a rare opportunity.\u00a0Nvidia's H100 SXM5 module carries a fully-enabled GH100 compute GPU featuring 80 billion transistors and packing 8448/16896\u00a0FP64/FP32 cores\u00a0as well as 538 Tensor cores (see details about specifications and performance of H100 in the tables below). The GH100 GPU comes with 96GB of HBM3 memory, though because of ECC support and some other factors, users can access 80GB of ECC-enabled HBM3 memory connected using a 5120-bit bus. The particular GH100 compute GPU pictured is A1 revision marked as U8A603.L06 and packaged on the 53rd\u00a0week of 2021 (i.e., from December 28 to December 31).\u00a0\u00a0(Image credit: ServeTheHome)Nvidia's GH100 measures 814mm^2, which makes it one of the largest chips ever made. In fact, die sizes of Nvidia's recent compute GPUs were primarily limited by reticle size of modern semiconductor production tools, which is around 850mm^2. Since the chip made using a customized TSMC N4 process technology (which belongs to the N5 family of nodes) consists of 80 billion transistors operating at around 1.40 ~ 1.50 GHz, the GPU is extremely power hungry. Nvidia rates its thermal design power at 700W (yet this number can change), so it requires an extremely sophisticated voltage regulating module (VRM) that can deliver enough power to feed the beast.\u00a0Indeed, the H100 SXM5 module comes with a VRM that has 29 high current inductors each equipped with two power stages as well as three inductors with one power stage. The inductors can survive high temperatures for prolonged periods of time and they come in metal shells to make VRM cooling easier.\u00a0Dimensions of the SXM5 module are unknown, but they hardly differ significantly from previous-generation Nvidia modules for compute GPUs. Meanwhile, Nvidia changed the connector layout for SXM5 (check it out at\u00a0ServeTheHome), probably because of higher power consumption and faster PCIe Gen5 and NVLink data rates supported by its GH100.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware/Nvidia)Nvidia will start commercial shipments of its Hopper H100 compute GPUs sometimes in the second half of this year and this is when it announces final specifications of these products and their final TDP.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware/Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nScience\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (0)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

Work as a team of four survivors to kick Deadite butt and banish the vile Kandarian Demon. Or become the Demon yourself, using its powers of possession to stop the good guys dead and swallow their souls in exciting multiplayer matches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you\u2019re playing with up to three others to stop the forces of evil, using the classic Boomstick and chainsaw combo, or hunting down Ash as evil, you can ramp up performance and image quality using NVIDIA DLSS.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS is our groundbreaking AI rendering technology that\u2019s available in over 180 games and apps that increases graphics performance using dedicated Tensor Core AI processors on GeForce RTX GPUs. By tapping into the power of a deep learning neural network, we boost frame rates significantly, and generate beautiful, sharp images for your games.\nIf you own a GeForce RTX graphics card, desktop or laptop, simply enable NVIDIA DLSS in the options and you can accelerate performance by up to 85% at epic settings, allowing all users with a GeForce RTX 3060 Ti or above to play Evil Dead: The Game at over 60 FPS at 4K:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure maximum performance in Evil Dead: The Game, be sure to download and install our latest Game Ready Driver from GeForce.com or GeForce Experience (discover why keeping your drivers up to date is so important in this article).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t have a GeForce RTX PC or laptop, you can still get some Evil Dead: The Game action, enhanced with NVIDIA DLSS, by streaming it from the cloud with NVIDIA GeForce NOW. Members can play over 1,000 of the real and full PC versions of games they already own from Steam, Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect, and GOG.com.\nGeForce NOW\u2019s RTX 3080 Membership gives you the power of a GeForce RTX 3080-class PC in the cloud, enabling streaming sessions at up to 4K on PC and Mac, 4K HDR on NVIDIA SHIELD, and up to 120 FPS on select Android devices.\nHead over to the GeForce NOW website to learn more, buy Evil Dead: The Game on the Epic Games Store, and get further info about the game on the official website.\nTHE EVIL DEAD\u2122 and its related characters are copyrighted trademarks of Renaissance Pictures, LTD. exclusively licensed to Diversion3 Entertainment, LLC.

See our ethics statement.A rack full of these could hold so much liquid (and computing power). Image: NvidiaNvidia has announced its new plan for reducing the energy use of data centers crunching massive amounts of data or training AI models: liquid-cooled graphics cards. The company announced at Computex that it\u2019s introducing a liquid-cooled version of its A100 compute card, and says that it consumes 30 percent less power than the air-cooled version. Nvidia\u2019s also pledging that this isn\u2019t just a one-off, it\u2019s already got more liquid-cooled server cards on its roadmap, and hints at bringing the tech to other applications like in-car systems that need to keep cool in enclosed spaces. Of course, Tesla\u2019s recent recall for overheating chips shows how tricky that can be, even with liquid cooling.According to Nvidia, reducing the energy needed to perform complex computations could make a big impact \u2014 the company says data centers use over one percent of the world\u2019s electricity, and 40 percent of that is down to cooling. Reducing that by almost a third would be a big deal, though it is worth noting that graphics cards are only one part of the equation; CPUs, storage, and networking equipment also draw power and need cooling as well. Nvidia\u2019s claim is that with liquid cooling, GPU-accelerated systems would be far more efficient than CPU-only servers on AI and other high-performance tasks.Nvidia\u2019s roadmap for liquid cooled appliances and cards. Image: NvidiaThere\u2019s a reason liquid-cooling is popular in high-performance use cases, from supercomputers to custom gaming PCs and even a few phones: liquids absorb heat better than air, according to Asetek, a major manufacturer of water cooling systems. And once you have warm liquid, it\u2019s relatively easy to transfer it elsewhere so it can cool off, compared to trying to cool down the air in an entire building or increase airflow to the specific components on a card that are dumping out all the heat.Besides the energy efficiency, liquid-cooled cards have another bonus over their air-cooled counterparts \u2014 they take up significantly less room, meaning you can fit more of them in the same amount of space.Nvidia\u2019s push to lower energy use via liquid-cooling comes at a time when a lot of companies are considering the amounts of energy their servers use. While data centers are far from the only source of carbon emissions and pollution for big tech, they\u2019re a piece of the puzzle that can\u2019t be ignored, and critics have noted that offsetting energy use through credits isn\u2019t as impactful as reducing consumption altogether. Companies like Microsoft have experimented with submerging servers in liquid completely and even putting whole data centers in the ocean in a bid to use less energy and water.Of course, those solutions are rather exotic \u2014 while the type of liquid-cooling Nvidia\u2019s offering isn\u2019t necessarily the norm for data centers, it\u2019s not as out there as putting your servers in the ocean (though so far Microsoft\u2019s experiments with that have been shockingly successful). Nvidia\u2019s explicitly marketing its liquid-cooled GPUs as being for \u201cmainstream\u201d servers, rather than as a bleeding-edge solution.But when can I get a liquid-cooled RTX card without modding?This does raise the question of whether we could see Nvidia try to take liquid-cooling even more mainstream by building liquid-cooling into the reference designs for its gaming-focused cards. The company doesn\u2019t mention any plans to do that, only saying that it plans to \u201csupport liquid cooling in our high-performance data center GPUs\u201d for the \u201cforeseeable future.\u201dHowever, server tech trickles down to home PC tech all the time, and gaming cards coming straight from the factory with an all-in-one liquid cooler isn\u2019t something that\u2019s completely unheard of \u2014 AMD\u2019s had a few reference designs that included a liquid-cooling loop, and third parties have sold liquid-cooled Nvidia cards before. As Nvidia\u2019s cards continue to draw more and more power (a stock 3090 Ti can draw up to 450 watts), I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Nvidia announces an RTX 5000-series card that comes stock with a liquid cooler.As for Nvida\u2019s data center-focused cards, the company says companies like ASRock, Asus, and Supermicro will incorporate liquid-cooled cards into their servers \u201clater this year,\u201d and that slot-in PCIe A100 cards are coming in Q3 of this year. A liquid-cooled PCIe version of its just-announced H100 card (which is the next-gen version of the A100) is due in \u201cearly 2023.\u201dSee More: NewsNvidiaTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Then, in 2018, when Morrison was mowing his lawn, it struck him: autonomous lawn mowers.\nThe two, along with Davis Foster, co-founded Scythe Robotics. The company, based in Boulder, Colo., has a 40-person team working with robotics and computer vision to deliver what it believes to be the first commercial electric self-driving mower service.\nScythe\u2019s machine, dubbed M.52, collects a dizzying array of data from eight cameras and more than a dozen other sensors, processed by NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier edge AI computing modules.\nThe company plans to rent its machines to customers much like is done in a software-as-as-service model, but based on acreage of cut grass, reducing upfront costs.\n\u201cI thought, if I didn\u2019t enjoy mowing the lawn, what about the folks who are doing it every day. Wasn\u2019t there something better they could do with their time?\u201d said Morrison. \u201cIt turned out there\u2019s a strong resounding \u2018yes\u2019 from the industry.\u201d\nThe startup, a member of the NVIDIA Inception program, says it already has thousands of reservations for its on-demand robots. Meanwhile, it has a handful of pilots, including one with Clean Scapes, a large Austin-based commercial landscaping company.\nScythe\u2019s electric machines are coming as regulatory and corporate governance concerns highlight the need for cleaner landscaping technologies.\nWhat M.52 Can Do\nScythe\u2019s M.52 machine is about as state of the art as it gets. Its cameras support vision on all sides, and its dozen sensors include ultrasonics, accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, GPS and wheel encoders.\nTo begin a job, the M.52 needs to only be manually driven on the perimeter of an area just once. Scythe\u2019s robot mower relies on its cameras, GPS and wheel encoders to help plot out maps of its environment with simultaneous localization and mapping, or SLAM.\nAfter that, the operator can direct the M.52 to an area and specify a direction and stripe pattern, and it completes the job unsupervised. If it encounters an obstacle that shouldn\u2019t be there \u2014 like a bicycle on the grass \u2014 it can send alerts for an assist.\n\n\u201cJetson AGX Xavier is a big enabler of all of this, as it can be used in powerful machines, brings a lot of compute, really low power, and hooks into the whole ecosystem of autonomous machine sensors,\u201d said Morrison.\nScythe\u2019s robo-mowers pack enough battery for eight hours of use on a charge, which can come from a standard level 2 EV charger. And the company says fewer moving parts than combustion engine mowers means less maintenance and a longer service life.\nAlso, the machine can go 12 miles per hour and includes a platform for operators to stand on for a ride. It\u2019s designed for jobs sites where mowers may need to travel some distance to get to the area of work.\nRiding the RaaS Wave\nThe U.S. market for landscaping services is expected to reach more than $115 billion this year, up from about $70 billion in 2012, according to IBISWorld research.\nScythe is among an emerging class of startups offering robots as a service, or RaaS, in which customers pay according to usage.\nIt\u2019s also among companies operating robotics services whose systems share similarities with AVs, Morrison said.\n\u201cAn advantage of Xavier is using these automotive-grade camera standards that allow the imagery to come across with really low latency,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are able to turn things around from photon to motion quite quickly.\u201d\nEarth-Friendly Machines\nTrends toward lower carbon footprints in businesses are a catalyst for Scythe, said Morrison. LEED certification for greener buildings counts the equipment used in maintenance \u2014 such as landscaping \u2014 driving interest for electric equipment.\nLegislation from California, which aims to prohibit sales of gas-driven tools by 2024, factors in as well. A gas-powered commercial lawn mower driven one hour emitted as much of certain pollutants as driving a passenger vehicle 300 miles, according to a fact sheet released from the California Air Resources Board in 2017.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of excitement around what we are doing because it\u2019s becoming a necessity, and those in landscaping businesses know that they won\u2019t be able to secure the equipment they are used to,\u201d said Morrison.\nLearn more about Scythe Robotics in this GTC presentation.\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | GPU | Jetson | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Page 1 of 1. 239 Comments.\n\nThe day has finally come: NVIDIA IS PUBLISHING THEIR LINUX GPU KERNEL MODULES AS OPEN-SOURCE! To much excitement and a sign of the times, the embargo has just expired on this super-exciting milestone that many of us have been hoping to see for many years. Over the past two decades NVIDIA has offered great Linux driver support with their proprietary driver stack, but with the success of AMD's open-source driver effort going on for more than a decade, many have been calling for NVIDIA to open up their drivers. Their user-space software is remaining closed-source but as of today they have formally opened up their Linux GPU kernel modules and will be maintaining it moving forward. Here's the scoop on this landmark open-source decision at NVIDIA.\n\nMany have been wondering in recent years what sort of NVIDIA open-source play the company has been working on... Going back to the end of 2019 have been signals of some sort of open-source driver effort and various rumblings have continued since that point. Last month I also pointed out a new open-source kernel driver appearing as part of the NVIDIA Tegra sources. Well, now the embargo has just expired and the lid can be lifted - NVIDIA is providing a fully open-source kernel driver solution for their graphics offerings. This isn't limited to just Tegra or so but spans not only their desktop graphics but is already production-ready for data center GPU usage.\n\nI've been super excited since being informed of NVIDIA's open-source kernel driver plans. For covering all of the important aspects, below I've laid out all of the key bits for easily getting to the most exciting details of this NVIDIA open-source kernel driver effort.\n\nWhat's covered by this NVIDIA open-source initiative - NVIDIA's open kernel modules is already considered \"production ready, opt-in\" for data center GPUs. For GeForce and workstation GPUs, the open kernel module code is considered \"alpha quality\" but will be ramped up moving forward with future releases. NVIDIA has already deprecated the monolithic kernel module approach for their data center GPU support to focus on this open kernel driver solution (and their existing proprietary kernel module using the GSP). Only Turing and newer GPUs will be supported by this open-source kernel driver. Pre-Turing GPUs are left to using the existing proprietary kernel drivers or the Nouveau DRM driver for that matter. Turing and newer is a hard requirement due to being dependent upon the GPU System Processor (GSP).\nThe GPU System Processor and this driver architecture that's come about in recent times is for offloading some GPU initialization/management tasks to the GPU rather than executing on the CPU. The GSP is binary-only firmware loaded at run-time. The open-source kernel driver explicitly depends upon the GSP-supported graphics processors. The GSP is a RISC-V based block that succeeded their earlier Falcon micro-controller on earlier NVIDIA GPUs.\nThe kernel module components consist of the NVIDIA kernel driver, the NVIDIA-DRM integration, the NVIDIA-Modeset driver for display/mode-setting, NVIDIA-UVM for Unified Video Memory.\nIt's genuine open-source kernel code - MIT/GPL dual licensed! NVIDIA has indicated that Canonical / Ubuntu, Red Hat, and SUSE are all preparing to package and use the open kernel modules. Beginning with the new R515 branch of the NVIDIA Linux driver, the driver installer will have the option for users whether they want to use the existing proprietary kernel modules or switch to the open driver code. The open kernel driver code will be available as well on GitHub. NVIDIA will also accept community contributions to the code where there is merit or bugs being addressed, but does require a CLA for signing off on the code to NVIDIA. NVIDIA's user-space libraries and OpenGL / Vulkan / OpenCL / CUDA drivers remain closed-source -- today's announcement is just about all the excitement in kernel space.\nMainline ambitions for NVIDIA's Linux kernel driver - It won't go upstream though near-term / in its current form. At this point the API/ABI is not stabilized and the open kernel driver code will be tied to particular driver releases. NVIDIA is ultimately working to stabilize its API/ABI as well as the GSP firmware interface. Once they work through all these technicalities, the driver (or whatever form of it in the future) may then look at being upstreamed into the kernel. Per Linux kernel upstreaming practices, there would also need to be open-source user-space support making use of this kernel driver.\nThis open-source kernel code is currently split into OS-agnostic and kernel interface layer components. This stems from NVIDIA's proprietary driver on Linux largely being shared code across Windows / Linux / FreeBSD / Solaris. For it to be upstreamed in the Linux kernel it would likely need to be more re-factored to cater to Linux, just as AMD's DAL/DC originally had tough time upstreaming due to its numerous abstractions.\nNouveau (open-source community) prospects around this new kernel driver - Eventually, yes, Nouveau may make use of this code being opened today. Asking about it to NVIDIA, they say that hopefully Nouveau will be able to utilize the GSP firmware / open kernel modules but first will likely take time for the GSP firmware interface to be stabilized and other factors. Thus in the future when this kernel driver is in better shape, Nouveau's Mesa code may end up interfacing with this kernel driver as an alternative to the Nouveau DRM kernel driver that is in rather rough shape for hardware newer than the GTX 600/700 Kepler series. Plus for this kernel code to be upstreamed, it would need an open user-space -- i.e. Nouveau Mesa code short of NVIDIA deciding later to open up their user-space libraries.\nNVIDIA's motivation to finally be more open-source - This appears to be an effort to improve their Linux integration and support. NVIDIA's announcement going out today says \"This release is a big step in improving the experience of using NVIDIA GPUs in Linux, enabling tighter integration with the OS as well as empowering developers to debug, integrate, and contribute back.\" It also looks like enterprise / data center use played a role in this strategy with also talking up confidential computing and how the data center GPU support is already considered \"production\" quality ahead of workstation and consumer GeForce GPU support. NVIDIA's announcement today also will talk up the developer benefits to open-source kernel drivers with better tracing/debugging and better integration around customized versions of the Linux kernel.\nFeature differences with this new kernel driver - Being an open-source kernel driver will eventually lead to some benefits -- right now this open driver already has DMA-BUF support unlike their proprietary driver. But until this code is mature, there may be performance differences and other areas for improvement with the consumer / workstation hardware of \"alpha\" quality support. But ultimately NVIDIA says they are going to have feature and performance parity with the proprietary kernel code.\nRight now this is a Linux-only change - At least as of the R515 branch, NVIDIA is only providing the open-source kernel driver support for Linux systems. I asked about FreeBSD support given NVIDIA's long-present BSD support with their proprietary driver and whether this open-sourced code was portable enough to work on any of the BSDs. I was simply told that for R515, it's Linux-only. We'll see if NVIDIA later decides to open up their FreeBSD kernel GPU driver, which could also help the NVIDIA stack run on some of the other BSDs. Even still, NVIDIA's proprietary FreeBSD driver offers the best graphics option today for FreeBSD users. The Intel and Radeon open-source graphics drivers continue to be ported over from the Linux kernel without the official backing/support of Intel or AMD and generally is always a number of releases behind the latest upstream Linux kernel state.\nThat's the synopsis of what is going on with NVIDIA's open-source kernel driver efforts. Stay tuned for NVIDIA R515 Linux driver testing and looking at the current experience and performance from using this open kernel driver with their closed-source OpenGL/Vulkan user-space drivers, etc. NVIDIA did comment to me though that \"These out-of-tree open kernel modules are just one step towards better support on Linux.\"\nNVIDIA going back many years has provided good Linux GPU driver support, albeit closed-source (unless counting the former, minimally useful xf86-video-nv DDX)... Now they are finally venturing into an open-source kernel driver.\nCongratulations to NVIDIA for finally moving forward with an open-source kernel driver solution for their range of graphics products. It's arguably long overdue and unfortunate that they are not open-sourcing their user-space driver components, but this is a terrific move and better than the status quo. This open kernel driver is still very much a work-in-progress especially for GeForce Linux gamers but is a great start and should help in allowing better kernel integration / improved setup experience and better managing NVIDIA proprietary driver installations across distributions -- once having a stable API/ABI for the driver and especially if/when the threshold is crossed of being able to upstream the kernel driver. It will also be great once the open-source Nouveau project is able to leverage GSP or this driver directly so they can just focus on their open-source Mesa driver support. Nouveau is still just limited to Gallium3D/OpenGL today and some OpenCL support but hopefully with time they will be able to provide a suitable open-source NVIDIA Vulkan driver for Mesa and all-around improving the open-source NVIDIA experience on Linux.\nAt least in the near-term AMD's Radeon Linux graphics driver leads with its open-source stack for discrete graphics -- both the user and kernel-space driver components being open-source and just limited to the closed-source microcode/firmware. Forthcoming Intel Arc Graphics take a similar route to AMD with fully open kernel and user space components and the proprietary GuC/HuC firmware/microcode. We'll see how this shifts the reception among Linux gamers with just having an open kernel driver, but long-term at least should provide more suitable integration / ease of use if all goes according to their open driver development plans. Free software purists will still consider NVIDIA off-limits for lack of open-source user-space support -- at least until Nouveau is adapted to use this driver and have a open Vulkan driver, etc.\n\nYes, the Linux gaming marketshare is small and NVIDIA likely didn't pursue this effort just to excite open-source enthusiasts. The real play here is likely on ensuring the continued attractiveness of NVIDIA on Linux in the data center. An open kernel driver will address some concerns by organizations over security matters with a binary driver tainting the kernel and the NVIDIA module often being the only closed-source kernel driver on many Linux systems. An open NVIDIA kernel driver will also allow for better integration with new Linux features around confidential/secure computing and other areas. The big HPC customers and data center users are often much less concerned about closed-source user-space software (and often running closed-source user applications anyhow) and more concerned with quality and functionality -- to which NVIDIA has a stellar reputation for CUDA and all their mature yet leading-edge user-space software for GPU compute. AMD meanwhile has the still-maturing open-source ROCm compute stack and for Intel HPC graphics everything is still coming together there with the various oneAPI efforts, so while the other vendors may have fully open-source software stacks, their compute offerings aren't as well versed as NVIDIA's that can now leverage an open kernel driver.\nI've been closely following NVIDIA's Linux driver support for nearly two decades and this is the best open-source effort they have made in this time.\nAs an open kernel driver, it will now be able to utilize GPL-only kernel symbols/functionality. Already this driver has DMA-BUF support that will be of interest to some enterprise / data center use. Other areas this could help out is better integration too with the HWMON subsystem, for example, to provide better integration there and using the same interfaces as used by the other open-source DRM/KMS kernel display/graphics drivers rather than right now relying on various NVIDIA-specific tools and interfaces for monitoring.\nIt will also be interesting to see if this NVIDIA Open GPU Kernel Modules deprecates the Nouveau DRM kernel driver... Well, it wouldn't entirely since let's not forget this new kernel driver only works with Turing GPUs and newer. Meanwhile the older sweet spot currently for the Nouveau kernel driver is GTX 600/700 Kepler series (and GTX 750 Maxwell1) but the newer GPUs is where it lacks proper power management firmware / re-clocking and thus the performance is in bad shape. Nouveau on recent generations of NVIDIA GPUs is basically only good enough for driving a display as due to the ability to re-clock to the peak performance state its 3D graphics performance is frankly junk. So the NVIDIA Open Kernel Driver is certainly superior for GeForce RTX 20/30 series while GTX 900 / GTX 10 graphics cards will likely be left in an awkward state outside of the proprietary driver stack.\nWe'll see with time how the community contributes or not to this open-source NVIDIA kernel driver code as there's also the CLA that may turn off some contributors. But hopefully Nouveu will embrace using this kernel driver so they can focus their efforts on open-source NVIDIA support within Mesa for improving their Gallium3D driver for OpenCL and OpenGL and hopefully moving on to making a capable Vulkan driver.\nGo forth and clone from GitHub to enjoy the open-source NVIDIA kernel driver sources.

The vehicles, designed to perform round-the-clock cleaning services, are built on the high-performance, energy-efficient compute of NVIDIA.\nThe fleet of 50 vehicles is sweeping, sprinkling and spraying disinfectant in Guangzhou, China, all without a human driver at the wheel. The robo-sweepers run on a cloud-based fleet management platform that automatically schedules and dispatches vehicles using real-time information on daily traffic and routes.\n\nStreet sweeping is a critical municipal service. In addition to keeping dirt and debris off the road, it helps ensure trash and hazardous materials don\u2019t flow into storm drains and pollute local waterways.\nAs cities grow, applying autonomous driving technology to street cleaning vehicles enables these fleets to run more efficiently and maintain cleaner and healthier public spaces.\nSweep Smarts\nWhile street sweepers typically operate at lower speeds and in more constrained environments than robotaxis, trucks or other autonomous vehicles, they still require robust AI compute to safely operate.\nStreet cleaning vehicles must be able to drive in dense urban traffic, as well as in low-visibility conditions, such as nighttime and early morning. In addition, they have to detect and classify objects in the road as they clean.\nTo do so without a human at the wheel, these vehicles must process massive amounts of data from onboard sensors in real time. Redundant and diverse deep neural networks (DNNs) must work together to accurately perceive relevant information from this sensor data.\nAs a high-performance, software-defined AI compute platform, NVIDIA\u2019s solution is designed to handle the large number of applications and DNNs that run simultaneously in autonomous vehicles, while achieving systemic safety standards.\nA Model Lineup\nThe WeRide Robo Street Sweepers are the latest in the company\u2019s stable of autonomous vehicles and its second purpose-built and mass-produced self-driving vehicle model.\nWeRide has been developing autonomous technology on NVIDIA since 2017, building robotaxis, mini robobuses and robovans with the goal of accelerating intelligent urban transportation.\nIts robotaxis have already provided more than 350,000 rides for 180,000 passengers since 2019, while its mini robobuses began pilot operations to the public in January.\nThe company is currently building its next-generation self-driving solutions on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, using the high-performance AI compute platform to commercialize its autonomous lineup.\nAnd with the addition of these latest vehicles, WeRide\u2019s fleets are set to make a clean sweep.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Her artwork also appears in book illustrations and magazines.\nDreams of the Past (left) and Elf Archer by Yangtian Li.\nLi\u2019s impressive portfolio features character portraits of strong, graceful, empowered women. Their backstories and elegance are inspired by her own life experiences and world travels.\nSnake Witch by Yangtian Li.\nNow based in Seattle, Li\u2019s artistic journey began in Chengdu, China. Her hometown serves as the inspiration behind her extraordinary portrait, Snake Witch. This unique and provoking work is based on tribal black magic from Chinese folklore. Li drew and painted the piece, powered by a GeForce RTX GPU and the NVIDIA Studio platform.\nUp close, viewers can feel the allure of the Snake Witch.\nSnake Witch is a product of Li\u2019s fascination with black magic, or \u201cGu,\u201d where tribal witch doctors would gather toxic creatures, use their venom to make poison and practice the dark arts. \u201cI always thought the stories were fascinating, so I wanted to do a take,\u201d Li said. \u201cSnakes are more appealing to me, and it helps to create some interesting compositions.\u201d\nLi chooses to keep it simple before diving in on the details.\nAfter primarily working in 2D, Li moves to 3D to support her concept process. She adds, \u201chaving a high-end GPU really helps speed up the process when it comes to using Blender, Zbrush and so on.\u201d These speed-ups, she says, are particularly noticeable with GPU-accelerated rendering in Blender Cycles 3.0, achieving results that are over 5x faster with a GeForce RTX laptop GPU compared to a MacBook Pro M1 Max or CPU alone.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/itns-yangtian-li-snake-witch-distortion-crop-1280x680-3.mp4\n\u00a0\nWith the Snake Witch\u2019s character foundation in a good place, Li used the Liquify filter to subtly distort her subject\u2019s facial features.\n\nLiquify is one of over 30 GPU-accelerated features in Adobe Photoshop, like AI-powered Neural Filters, that help artists explore creative ideas and make complex adjustments in seconds.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/itns-yangtian-li-snake-witch-adjustment-layer-crop-1280x680-1.mp4\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe more life experiences you have, your understanding of the world evolves, and that will be reflected in your art.\u201d\n\nLi uses adjustment layers in the coloring phase of her process, allowing for non-destructive edits while trying to achieve the correct color tone.\nIf unsatisfied with an adjustment, Li can simply delete it while the original image remains intact.\nFinally, Li adjusts lighting, using the Opacity feature to block light from right of the image, adding a modicum of realistic flair.\nThe devil is in the details, or in this case, the Snake Witch.\nRemaining in a productive flow state is critical for Li, as it is for many artists, and her GeForce RTX GPU allows her to spend more time in that magical creative zone where ideas come to life faster and more naturally.\n\nLi goes into greater detail on how she created Snake Witch in her Studio Session. This three-part series includes her processes for initial sketching, color and detail optimization, and finishing touches.\nPreviously, Li has worked as a senior concept artist and designer at Amazon Game Studios, Niantic and Treyarch, among others.\nCheck out Li\u2019s portfolio and favorite projects on Instagram.\nAccelerating Adobe Creators In the NVIDIA Studio\nMore resources are available to creators seeking additional NVIDIA Studio features and optimizations that accelerate Adobe creative apps.\n\nFollow a step-by-step tutorial in Photoshop that details how to apply a texture from a photo to a 3D visualization render.\n\nLearn how to work significantly faster in Adobe Lightroom by utilizing AI-powered masking tools; Select Subject and Select Sky.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, access tutorials on the Studio YouTube channel, and get updates directly in your inbox by joining the NVIDIA Studio newsletter.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: In the NVIDIA Studio | NVIDIA Studio | Rendering \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Today\u2019s models deliver the performance to play the latest games at high detail levels and accelerate workloads in creative and science applications. They can connect to multiple high-resolution displays when you\u2019re at home or in the office, and when you\u2019re on the go have excellent battery life.\nFor anyone wanting to game or work in a broad range of applications, GeForce laptops have been the go-to for the longest time. And NVIDIA innovations such as DLSS, hardware-accelerated ray tracing, AI, and NVIDIA Broadcast have raised demand to record levels. In the last year alone, there\u2019s been a 35% growth in GeForce gaming laptop sales, and a 3X leap in sales of NVIDIA Studio laptops targeted at creatives and professional users of GPU-accelerated apps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are now over 180 laptop models for gamers and creators that feature our GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs and Max-Q technologies, covering every price point and use case, enabling every user to find the perfect laptop for their needs.\nEach GeForce RTX and NVIDIA Studio laptop boasts a massive array of technology that unlocks new possibilities, makes games faster, allows you to work more efficiently, and makes laptop use even better.\nFirst and foremost, our suite of AI-powered NVIDIA Max-Q technologies gives the very best laptop experience, automatically optimizing and regulating your laptop\u2019s CPU, GPU, power usage, and fans. Max-Q will optimize battery life and performance, manage fan acoustics for a more pleasant user experience, and enable you to get more done each day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX unlocks performant ray tracing with industry-leading denoising, enabling you to experience the highest-fidelity games with ray tracing, and to ray trace in applications like Blender, giving you higher-fidelity, more realistic results. And NVIDIA DLSS accelerates performance in over 180 games and apps, allowing you to game at much higher, more enjoyable framerates, and to render your application workloads at significantly higher speeds.\u00a0\nFor gamers, we\u2019ve also invented NVIDIA Reflex, which enables developers to greatly reduce system latency on PCs and laptops. With lower system latency, you can aim and react faster to in-game events, and gameplay gets perceptively smoother and more responsive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen gaming or working, you\u2019ll often be communicating with others, and at those times there\u2019s nothing more annoying and disruptive than loud background noise. Using the power of AI and the Tensor Cores found exclusively inside RTX GPUs, the free NVIDIA Broadcast app eliminates distractions. The app now comes pre-installed in creator laptops from Gigabyte, MSI, and ASUS.\nThe future of content creation is AI. And time-saving AI features \u2014 like the new depth map, object selection, and surface tracking in DaVinci Resolve 18 \u2014 require high-performance GPUs to deliver the best results.\nOur NVIDIA Studio platform collaborates with app developers to ensure maximum stability, optimize performance, and leverage NVIDIA technologies. Render faster, make more calculations per minute, and crunch bigger datasets; work more efficiently, get more done every day, and finish your coursework faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Studio is an end-to-end approach, starting from our GPUs that include dedicated hardware to accelerate ray tracing for 3D editors, AI features to simplify content creation, high-performance encoders, and decoders to accelerate video editing, and CUDA for compute intensive tasks like image processing and simulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are now over 200 NVIDIA accelerated apps, including 75 apps accelerated for RTX, delivering significant performance advantages for NVIDIA Studio users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Flagship Gaming Laptops Announced At COMPUTEX 2022\nThe GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Laptop GPUs are our most powerful yet, enabling owners to play at the highest resolutions and settings, with ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS enabled, for the definitive experience.

Its machine learning models accelerate properties through the title search, underwriting and closing processes, helping complete home transactions up to 15 percent faster.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of paperwork involved in this process,\u201d said Brian Holligan, director of data science at Doma. \u201cThe better we are at using machine learning to identify different document types and extract relevant information, the faster and more seamless the process can be.\u201d\nDoma uses machine learning to identify different types of real estate documents and extract insights from those files. It\u2019s also developing natural language understanding models to help everyone involved in a real estate transaction \u2014 from loan officers to real estate agents to homebuyers \u2014 rapidly interpret the numerous requests and inquiries that typically occur during the process.\nSince its beginnings in 2016, Doma has accelerated over 100,000 real estate transactions with machine learning.\nThe company uses machine learning models \u2014 both transformer-based NLP tools and convolutional neural networks for computer vision \u2014 that rely on NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs through Microsoft Azure for model training.\n\u201cWorking with a remote team, it\u2019s nice to have the flexibility of GPUs in the cloud,\u201d said Keesha Erickson, a data scientist at Doma. \u201cWe can spin up the right-sized machines based on the project or task at hand. If there\u2019s a larger-scale model with a longer run time, we can grab the GPUs that are appropriate for the time constraints we\u2019re under.\u201d\nDoma Machine Intelligence Delves Into Real Estate Docs\nOnce a seller and buyer have agreed on a purchase price for a home, they enter into a contract. But typically, a few weeks pass before keys actually change hands \u2014 a period known as escrow. During this process, the buyer\u2019s mortgage loan is finalized and a title company investigates the home\u2019s ownership, balance fees and tax history.\nDoma\u2019s GPU-accelerated machine learning models speed the title examination process by analyzing property records and mortgage files to help identify any risks that could disrupt the transaction.\nLike other fields such as drug discovery or architecture, the real estate industry has jargon that a general NLP model may not be able to interpret. To tailor its AI to this lingo, Doma fine-tunes a suite of models, including BERT-based models, using a corpus of proprietary real estate data.\nDoma\u2019s technology also uses computer vision models to analyze older real estate documents. Many records come from county courthouses and clerk\u2019s offices \u2014 and depending on the age of the home, records can be incredibly low-quality scans of paper documents that are decades old.\nDoma machine learning engineer Juhi Chandalia, who works on machine learning models for this kind of document processing, found that using NVIDIA GPUs for inference cut the team\u2019s time to insights by 4x, to under a minute.\n\u201cI\u2019ve started training models on CPU instead of GPU before, and realized it would take weeks to complete,\u201d Chandalia said. \u201cMy team relies on NVIDIA GPUs because otherwise, by the time we finished training and testing our machine learning models, they\u2019d be out of date.\u201d\nDoma offers application programming interfaces, predefined integrations and custom versions of its platform to its lender partners. The company has teamed up with major mortgage lenders around the U.S., including Chase, Homepoint Financial, PennyMac and Sierra Pacific Mortgage, to accelerate the mortgage transaction and refinance process.\nThe company is also bringing some of its machine learning tools to individuals \u2014 real estate agents, buyers and sellers \u2014 to further streamline the complex process for all parties in a real estate transaction.\nLearn more about how AI can help predict mortgage delinquencies, improve credit risk management and power banks of the future.\nSubscribe to the latest financial services news from NVIDIA.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Financial Services | Machine Learning \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Eventually, he\u2019ll reach a colossal size and disappear.\u201d\n3D Forest Creature sketch by Pablo Mu\u00f1oz G\u00f3mez.\nG\u00f3mez begins his journey in a 2D app, Krita, with a preliminary sketch. The idea is to figure out how many 3D assets will be needed while adding a little bit of color as reference for the palette later on.\n\nNext, G\u00f3mez moves to Zbrush, where he uses custom brushes to sculpt basic models for the creature, rocks and plants. It\u2019s the first of multiple leaps in his 2D to 3D workflow, detailed in this two-part 3D Forest Creature tutorial.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/studio-itns-pablo-05172022-blog-asset-substane-painter-loop.mp4\n\u00a0\nG\u00f3mez then turns to Adobe Substance 3D Painter to apply various colors and materials directly to his 3D models. Here, the benefits of NVIDIA RTX acceleration shine. NVIDIA Iray technology in the viewport enables G\u00f3mez to edit in real time and use ray-traced baking for faster rendering speeds \u2014 all accelerated by his GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.\nBuilding and applying custom photorealistic textures in Adobe Substance 3D Sampler.\n\u201cSince I switched to the GeForce RTX 3090, I\u2019m simply able to spend more time in the creative stages.\u201d\n\nSeeking further customization for his background, G\u00f3mez downloads and imports a grass asset from the Substance 3D asset library into Substance 3D Sampler, adjusting a few sliders to create a photorealistic material. RTX-exclusive interactive ray tracing lets G\u00f3mez apply realistic wear-and-tear effects in real time, powered by his GPU.\n3D workflows can be incredibly demanding. As G\u00f3mez notes, the right GPU allows him to focus on content creation. \u201cSince I switched to the GeForce RTX 3090, I\u2019m simply able to spend more time in the \u2018creative stages\u2019 and testing things to refine my concept when I don\u2019t have to wait for a render or worry about optimizing a scene so I can see it in real time,\u201d he said.\nGetting close to exporting final renders.\nG\u00f3mez sets up his scene in Marmoset 4, critically changing the denoiser from CPU to GPU. Doing so unlocks real-time ray tracing and smooth visuals in the viewport while he works. This can be done by accessing the Lighting then Ray Tracing selections in the main menu and changing the denoiser from CPU to GPU.\n\nWith the scene in a good place after some edits, G\u00f3mez generates his renders.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/studio-itns-pablo-05172022-blog-asset-photoshop-loop.mp4\n\u00a0\nHe makes final composition, lighting and color correction in Adobe Photoshop. With the addition of a new background, the scene is complete.\nThankfully, the 3D Forest Creature hasn\u2019t disappeared \u2026 yet!\nMore 3D to Explore\nG\u00f3mez has created several tutorials demonstrating 3D content creation techniques to aspiring artists. Check out this one on how to build a 3D scene from scratch.\n\nPart one of the Studio Session, Creating Stunning 3D Crystals, offers an inside look at sketching and concepting in Krita and modeling in Zbrush, while part two focuses on baking in Adobe Substance 3D Painter and texturing in Marmoset Toolbag 4.\n\nGenerally, low-polygon models for 3D workflows are great to work with on hardware that can\u2019t handle high-poly counts. G\u00f3mez\u2019s Studio Session, Creating a 3D Low-Poly Floating Island, demonstrates how to build low-poly models like his Floating Island within Zbrush and touch up in Adobe Photoshop.\n\nHowever, with the graphics horsepower and AI benefits of NVIDIA RTX and GeForce RTX GPUs, 3D artists can work with high-polygon models quickly and easily.\nLearning how to create in 3D takes ingenuity, notes G\u00f3mez: \u201cYou become more resourceful making your tools work for you in the way you want, even if that means finding a better tool to solve a particular process.\u201d But with enough practice, as seen from the variety of G\u00f3mez\u2019s portfolio, the results can be stunning.\nConcept artist Pablo Mu\u00f1oz G\u00f3mez.\nG\u00f3mez is the founder of ZBrushGuides and the 3DConceptArtist academy.

To date, over 250 games and applications have added RTX technologies, and at COMPUTEX 2022 we announced that DLSS is headed to another 12 games.\nHeadlining the new additions are F1\u24c7 22 and HITMAN 3, which are both introducing support for NVIDIA DLSS and ray-traced effects. DLSS is also coming to or has just launched in Deep Rock Galactic, LEAP, Ghost, Loopmancer, Hydroneer, Propnight, Raji: An Ancient Epic, Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong, Turbo Sloths, and Warstride Challenges.\nCheck out NVIDIA DLSS and RTX videos for the games below, and head to our dedicated COMPUTEX 2022 RTX Games article to learn more about each title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex Coming To ICARUS, My Time At Sandrock, and More\nNVIDIA Reflex is a must-have in games, reducing system latency so your actions occur quicker, making you more competitive in multiplayer matches, and making single-player titles more responsive. It\u2019s available in the most popular multiplayer and esports games, supported on GeForce graphics cards dating back to the 900 Series, and it takes only a single click to enable.\nNVIDIA Reflex is used by over 20 million players each month, making it one of NVIDIA\u2019s most successful technologies. And as more players jump on board, more developers do, too. Each month, more add NVIDIA Reflex to their games, with over 35 available already, and another four coming soon.\nAt COMPUTEX 2022, we announced NVIDIA Reflex is coming to ICARUS in June, and My Time At Sandrock when it launches into Early Access on May 26. Additionally, Reflex has just launched in Warstride Challenges and Soda Crisis.\nSee how NVIDIA Reflex helps reduce system latency in the videos and charts below, and check out our dedicated COMPUTEX 2022 NVIDIA Reflex article for further information.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew GeForce RTX and NVIDIA Studio Laptops Announced, Now Over 180 Designs!\nThe demand for laptops has exploded in recent years.

Today his company, Tapway, is riding a wave of computer vision and AI adoption in Southeast Asia.\nA call for help in 2019 with video analytics led to the Kuala Lumpur-based company\u2019s biggest project to date.\nMalaysia\u2019s largest operator of toll highways, PLUS, wanted to reduce congestion for its more than 1.5 million daily travelers. A national plan called for enabling car, taxi, bus and truck traffic to flow freely across multiple lanes \u2014 but that posed several big challenges.\nUnsnarling Traffic Jams\nThe highways charge five classes of tolls depending on vehicle type. Drivers pay using four different systems, and often enter the highway using one payment system, then exit using another, making it hard to track vehicles.\nDedicated lanes for different vehicle classes forced users to stop, slowing traffic, so toll booth operators could identify the specific vehicle. Even then some drivers scammed the system, exchanging cards on the highway to get lower tolls.\n\u201cWe showed them how with computer vision \u2014 just a camera and AI \u2014 you could solve all that,\u201d said Lim.\nAI Smooths the Flow\nUsing NVIDIA GPUs and software, Tapway trained and ran AI models that could read a vehicle\u2019s license plate and detect its class, make and color in just 50 milliseconds, about one-tenth of one eye blink \u2014 even if it\u2019s traveling at up to 40 kilometers/hour while approaching a toll plaza.\nTapway\u2019s VehicleTrack software works in all light and weather conditions with a consistent 97 percent accuracy. And thanks in part to NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, a single GPU can manage up to 50 simultaneous video streams.\nPLUS has installed 577 cameras so far, and plans to expand to nearly 900 in 92 toll plazas to meet its goal of freely flowing traffic.\nInside a Computer Vision System\nUnder the hood, the system depends on smart AI models trained in the cloud on a network of NVIDIA A100 and V100 Tensor Core GPUs.\nThey use a dataset of up to 100,000 images to prepare a new model for a Tapway customer in a few hours, a huge improvement on a CPU-based system that used to take several days, Lim said.\nBut the real magic comes with inference, running those models in production to process up to 28,800 images a minute on edge servers using NVIDIA A10, A30 and T4 GPUs.\nSoftware Makes It Sing\nTapway uses the NVIDIA DeepStream software development kit to build its computer vision apps, NVIDIA TensorRT to keep its AI models lean and fast, and Triton to play traffic cop, directing AI inference jobs.\n\u201cTriton is a real lifesaver for us,\u201d said Lim. \u201cWe had some scaling problems doing inference and multithreading on our own and couldn\u2019t scale beyond 12 video streams in a server, but with Triton we easily handle 20 and we\u2019ve tested it on up to 50 simultaneous streams,\u201d he said.\nIn February, Tapway officially became an NVIDIA Metropolis partner. The program gives companies in intelligent video analytics early access to technology and expertise.\nTapway is also a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program designed to nurture cutting-edge startups.\n\u201cWe had to pass stress tests in areas like multistreaming and security \u2014 that helped us strengthen our product offering \u2014 and from a business perspective it\u2019s a way to be recognized and further establish ourselves as an AI expert in the region,\u201d Lim said.\nAI Covers the Waterfront\nSince its start in 2014, Tapway has deployed 3,000 sensors in 500 locations throughout Malaysia and Singapore. Off the road, they help malls and retailers understand customer shopping habits, and now the company is gearing up to help manufacturers like the region\u2019s car makers and palm oil producers inspect products for quality control.\n\u201cThe demand has never been better, there are a lot of vision challenges in the world, and quite a few exciting projects we hope to land soon,\u201d he said.\nTo learn more, watch Lim\u2019s talk at GTC (free with registration).

Such technology could provide virtually limitless clean, safe and affordable energy to meet the world\u2019s growing demand.\nFusion is the principle that energy can be released by combining atomic nuclei together. But fusion energy has not yet been successfully scaled for production due to high energy input needs and unpredictable behavior of the fusion reaction.\n\nFusion reaction powers the sun, where massive gravitational pressures allow fusion to happen naturally at temperatures around 27 million degrees Fahrenheit. But Earth doesn\u2019t have the same gravitational pressure as the sun, and this means that temperatures to produce fusion need to be much higher \u2014 above 180 million degrees.\nTo replicate the power of the sun on Earth, researchers and engineers are using the latest advances in data science and extreme-scale computing to develop designs for fusion powerplants. With NVIDIA Omniverse, researchers could potentially build a fully functioning digital twin of a powerplant, helping ensure the most efficient designs are selected for construction.\n\nAccelerating Design, Simulation and Real-Time Collaboration\nBuilding a digital twin that accurately represents all powerplant components, the plasma, and the control and maintenance systems is a massive challenge \u2014 one that can benefit greatly from AI, exascale GPU computing, and physically accurate simulation software.\nIt starts with the design of a fusion powerplant, which requires a large number of parts and inputs from large teams of engineering, design and research experts throughout the process. \u201cThere are many different components, and we have to take into account lots of different areas of physics and engineering,\u201d said Lee Margetts, UKAEA chair of digital engineering for nuclear fusion at the University of Manchester. \u201cIf we make a design change in one system, this has a knock-on effect on other systems.\u201d\nExperts from various domains are involved in the project. Each team member uses different computer-aided design applications or simulation tools, and an expert\u2019s work in one domain depends on the data from others working in different domains.\nThe UKAEA team is exploring Omniverse to help them work together in a real-time simulation environment, so they can see the design of the whole machine rather than only individual subcomponents.\n\nOmniverse has been critical in keeping all these moving parts in sync. By enabling all tools and applications to connect, Omniverse allows the engineers working on the powerplant design to simultaneously collaborate from a single source of truth.\n\u201cWe can see three different engineers, from three different locations, working on three different components of a powerplant in three different packages,\u201d said Muhammad Omer, a researcher on the project.\nOmer explained that when experimenting in Omniverse, the team achieved photorealism in their powerplant designs using the platform\u2019s core abilities to import full-fidelity 3D data. They could also visualize in real time with the RTX Renderer, which made it easy for them to compare different design options for components.\n\nSimulation of fusion plasma is also a challenge. The teams developed Python-based Omniverse Extensions with Omniverse Kit to connect and ingest data from industry simulation software Monte Carlo Neutronics Code Geant4. This allows them to simulate neutron transport in the powerplant core, which is what carries energy out of the powerplant.\nThey also built Omniverse Extensions to view JOREK plasma simulation code, which simulates visible light emissions, giving the researchers insight into the plasma\u2019s state. The scientists will begin to explore the NVIDIA Modulus AI-physics framework to use with their existing simulation data to develop AI surrogate models to accelerate the fusion plasma simulations.\nSimulation of Monte Carlo Neutronics Code Geant4 in Omniverse.\nUsing AI to Optimize Designs and Enhance Digital Twins\nIn addition to helping design, operate and control the powerplant, Omniverse can help assist in the training of future AI-driven or AI-augmented robotic control and maintenance systems. These will be essential for maintaining plants in the radiation environment of the powerplant.\nUsing Omniverse Replicator, a software development kit for building custom synthetic data-generation tools and datasets, researchers can generate large quantities of physically accurate synthetic data of the powerplant and plasma behavior to train robotic systems. By learning in simulation, the robots can correctly handle tasks more accurately in the real world, improving predictive maintenance and reducing downtime.\nIn the future, sensor models could livestream observation data to the Omniverse digital twin, constantly keeping the virtual twin synchronized to the powerplant\u2019s physical state. Researchers will be able to explore various hypothetical scenarios by first testing in the virtual twin before deploying changes to the physical powerplant.\nOverall, Margetts and the team at UKAEA saw many unique opportunities and benefits in using Omniverse to build digital twins for fusion powerplants. Omniverse provides the possibility of a real-time platform that researchers can use to develop first-of-a-kind powerplant technology. The platform also allows engineers to seamlessly work together on powerplant designs. And teams can access integrated AI tools that will enable users to optimize future power plants.\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted about what we\u2019ve seen. We believe it\u2019s got great potential as a platform for digital engineering,\u201d said Margetts.\nWatch the demo and learn more about NVIDIA Omniverse.\nFeatured image courtesy of Brigantium Engineering and Bentley Systems.\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: 3D | Climate | Energy | High-Performance Computing | Omniverse | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Silicon and software that transforms data centers into AI factories. Gaming advances that bring the world\u2019s most popular games to life.\nTaiwan has become the engine that brings the latest innovations to the world. So it only makes sense that NVIDIA leaders brought their best ideas to this week\u2019s COMPUTEX technology conference in Taipei.\n\u201cTaiwan is the birthplace of the PC ecosystem and the spirit of COMPUTEX is to celebrate the incredible journey that built this $500 billion industry,\u201d Jeff Fisher, senior vice president for gaming products at NVIDIA told attendees.\n\nThe headline news:\n\nNVIDIA announced Taiwan\u2019s leading computer makers will release the first wave of systems powered by the NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip and Grace Hopper Superchip for workloads such as digital twins, AI, high-performance computing, cloud graphics and gaming.\nNVIDIA announced liquid-cooled NVIDIA A100 GPUs for data centers. They\u2019ll be available in the fall as a PCIe card and will ship from OEMs with the HGX A100 server. The H100 Liquid Cooled will be available in the HGX H100 server, and as the H100 PCIe in early 2023.\nPartners creating products around the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI and robotics platform announced more than 30 servers and appliances based on the NVIDIA Orin system-on-module.\nMomentum for NVIDIA RTX is growing, with over 250 RTX games and applications available, double that at last year\u2019s COMPUTEX. And GeForce gamers continue to upgrade, with over 30% now on RTX hardware, logging over 1 and a half billion hours of playtime with RTX. And DLSS is in the games that gamers want to play, with 12 new added to the ever-growing library.\n\nThe announcements punctuated a talk from six NVIDIA leaders who wove together advances from robotics to AI, silicon to software and highlighted the work of partners throughout the industry.\nClockwise, from top left: NVIDIA VP for Accelerated Computing Ian Buck, Senior VP for Hardware Engineering Brian Kelleher, Director of Product Management for Accelerated Computing Ying Yin Shih, CTO Michael Kagan, Senior VP for GeForce Jeff Fisher, VP of Embedded and Edge Computing Deepu Talla.\nTransforming Data Centers\nFirst up, NVIDIA VP for Hyperscale and HPC Ian Buck detailed how data centers are transforming into AI factories.\n\u201cThis transformation requires us to reimagine the data center at every level, from hardware to software, from chips to infrastructure to systems,\u201d Buck said.\nThis will drive massive business opportunities for NVIDIA\u2019s partners in data centers, HPC, in digital twins and cloud-based gaming referencing a \u201chalf-trillion market opportunity.\u201d\nPowering these modern AI factories requires end-to-end innovation at every level, Buck said.\nAnd with data centers becoming \u201cAI factories,\u201d data processing is essential.\nThese include NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, NVIDIA Grace CPUs and NVIDIA BlueField DPUs as the building blocks networked together by NVIDIA Quantum and Spectrum switches.\n\u201cThe Bluefield DPU along with the Quantum and Spectrum networking switches comprise the infrastructure platform for the AI factory of the future,\u201d said CTO Michael Kagan\nNVIDIA technologies will be featured in a wide range of server designs, including NVIDIA CGX for cloud gaming, OVX for digital twins, and HGX Grace and HGX Grace Hopper for science, data analytics and AI.\nNVIDIA announced the first wave of systems powered by the NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip and Grace Hopper Superchip are expected starting in the first half of 2023.\n\u201cGrace will be amazing at AI, data analytics, scientific computing, and hyperscale computing,\u201d said NVIDIA senior VP for hardware engineering Brian Kelleher. \u201cAnd, of course, the full suite of NVIDIA software platforms will run on Grace.\u201d\nThe Grace-powered systems from ASUS, Foxconn Industrial Internet, GIGABYTE, QCT, Supermicro and Wiwynn join x86 and other Arm-based servers to offer customers a broad range of choices.\n\u201cAll of these servers are optimized for NVIDIA accelerated computing software stacks, and can be qualified as part of our NVIDIA-Certified Systems lineup,\u201d said Director of Product Management for Accelerated Computing Ying Yin Shih\nTo provide enterprises with options to deploy green data centers, NVIDIA also announced its first data center PCIe GPU with direct chip liquid cooling.\nThe liquid-cooled A100 PCIe GPUs will be supported in mainstream servers by at least a dozen system builders, with the first shipping in the third quarter of this year.\n\u201cAll of these combine to deliver the infrastructure of the data center of the future that handles these massive workloads,\u201d Buck said.\nFinally, getting all of this to run seamlessly requires NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, which delivers robust 24/7 AI deployment, Buck said.\n\u201cWhen it comes to reimagining the data center, NVIDIA has the complete, open platform of hardware and software to build the AI factories of the future,\u201d Buck said.\nRevolutionizing Robotics with AI\nAI is also reaching more deeply into the world around us.\nDeepu Talla, VP of Embedded and Edge Computing, spoke about how the global drive to automation makes robotics a major new application for AI.\nNVIDIA announced this week that more than 30 leading partners worldwide will be among those offering the first wave of NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin-powered production systems at COMPUTEX in Taipei.\nNew products are coming from a dozen Taiwan-based camera, sensor and hardware providers for use in edge AI, AIoT, robotics and embedded applications.\n\u201cWe are entering the age of robotics \u2014 autonomous machines that are keenly aware of their environment and that can make smart decisions about their actions,\u201d Talla said.\nAvailable worldwide since GTC in March, the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin developer kit delivers 275 trillion operations per second, packing over 8x the processing power of its predecessor, NVIDIA AGX Xavier, in the same pin-compatible form factor.\nJetson Orin features the NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPU, Arm Cortex-A78AE CPUs, next-generation deep learning and vision accelerators, high-speed interfaces, faster memory bandwidth, and multimodal sensor support capable of feeding multiple, concurrent AI application pipelines.\nOffering server-class performance for edge AI, new Jetson AGX Orin production modules will be available in July, while Orin NX modules are coming in September.\nSuch modules are key to embedding smarter devices in the world around us, Talla said.\nNVIDIA Isaac, the company\u2019s robotics platform, has four pillars, he explained.\nThe first pillar is about creating the AI, \u201ca very time-consuming and difficult process that we are making fast and easy,\u201d Talla said, highlighting how tools such as the Isaac Replicator for synthetic data generation, NVIDIA pre-trained models available on NGC, and the NVIDIA TAO toolkit are addressing this challenge.\nThe second pillar is simulating the operation of the robot in the virtual world before it is deployed in the real world with Isaac Sim, Talla explained.\nThe third pillar is building the physical robots.\nAnd the fourth pillar is about managing the fleet of robots over their lifetimes, typically many years if not more than a decade, Talla said.\nAs part of that, Talla detailed Isaac Nova Orin, a reference design for state-of-the-art compute and sensors for autonomous mobile robots (AMR) \u2014 packed with technologies such as DeepMap, CuOpt and Metropolis.\nAnd he explained how NVIDIA Fleet Command provides secure management for fleets of AMRs.\n\u201cThis is the industry\u2019s most comprehensive end-to-end robotics platform and we continue to invest in it,\u201d Talla said.\nMore Power for Gaming and Content Creation\nSpeaking last, Fisher detailed how NVIDIA is working to deliver innovation to gamers and content creators.\nOver the past 20 years, NVIDIA and its partners have dedicated themselves to building the best platform for gaming and creating, Fisher said.\n\u201cHundreds of millions now count on it to play, work and learn,\u201d he said.\nNVIDIA RTX, introduced in 2018, has reinvented graphics thanks to advanced features such as real-time ray tracing \u2014 and the momentum around it continues to grow.\nThere are now over 250 RTX-enabled games and applications, doubling since last Computex, Fisher said.\nNVIDIA DLSS continues to set the standard for super resolution with best in class performance and image quality, and is now integrated into more than 180 games and applications.\nAt COMPUTEX, DLSS is in the games that gamers want to play, with 12 new games added to the ever-growing library.\nAmong the highlights: the developers of the critically-acclaimed HITMAN 3 announced they will be adding NVIDIA DLSS along with ray-traced reflections and ray-traced shadows on May 24.\nIn addition, NVIDIA Reflex is now supported in 38 games, 22 displays, and 45 mice. With over 20M gamers playing with Reflex ON every month, Reflex has become one of NVIDIA\u2019s most successful technologies.\nThe Reflex ecosystem is continuing to grow: ASUS debuted the world\u2019s first 500Hz G-SYNC display, the ASUS ROG Swift 500Hz gaming monitor. Acer also launched the Predator X28 G-SYNC display. Meanwhile, Cooler Master introduced the MM310 and MM730 gaming mice with Reflex.\nGaming laptops continue to be the fastest-growing PC category and 4th generation Max-Q Technologies \u2014 the latest iteration of NVIDIA\u2019s design for thin and light laptops \u2014 is delivering a new level of power efficiency. GeForce RTX laptop models now total over 180.\n\u201cThese are our most portable, highest performance laptops ever,\u201d Fisher said.\nThese powerful systems are being used to help build massive, interconnected 3D destinations.\nNVIDIA Studio, the RTX-powered platform that includes dozens of SDKs and accelerates the top creative apps and tools, and NVIDIA Omniverse, the company\u2019s platform for building interconnected 3D virtual worlds, are designed to enable collaboration and construction of these virtual worlds, Fisher said.\nOmniverse is getting a number of updates to accelerate creator workflows. Omniverse Cloud Simple Share, now in closed early access, allows users to send an Omniverse scene for others to view with a single click. Audio2Emotion will soon be coming to Audio2Face, providing an AI-powered animation feature that generates realistic facial expressions based on an audio file, Fisher said.\nIn addition, the Omniverse XR App is now available in beta. With it you can open your photorealistic Omniverse scene and experience it, fully immersive, in Virtual Reality, Fisher said.

They demand more data and more intelligence, often with AI, and they want it in a sustainable way,\u201d said Smith, a Julliard grad who got into tech in the early 2000\u2019s building websites for fellow musicians in New York City.\nMarking Progress in Efficiency\nAs of April, Equinix has issued $4.9 billion in green bonds. They\u2019re investment-grade instruments Equinix will apply to reducing environmental impact through optimizing power usage effectiveness (PUE), an industry metric of how much of the energy a data center uses goes directly to computing tasks.\nData center operators are trying to shave that ratio ever closer to the ideal of 1.0 PUE.\u00a0 Equinix facilities have an average 1.48 PUE today with its best new data centers hitting less than 1.2.\nEquinix is making steady progress in the energy efficiency of its data centers as measured by PUE (inset).\nIn another step forward, Equinix opened in January a dedicated facility to pursue advances in energy efficiency. One part of that work focuses on liquid cooling.\nBorn in the mainframe era, liquid cooling is maturing in the age of AI. It\u2019s now widely used inside the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers in a modern form called direct-chip cooling.\nLiquid cooling is the next step in accelerated computing for NVIDIA GPUs that already deliver up to 20x better energy efficiency on AI inference and high performance computing jobs than CPUs.\nEfficiency Through Acceleration\u00a0\nIf you switched all the CPU-only servers running AI and HPC worldwide to GPU-accelerated systems, you could save a whopping 11 trillion watt-hours of energy a year. That\u2019s like saving the energy more than 1.5 million homes consume in a year.\nToday, NVIDIA adds to its sustainability efforts with the release of our first data center PCIe GPU using direct-chip cooling.\nEquinix is qualifying the A100 80GB PCIe Liquid-Cooled GPU for use in its data centers as part of a comprehensive approach to sustainable cooling and heat capture. The GPUs are sampling now and will be generally available this summer.\nSaving Water and Power\n\u201cThis marks the first liquid-cooled GPU introduced to our lab, and that\u2019s exciting for us because our customers are hungry for sustainable ways to harness AI,\u201d said Smith.\nData center operators aim to eliminate chillers that evaporate millions of gallons a water a year to cool the air inside data centers. Liquid cooling promises systems that recycle small amounts of fluids in closed systems focused on key hot spots.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll turn a waste into an asset,\u201d he said.\nSame Performance, Less Power\nIn separate tests, both Equinix and NVIDIA found a data center using liquid cooling could run the same workloads as an air-cooled facility while using about 30 percent less energy. NVIDIA estimates the liquid-cooled data center could hit 1.15 PUE, far below 1.6 for its air-cooled cousin.\nLiquid-cooled data centers can pack twice as much computing into the same space, too. That\u2019s because the A100 GPUs use just one PCIe slot; air-cooled A100 GPUs fill two.\nNVIDIA sees power savings, density gains with liquid cooling.\nAt least a dozen system makers plan to incorporate these GPUs into their offerings later this year. They include ASUS, ASRock Rack, Foxconn Industrial Internet, GIGABYTE, New H3C Information Technologies, Inspur Electronic Information, Inventec, Nettrix, QCT, Supermicro, Wiwynn and xFusion\nA Global Trend\nRegulations setting energy-efficiency standards are pending in Asia, Europe and the U.S. That\u2019s motivating banks and other large data center operators to evaluate liquid cooling, too.\nAnd the technology isn\u2019t limited to data centers. Cars and other systems need it to cool high-performance systems embedded inside confined spaces.\nThe Road to Sustainability\n\u201cThis is the start of a journey,\u201d said Smith of the debut of liquid-cooled mainstream accelerators.\nIndeed, we plan to follow up the A100 PCIe card with a version next year using the H100 Tensor Core GPU based on the NVIDIA Hopper architecture. We plan to support liquid cooling in our high-performance data center GPUs and our NVIDIA HGX platforms for the foreseeable future.\nFor fast adoption, today\u2019s liquid-cooled GPUs deliver the same performance for less energy. In the future, we expect these cards will provide an option of getting more performance for the same energy, something users say they want.\n\u201cMeasuring wattage alone is not relevant, the performance you get for the carbon impact you have is what we need to drive toward,\u201d said Smith.\nLearn more about our new A100 PCIe liquid-cooled GPUs.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate Sustainability | Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Cloud Services | Computex | Corporate Responsibility | Customer Stories | Events | GPU | GPU Computing | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Built using the HPE Cray EX supercomputer, Venado is a heterogeneous system that will feature a mix of Grace CPU Superchip nodes and Grace Hopper Superchip nodes for a wide and emerging set of applications. When completed, the system is expected to exceed 10 exaflops of AI performance.\n\u201cBy equipping LANL\u2019s researchers with the performance of NVIDIA Grace Hopper, Venado will continue this laboratory\u2019s commitment to pushing the boundaries of scientific breakthroughs,\u201d said Irene Qualters, associate director for Simulation and Computation at LANL. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing platform and expansive ecosystem are removing performance barriers, allowing LANL to make new discoveries that will benefit the nation and society as a whole.\u201d\nAlps, the Swiss National Computing Center\u2019s new system, also to be built by HPE using the HPE Cray EX supercomputer, will use the Grace Hopper Superchip to enable breakthrough research in a wide range of fields. It will serve as a general-purpose system open to the research community in Switzerland, as well as the rest of the world.\nNVIDIA Grace Speeds Up Compute-Intensive Workloads\r\nThe NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip features two Arm\u00ae-based CPUs, connected coherently through the high-bandwidth, low-latency, low-power NVIDIA NVLink\u00ae-C2C interconnect. This breakthrough design features up to 144 high-performance Arm Neoverse cores with scalable vector extensions and a 1 terabyte-per-second memory subsystem.\nThe Grace CPU Superchip interfaces with the latest PCIe Gen5 protocol to enable maximum connectivity with the highest-performing GPUs, as well as with NVIDIA ConnectX\u00ae-7 smart network interface cards and NVIDIA BlueField\u00ae-3 DPUs for secure HPC and AI workloads.\nThe Grace Hopper Superchip pairs an NVIDIA Hopper GPU with an NVIDIA Grace CPU in an integrated module connected with NVLink-C2C to address HPC and giant-scale AI applications.\nThe NVIDIA Grace-powered systems will run the portfolio of NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA HPC software for full-stack, integrated computing.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Grace technologies during the ISC special address with Buck, taking place on Monday, May 30, at 9:30 a.m. PT.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing and artificial intelligence.

One of the early adopters is Equinix, which is test-driving the servers and hopes to implement liquid cooling in a sustainable AI platform.\nRich MillerAn image of an NVIDIA-liquid cooled PCIe A100 GPU. (Image: NVIDIA)       In a move to enable wider use of liquid cooling, NVIDIA is introducing its first data center GPU with direct chip liquid cooling. NVIDIA is touting the A100 PCIe GPU as a sustainability tool to deploy green data centers, rather than a strategy to boost performance.By expanding the availability of liquid-cooled GPUs, NVIDIA is seeking to reduce the energy impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and other high-density applications, which pose challenges for data center design and management. Powerful new hardware for AI workloads is packing more computing power into each piece of equipment, boosting the power density \u2013 the amount of electricity used by servers and storage in a rack or cabinet \u2013 and the accompanying heat.NVIDIA says the liquid-cooled NVIDIA A100 PCIe GPU will deliver the same high performance with 30% less energy than air-cooled hardware. Because liquid cooling also allows for higher rack density, NVIDIA says the new GPUs will also allow data center operators to use less floor space to deliver the same capacity.\u201cAll of these combine to deliver the infrastructure of the data center of the future that handles these massive workloads,\u201d said Ian Buck, NVIDIA VP for Hyperscale and HPC. \u201cWe have reimagined the data center.\u201dEquinix is Early AdopterThe liquid-cooled NVIDIA GPUs are running at Equinix in the company\u2019s Co-Innovation Facility (CIF) in Ashburn, Virginia, where the huge digital infrastructure company is test-driving technologies that will drive the data center of the future.\u201cThis marks the first liquid-cooled GPU introduced to our lab, and that\u2019s exciting for us because our customers are hungry for sustainable ways to harness AI,\u201d said Zac Smith, Global Head of Edge Infrastructure Services at Equinix, which is the largest provider of colocation and interconnection services, with 10,000 customers and 240 data centers across the globe.Equinix said last year that it hopes to use liquid cooling technology in its Equinix Metal service to create a high-density, energy efficient computing platform. NVIDIALike most data centers, Equinix uses air to cool the servers in its data centers, where it leases space to customers. Liquid cooling is used primarily in technical computing, enabling the use of more powerful hardware that uses more energy.The new liquid-cooled GPUs can reduce the offset that energy impact, NVIDIA said, sharing results of testing with Equinix, in which liquid-cooled racks with 2,000 servers and density of 30 kW per rack used 30% less energy and 66% less space than 2,000 air-cooled servers at 15 kW per rack.Bringing Liquid Cooling to the Mass MarketEnd users and system builders have adapted GPUs for liquid cooling for some time, but NVIDIA\u2019s move will make these systems more widely available. The announcement was part of NVIDIA\u2019s presentation for the Computex 2022 trade show in Taiwan.NVIDIA says its liquid-cooled A100 PCIe GPUs will be supported in mainstream servers by at least a dozen system builders, with the first shipping in the third quarter of this year. They include ASUS, ASRock Rack, Foxconn Industrial Internet, GIGABYTE, H3C, Inspur, Inventec, Nettrix, QCT, Supermicro, Wiwynn and xFusion, according to an NVIDIA blog post.The liquid-cooled GPUs will be available in the fall as a PCIe card and will ship from OEMs with the HGX A100 server.\u00a0The company plans to follow up the A100 PCIe card with a version next year using the new H100 Tensor Core GPU based on the NVIDIA Hopper architecture, the key building blocks for its vision to transform data centers into \u201cAI factories,\u201d unleashing new frontiers in technical computing.\u201cWe plan to support liquid cooling in our high-performance data center GPUs and our NVIDIA HGX platforms for the foreseeable future,\u201d NVIDIA said. \u201cFor fast adoption, today\u2019s liquid-cooled GPUs deliver the same performance for less energy. In the future, we expect these cards will provide an option of getting more performance for the same energy, something users say they want.\u201dNVIDIA says its liquid-cooled GPUs can drive a PUE (power usage effectiveness, a leading energy efficiency metric) of 1.15.Industry Leaders Invest in Liquid CoolingWe\u2019ve been tracking progress in rack density and liquid cooling adoption for years at Data Center Frontier as part of our focus on new technologies and how they may transform the data center.Cold water is often used to chill air in room-level and row-level systems, and these systems are widely adopted in data centers. The real shift is in designs that bring liquids into the server chassis to cool chips and components. This can be done through enclosed systems featuring pipes and plates, or by immersing servers in fluids. Some vendors integrate water cooling into the rear-door of a rack or cabinet.Bringing water to the chip enables even greater efficiency,\u00a0creating tightly-designed and controlled environments that focus the cooling as close as possible to the heat- generating components. This technique can cool components using warmer water temperatures.In 2019 Google decided to shift to liquid cooling with parts of its data center infrastructure to support its latest custom hardware for artificial intelligence. Alibaba and other Chinese hyperscale companies have also adopted liquid cooling, and last year Microsoft said it is using immersion-cooled servers\u00a0in production, and believes the technology can help boost the capacity and efficiency of its cloud data centers.Intel recently introduced an open intellectual property immersion liquid cooling solution and reference design, initiated in Taiwan. (Credit: Intel Corporation)The growing importance of liquid cooling to technology vendors is reflected in Intel\u2019s announcement last week that it plans to invest more than $700 million to create a 200,000-square-foot, research and development \u201cmega lab\u201d\u00a0 in Hillsboro, Oregon focused on innovative data center technologies, including liquid cooling. The company also announced an open intellectual property (open IP) immersion liquid cooling solution and reference design, with the initial design proof of concept initiated in Taiwan.The Open Compute Project (OCP) has also created an Advanced Cooling Solutions project to boost collaboration on liquid cooling for the hyperscale ecosystem. A similar initiative is underway at Open19, which serves as as alternative to OCP focused on edge and enterprise computing.Like most data center operators, Equinix is focused on climate change and reducing the impact of its operations on the environment. More hot processors require more cooling, and both consume more energy. Smith, who is also president of the Open19 foundation, says the group\u2019s designs could position Equinix Metal \u2013 a cloud-style service where Equinix manages the hardware and leases capacity on bare metal servers \u2013 as a path for customers to deploy AI workloads sustainably and quickly through a web interface.If Equinix succeeds, that could prompt other colocation providers to respond with similar services, as data center customers look beyond on-premises facilities that may struggle to support higher rack density and liquid cooling infrastructure.

Crypto mining is the process of obtaining crypto rewards in exchange for verifying transactions on distributed ledgers.Recommended Stories list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4UK pushes tough tech rules under new digital watchdoglist 2 of 4Bitcoin drops by most in almost a month as Fed optimism fadeslist 3 of 4Big tech breakouts: Apple leads rally after rough start to 2022list 4 of 4Chipmaker Nvidia forecasts upbeat current-quarter revenueend of list\n\u201cAll issuers, including those that pursue opportunities involving emerging technology, must ensure that their disclosures are timely, complete, and accurate,\u201d Kristina Littman, head of the SEC\u2019s crypto enforcement team, said in the statement.\nA Nvidia spokesman declined to comment. The company, which is based in Santa Clara, California, agreed to the penalty without admitting or denying the regulator\u2019s findings. Advertisement \nNvidia increased 1.2% to $190.73 per share at 11:04 a.m. in New York.\nAccording to the SEC, Nvidia omitted the information about surging demand from crypto miners while making statements about how digital assets were affecting other business lines.\n\nThe growth of crypto mining has been a boon to Nvidia in recent years, but it\u2019s also brought headaches.\nThe firm\u2019s powerful processors designed to handle video-game graphics are considered well-suited for mining cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin \u2014 and it\u2019s been hard to tell what task customers are buying the products for.\nThe situation has made Nvidia\u2019s financial results\u00a0less predictable.\nA surge in demand for graphics chips \u2014 fueled in part by the crypto craze \u2014 led to a run-up in 2017. But that windfall was short-lived, and the following year the company slashed annual sales forecasts to below analysts\u2019 estimates. The disappointment caused investors to dump the stock, resulting in a 20% decline over two trading days.\nTo address the volatility, Nvidia is now offering chips designed specifically for crypto mining. And it adjusted its graphics cards so they\u2019re harder to use for that task.\nInvestors will get a fresh peek at Nvidia\u2019s efforts to navigate the crypto industry on May 25, when the company reports its quarterly results.\n(Adds SEC details starting in the fifth paragraph.)\n\u2013With assistance from\u00a0Nick Turner.\n\u00a0\nSource: Bloombergaj-logoaj-logoaj-logo Sponsored Content  Advertisement AboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usStay ConnectedNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2025 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"

Adi has covered video games, biohacking, and more for The Verge since 2011.Nvidia will pay $5.5 million to settle charges that it unlawfully obscured how many of its graphics cards were sold to cryptocurrency miners. The US Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges and a settlement with the company today. Its order claims Nvidia misled investors by reporting a huge boost in revenue related to \u201cgaming,\u201d hiding how much its success relied on the far more volatile crypto market. Nvidia isn\u2019t admitting to wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but it agrees to stop any unlawful failures to disclose information.The charges stem from Nvidia\u2019s fiscal year 2018 financial reports. The SEC notes Nvidia saw an explosion in crypto mining-related sales in 2017, when the rewards of mining Ethereum grew dramatically. Crypto mining was widely reported as a cause of GPU scarcity, and Nvidia launched a separate CMP line specifically for mining, attempting to prevent shortages for gamers. But employees apparently acknowledged that many gaming GPUs were still going to miners. \u201cThe company\u2019s sales personnel, in particular in China, reported what they believed to be significant increases in demand for Gaming GPUs as a result of crypto mining,\u201d the order says.Investors \u201croutinely\u201d asked how much Nvidia relied on crypto miningGiven the boom-and-bust nature of cryptocurrency, this meant Nvidia\u2019s sales numbers didn\u2019t necessarily indicate reliable future growth, making investing in it riskier. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s analysts and investors were interested in understanding the extent to which the company\u2019s Gaming revenue was impacted by crypto mining and routinely asked senior management about the extent to which increases in gaming revenue during this time frame were driven by crypto mining,\u201d the SEC alleges.Despite this, Nvidia didn\u2019t mention mining-related sales as a factor in its gaming division\u2019s success. Meanwhile, it mentioned crypto as an important factor in other markets, which suggested to the SEC that it was being deliberately deceptive. And investors\u2019 anxieties turned out to be well-founded. A crypto crash in late 2018 (along with a weakening Chinese market) led it to slash its quarterly earnings projections by $500 million and spurred a shareholder lawsuit.\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s disclosure failures deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company\u2019s business in a key market,\u201d says SEC Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit head Kristina Littman. \u201cAll issuers, including those that pursue opportunities involving emerging technology, must ensure that their disclosures are timely, complete, and accurate.\u201dSee More: CryptoEntertainmentGamingLawNewsPolicyTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Stage 3: Connecting the central and north regions Stage 3 of TEL will significantly cut down travel time between the north and central regions of Singapore when it opens later this year. Housing prices are known to be high in the central area, but there are a number of affordable developments near a TEL station just outside Orchard.    Outstanding Outram Park Outram Park MRT Station is one to watch because it is one of the few interchanges that connect TEL to two other MRT lines. Residents living near Outram Park MRT Station can enjoy superior connectivity to all parts of Singapore. One Pearl Bank is a landmark development near Outram Park MRT Station. The 774-unit development is slated for completion in 2023. In addition to having a MRT station at their doorstep, residents of the upcoming development are a short drive away from the CBD, Orchard Road and the bohemian Tiong Bahru neighbourhood. Based on caveats lodged with URA, One Pearl Bank is almost 80% sold at an average price of $2,507 psf.     New condos creating much buzz  The upcoming Great World and Havelock MRT Stations are only a few stops away from Outram Park MRT Station, giving commuters easy access to three MRT lines. Irwell Hill Residences near Great World MRT Station and Riviere near Havelock MRT Station created much buzz when they were launched. Irwell Hill Residences saw 51.5% of its units snapped up during the launch weekend. Current take-up for the 540-unit project is almost 83%, based on caveats lodged with URA. Average price for the leasehold development is $2,816 psf, based on transactions for the last six months. The project is expected to receive temporary occupation permit (TOP) in 2025.    Model of Irwell Hill Residences (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Buyers with a more modest budget should check out Riviere which has a lower average price of $2,720 psf. Located near Havelock MRT Station and overlooking the Singapore River, the 455-unit development is expected to receive TOP in 1H2023.    Artist\u2019s impression of the upcoming Riviere (Picture: Frasers Property) There are more affordable options near Havelock MRT Station but such developments are older. Average prices for freehold Mirage Tower and leasehold Harvest Mansions are $2,097 psf and $1,189 psf respectively. Both developments received TOP in 1996. Nearby leasehold Emerald Park, which received TOP in 1993, has an average price of $1,264 psf.   Story continues   Stage 4: Onboarding the east Condominiums along East Coast, with their panoramic sea view, are popular with buyers. The improved connectivity after the opening of Stage 4 TEL in 2024 will give a boost to demand for homes in the area, especially around Tanjong Rhu and Bayshore MRT Stations. En bloc interest may also be spurred for older developments.\u00a0(See potential condos with en bloc calculator)  Connecting Tanjong Rhu Residents in Tanjong Rhu enjoy beautiful views of the sea and proximity to the city, but suffer from the lack of accessibility to an MRT station. Pebble Bay, Tanjong Ria Condominium and Costa Rhu are the first condominiums to be developed in Tanjong Rhu. All three projects are leasehold developments that obtained TOP in 1997. Average prices for the three projects range from $1,241 psf to $1,517 psf.  The developments are an excellent choice for those who want to live near the CBD for under $1,600 psf and are willing to compromise on the age of the development. Investors should also consider the developments because of the expected boost in prices after the opening of TEL.The developments are also popular with tenants, with at least 72 rental transactions in the last 12 month. Monthly rents for the condominiums range from $2.90 psf to $3.40 psf and rental yields are 2.7% to 2.8%.  The age of the three developments plus the upcoming Tanjong Rhu MRT Station make the developments candidates for potential en bloc sales. Tanjong Ria Condominium is the most likely candidate because it is the smallest with 168 units, which makes it easier to get consent from sufficient number of owners. Tanjong Ria Condominium will also be more appealing to developers because its smaller size means less capital outlay and risk exposure. Costa Rhu and Pebble Bay have 737 and 510 units respectively.Massive developments near Bayshore MRT StationA trio of massive condominium developments will benefit from the upcoming Bayshore MRT Station: Costa Del Sol (906 units), The Bayshore (1,038 units) and Bayshore Park (1,083 units).The Bayshore, having received TOP in 1996, is younger than Bayshore Park by 10 years. However, The Bayshore is slightly cheaper with an average price of $1,097 psf compared to Bayshore Park ($1,122 psf). This could be because The Bayshore is further from the sea.  The Bayshore (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)Costa Del Sol is the youngest among the three developments, having received TOP in 2004. Its relative youth could explain why the development has the highest average price of $1,530 psf.The Bayshore presents an excellent value proposition, because its average price is not only the lowest among the three developments but also lower than the overall average of $1,181 psf by $84 psf (7.7%). Bayshore Park should not be discounted because its average price is also lower than the overall average by $59 psf (5.3%).  The three developments are also popular with tenants. Each development has at least 232 rental transactions over the past 12 months, with rents ranging from $2.70 psf to $3.30 psf per month. Rental yields are 2.7% to 3.1%.  Stage 5: Potential for growthThe final two stations on TEL are expected to open in 2025. The areas around the stations are lightly populated, but more residents can be expected after the stations become operational. However, population growth in both areas will be restricted by the East Coast Park, Laguna National Golf and Country Club, as well as Tanah Merah Country Club (Tampines course).  There are 3,349 private residential units and 2,140 HDB flats near Bedok South MRT Station.\u00a0As for Sungei Bedok MRT Station, there are only 832 private residential units and no HDB flats. Both MRT stations are in the Bedok planning area which has 97,551 residents, with 87% of them being owners.  Key observations Stage 3 of TEL passes through central Singapore which is already well-served by MRT lines. However, TEL will allow commuters from all parts to the island to travel to central Singapore faster. Commuters will also have a wider choice of routes. The East Coast area is currently underserved by the MRT network. TEL Stage 4 will connect residents in the east to the central and north regions of Singapore. The improved connectivity is expected to give a boost to property prices and en bloc potential. The population near Stage 5 of TEL is expected to grow after the line is operational. However, population growth will be limited by East Coast Park and two golf courses. \u00a0Check out the latest listings near One Pearl Bank, Irwell Hill Residences, Rivi\u00e8re, Harvest Mansions, Mirage Tower, Costa Del Sol, The Bayshore, Bayshore Park, Tanjong Rhu MRT Station, Pebble Bay, Tanjong Ria Condominium, Costa Rhu, Emerald Park, Outram Park MRT Station, Havelock MRT Station, Bedok South MRT Station, Sungei Bedok MRT Station\u00a0\u00a0See Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) One Pearl Bank hits new high of $2,891 psf COMMENTARY: Can you afford a 3-bedroom home?

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

The Grace-powered systems will join x86 and other Arm-based servers to offer customers a broad range of choice for achieving high performance and efficiency in their data centers.\n\u201cA new type of data center is emerging \u2014 AI factories that process and refine mountains of data to produce intelligence \u2014 and NVIDIA is working closely with our Taiwan partners to build the systems that enable this transformation,\u201d said Ian Buck, vice president of Hyperscale and HPC at NVIDIA. \u201cThese new systems from our partners, powered by our Grace Superchips, will bring the power of accelerated computing to new markets and industries globally.\u201d\nThe coming servers are based on four new system designs featuring the Grace CPU Superchip and Grace Hopper Superchip, which NVIDIA announced at its two most recent GTC conferences. The 2U form factor designs provide the blueprints and server baseboards for original design manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers to quickly bring to market systems for the NVIDIA CGX\u2122 cloud gaming, NVIDIA OVX\u2122 digital twin and the NVIDIA HGX\u2122 AI and HPC platforms.\nSupercharging Modern Workloads\r\nThe two NVIDIA Grace Superchip technologies enable a broad range of compute-intensive workloads across a multitude of system architectures.\n\nThe Grace CPU Superchip features two CPU chips, connected coherently through an NVIDIA NVLink\u00ae-C2C interconnect, with up to 144 high-performance Arm V9 cores with scalable vector extensions and a 1 terabyte-per-second memory subsystem. The breakthrough design provides the highest performance and twice the memory bandwidth and energy efficiency of today\u2019s leading server processors to address the most demanding HPC, data analytics, digital twin, cloud gaming and hyperscale computing applications.\nThe Grace Hopper Superchip pairs an NVIDIA Hopper\u2122 GPU with a Grace CPU over NVLink-C2C in an integrated module designed to address HPC and giant-scale AI applications. Using the NVLink-C2C interconnect, the Grace CPU transfers data to the Hopper GPU 15x faster than traditional CPUs.\n\nBroad Grace Server Portfolio for AI, HPC, Digital Twins and Cloud Gaming\r\nThe Grace CPU Superchip and Grace Hopper Superchip server design portfolio includes systems available in single baseboards with one-, two- and four-way configurations available across four workload-specific designs that can be customized by server manufacturers according to customer needs:\n\nNVIDIA HGX Grace Hopper systems for AI training, inference and HPC are available with the Grace Hopper Superchip and NVIDIA BlueField\u00ae-3 DPUs.\nNVIDIA HGX Grace systems for HPC and supercomputing feature the CPU-only design with Grace CPU Superchip and BlueField-3.\nNVIDIA OVX systems for digital twins and collaboration workloads feature the Grace CPU Superchip, BlueField-3 and NVIDIA GPUs.\nNVIDIA CGX systems for cloud graphics and gaming feature the Grace CPU Superchip, BlueField-3 and NVIDIA A16 GPUs.\n\nNVIDIA is extending its NVIDIA-Certified Systems\u2122 program to servers using the NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip and Grace Hopper Superchip, in addition to x86 CPUs. The first certifications of OEM servers are expected soon after partner systems ship.\nSupported Software\r\nThe Grace server portfolio is optimized for NVIDIA\u2019s rich computing software stacks, including NVIDIA HPC, NVIDIA AI, Omniverse\u2122 and NVIDIA RTX\u2122.\nTo learn more about NVIDIA Grace, watch the Computex keynote on Tuesday, May 24, at 11 a.m. Taiwan time.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing, and artificial intelligence.

The news appears to be mostly good, as the company has surpassed its revenue and EPS expectations.\nHere is the statement from the NVIDIA investor relations website:\n\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported record revenue for the first quarter ended May 1, 2022, of $8.29 billion, up 46% from a year ago and up 8% from the previous quarter, with record revenue in Data Center and Gaming.\nGAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.64, down 16% from a year ago and down 46% from the previous quarter, and include an after-tax impact of $0.52 related to the $1.35 billion Arm acquisition termination charge. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.36, up 49% from a year ago and up 3% from the previous quarter.\n\n\nRevenue came in at $8.29 billion, which is more than the initial projected $8.12 billion that was expected. EPS came in at $1.36 per share, which passed the Wall Street consensus estimates of $1.20 per share.\nNVIDIA expects to ramp up several of its divisions in the second half of 2022, including new GPU, CPU, DPU, and robotics processors. The company will aim to push forward on AI, graphics, robotics, and self-driving cars.\n\n\n\nThe company also hailed its revenue from its gaming division, noting that it has overcome many of the challenges created by the ongoing supply chain crisis to record a substantial $3.62 billion revenue, which is up from 31 percent at this time one year ago. NVIDIA has also noted the advancements to GeForce NOW, which now features RTX 3080-class streaming, a larger library, and even the ability to access Fortnite on mobile devices, which now offers one of the only ways to play the battle royale on iOS.\n\nWe'll have more on NVIDIA, as the company prepares to hold its Q1 2023 earnings call. You can watch the call live on the Shacknews Twitch channel and on-demand later today on the Shacknews YouTube channel today at 2:00 p.m. PT/5:00 p.m. ET.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOzzie Mejia\nSenior Editor\n\n\n\nOzzie has been playing video games since picking up his first NES controller at age 5. He has been into games ever since, only briefly stepping away during his college years. But he was pulled back in after spending years in QA circles for both THQ and Activision, mostly spending time helping to push forward the Guitar Hero series at its peak. Ozzie has become a big fan of platformers, puzzle games, shooters, and RPGs, just to name a few genres, but he\u2019s also a huge sucker for anything with a good, compelling narrative behind it. Because what are video games if you can't enjoy a good story with a fresh Cherry Coke? \n\n\nFiled Under\n\nEarnings\nNvidia\nStock Market\nNews\nNVDA\nEarnings Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom The Chatty\n\nRefresh\nGo To Thread\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShacknews\n\n\n\n\n\ueaa3\nreply\nMay 25, 2022 1:32 PM\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOzzie Mejia posted a new article, Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2023 earnings results beat revenue and EPS expectations \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[deleted] 1790515555\n\n\n\n\n\ueaa3\nreply\nMay 25, 2022 1:44 PM\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t[deleted]\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbaconisgod\n\n\n\n\ueaa3\nreply\nMay 25, 2022 1:45 PM\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDown it goes\r https://twitter.com/CNBCOvertime/status/1529559540554993665 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin / Register\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1996 - 2025 Shacknews LTD.\n\n\n\nCompany\nAbout Shacknews\nShackpets\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\n\n\nDo It For Shacknews\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTwitch\nYoutube\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Prudential Singapore and NTUC Income have partnered up to help Singaporeans prepare themselves financially for their later years and long-term care needs. Under the partnership, Income\u2019s Care Secure, a CareShield Life supplement plan, will be made available through Prudential\u2019s network of financial consultants.  This is in addition to Income\u2019s own multi-channel distribution network. CareShield Life is a long-term care insurance scheme introduced by the government in October 2020. The scheme is to help provide basic financial support to help Singaporeans cover their personal and medical care expenses should they become disabled, especially in their old age. Income\u2019s Care Secure offers its policyholders additional coverage and financial support in addition to the coverage already provided by CareShield Life. According to data pulled by Prudential Singapore, Singaporeans have one of the highest life expectancies in the world at 83.9 years. In addition, studies show that one in two healthy Singaporeans aged 65 could become severely disabled in their lifetime and may need long-term care. By 2030, it is estimated that 47% of Singaporeans ageing population will experience one or two limitations to their daily living activities, while 53% will have three or more of such limitations. Under the supplement, policyholders will be able to receive their lifetime monthly disability payout if they are unable to perform two or more activities of daily living (ADLs), compared to the basic CareShield Life plan, which requires customers to be unable to perform at least three ADLs.  Prudential\u2019s chief distribution officer, Ben Tan, says, \u201cWe are pleased that our partnership with Income allows us to protect even more Singaporeans against rising medical costs, and raise awareness about the importance of early planning for long-term care, through our 5,000-strong agency force.\u201d \u201cAs Singaporeans are living longer, the risk of disability associated with their health is real. It is crucial that they also have the necessary financial protection when unexpected events occur and there is a need for long-term care services,\u201d he adds. Fabian Ng, Income\u2019s general manager for consumer business says, \u201cWe are very glad to be working with Prudential, a fellow industry service and advisory provider, who is equally passionate about improving access to insurance and giving customers more solutions to meet their individual needs.\u201d \u201cWorking with like-minded partners amplifies Income\u2019s endeavours to promote better financial planning and preparedness amongst Singaporeans, particularly in the area of long-term care. Together, we look forward to closing protection gaps and empowering more Singaporeans with better financial security well into their later years, even in difficult times,\u201d he adds.

In addition to a look at recent performance, the report also took a look at the company\u2019s future plans. It was here that Nvidia revealed its plans to increase its share buyback program to $15 billion through 2023.\nNvidia\u2019s (NVDA) Q1 2023 earnings report was released on May 25, 2022. In the report, the tech company gives an update on its share repurchase program. \u201cOn May 23, 2022, the board of directors increased and extended the company\u2019s share repurchase program to repurchase additional common stock up to a total of $15 billion through December 2023.\u201d Nvidia had already been buying back its own stock, but will boost those efforts over the next year.\n\n\n\nWith Nvidia looking to gobble back up so much of its own stock, it will be interesting to see how the company\u2019s share value is impacted. Following the release of the earnings report, Nvidia (NVDA) stock saw a sharp drop in after-hours trading, hitting a low of $153.42 before it began to climb back up.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang also provided a statement about Nvidia\u2019s upcoming product offerings in the report.\n\nWe are gearing up for the largest wave of new products in our history with new GPU, CPU, DPU and robotics processors ramping in the second half. Our new chips and systems will greatly advance AI, graphics, Omniverse, self-driving cars and robotics, as well as the many industries these technologies impact.\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s (NVDA) bolstering of its buyback program could spell out good news for the company and shareholders alike. Stick with us as we continue to follow the latest developments with the company.

(PHOTO: Resort World Cruises)  \u00b7 Resort World Cruises By Low De Wei (Bloomberg) \u2014 Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay is launching another cruise line in Singapore, months after his Hong Kong-based cruise empire imploded. Resorts World Cruises Pte Ltd will initially operate with one ship, Genting Dream, which will provide cruises to nowhere setting off from the city-state in June, Michael Goh, the firm\u2019s President and Head of International Sales, said in a press briefing. Goh was also former president of Dream Cruises, which went into liquidation in February amid the collapse of its parent firm Genting Hong Kong Ltd.  Lim, who is executive chairman of the new venture, resigned in January from his positions as the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Genting Hong Kong, after the Covid-19 pandemic crippled his once-sprawling global cruise brand.

While the new cruise line shares the same name as Genting\u2019s Resorts World casino and resort franchise, it will be run as a separate business entity. At the same time, Lim continues to own one of the largest gaming and entertainment conglomerates in the world operating casino resorts in countries including Malaysia, Singapore and the US. \u201cOur cruise ventures for the last 30 years have been very profitable and is a core business,\u201d Colin Au, the new liner\u2019s Chief Executive Officer said at the same briefing. While the world\u2019s largest cruise liners \u2014 including Carnival Corp. and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. \u2014 have been able to raise enough liquidity to get through the worst of the pandemic, a handful of smaller operators sought bankruptcy. Spanish cruise line Pullmantur, partly owned by Royal Caribbean, shut down in 2020, while Jalesh Cruises became the first operator in Asia to collapse the same year.  Singapore\u2019s move to scrap testing requirements for vaccinated travelers has been a major boost for travel in the region, while other neighbouring countries like Malaysia and Indonesia have followed suit. Still, key cruise markets like China still face strict quarantine requirements for travelers. Au said the new cruise line will remain focused on Asia, although adding future ships will depend on whether locations like Hong Kong and Taiwan open up. The firm will seek to roll out routes to Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia from September. Bloomberg News previously reported that Lim had indicated interest in acquiring Genting Hong Kong\u2019s mega-liner Global Dream, which is being sold by liquidators. Au declined to comment.   Story continues Genting Dream, which was previously sold after the liquidation of Dream Cruises, is being leased from four Chinese banks including Bank of Communications Co., China Merchants Bank Co., China Construction Bank Corp. and China Development Bank.\u2014With assistance from K.

(PHOTO: REUTERS/Bobby Yip)  \u00b7 Bobby Yip / Reuters By David Ramli (Bloomberg) \u2014 Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing\u2019s private investment firm Horizons Ventures Ltd. is opening a Singapore office to find new deals and support portfolio companies trying to expand in Asia. As many as ten staff will be based in the South East Asian city including Jacky Li, a senior investment manager who will focus on deal execution, and Jeffrey Ho, a portfolio curator. It comes a year after the firm flagged plans to ramp up deals in the region and will be Horizons\u2019 first office outside of Hong Kong with a focus on supporting portfolio companies entering the market.  The Li-funded firm, which was co-founded by long time confidante Solina Chau, is the latest among a raft of high-profile investment outlets and family offices that have set up presence in Singapore \u2014 attracted by its low taxes, relative safety and an expedited pathway for permanent residency for the super wealthy. A number of investors have either left Hong Kong or expanded operations outside the city amid increasingly strict national security laws and Covid-related travel restrictions. Horizons Ventures said none of these factors played a part. Instead its decision was driven by Singapore\u2019s advantages as a regional hub for investors and expansion. \u201cWe have about 23 investments across the region and operating out of this hub actually becomes pretty important because everyone is here,\u201d said Chris Liu, an Adelaide-based portfolio curator for Horizons. \u201cBuilding a hub out of Singapore and helping our companies create and identify strategic opportunities and partnerships into the South East Asian region makes total sense.\u201d  Liu made the comments on a trip to Singapore with founders from two portfolio companies \u2014 health-care AI platform Harrison.ai and Loam Bio \u2014 both of which met with Singaporean government agencies and state-owned investors with Horizons\u2019 assistance. \u201cConnecting into this region, it makes more sense to be in Singapore than Hong Kong. A lot of our co-investors are in this part of the world rather than in the greater China region,\u201d he said, naming Temasek as an example, adding that Australia was too physically far away from Asia to act as a regional base. Li, whose early wealth was built on infrastructure, telecommunications and real estate, enjoyed a surge in wealth thanks to high-tech bets in companies like Zoom Video Communications Inc. and Spotify Technology S.A. via Horizons Ventures when the pandemic hit. In October Horizons\u2019 will host portfolio company founders, co-investors and guests in Singapore for its bi-annual \u201cTechcracker\u201d event.   Story continues The firm is speaking with universities and professionals to see what investment and hiring opportunities are available, Liu added. \u201cWell over US$100 million\u201d has been deployed across its Australian investments with South East Asia likely to get similar, if not higher, amounts of deals.\u00a9 2022 Bloomberg L.P.

(PHOTO: Wan Ting Koh/Yahoo Finance Singapore)   SINGAPORE \u2014 Just weeks after completing her bar exam last December, Poon Shu Qi signed a lease that would change the course of her career after four years of toiling at law school. With the help of three partners, the 24-year-old decided to set up her own gym, The Kampung Too, which currently offers tailored fitness classes to 50 clients.  Speaking to Yahoo Finance Singapore from her gym\u2019s three-month-old premises in Geylang, Poon said that the stars aligned for her when the 1,600 square feet space became available for lease in December \u2014 the same month she completed her bar examinations to become a corporate lawyer. Her mentor, who owns the sister gym \u2014The Kampung Gym \u2014 nearby, chanced upon the listing and showed it to Poon, who jumped at the opportunity. Less than a week later, Poon had a new gym space. Fearing her parents' reaction, Poon only told them about the career switch a few days after signing the contract. She mustered up the courage one night and penned her thoughts in a blog post, sending the link to her parents, who were in a separate room at that point. They thought she was joking. \u201cWe just talked about whether it\u2019s a wise choice. But I think ultimately they would know that if I want to do something I would still do it. They just told me to be a bit more careful. Eventually they were more supportive just that they were a bit shocked,\" Poon said while seated on a pyro box in the open-space gym. Nevertheless, Poon, armed with S$60,000 to S$80,000 in mostly savings, loans and funding from three partners, spent the next month or so renovating the space, buying and installing gym equipment. By the end of January, The Kampung Too was ready for its soft launch. Law student and part-time fitness coach Asked why she had gone into law in the first place, Poon said, like many others her age, that she was uncertain about a career choice. She received a scholarship from the Singapore Management University and enrolled In Yong Pung How School of Law in 2017. One year into law school, Poon started her own fitness journey by joining a gym with her parents and was immediately hooked. \u201cI just felt like I liked the growth in myself and I kind of wanted to see it for everyone else,\u201d she recalled. In her second year of study, Poon snagged a law training contract and was due to complete a six-month stint upon graduation as part of requirements to become a full-fledged corporate lawyer. But fitness still held a place in her heart that law could not displace. By 2021 \u2014 her final year \u2014 she began coaching in gyms, including international franchise F45, fitting nearly 15 to 20 hours a week of coaching in between studies and internships. Despite her bustling schedule, fitness was \"non-negotiable\", she said.   Story continues \u201cI really tried to make it work because it\u2019s something that I wanted to do. I felt in a sense that (it was) non negotiable and that I must have some pockets of time to train,\u201d she said earnestly.\u201cAll along I wanted to do both but at the same time I knew that it would be a struggle to do both, just because there\u2019s really no time at all. So I was struggling with the fact that I still wanted to do fitness, I wanted to coach, but at the same time I have to do law.\u201dEven then, law as a career was losing its shine. \u201cWhen I look at a lot of lawyers working I felt like I wasn\u2019t sure if that was something that I could do. When people tell me they left the office at 3am, I was a bit scared of that,\u201d she said.  Poon Shu Qi at The Kampung Too. (PHOTO: Wan Ting Koh/Yahoo Finance Singapore)  Forgoing salary for half a yearWhile her peers may be earning a mid to high four-digit salary, Poon has decided to forgo a salary for the initial four to six months in order to help the business grow. Her current revenue is enough to foot the bills and pay a part-timer who coaches at the gym.She hopes to double her client base by the end of the year, and currently offers one-week trials with unlimited classes to potential clients. Otherwise, her classes are pegged at S$200 a month for unlimited sessions alongside other class packages.\u201cIt\u2019s my business so I want to see it grow as well so I\u2019m completely okay with not taking a salary. I still want to see it through in the long run,\u201d she said. While she does not see herself returning to law in the near future, law would still be her backup plan should her current venture wind up.Sharing her experienceSince opening her gym, Poon took to LinkedIn to share her experience and found that her circumstances resonated with many others. At least 40 individuals sought her out for her advice or with their own thoughts.These were mostly those who not want to do law but did not know what else to do; or those who wanted to do law but had a side interest.She would tell the former group to stick to their current study or job while exploring what they are interested in, while her advice for the second group is to have a good backup plan, have their finances in order, and have reliable partners they can trust.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that (there are) so many people facing the same problem, which is also something that I kind of want to tell people; It\u2019s fine to be confused,\" she said.\"A lot of people out there are very confused as to what they want to do and work has been stressful and they don\u2019t know if (it\u2019s something) they should continue in. I would say take some time off and reflect and think about it and recognise you only have one life, so make full use of that life.\u201dStay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingapore  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Chan received a total revenue of S$1,254,907.78 from the 14 premises he let out for short-term accommodation between 30 June 2017 and July 2018. Chan paid Zhao about S$52,000 in total for her assistance \u2014 which works out to a monthly salary of S$4,000.

Chan pleaded guilty to nine charges under the Planning Act, while Zhao pleaded guilty to four charges under the same act. Respectively, each had five and 10 charges taken into consideration for their sentencing.  Chan had been the director or ex-director of HTM Solutions, HTM Management, and SNS Infotech at the time. Zhao had also been involved as director of HTM Solutions and HTM Managements. Using the three companies and Zhao, Chan rented 14 private residences and listed them them on various short-term letting platforms such as Airbnb and HomeAway. The premises that Chan let out were in condominiums or apartments in prime areas of Tanjong Pagar, River Valley, Orchard and Keppel Bay. Two residential units were at International Plaza, three units at Robinson Suites, five units at Claremont condominium, a unit at condominium Residences @ 338A, a unit at condominium The Abode at Devonshire, a unit at Centrepoint Apartments and a unit at Caribbean at Keppel Bay condominium. To lease the properties, Chan and Zhao entered tenancy agreements with the owners of these units through his companies. The couple did not reveal that they were subletting the units for short-term accommodation, or seek permission to do so. Chan lied to the some of the owners by claiming that Zhao and her child, or that Zhao and her husband would reside at the rented units.   Story continues Besides assisting Chan in renting two units, Zhao helped set up and manage the accounts on Airbnb. She also posted listings on the platform. Chan took charge of the day to day operation of the units.Between December 2017 and May 2018, CISCO officers inspected several units sub-letted by Chan and found foreigners and their families staying there.For using the premises to provide short-term accommodation of less than three months, a first time offender may be fined up S$200,000.Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingapore  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

(Photo by Roslan RAHMAN / AFP) (Photo by ROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP via Getty Images)  \u00b7 ROSLAN RAHMAN via Getty Images SINGAPORE \u2014 Changi Airport Group (CAG) announced a mass recruitment drive with over 6,600 available job vacancies amid spiking demand for air travel. The mass hiring, announced through CAG\u2019s publication Changi Journeys on Tuesday (17 May), comes as the aviation industry recovers. Countries have started to loosen border controls put in place since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.  Passenger movements at Changi Airport crossed the one-million mark for the first time in two years in March, with some 1.14 million passenger movements recorded. Passenger traffic in April neared 40 per cent of pre-pandemic levels and is expected to continue to grow to more than half of its pre-pandemic volume this year, CAG said. CAG is also due to resume works for its Terminal 5 project, which has been halted for two years due to the pandemic. The new terminal is expected to be operational around the mid-2030s, Singapore\u2019s Transport Minister S Iswaran said earlier this week. On its recruitment exercise, CAG said, \"A positive vibe and energy is also returning to Changi. Visitors to Changi today will see more travellers checking in for flights. Many can also feel the buzz at the Departure Transit Hall as travellers enjoy the exciting retail and dining options with more shops now open, and many back to pre-COVID operating hours.\" It is offering job vacancies in both professional, manager, executive and technician (PMET) and non-PMET roles, with hiring focused on frontline passenger service positions and newly created roles in innovation and technology.  CAG said that its airport partners are offering market competitive salaries, incentives, and better career prospects. These include ground handlers Sats and Dnata. The quality assurance team is seeking \u201cfood CSI experts\u201d to maintain food safety and standards, while the airport emergency services and the cyber security team are also recruiting. Get hired on the spot Potential candidates may also visit the One Aviation Careers Fair, occurring over 27 and 28 May at the Suntec City Convention Centre. The career fair will have themed career talks from airport partners. There will also be on-site interviews by more than 20 aviation companies so that candidates may apply, get interviewed and get hired on the spot.

(Source: Reuters) \u00b7 Ruben Sprich / reuters Melinda French Gates is most widely recognised as the former wife of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, but her identity and success extend far beyond the tag of 'a billionaire's ex-wife'. As the co-chairperson of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, she is one of the most powerful women in philanthropy.  Her net worth is estimated to be US$10.8 billion according to Bloomberg as of April, 2022. The power couple announced their divorce back in May 2021 after 27 years of marriage and three children \u2013 Jennifer, Phoebe, and Rory. However their philanthropical partnership continuous through the foundation which focuses on helping reduce global inequities. In a recent interview with the Sunday Times, Bill Gates said his marriage to ex-wife Melinda French Gates was \u201cgreat\u201d and he would choose to marry her \u201call over again\u201d. \u201cI wouldn't have changed it. You know, I wouldn't choose to marry someone else,\u201d the Microsoft founder said. When Bill and Melinda first met, she was already working at Microsoft as a product manager. The duo met in 1987 at a Microsoft conference dinner and the rest was history. But Melinda was a distinguished figure long before the business magnate popped the question in 1994. Here's a look at her life before marriage and her endeavours following the divorce. She was a top student in school Born into a Catholic family, French grew up in Dallas, Texas, with her parents - a stay-at-home mother and an aerospace-engineer father - and her three siblings. She developed an interest in computer science while studying at St. Monica Catholic School, where she was the top student in her class. Her father introduced her to the Apple II which further piqued her interest in computer games and programming language. She graduated as valedictorian from Ursuline Academy of Dallas in 1982 and earned a bachelor's degree in computer science and economics from Duke University in 1986. She also holds a Masters in Business from Duke's Fuqua School of Business. She was a marketing manager with Microsoft While still in college, French tutored children in mathematics and computer programming. Soon after graduation, she was recruited by Microsoft shortly after the company went public and its stock began to rise. She served as project manager of Microsoft Bob, Encarta, Cinemania, Publisher, Word and Expedia during her time at Microsoft and held the position of General Manager of Information Products until 1996. Member of several esteemed institutions From 1996 to 2003, French served as a member of Duke University's Board of Trustees.   Story continues She has also been generous to her alma mater and gifted them The French Family Science Center, the University Scholars Program, and the DukeEngage Program.Since 2004, she has attended the annual Bilderberg Group conference and has held a seat on the Board of Directors of Graham Holdings (formerly The Washington Post Company).She was also on the board of directors at Drugstore.com until August 2006.  Melinda Gates plans to give away the bulk of her wealth via her own platform Pivot. (Source: Getty) \u00b7 David Ryder via Getty ImagesA generous philanthropistFrench is known as one of the most prolific philanthropists in the world.As co-chairperson, she led the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation almost on her own for the first six years of operation.She helped shape and approve the foundation\u2019s strategies, reviews results, and sets the organisation\u2019s overall direction.The Foundation was set up to enhance healthcare, reduce extreme global poverty and to expand educational opportunities in the United States.In 2020, it was reported to be the second largest charitable foundation in the world, holding US$49.8 billion in assets.As an advocate of women's and girls' rights, she created Pivotal Ventures in 2015 as a separate independent organisation to identify, help develop and implement innovative solutions to problems affecting US women and families.Following her divorce from Bill Gates in 2021, she announced that she no longer plans to give away the bulk of her wealth via the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, but will continue to do so via her own platform Pivot.She will continue pledging US$1 billion over ten years to fight pivotal issues within America, such as national paid leave, young people\u2019s mental health and gender equality, according to the The Wall Street Journal.A successful authorFrench debuted as an author in 2019 with the book The Moment of Lift: How Empowering Women Changes the World. It was a New York Times bestseller.She said she wrote The Moment of Lift \"to spark conversations about the steps we can all take toward gender equality.\"She has also co-authored Famine, Affluence, and Morality along with Australian philosopher Peter Singer and The Mother and Child Project along\u00a0with\u00a0Australian activist Christine Caine.Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore\u2019s Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingapore  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

(PHOTO: Roslan RAHMAN/AFP)   \u00b7 ROSLAN RAHMAN via Getty Images By Joyce Koh (Bloomberg) \u2014 The number of Singapore citizens holding senior roles in the financial sector has increased more than 80% compared to 2016, amid a push in the city-state to build up local leadership in the expanding industry. More than 3,000 citizens now hold senior positions in the sector, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said in a written response to queries in parliament.  Singapore has been moving to bolster the hiring and grooming of its local workforce, even as ministers stress that the country is open to talent from abroad. The subject of expats, or foreign talent, has sparked fierce debate, with opposition politicians calling for closer scrutiny and the government recently tightening requirements for companies seeking to hire foreigners.

For senior roles \u2014 referring to executives with more than 15 years of related work experience \u2014 about 46% were Singapore citizens, 21% permanent residents and 33% work pass holders, based on MAS\u2019 survey results for 2020. These proportions have remained stable over the years, with a \u201cgradual increase\u201d in the proportion of Singapore citizens holding senior roles, according to the response. The finance sector is a key one for the city-state, thriving during the pandemic even as other parts of the economy suffered. The MAS consults with senior management at financial firms on the makeup of their workforces and their plans to grow the \u201cSingaporean core,\u201d its managing director Ravi Menon said in 2020. The regulator has also been working with firms to develop a strong local leadership pipeline, he said. \u2014With assistance from Michelle Jamrisko. \u00a9 2022 Bloomberg L.P.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Under the MOU, SLA and Redas will jointly promote awareness of geospatial technologies and organise joint events as well as capability development programmes that can address the challenges faced by the real estate and related industries. The MOU signing ceremony was held on June 1 at Geo Connect Asia 2022, the geospatial and location intelligence industry trade show and conference, and was witnessed by Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law, Edwin Tong. The conference will also see the first initiative to be rolled out under the MOU \u2014 a seminar by a panel of experts on engaging geo-based solutions to enhance building design, operations and maintenance. SLA will also explore working with developers to place 3D models of newly launched projects on OneMap to showcase the views at different building vantage points to consumers. Chia Ngiang Hong, president of Redas, says the collaboration will advance the current push by the real estate industry towards the digitalisation of real estate development. \u201cWe also look forward to working with SLA to tap on its extensive networks to upskill our members\u2019 and the industry\u2019s geospatial knowledge and competencies to help improve productivity, resilience and sustainability for real estate and related businesses,\u201d he adds.  Meanwhile, SLA chief executive Colin Low notes that geospatial technology can be a catalyst to spark improvement to business operations and service delivery across various industries, as it supports many cutting-edge technologies. \u201cWe look forward to working with Redas to pool together our collective expertise and unlock the potential of geospatial technology in the real estate sector,\u201d he says. Ng Siau Yong, SLA\u2019s director of geospatial & data division, adds that geospatial technology can add value across the development stages within the real estate sector. As an example, 3D city models can support the design and build of properties at the pre-development stage as well as during the marketing stage to help buyers visualise the development. SLA\u2019s MOU with Redas follows a series of other MOUs the agency has signed within the past year to deepen industry collaborations and improve SLA\u2019s geospatial products including the national map of Singapore, OneMap, and OneMap 3D. These include MOUs with Ninja Van, robotics company Kabam, and property agencies PropNex Realty, ERA Realty Network, OrangeTee & Tie, Huttons Asia and SRI.

(PHOTO: Roslan RAHMAN / AFP)    SINGAPORE \u2014 Singapore\u2019s deputy prime minister Heng Swee Keat warned retail investors to \u201csteer clear\u201d of cryptocurrencies following the recent Terra Luna crash which saw investors losing life savings. That said, the crypto asset space, while highly risky, still had the potential to transform the future of finance, said Heng, who is also Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies, on Tuesday (31 March) at the opening of the Asia Tech x Singapore 2022 Summit.  \u201cWe must continue to adapt our rules to ensure that regulation remains facilitative of innovation, and yet addresses the key risks that crypto assets pose,\u201d added Heng. The DPM\u2019s warnings to retail investors echoes calls from The Monetary Authority of Singapore which has consistently warned the public against trading in cryptocurrencies. In January, the MAS issued guidelines to discourage cryptocurrency trading, including how Digital Payment Token service providers should not promote their crypto services to the general public. This was on the basis that trading in crypto was highly risky and volatile. In April, Singapore passed a law that required virtual asset service providers which only do business overseas to be licensed.

Terra, which ranked among the top 10 most valuable cryptocurrencies, dropped below US$1 on 11 May, after having peaked close to US$120 last month. Some investors later took to the Reddit forum to state how much they have lost, with some losing life savings. The meltdown triggered knock-on effects on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Heng noted. \u201cRetail investors especially should steer clear of cryptocurrencies. We cannot emphasise this enough,\u201d said Heng. Tokenisation However the digital asset ecosystem comprised a range of services beyond cryptocurrency trading and the Singapore government remained \u201ckeen to work with blockchain and digital asset players to encourage innovation, and build up trust in the sector,\u201d he said. MAS granted licenses and in-principle approvals to 11 digital payment token service providers in the past two years. These include stable coin players such as Paxos, Coinhako and financial institution DBS Vickers. \u201cWe will continue to evaluate applications, and facilitate live experiments through regulatory sandboxes, to enable safe adoption in the financial sector,\u201d added Heng.   Story continues As part of the digital asset initiatives, Heng also launched Project Guardian, which he said was a \u201ccollaborative effort by MAS to partner the industry to explore the tokenisation of financial assets and develop the future of finance infrastructure\u201d.The first industry pilot will be to explore potential Decentralised Finance (DeFi) applications in wholesale funding markets.\u201cIn short, we must approach emerging tech with an open mind, separating the hubris from its true underlying potential,\" he said.\u201cThrough regulation, we work constructively to realise the gains of these new technologies, and partner responsible and innovative players with strong risk management capabilities to build the foundations of the digital asset ecosystem,\u201d Heng added.Separately, Heng also introduced two new programmes which leveraged quantum technology to solve \u201creal-world challenges\u201d.The two initiatives under the Quantum Engineering Programme are the National Quantum Computing Hub which will strengthen talent development, and the National Quantum Fabless Foundry, which will support micro and nanofabrication of quantum devices across partner cleanrooms.\"Our investment in quantum computing and quantum engineering is part of our approach of trying to anticipate the future, and proactively shaping the future that we want,\" Heng said.Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingapore  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories      China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Analysts from DBS Group Research and OCBC Investment Research are remaining positive on CapitaLand China Trust (CLCT) for its exposure to new economy assets. The analysts have also kept their \u201cbuy\u201d calls on the REIT after it reported higher gross revenue and net property income (NPI) for the 1QFY2022 ended March.  On April 26, the manager of CLCT posted gross revenue of RMB489.9 million ($103.3 million), up 24% y-o-y for the quarter. CLCT\u2019s NPI increased by 30.4% y-o-y to RMB344.5 million during the same quarter. DBS analysts Geraldine Wong and Derek Tan say they like the REIT for its \u201ccompelling value\u201d. \u201cWe believe markets have not given CLCT the benefit of their new economy exposure, which now comprises close to one-third of their portfolio exposure and has boosted resilience in portfolio earnings in recent quarters. Forward yields are compelling at 7.6%, based on current trading levels,\u201d the analysts write in their April 27 report. They have, however, lowered their target price slightly to $1.55 from $1.60 previously. The revised target price represents a 31% upside to the REIT\u2019s last-traded price of $1.18 as at April 26. The new target price also factors in the rental rebates and flat reversions across CLCT\u2019s retail portfolio for half a month, given the prolonged lockdowns and sporadic retail mall closures, the analysts add.  In their report, Wong and Tan see the REIT facing short-term weaknesses due to China\u2019s zero-Covid-19 tolerance. The weakness could sustain for the rest of the year, and the lockdown could potentially expand to Beijing, where a bulk of CLCT\u2019s retail exposure is. However, all is not lost. \u201cWe believe that CLCT\u2019s retail portfolio was stress tested back in 1HFY2021, coinciding with Beijing\u2019s lockdown, which showed that a retail overhang can dissipate fast with a sharp rebound in occupancy in the matter of a quarter\u2019s time,\u201d the analysts say. \u201cMoreover, the [estimated] 30% expansion in exposure to new economy assets \u2013 that are on [around] 3%-4% rental escalations and registering single digit, positive reversions \u2013 incorporate greater income visibility to offset the downside risk from retail,\u201d they add. Furthermore, the REIT\u2019s exposure to new economy assets, which now makes up 30% of its current portfolio and expanding, should \u201cprovide a shelter in the storm\u201d. \u201cDespite the ongoing macro headwinds, which is as an overhang for China S-REITs, we continue to set our eyes on the horizon, as its asset rejuvenation continues to unfold, expanding its new economy resilience from the current 30% portfolio exposure,\u201d say Wong and Tan.   Story continues \u201cThe dissipation of the current macroeconomic headwinds should help re-rate CLCT\u2019s current P/NAV of 0.76x to trade closer to its historical mean of 0.98x,\u201d they add.In their report, the DBS analysts see inorganic growth opportunities for the REIT. This comes in the form of more third-party assets on the table for acquisition as distressed Chinese developers look to divest to beef up their cash positions.That said, the expansion of lockdown clusters to include Beijing again could pose a key risk, note the analysts.OCBC analyst Chu Peng is also positive on CLCT\u2019s prospects as she sees the manager\u2019s diversification strategy paying off.\u201cOverall, performance of the new economy portfolio remained resilient, benefiting from policy support, growth in local consumption and demand for logistics,\u201d Chu writes in her April 27 report.However, the leasing environment is likely to remain cautious for the time being.As such, she has lowered her fair value estimate on the REIT to $1.40 from $1.50 previously after adjustments and increasing her risk-free rate from 1.9% to 2.5%.Higher-than-expected rental reversions and distribution per unit (DPU) accretive acquisitions are potential catalysts to CLCT\u2019s share price, while a sharp slowdown in retail sales in China as well as a slowdown in macroeconomic conditions are key risks.Units in CLCT closed flat at $1.17 on May 4.See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore Analysts continue to like AEM's prospects following Intel news; UOBKH initiates 'buy' CGS-CIMB maintains 'add' on Singapore banks despite 10% earnings drop  Analysts positive on FEHT as operations and DPU improve Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

And it\u2019s particularly helpful to do so during times of market volatility. While not the be-all or end-all in terms of an investor\u2019s due diligence, analysts do have access to information that retail investors are not privy to. They also have their own reputations, and in many cases their firm\u2019s assets, on the line. So when a number of analysts offer similar ratings or deliver similar price targets, it becomes significant.\nThis article covers seven growth stocks that analysts are bullish about. By bullish, I mean that the stock has a consensus buy rating. In some cases, that may be supported by increases in the price target for a stock. Either way, these are growth stocks that analysts love and are worth considering for your portfolio.\n\n\n\nTicker\nCompany\nCurrent Price\n\n\nNVDA\nNvidia\n$172.64\n\n\nAMD\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n$94.24\n\n\nWBD\nWarner Bros Discovery\n$17.21\n\n\nENPH\nEnphase Energy\n$151.03\n\n\nGNRC\nGenerac Holdings\n$219.84\n\n\nEW\nEdwards Lifesciences\n$95.93\n\n\nFTNT\nFortinet\n$275.57\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is down 48% from its 52-week high. That\u2019s not atypical of growth stocks that are being affected by a number of factors including a flight to risk-off assets. However, trading at around $172 a share at the time of this writing, NVDA stock looks like it may be an attractive buying candidate.\nThe concern about the company\u2019s link to the crypto markets is real, but not the same as it was in 2018. As Louis Navallier explains to InvestorPlace readers, the company has taken steps to isolate the impact of the crypto sector on its business.\nThat means that investors can pay attention to the company\u2019s core businesses which are doing just fine. In its last quarter, the company reported revenue that was 52% higher than the same quarter in 2021 and it was 7% higher from the prior quarter.\nOver 50 analysts give NVDA stock a consensus buy rating with a mean price target of $332.99. Recent price targets come in lower than the consensus, but still suggest a solid buying opportunity.\n\n\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) was among the strongest growth stocks in 2020 and 2021. But since the tech selloff began in November 2021, AMD stock is down 55% in total. And the stock is down nearly 35% in 2022 alone. This is despite the company posting strong earnings in early May.\nThe concern among investors is that the company will not be able to overcome slumping PC sales as well as the hit it\u2019s taking from the major selloff in the crypto markets. But Advanced Micro Devices is one of the leading chip providers in the gaming sector, which remains incredibly popular with the two market segments that will drive consumer demand in the next decade.\nFor its part, the company gave analysts a bullish outlook, including a revenue increase of over 60% over 2021. AMD has a consensus buy rating with a price target of $140.34.\n\nWarner Bros Discovery (WBD)\nWarner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) is the newly formed entity created as AT&T (NYSE:T) spun off its Time Warner assets. And many investors who received shares of WBD stock have said thanks but no thanks. That\u2019s one reason that the stock is down to levels not seen since the pandemic began.\nBased on the rising subscriber numbers the company posted in the last quarter, WBD stock may look oversold. But the market is always forward looking and the company\u2019s debt load is a concern. Investors may also suspect that the company will not be able to continue its current pace of growth. That could be true, streaming is an incredibly competitive sector. However, many customers who cancel a streaming service eventually come back.\nHowever, analysts are also forward looking and 27 analysts give WBD stock a buy rating with a price target of $35.70. And while it it\u2019s unlikely that the company will see a near-100% gain, it will remain a bargain, even if that forecast comes down by 30%.\n\nEnphase Energy (ENPH)\nWhen investors are looking for growth stocks in this market, the energy sector is a good place to search. Last year, I said Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) was the solar stock I would buy if I could only buy one. I feel the same way today.\nThe company offers products and services that allow traditional solar systems to offer consumers true energy independence. \u00a0The company\u2019s microinverters convert direct current (DC) power to alternating current (AC) power. And the company offers a complete energy system that includes software solutions that allow consumers to \u201cbank\u201d the energy from solar panels to ensure they have adequate power when needed.\nEnphase is benefiting from Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, which is sparking demand for solar solutions in Europe. And as supply chain issues continue to unwind, the company should resume growth in the United States. Notably, 36 analysts currently give ENPH stock a consensus price target of $230.81.\n\nGenerac Holdings (GNRC)\nIt seems appropriate that a company that specializes in products that help its customers deal with emergencies also has a stock that can help investors ride out the current storm in the market. That\u2019s the case with Generac Holdings (NYSE:GNRC). The company, which is known for its whole house generators, reports a backlog that is valued at over $1 billion.\nWhen you consider that the company\u2019s total revenue in its prior quarter was just over $1 billion, you can see why it made it my list of undervalued stocks. And the company also offers its PWRcell battery storage system that \u201charnesses power from the sun\u201d to help its customers get backup power during a power outage. 27 analysts give GNRC stock a consensus price target of $428.52, which is almost 90% above its current price.\nThe current market volatility may act as a headwind for the stock, but in the long term, Generac looks like a strong buy-the-dip opportunity.\n\nEdwards Lifesciences (EW)\nCompanies that manufacture medical devices saw their stocks devastated in 2020 as demand dried up. Such was the case with Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW). The company develops patient-focused innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring. And as Josh Enomoto pointed out, there may be growing demand for these products since patients with Covid-19 are proving to be \u201cat increased risk of a broad range of cardiovascular disorders.\u201d\nEW stock seems to be drawing interest from institutional investors. In the last 12 months, buyers have outnumbered sellers and the amount of money spent on the stock was about twice that of what was sold. 34 analysts have set a mean price target of $132.45 for EW stock which is more than 35% above its current price.\n\nFortinet (FTNT)\nFor most of the first four months of this year, Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) was managing to avoid the fate that many tech stocks were suffering. But even a quality cybersecurity stock like Fortinet couldn\u2019t avoid the most recent selloff.\nHowever, the stock is \u201conly\u201d down about 25% from its 52-week high and sitting right in the middle of its 52-week range. That shows how resilient the demand for cybersecurity products and services is likely to be. And Fortinet is one of the leading names in this space. As Tezcan Gecgil wrote recently, the company \u201cprovides a broad array of next-generation security and networking functions. Around 500,000 customers rely on its market leader firewall platform\u00a0Fortigate.\u201d\n38 analysts give FTNT stock a mean price target of $373.25 which is more than 30% above its current price.\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Dual-listed construction and engineering services provider Civmec Limited\u00a0has recently secured circa A$120 million ($116.82 million) of new contracts across multiple operating sectors.  These include a car dumper replacement, a subsea project and maintenance contracts, announced the company on May 25. Civmec is listed on both the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). BHP has awarded a contract to Civmec for the replacement of BHP\u2019s Car Dumper 3 (CD3) at BHP\u2019s Nelson Point facility in Port Hedland, which was commissioned in 1998. The new CD3 has a design life of 30 years and is intended to fit in the existing concrete vault with minimal structural modifications. Procurement activities for this project have commenced, with fabrication commencing in 1QFY2023 and completion in 4QFY2023. At peak, this contract will employ approximately 85 people, says Civmec. In addition, Subsea 7 has awarded the contract for subsea structures on the Woodside-operated Scarborough Project performed by Subsea Integration Alliance, a non-incorporated strategic global alliance between Subsea 7 and OneSubsea, the subsea technologies, production, and processing systems division of Schlumberger.  Totalling over 1,700 tonnes of subsea structures, the project deliverables, welding procedure qualification campaign and shop detailing will commence immediately with fabrication commencing in 4Q2022 through to FAT (Factory Acceptance Testing) being carried out from 2Q2023 with progressive loadout to 3Q2024, this project will employ 80 people at peak. Next, Roy Hill have awarded the SMP&E (Structural Mechanical Piping and Electrical) Works for the ROM4 Crusher 5 project at Roy Hill\u2019s Mine Facility to Civmec.

This follows the current SMP&E contract for the Wet High Intensity Magnetite Separator (WHIMS) project, which is nearing completion and will see the same project management team transitioning to the ROM4 project, says Civmec. Mobilisation will commence in 4QFY2022 with completion in 2QFY2023 with peak manning planned to be approximately 130. Finally, Roy Hill have also extended Civmec's\u00a0Roy Hill - Shutdown and Maintenance Support Services Agreement by an additional five years through to March 2027.  \"As one of Civmec\u2019s long term customers, Roy Hill is an important stakeholder for our maintenance business. Our investment in the local community and our commitment to building our Port Hedland Workshop facility is evidence of our pledge to being a long-term partner to Roy Hill and our intent is to further strengthen this relationship,\" reads a press release.

With that in mind, let\u2019s look at a few top stock trades for Thursday, as the S&P 500 tries to snap a seven-week losing session.\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Nvidia (NVDA)\nClick to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\nWith one glance at the chart, investors can tell Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is trying to bottom in the $155 to $160 area. With earnings set to be released after the close tonight, it will either make or break this support zone.\nIf we get a bullish post-earnings pop, I\u2019ll be watching the 21-day moving average and $185 area. Most recently, the latter was resistance earlier this month after acting as support. Above that opens the door to the $195 to $200 area, then $210.\nOn the downside, I really don\u2019t want to see Nvidia lose the $150 mark. That thrusts it below a lot of key areas and measures. If it does so \u2014 and closes below it \u2014 we\u2019ll need to re-evaluate this stock. \t\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods (DKS)\nClick to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\nDick\u2019s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) is all over the place on Wednesday. First, it gapped down and plunged lower on earnings, then spike higher. At one point, shares were down more than 10%, then up more than 14%.\nNow we\u2019re in a pickle.\nDick\u2019s stock bounced hard off the 200-week moving average, but it\u2019s now running right into active resistance via the 10-week moving average. Talk to any technical trader and they\u2019ll put more weight into the 200-week than the 10-day. However, it\u2019s hard not to point them both out.\nIf Dick\u2019s can clear the 10-day and today\u2019s high, the gap-fill level is in play at $87.31, along with the key $92 area and the declining 21-day moving average. On the downside, if it trades below $69.50, the low could be back in play. \t\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: GameStop (GME)\nClick to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) had some fire on Wednesday, ripping over last week\u2019s high and climbing almost 30% in the session.\nNow it faces two keys measures via the 10-week and 21-week moving averages. If we can clear that zone near $120, it technically opens the door up to the $150 to $160 area.\nOn the downside \u2014 and we\u2019d need a big drop to do it \u2014 a move below this week\u2019s low opens the door back down to $78, then the 200-week moving average. \t\n\nTop Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Toll Brothers (TOL)\nClick to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\nToll Brothers (NYSE:TOL) is up almost 8% after reporting earnings. In doing so, it\u2019s pushing through the 50-day moving average and downtrend resistance.\nIf it can continue higher, $50 to $52 is in play. There we find the 23.6% retracement, the May high and the declining 21-week moving average.\nOn the downside, $44 is must-hold support. Not only is it where Toll Brothers has been finding support lately, but it\u2019s also where we have the 200-week moving average and the 50% retracement from the 2021 high down to the March 2020 Covid-19 low.\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in NVDA.

Superapp Grab has reported a loss of US$435 million ($601 million) in 1QFY2022 ended March, 35% lower than the loss recorded in the previous corresponding quarter at US$666 million ($902 million). This was attributed to the elimination of non-cash interest expense of Grab\u2019s convertible redeemable preference shares that converted to ordinary shares in December 2021. This will no longer be incurred going forward, the company said in its results statement.  Revenue in 1QFY2022 stood at US$228 million, a 6% growth y-o-y and 87% growth q-o-q as total incentives in the deliveries segment moderated. This is also the first quarter that included Jaya Grocer financial results since Grab completed its acquisition of the Malaysian supermarket chain at the end of January this year. Grab\u2019s gross merchandise value (GMV) grew by 32% y-o-y, driven by mobility segment acceleration, strong core food and groceries growth as the company expanded its merchant selection and contributions from Jaya Grocer. Adjusted EBITDA improved by approximately US$17 million compared to the preceding quarter as total incentives in its deliveries segment came down. As a percentage of GMV, adjusted EBITDA margins declined to -6% in the quarter compared to -3.1% in the same period a year ago, but improved from -6.8% achieved in the previous quarter. As at March 31, Grab has cash liquidity of US$8.2 billion, a decrease from US$9 billion as at December 31, 2021. This is primarily due to net cash outflow from operating activities and Jaya Grocer\u2019s acquisition.  Grab\u2019s CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan said its first quarter results are a testament to the resilience of Southeast Asia\u2019s economy, moving past the worst of the pandemic restrictions. \u201cWe are optimistic that our business will continue to strengthen as more countries pivot to living with Covid-19,\u201d he added. Looking ahead, the company is focused on growing sustainably by being disciplined with its capital, optimising its fixed cost base and tapering its incentive spend as the market rationalises, said Grab chief financial office Peter Oey. \u201cWe believe these actions will put us on a path to achieving segment adjusted EBITDA breakeven for deliveries by the end of 2023.\u201d Shares in Grab closed 20 US cents lower or 7.33% down on May 18 at US$2.53. \u00a0 \u00a0 See Also: Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore ComfortDelGro has more room to move thanks to the reopening It\u2019s a smooth ride ahead in FY2022 for Genting Singapore U.S. Stocks Extend Losses in Late Session Selloff: Markets Wrap Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

But gaming is still the company's largest segment. Last year, gaming revenue totaled $12.4 billion, growing 61% year over year.\u00a0\nGrowth in gaming revenue is generated from a balance of higher unit sales and average selling prices, as gamers tend to upgrade to more expensive GPUs. The chip shortage during the pandemic caused an imbalance of supply and demand that pushed selling prices through the roof. Prices of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 30 series and Advanced Micro Devices'\u00a0Radeon RX 6000 series had been trending up through 2021, but since the start of 2022, GPU prices have started to decline.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNow what\nRolland is not the first analyst to issue a warning over Nvidia's gaming segment. A few weeks ago, research analysts at Morgan Stanley\u00a0also cautioned investors about a possible deceleration of growth in gaming.\u00a0\nIt's worth noting that both Susquehanna and Morgan Stanley are bullish on Nvidia's long-term prospects. Plus, Nvidia shares have already fallen 50% from their all-time high of $346 in 2021.\u00a0It seems investors were already expecting a slowdown in growth this year.\n\nAt a current share price of $177, the stock trades at a more attractive forward price-to-earnings ratio of 31.5.\u00a0That looks like a cheap valuation for a company that analysts expect to grow earnings at a compound annual rate of 30% over the next five years.\u00a0\n\n\n\nJohn Ballard has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Still, the company saw shares fall by about 10% on Wednesday, partly due to investors announcing weaker revenues expected for the current quarter.Like many technology and software companies, Nvidia saw exponential revenue growth during the pandemic as demand for electronics and gaming rose \u2014 with the release of its RX 30 Series being its \"best gaming product cycle ever.\" However, as demand has plateaued, gaming was surpassed by its data center revenue for the first time with an 83% year-over-year increase.And yet, the software giant still saw a drop in overall revenue, falling to $8.1 billion for Q2.\n\n\n\nWhat is Nvidia?Nvidia Corporation is an American multinational technology company. It is a global leader in artificial intelligence software and has an increasing presence in the gaming industry. In 2020, it acquired British software design company Arm for $40 billion in stock and cash, before dropping the acquisition in early 2022 due to regulatory hurdles.

Even though the Radeon carries an MSRP of $380, while the RTX 3060 is meant to cost $330, in reality they're competing products, both selling for about $400 at major online retailers.\nThat's quite a drop for the RTX 3060 which was closer to $500 a few weeks ago, while the 6600 XT was around $440. Meanwhile, supply for the 6600 XT appears to be drying up and that's probably due to the imminent release of the 6650 XT.\n\nFor testing we've used our Ryzen 9 5950X test system with 32GB of DDR4-3200 CL14 dual-rank, dual-channel memory. Both GPUs were tested using the default AMD and Nvidia clock specifications at 1080p and 1440p across 50 games with Resizable Bar enabled. The driver versions used were Radeon Adrenalin 22.4.2 and GeForce Game Ready Driver 512.59, as these were the latest available drivers when we started testing a week ago.\n\nWe won't go over the data for all 50 games individually as that would take all day, instead we're going to take a close look at the results for about a dozen of them and then we'll take a look at how these two GPUs compare head-to-head across all games tested in a single graph.\nBenchmarks\nStarting with Dying Light 2, this recently released game uses a proprietary 3D game engine developed by Techland known as Chrome Engine 6, and it's the only game in our test suite to use it.\nDying Light 2 plays well with Radeon GPUs and here the 6600 XT is 11% faster at 1080p and 8% faster at 1440p. Perhaps more impressive is that both GPUs rendered well over 60 fps at 1080p using the highest quality settings, with the exception of ray tracing, which isn't enabled by default.\n\n\nWarhammer III is another new game and this one uses the Warscape Engine 3 which is used exclusively by the Total War series. Here the GeForce GPUs currently enjoy a small performance advantage.\nIn this matchup, the RTX 3060 was 9% faster at 1080p and 14% faster at 1440p which is a significant margin, though the 1% lows are basically identical.\n\nNext we have Call of Duty Warzone, where the 6600 XT was quite a bit faster than the RTX 3060, delivering 21% more frames at 1080p and 16% more at 1440p. A strong win for the Radeon GPU, though keep in mind it was also meant to cost 15% more based on the original MSRP.\n\nForza Horizon 5 is a well optimized title that plays well on both hardware platforms. We are using the extreme preset, so this is as demanding as the game gets, yet we're still looking at 61 fps on average from both GPUs at 1440p. Performance was very similar with no clear winner.\n\nGod of War is another well optimized title and while it does play well on the 6600 XT, it plays much better with the RTX 3060, especially at 1440p. We did double check these results, and it would seem the RTX 3060 is 15% faster at 1080p and a whopping 33% faster at 1440p. A massive win for Nvidia in this game.\n\nFar Cry 6 uses the Dunia 2 engine and this one runs very well on AMD hardware, largely helped by the fact that AMD had a hand in sponsoring the game's development. As a result, the 6600 XT enjoys a strong 13% performance advantage at 1080p and was able to maintain a double digit win at 1440p where it was 10% faster.\n\nTypically, Radeon GPUs perform well in the F1 series, but F1 2021 enables ray tracing by default at the highest presets and therefore we tested with the feature enabled. This hands the RTX 3060 a performance advantage, affording it a 6% performance advantage at 1080p and 10% at 1440p. Disabling ray tracing does favor the 6600 XT, but we feel we might as well test using the default configuration as that's how we normally test, and we're still looking at around 60 fps at 1440p.\n\nNext we have Metro Exodus Enhanced and this version of the game requires ray traced accelerated hardware, so ray tracing effects are enabled by default and for testing these mid-range GPUs we've gone with the 'normal' setting.\nAlthough the 6600 XT was able to deliver highly playable performance at 1080p, the RTX 3060 was 29% faster and that meant we were seeing similar frame rates at 1440p from the GeForce GPU compared to what the 6600 XT could do at 1080p.\n\nThe Rainbow Six Extraction performance was comparable with both GPUs delivering over 130 fps at 1080p. The RTX 3060 did edge ahead by a 7% margin at 1440p, but overall performance was very similar.\n\nPerformance was also similar when testing with Apex Legends. In short, the 6600 XT was slightly faster at 1080p and then slightly slower at 1440p. Both GPUs proved plenty powerful for this title though, delivering over 100 fps at 1440p using the highest in-game quality settings.\n\nAnother competitive title that delivered competitive results is Fortnite. Although most Fortnite players won't run the Epic preset, we're interested in testing GPU performance and not CPU performance, which is where things quickly head with competitive settings.\nAssuming you don't run into CPU bound conditions, Radeon and GeForce GPUs scale very similarly with the quality presets, so using competitive settings both the 6600 XT and RTX 3060 will deliver a similar level of performance.\n\nThe last set of results we're going to look at are for Cyberpunk 2077 and here the 6600 XT was 9% faster using the high quality settings at 1080p. Both GPUs are best suited to 1080p gaming in this title as the slightly dialed down quality settings saw just 44 fps rendered on average at 1440p.\nPerformance Summary\nBased on the games we just looked at, the RTX 3060 and 6600 XT appear to be extremely close in terms of performance. There were a few titles that heavily favor one over the other, but for the most part performance was close.\nWe did spend a week testing through 50 games though, so let's check that out...\nStarting with the 1080p data, we see that the 6600 XT was 3% faster on average, meaning they're basically identical overall across a wide range of games as we deem anything within 5% a draw. That means for 20 of the 50 games tested performance was near enough to \"identical\" with margins 4% or less.\n\nThere were just a handful of outliers where the margins extended to 10% or more in either direction. The big losses for AMD were seen in Resident Evil Village and Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition, unsurprisingly two of the games that used ray tracing. Vermintide 2, God of War, and PUBG were also bad titles for AMD.\nTitles where the 6600 XT performed exceptionally well included Assassin's Creed Valhalla, World War Z, Borderlands 3, Warzone, Call of Duty Vanguard and Death Stranding.\n\nIncreasing the resolution to 1440p flipped the results in Nvidia's favor as now the 6600 XT was 2% slower overall, but again that margin is insignificant. This time there were 23 games where the margin was 5% or less, with just three outliers with a few games in either direction exceeding 20%.\nPicking a Winner: Go RTX\nDepending on the resolution and the game played, one GPU might be faster than the other. There were instances where the margins grew to almost 30%, which is very significant, so you may want to pay attention to how these Radeon and GeForce GPUs stack up in the games you care about the most.\nWhen looking at our 50 game sample \u2013 and that's a substantial number of games to test \u2013 it's fair to conclude that in most instances there will be less than a 10% difference between these two GPUs.\nHaving said that, once you take the full picture into account, it's hard not to argue that the GeForce RTX 3060 is the better buy and is even worth a premium. This is because when you start to look at what each product offers beyond rasterization performance, there's not much to talk about when it comes to the 6600 XT.\n\nThe RTX 3060 packs a 50% larger frame buffer with 12 GB opposed to 8 GB, so it should handle future HD texture packs a lot better, meaning future AAA titles could potentially look better without hurting frame rate performance. In our opinion, that's a nice bonus that shouldn't be overlooked.\nThe RTX 3060 also packs a full x16 PCIe 4.0 connection whereas the 6600 XT is cut down to just 8 lanes, and this can cause serious performance issues when exceeding the memory buffer. That's another reason why the memory subsystem of the RTX 3060 is vastly superior.\n\nOn top of that, you get DLSS which is widely supported by many new AAA titles and it works really well at 1440p and beyond, and that's resolutions where the RTX 3060 could do with a performance boost.\nAMD offers some upscaling techniques for 6600 XT owners and more plans are in the works to head off the DLSS threat, but for now DLSS is the best option. Then there's ray tracing, which is yet another strength of the RTX 3060. As we saw in the titles that use this rendering technique, the GeForce GPU had a clear performance advantage thanks to its more mature implementation.\n\nIn a nutshell: the RTX 3060 offers similar rasterization performance, superior ray tracing, DLSS support, a bigger VRAM buffer, and a full PCIe 4.0 x16 connection, making it a better product \u2013 and if available at the same price, the obvious option.\nWhether or not AMD can tempt us with the Radeon RX 6650 XT has yet to be seen, but we're keen to look into that very soon.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6600 XT on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6700 XT on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 9 5950X on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 21\n\n\n Got something to say?

Rhea is an Arm-based chip with RISC-V controllers, planned to appear in next-generation exascale computers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe partnership will expand heterogeneous computing options for supercomputing, according to SiPearl, and is intended to support and accelerate adoption of exascale systems in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears that the contributions from HPE will include high-performance networking with the Slingshot interconnect, plus a software compiler and programming stack that will be based on the HPE Cray Programming Environment.\nSlingshot, which HPE inherited from Cray, is a high-performance network standard that is also compatible with Ethernet and features in many current supercomputers, including the Frontier system that has now claimed first place in the Top500 rankings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HPE Cray Programming Environment is a suite of development software comprising compilers, programming languages, scientific, mathematics, and I/O libraries, plus profiling and performance optimization tools.\nThe partnership is expected to deliver joint HPE and SiPearl solutions to HPE's Center of Excellence (CoE) in Grenoble, which has recently deployed a new AI supercomputer called Champollion.\n\"In addition to our recent investments in a new HPC factory in Czech Republic and an AI cluster, dedicated to research, in Grenoble, France, our partnership with SiPearl is another demonstration of HPE's ongoing commitment to support Europe's mission to deliver world-class supercomputing that extends its sovereignty and competitiveness on the global stage,\" HPE executive vice president for HPC & AI Justin Hotard said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Nvidia, SiPearl said it has entered into a \"strategic collaboration agreement\" for joint technical and business development that will combine their respective hardware and software solutions.\nThe two said they intend to develop a proxy platform for porting activities that will combine SiPearl's processors and Nvidia's GPUs. The work will also include joint efforts with other European research institutions on elements including simulation capabilities in open-source and research-oriented modeling tools.\nEssentially, the partnership is about SiPearl and Nvidia agreeing to ensure that Nvidia's accelerated computing and networking portfolio will operate seamlessly with SiPearl's Rhea processor and future CPUs, as well as working to expand the Arm HPC ecosystem itself.\n\nIntel to spend \u20ac17bn on chip mega-factory in Germany\nEU directs \u20ac11bn toward European Chips Act to build homegrown semiconductor industry\nJoined up thinking: Europe to oversee trio of projects for homegrown chips, HPC gear\nEC president promises European Chips Act to quadruple homegrown production by 2030\n\nNvidia doesn't just do GPUs, of course, as it acquired network specialist Mellanox for its InfiniBand and Ethernet tech in 2020.\nToday's agreement between the companies was given the thumbs-up by some in the European HPC sector.\n\"It holds great potential for the European supercomputing space, the Arm ecosystem and accelerated computing,\" said Dr Thomas Lippert, head of the J\u00fclich Supercomputing Centre in Germany.\nLast year, SiPearl also announced a collaboration with Intel over the latter's Ponte Vecchio GPU technology, making Arm-based supercomputers with Intel GPUs possible. As part of that agreement, SiPearl said it would port and optimize Intel's oneAPI heterogeneous compute toolkit for the Rhea processor.\nThat announcement also implied that Ponte Vecchio would feature in the first European exascale supercomputer.\nSiPearl itself was born out of the European Processor Initiative (EPI), aimed at developing a new generation of high-end European microprocessors.\nThe Rhea processor is set to be the first fruit of this, and is due to launch sometime before the end of this year. It is expected to comprise 72 of the Neoverse V1 (codenamed Zeus) 64-bit Arm cores, plus support for DDR5 or the high-performance HBM2E stacked memory technology. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Advanced HPC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                HPC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                HPE\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Advanced HPC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                HPC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                HPE\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Supercomputer\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Exascale\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Hadoop\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                Computer\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n                    COMMENTS\n            \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Advanced HPC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                HPC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                HPE\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Advanced HPC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                HPC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                HPE\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Supercomputer\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Exascale\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Hadoop\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                Computer\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nESA cuts the ribbon on 34,000-core Space HPC center tailored for space workloads\nPUE of 1.09 and heats the building it lives in\n\nHPC13 Mar 2025 | 8\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNvidia won the AI training race, but inference is still anyone's game\n\nComment\u00a0When it's all abstracted by an API endpoint, do you even care what's behind the curtain?\n\nSystems12 Mar 2025 | 5\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDo you DARE?

The system can be equipped with up to 4TB of DDR4-3200 memory using 16 modules, four M.2 solid-state drives, six U.2 SSDs, and ten low-profile PCIe expansion cards. The whole machine is powered by three 3000W 80+ Platinum power supplies (+ one additional PSU for redundancy).Gigabyte's 4U machine fully leverages Nvidia's HGX platform, so it fully leverages not only NVLink with NVSwitches for GPUs, but also\u00a0the green company's GPUDirect RDMA for direct data exchange between GPUs and third-party devices like SSDs and network cards.(Image credit: Gigabyte)Previously, Gigabyte offered Nvidia A100 GPU-based servers with up to two 64-core AMD EPYC 7003 or 40-core Intel Xeon Scalable 'Ice Lake' processors. Those machines tend to be expensive given that both AMD and Intel charge a lot for their flagship offerings for servers that are in high demand. With a system based on Ampere's Altra/Altra Max, Gigabyte can offer somewhat lower pricing. Meanwhile, Gigabyte's\u00a0G492-PD0 server has fewer PCIe lanes and potentially lower performance in some workloads, but organizations that buy GPU servers tend to do research before buying new machines to ensure they meet their needs.(Image credit: Gigabyte)There is another reason why Gigabyte needs this server: Gigabyte and users of its AI and HPC servers need is to gain experience with Arm-based CPUs in context of GPU-powered HPC applications before Nvidia launches its platforms powered by its Grace CPU and H100 compute GPU next year. Usage of Ampere Altra and Altra Max CPUs with up to 128 cores makes a lot of sense for Gigabyte as the machines are Arm-based and have a lot of cores.\u00a0\u00a0(Image credit: Gigabyte)It is noteworthy that Ampere's Altra/Altra Max-based platforms in general and Gigabyte's G492-PD0 machine in particular have been\u00a0certified by Arm for its SystemReady program for easy deployment of Arm-based servers. The Arm SystemReady program offers an official set of platform definitions that cover machines that range from IoT and edge servers all the way to cloud machines.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\narm\nAltera\nXeon\nCloud Computing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (1)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

The SEC enforces several laws, including rules on communications between shareholders and organizations. Organizations must communicate honestly and transparently about sources of revenue. This allows shareholders to fairly consider whether to invest in an organization. Nvidia failed to comply. \nIn its 2018 quarterly results, Nvidia presented revenue from cryptominers in the \u2018gaming\u2019 category. A deliberate choice, as revenue from cryptominers is relatively unreliable. By misappropriating its revenue, Nvidia hoped to increase the trust of shareholders. An illegal offence, concluded the SEC in a recent investigation. The market authority imposed a fine of 5.5 million dollars (approximately 5.2 million euros). Nvidia announced that it will be complying and paying the fine. Although the organisation refuses to acknowledge the accusations, actions speak louder than words.\nNvidia and cryptominers\nGPUs are excellent for repetitive tasks. That\u2019s why Nvidia\u2019s models are regularly bought by cryptominers. They receive a reward for performing calculations for blockchains. The more computing power, the bigger the spoils. \nResultingly, Nvidia earns revenue from cryptomining. Nevertheless, the organization is trying to distance itself from the market. First of all, Nvidia doesn\u2019t always have enough chips and production capacity to serve every customer. Every GPU bought by a cryptominer is one less GPU for business customers and other consumers. Second, some investors aren\u2019t interested in organisations with unpredictable revenue streams. Whenever Nvidia is branded as a service provider for cryptominers, it risks shareholders dropping out.\nThe dilemma has multiple solutions. Among other things, Nvidia tries to deter cryptominers with product modifications. The optimal GPUs for mining Ethereum (cryptocurrency) have a high Lite Hash Rate. Nvidia limits the Lite Hash Rate of some models to discourage cryptominers.\nThe measures are successful, but not always at the desired time. At the end of 2017, cryptominer sales increased significantly. Nvidia preferred not to tell investors, because as mentioned earlier, some shareholders have little faith in the sustainability of cryptomining. Hence, the organisation decided to categorize the revenue as \u2018gaming\u2019, and will be fined accordingly. \n\n\n\nTags:\nNvidia / SEC / US Securities and Exchange Commission \n\n\n\n\n\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n\nStay tuned, subscribe!\nE-mailadres*\n\nNieuwsbrieven*\n\nMorning Bytes\n\n\nWeekly Advisor\nEmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nRelated                                \n\n\n\nAI increases Nvidia revenue by 80%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS restricts exports of Nvidia chips\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcerns over new Nvidia chip do not stop revenue growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia books record revenue again and promises Blackwell is coming this year\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor picks    \n\n\n\nOpenAI introduces Responses API for building AI agents\n\n\nOpenAI has launched a new set of APIs and tools, making it easier for...\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are Google\u2019s plans for cloud security provider Wiz?\n\nCatching up in the cloud computing market\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is Lip-Bu Tan, the new Intel CEO?\n\nChange is afoot at Chipzilla\n\n\n\n\n\nA storm has formed around CoreWeave\n\nOpenAI steps in, Microsoft pulls back\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight: Agentic AI\n\n\n\n\nWorkday tracks AI agent \u2018digital labour\u2019 in core systems of record\u00a0\n\n\nAI agents are starting to get to work.

The move, it says, is the first step in a broader open source by the company aimed at \u201cimproving the experience of using NVIDIA GPUs in Linux\u201d.\nAnd about time too, right?\nCanonical, backers of Ubuntu, plan to \u2018package the open kernel modules\u2019 for use in the recent Ubuntu 22.04 LTS release in short order with other Linux distro vendors set to follow suit.\n\u201cThe new NVIDIA open-source GPU kernel modules will simplify installs and increase security for Ubuntu users, whether they\u2019re AI/ML developers, gamers, or cloud users,\u201d Cindy Goldberg, VP of Silicon alliances at Canonical is quoted as saying. \n\u201cAs the makers of Ubuntu, the most popular Linux-based operating system for developers, we can now provide even better support to developers working at the cutting edge of AI and ML by enabling even closer integration with NVIDIA GPUs on Ubuntu.\u201d\nDon\u2019t expect to see these modules upstreamed just yet, mind. NVIDIA says the \u2018current codebase does not conform to the Linux kernel design conventions\u2019 at present but that says it plans to work with the Linux kernel community to improve the situation. \nNVIDIA open GPU kernel modules are hosted on GitHub, should you want to download \u2019em, inspect \u2019em, or start contributing to \u2019em. Those with pre-Turing NVidia GPUs will have ti stick with the existing binary kernel driver for now, and given the \u201calpha\u201d status of the open source driver, those who do have compatible cards may want to hold off using the open source driver until it\u2019s a little more robust.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Open Source Embrace\nNow, I\u2019ll admit that the state of Linux graphics drivers (and Linux gaming in general) is not my area of expertise. I don\u2019t own any devices which feature NVIDIA graphics. Thus, I\u2019m (more than a little) ignorant to the on-going struggles (or otherwise) for folks out there using it with Linux.\nNVIDIA famously got the middle-finger from Linux creator Linus Torvalds\nThat said, even a dork like me can tell that this news is important not only for AAA gamers, ML developers, and AI scientists but for regular home users like you and I. \nPeople have been willing NVIDIA to change tack and become part of the wider open source community for as long as I\u2019ve been using Linux. NVIDIA trails its rivals (mainly AMD and Intel, though bonus points if you remember VIA) in support for emerging open source technologies (like Wayland).\nNVIDIA famously got given the middle-finger by Linux creator Linus Torvalds.\nAnd although the proprietary NVIDIA graphics drivers are readily available (and are said to work well) effort towards a more open, accessible future that benefits all users is surely to be applauded.  \nNVIDIA make powerful, cutting-edge technology that helps amazing people do equally amazing things \u2014 and by embracing open source properly it\u2019s surely set to unlock that potential further.\n\n\n\n\nSource: \nNVIDIA Developer Blog \n\n                (via: \nGaming on Linux)\n              \n\n\n\n\n                                    GPU                                \n\n                                    graphics drivers                                \n\n                                    NVIDIA                                \n\n                                    open source                                \n\n\nShare this postPostRepostSendShare  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPopular This Week \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDesign\nUbuntu 25.04 Yaru Theme Update Brings New Icons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDesign\nUbuntu 25.04 Default Wallpaper & Mascot Unveiled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDistros\nBodhi Linux Shows Off New Theme, Revived Modules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nGIMP 3.0 Finally Released with a HUGE Set of Changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHuawei\u2019s New Laptops May Run Linux, not HarmonyOS Next\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLike This Blog?\n\n\n\n\nBy buying me a $2 coffee, you\u2019re directly funding continued independent coverage of the Linux ecosystem\u2014content for you, and for everyone!\n\n        Buy Me a Coffee    \n\n\n\n\nLatest Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerpf\n            Until now Vivaldi as a browser felt to bloated to\u2026            \n\n            Vivaldi 7.2 Released with Speed Improvements + More            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe Sneddon\n            Ah, understandable.            \n\n            Bodhi Linux Tease New Theme            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe Sneddon\n            I\u2026 Totally forget this was coming out \ud83d\ude48 I had\u2026            \n\n            GIMP 3.0            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAleksandr Prokudin\n            Oh, this has nothing to do with tablets.

Courtesy LANL\nLANL NEWS RELEASE\nAt the International Supercomputing Conference 2022 on May 23, the Laboratory offered new details about its collaboration with Nvidia Corp. to develop high-performance computing systems to meet the Laboratory\u2019s diverse mission needs.\nThe Laboratory will be the first U.S. customer to receive an Nvidia Grace central processing unit, with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) as the system provider. The system also represents the first U.S. installation of the Nvidia Grace and Grace Hopper Superchips using NVLink-C2C, an ultra-fast, chip-to-chip interconnect.\nThe new system will be named \u201cVenado,\u201d after Venado Peak, a mountain near Taos. That moniker follows the example of the Chicoma system at the Laboratory, named for the tallest peak in New Mexico\u2019s Jemez Mountains.\n\u201cWe\u2019re finalizing the makeup of the Venado system, and eagerly anticipating its arrival,\u201d said Irene Qualters, associate Laboratory director for Simulation and Computation. \u201cThis advanced system pushes new technical boundaries, enabling Los Alamos researchers and collaborators to make new discoveries, benefiting the nation and society as a whole.\u201d\nVenado designed to optimize developer productivity\nVenado\u2019s balanced architecture is well-suited for complex, heterogeneous workloads. Built on the HPE Shasta system, the Nvidia Grace Hopper Superchip includes a reticle-sized Grace CPU tightly coupled with a reticle-sized Hopper architecture graphics processing unit. This combination offers the highest levels of application performance and flexibility.\nVenado includes a cluster of CPU-only systems powered by the Grace CPU Superchip, which packs 144 Arm cores in a single socket to deliver an immediate performance boost to a wide range of HPC applications.\nVenado represents an ongoing collaboration between Los Alamos, Nvidia and HPE to build a robust software ecosystem to optimize developer productivity. This collaboration will continue to focus on developing flexible, portable parallel programming models and driving the continued expansion of the Arm-based HPC and artificial intelligence development ecosystem.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cVenado\u2019s heterogeneous architecture will feature a mix of Grace CPU Superchip nodes and Grace Hopper Superchip nodes and accelerate simulation, machine learning, scientific edge, and digital twin application use cases,\u201d said Gary Grider, division leader of High Performance Computing at the Laboratory.\nFrom materials science to firefighting\nVenado enables research across the Laboratory\u2019s portfolio.\nIn materials science, the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package supports density functional theory capabilities, enabled by AI. That AI capability may also be used in inertial confinement fusion research with transfer learning.In energy-related research, Venado\u2019s digital twin application capabilities can enable power-grid modeling to simulate grid scenarios and the impacts of investment decisions.Venado could also allow for the modeling and simulation of unmanned vehicles with lidar systems, connected over 5G, to help stop the spread of wildfires.\nComing next year\nVenado represents\u00a0a milestone for the collaboration\u00a0between Los Alamos, Nvidia and HPE. Los Alamos\u2019 current premier institutional computing capability is Chicoma, an HPE Olympus system with a mixture of node types including an Nvidia A100 partition that is being used as a stepping stone to be ready for the much-awaited Venado system.\nWhen it is delivered in 2023, Venado will afford the Laboratory a leadership-class advanced technology supercomputer to conduct modeling, simulation and data analysis in support of Laboratory research and missions.\nA multiyear collaboration focused on codesign for a broad spectrum of computing, memory and software technologies will build on the capabilities deployed with Venado. Codesign draws on the combined expertise of vendors, hardware architects, system software developers, domain scientists, computer scientists and applied mathematicians working together to make informed decisions about hardware and software components.\nShare this:TweetEmailPrintLike this:Like Loading...\n\nRelated\n \n\n\nCommunity\nLos Alamos National Laboratory\nScience \n\n

Smith  \n\n Contributor, PCWorld   May 9, 2022 3:45 am PDT \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nImage: Intel \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s finally happening.\nAfter several years of teases, leaks, hints, and one extremely soft desktop graphics card, Intel\u2019s debut Arc discrete GPUs are finally arriving in mainstream notebooks like the Samsung Galaxy Book2 Pro and Lenovo Slim 7i.\n\n\nBut how well do they perform? To find out, I paid a visit to Intel\u2019s Jones Farm campus in Portland, Oregon, where Intel invited me to put an Arc A370M reference laptop (based off MSI\u2019s Summit E16 Flip Evo) through the wringer. I was given a little more than an hour to test Intel\u2019s entry-level GPU using benchmarks of my choosing, in a similar arrangement to our recent early performance preview for 12th-gen Core i9 laptop processors.\nBottom line? Intel might just be getting started in discrete graphics, but Arc\u2019s results are already impressive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3DMark Time Spy\nWe start in 3DMark Time Spy, a classic synthetic graphics benchmark PCWorld frequently uses to judge the performance of anything that comes across our test bench.\nThe Intel Arc A370M posted a strong score of 4,405 in 3DMark Time Spy. This is almost two and half times quicker than Intel Iris Xe on its own, a significant uplift that certainly puts Arc A370M in a different performance class.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt Smith/IDG\nOf course, it\u2019s the entry-level discrete GPUs that provide the real challenge, and here the Arc A370M holds its own. It\u2019s roughly 15 percent quicker than Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3050, as tested in HP\u2019s Spectre x360 16, and essentially tied with the Asus Vivobook Pro 15 OLED, which again equipped an Nvidia RTX 3050.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Arc A370M falls behind the more mid-tier discrete graphic options found in laptops that explicitly target gaming. The RTX 3050 Ti in the MSI GF76 Katana is just a bit less than 50 percent quicker, and the Acer Nitro 5 with an RTX 3060 nearly doubles the Arc A370M\u2019s performance in this benchmark.\n\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV: Endwalker benchmark\nThe game tests begin with Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker. This is not a test PC World normally runs but, given that the Arc A370M is an entry-level discrete offering, I thought testing an older, popular game with no cutting-edge features could provide some insight. After all, many people (myself included) spend more time in games like this than in Cyberpunk 2077 or Metro Exodus.\n\n\n\n\nMatt Smith/IDG\nThis test pegs the Intel Arc A370M\u2019s performance a bit less than 50 percent above that of Intel\u2019s Iris Xe graphics with 96 EUs. It\u2019s a much smaller gain than in 3DMark Time Spy, but still large enough to substantially improve the real-world experience. Iris Xe just gets by at 1080p and High (Desktop) settings, while the A370M is rather smooth.\n\nIntel\u2019s reference laptop with Arc A370M falls slightly behind the HP Spectre x360 16 with RTX 3050 in this benchmark, but the margin of victory is so small that it\u2019s a hair away from being a tie. I doubt most players would see any real-world difference playing Final Fantasy XIV on each system.\nOf course, the Acer Nitro 5 is in a different realm, as expected given its use of Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3060. This sort of mid-tier discrete GPU lets players set their sight well beyond 60 FPS and gain benefit from a high refresh display.\n\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\nShadow of the Tomb Raider is now four years old, believe it or not, but remains an excellent game for gauging how well a PC will handle the most attractive games of the \u201clast-gen\u201d console era.\n\n\n\n\nMatt Smith/IDG\nIntel Arc A370M provides a beefy gain over Iris Xe here, coming oh-so-close to an average of 60 frames per second. Iris Xe can\u2019t really handle this game at 1080p and Highest settings, struggling along at an unacceptable average of 21 (with many dips into the mid-teens).\n\nArc A370M also beats the HP Spectre x360 16 with Nvidia RTX 3050 by more than 15 percent, a greater margin than I expected. That\u2019s a nice boost and shows that Arc A370M can indeed beat Nvidia\u2019s entry-level graphics in some situations.\nOnce again, the Acer Nitro 5 with RTX 3060 shows the difference between a mainstream laptop with entry-level discrete graphics and a \u201creal\u201d gaming laptop, beating all competitors handily.\n\n\nMetro Exodus Enhanced Edition\nWe come last to Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition, the most demanding game I tested, and the only game I tested with ray tracing on. Even then, I used only the High graphics preset, which sets ray tracing to its lowest \u201cnormal\u201d setting and uses hybrid reflections instead of fully ray traced reflections.\n\n\n\n\nMatt Smith/IDG\nIntel Arc A370M beats Iris Xe by an infinite percentage because, well, Iris Xe doesn\u2019t meet the game\u2019s minimum system requirements. Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition is unusual because ray tracing is required to run the game at all. That leaves Iris Xe out in the cold of nuclear winter.\n\nArc A370M slugs it out with the HP Spectre x360 16 with RTX 3050 graphics and ultimately loses by three frames per second. That reflects a 15 percent performance advantage for the RTX 3050, and hints that the Arc A370M may fall slightly behind in ray tracing relative to Nvidia\u2019s hardware.\nAcer\u2019s Nitro 5 with an RTX 3060 once again stomps everything else in the field, beating both the Arc A370M and RTX 3050 machines by a three-fold margin. This thumping may have something to do with the more limited 4GB of video memory available on the Arc A370M and RTX 3050, compared to 6GB on the RTX 3060. Ray tracing is notoriously memory intensive.\n\n\nTopaz Video Enhance AI\nThe last test is different \u2013 a content creation workload. Topaz Video Enhanced AI is a tool that can upscale or improve the quality of video clips. I\u2019ve used Topaz Video Enhance AI to upscale videos for my own YouTube channel, Computer Gaming Yesterday, and I\u2019ve found discrete graphics can provide a serious lift in this app\u2019s performance.\nOne quirk to note is that I ran this test using Topaz\u2019s experimental multi-GPU support. Intel collaborated with Topaz to make this feature work with Intel hardware. Intel Arc systems can use both the Arc discrete graphics and Xe integrated graphics simultaneously, one of the the unique and intriguing \u201cDeep Link\u201d features offered by Intel Arc laptops with Intel Core processors. I did try using this experimental feature with the Nvidia laptops I had for comparison, in which case the Nvidia GPU was paired with Iris Xe integrated graphics, but it made performance significantly worse. So for those systems, the results below show performance when running only on the Nvidia GPU.\n\n\n\n\nMatt Smith/IDG\nComparing Intel Arc A370M to Iris Xe shows the advantage of using even entry-level discrete graphics for content creation. Arc A370M cuts through the sample clip nearly four times more quickly than the Iris Xe laptop. This could literally save you hours if looking to upscale video files more than a few minutes in length.\nThe Arc A370M proved about 40 percent quicker than the HP Spectre x360 16 with Nvidia RTX 3050 graphics. That is a very significant win. Arc scores a larger margin of victory over the RTX 3050 here than in other tests, which shows Intel\u2019s hardware is using the experimental multi-GPU support to its fullest.\n\n\nHow we tested\nThese tests were performed on Intel Arc A370M reference laptops located at Intel\u2019s Jones Farm campus. I was given access to not one, but five identical reference systems, which meant I was able to repeat test runs multiple times to verify results. The results here are averages of systems tested.\nIntel also provided an Alder Lake reference system, the equivalent of an MSI Summit E14 Flip, to provide comparison to Intel\u2019s Iris Xe graphics. The other systems benchmarked, including the HP Spectre x360 16 and Acer Nitro 5, are review systems not provided by Intel. The Intel reference platforms and HP Spectre x360 16 were set to \u201cperformance\u201d power management, while the Acer Nitro 5 was at its default setting.\nHere\u2019s the run-down on settings for each benchmark.\n3DMark Time Spy: Time Spy standard demo at default settings.Shadow of the Tomb Raider: DX12 1080p Highest settings, Ray Tracing off, TAA on.Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker: 1080p at Highest (Desktop) settings.Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition: 1080p at High benchmark settings.Topaz Video Enhance AI: An eight-second 1080p .MOV file was upscaled to 4K using the Artemis Medium Quality AI model.\nConclusions\n\n\n\n\nIntel\nWhat most gamers and enthusiasts want to know is simple: can you buy a laptop with Intel\u2019s Arc and expect performance in league with Nvidia and AMD?\n\n\nThe answer, it seems, is yes.\nThese are strong results for Intel\u2019s Arc A370M. The quicker of Intel\u2019s two entry-level discrete GPUs appears to be an even match for Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3050 as implemented in a variety of mainstream professional and enthusiast notebooks (though initial Arc laptops cost much more than RTX 3050 notebooks). Intel Arc A370M can easily handle \u201clast-gen\u201d 3D games and can deliver a big boost in content creation apps that lean on the GPU.\nThe Arc A370M is no match for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 in Acer\u2019s Nitro 5, but it\u2019s not meant to compete in that segment. That task will go to Intel\u2019s Arc A550M, which has twice as much memory (8GB vs 4GB) and twice as many Xe Cores (16 vs. 8) when compared to Arc A370M. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how Arc A550M performs when it arrives this summer, but napkin math suggests it could be nipping at the heels of RTX 3050 Ti and RTX 3060 laptops.\nI\u2019m pleased with these numbers. Intel Arc provides a third option for people seeking a slim, portable Windows laptop to handle gaming and content creation. Now let\u2019s just hope Intel\u2014and OEM system manufacturers\u2014can turn the current trickle of Arc-equipped machines into a flood.\n\n\nFurther Intel Arc reading:\nIntel\u2019s long-anticipated Arc GPUs arrive in laptops, loaded with enticing featuresMeet Xe HPG, the beating heart inside Intel\u2019s first graphics cardsCan Intel Arc shake up the depressingly bleak state of graphics cards?Here\u2019s your first look at Intel\u2019s Arc Limited Edition graphics card\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Matthew S.

It underlined this is not a hiring freeze, but a pause.The message added that bars will be raised for the ongoing interviews so that only 10% of those being interviewed will be given offers to work for Nvidia.\u201cOffers in process \u2013 continue. There will be no counters to the offers unless Jensen approves, none,\u201d read the message.It also said that diversity hiring will continue and there will be no slowdown in this area. \u201cWe need to determine if any of your candidates are considered a diversity candidate. If so, proceed as usual,\u201d it said.\"We\u2019ve been extremely successful in hiring this year.

He\u2019s talking to corporate America, and his goal is to have companies essentially institute a hiring freeze and end the cycle of paying up for new hires.\u201dPowell has centred on the ratio between job openings versus unemployed workers and the core personal consumption expenditures price index, which measures inflation. Colas said he mentioned this ratio several times at a press conference, and added that job postings need to drop from 11.5 million to 8 million to get back to normal.The hiring pause comes after Nvidia agreed to pay $5.5 million to settle the long-standing civil charges accusing the chip giant of attempting to conceal the impact of cryptomining on its gaming business. The company\u2019s chips had been used to mine cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum, since at least 2018.The company was found to have \u201cfailed to disclose that cryptomining was a significant element of its material revenue growth from the sale of its graphics processing units (GPUs) designed and marketed for gaming\u201d in its back-to-back quarterly financial results in fiscal 2018. This violated part of the Securities Act of 1933, said the SEC.\n\n\nZach MarzoukSocial Links NavigationZach Marzouk is a former ITPro, CloudPro, and ChannelPro staff writer, covering topics like security, privacy, worker rights, and startups, primarily in the Asia Pacific and the US regions.

But a rise in the value of Ether from under $10 in January 2017 to nearly $800 a year later changed things - and helped lead to a 52 percent year-over-year increase in gaming GPU revenue in the second quarter of 2018.\"Nvidia's senior management internally expressed a desire to capture the cryptomining demand, and at the same time shelter its gaming business from cryptominers and protect supply of GPUs for gamers,\" the SEC report says.\"While the company could not track when and which specific gaming GPUs were purchased for the purpose of cryptomining, company personnel estimated using various assumptions that the impact of cryptomining was at levels that would indicate cryptomining was a significant factor in the year-over-year growth in gaming revenue during the relevant period.\"Kristina Littman, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division\u2019s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, said that the failure to disclose crypto's impact on GPU sales \"deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company\u2019s business in a key market.\"That unit is set to nearly double as the number of crypto scams, schemes, and cyberattacks grow in the little-regulated sector.Crypto booms have led to GPUs and other chips being hard to find, while slumps have flooded the market with second-hand equipment. In late 2018, Nvidia suffered \"an extraordinary, unusually turbulent, and disappointing quarter,\" partially due to crashing cryptocurrency demand.\n\n\n\n Subscribe to our daily newsletters\n\n\n Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in IT Hardware & Semiconductors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture-proof your datacenter with DDC S-Series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25 Oct 2024\n\n\n\n\nSK Hynix posts record quarterly revenues, says demand for AI memory will carry into 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nThe drivers of chip design: AI, efficiency and geopolitics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\ncryptomining\n\n\ncryptocurrency\n\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission\n\n\nSEC\n\n\nGPU\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

Image: NvidiaSean Hollister is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.Did you finally find a gaming GPU within your budget now that sanity is returning to the market? Here\u2019s a reason to keep on waiting: the Nvidia RTX 4090 might arrive as soon as mid-July (via VideoCardz).That\u2019s the word from kopite7kimi, the leaker who correctly predicted the specifications of the RTX 3090 and RTX 3080, among other things.Kopite7kimi\u2019s latest predictions suggest the RTX 4090 will require up to 450W of power all by itself, just like the $1,999 RTX 3090 Ti that Nvidia put on sale in March, but offer quite a few more cores than the last-gen chip: 16,128 of them paired with 24GB of GDDR6X memory at 21Gbps.And while that\u2019s only around 50 percent more cores than the RTX 3090, it\u2019s on Nvidia\u2019s new Ada Lovelace architecture which \u2014 again, reportedly \u2014 crams in a bunch of other hardware as well, enough that some watchers suspect we may see double the raw performance this hardware generation. Wccftech has a good breakdown of the math, if you\u2019re curious, though Kimi\u2019s actually suggesting fewer cores and lower power (450W versus 600W) for the RTX 4090 today than previously.Kimi\u2019s been trickling out predictions for months, actually, but we\u2019ve been waiting for them to start to firm up. As you might expect, the ones proactively labeled \u201cApril Fools\u2019 Day\u201d didn\u2019t give us much confidence!And, speaking of April Fools\u2019, remember when one Nvidia fan imagined the RTX 4090 would be a 1,000W card with two power cords and 48GB of memory? Last month, Kimi suggested Nvidia is actually testing a 900W card with 48GB of memory that requires two 16-pin power connectors to function.See More: EntertainmentGamingNewsNvidiaPC GamingTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

That's part of why Nvidia came up with Advanced Optimus - a genius system to help your laptop last longer. \n                        What is Nvidia Advanced Optimus?\n               \nAdvanced Optimus is a technology that Nvidia has developed specifically for gaming laptops that use its RTX laptop GPUs, graphics cards that are capable of ray-tracing and high resolutions even in a thin laptop.\nIt allows these laptops to swap which GPU is driving the laptop\u2019s onboard display on the fly between their discrete GPUs and their lower-spec onboard integrated graphics, to save on the amount of power that the machine has to use, improve performance in games and deliver the smooth, tear-free certified G-SYNC gaming experience. No reboot required.\u00a0\nIt's a simple concept, but one that makes a massive difference. After all, it's great to have a gaming GPU that can manage ray-traced reflections when you're playing a new game and want it to look as good as possible, but if you're just checking Twitter then you just need the lower-spec\u2019d integrated GPU (iGPU).\nThis means that for low-powered tasks the laptop can opt for its low-powered iGPU, and can automatically swap to the discrete GPU when you actually need it - Nvidia RTX GPU power, performance and features when you need it, power savings when you don\u2019t. This means Advanced Optimus can hugely increase battery life when running tasks that don\u2019t need the power of a discrete GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\nThe tech also helps with system latency, ensuring that your machine runs with the absolute minimum in delay and input lag, making it more responsive than ever and giving a potentially pretty noticeable uplift when you turn it on.\nThis is down to the removal of a step between the GPU and your display, freeing things up so that your split-second reaction times are backed up by the PC you're playing on to ensure that you have every advantage in your games of choice. \n                        What is Advanced Optimus like to use?\n               \nThe best part of Advanced Optimus, in our opinion, is how simple it is to take advantage of it - you can just turn it on and let your laptop do the rest of the work. We've been playing the Overwatch 2 beta over the last couple of weeks, and it's been instructive for that.\nYou don't notice when it switches between integrated and GPU graphics, so seamless is the system at play, but it means that we can alt-tab out of the game while we queue up for a match without worrying that we're wasting huge amounts of power in the background. \n                        Which laptops support Advanced Optimus?\n               \nThere are a whole bunch of excellent gaming laptops out there that support Advanced Optimus, including the Lenovo Legion 5, MSI GP66 Leopard, MSI GE66 Raider and Acer Triton 500 SE. It's certainly something that you should pay attention to as you shop for your next gaming laptop - if it packs in an Nvidia GeForce RTX laptop GPU, having Advanced Optimus is a great bonus. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\n\n\nPC Gaming\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support Pocket-lint.

On the CPU side of things, buying just a slice of CPU power is standard, but until now, that just wasn\u2019t possible for GPUs, even though for many use cases, like inferencing, you would only need access to a fraction of the GPU\u2019s compute power.\nImage Credits: Vultr\nVultr argues that its platform is the first to offer fractional access to these high-end GPUs. The service is powered by the Nvidia AI Enterprise software suite and Vultr CEO J.J. Kardwell, who joined the company in late 2020, believes that this is another point in his service\u2019s favor. \u201cIf you think about the way that the big clouds deploy, they want to buy GPU hardware and then push their own stack, whereas we partnered very closely with Nvidia to deliver not just the GPU itself but the Nvidia AI Enterprise software stack and the full set of libraries,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best way to get the most out of the GPU \u2014 the physical GPUs \u2014 is through that Nvidia software stack \u2014 and that\u2019s a very, very different approach.\u201d\nImage Credits: Vultr\nThe company, which also recently launched its managed Kubernetes platform into general availability, always remained a bit under the media radar \u2014 and much of that was by design. It never raised a lot of outside funding since its launch in 2014 and mostly relied on word of mouth to grow to $125 million ARR today, as Kardwell told me. That\u2019s the way the company\u2019s founder, David Aninowsky, who is now its executive chairman, wanted to build Vultr. But as the company is now reaching this scale \u2014 and likely thinking about an IPO at some point in the future \u2014 the team is clearly looking to elevate its profile a bit more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe really believe we\u2019re doing more than anyone to democratize access to cloud computing globally. And as we seek to do that, we think it\u2019s important that people understand that mission,\u201d he explained.\nThe A100 is now available in Vultr\u2019s New Jersey data center, with other locations following in the next few weeks. The company also tells me that it will add other Nvidia GPUs to its lineup later this year.\n\n\nTopics\n\nCloud Computing, computing, developers, GPU, graphics cards, machine learning, nvidia, TC, technology, tensor, Vultr \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tFrederic Lardinois\t\n\n\n\nEditor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore he joined TechCrunch in 2012, he founded SiliconFilter and wrote for ReadWriteWeb (now ReadWrite).

In addition, enterprise software developers can now integrate the driver seamlessly into the customized Linux kernel configured for their project.\" - NVIDIA.\n\nNVIDIA has been criticized heavily in the past for its denial to follow a more open and collaborative approach with the open-source community, so this move comes after many years of pressure.\nRed Hat, SUSE, and Canonical, the maker of Ubuntu, have all issued short statements to celebrate this development and highlight the benefits it will bring to their users and customers.\n\u201cThe new NVIDIA open-source GPU kernel modules will simplify installs and increase security for Ubuntu users, whether they\u2019re AI/ML developers, gamers, or cloud users,\u201d commented Cindy Goldberg, VP of Silicon alliances at Canonical. \u201cAs the makers of Ubuntu, the most popular Linux-based operating system for developers, we can now provide even better support to developers working at the cutting edge of AI and ML by enabling even closer integration with NVIDIA GPUs on Ubuntu.\u201d\n\nNew end-user installation option (NVIDIA)\nWhat this means for Linux\nWhile this is the most open-source-friendly move NVIDIA has ever taken, many argue that it's not what it looks like, as large parts of the code were moved to the firmware before open-sourcing.\n\nI'd argue that it's probably fine licensing-wise, and it's better for users in that at least the blob can be sandboxed behind an IOMMU, so it's a net win for practical purposes.\r\nBut no freedom was gained, for people who care about that. The ~same amount of code is closed.\r\n\u2014 Hector Martin (@marcan42) May 12, 2022\nAdditionally, the user-mode drivers will remain closed source and published with pre-built binaries, so when evaluated generally, a big part of the modern graphics driver is still closed source.\nThe development does not make NVIDIA drivers part of the Linux kernel, and no upstream integration can occur. However, this doesn't mean that NVIDIA's move is insignificant for the Linux world.\nThe published source code can help the developers of the Nouveau driver, the open-source graphics driver for NVIDIA video cards, improve their code and upgrade its performance considerably.\nPreviously, these developers had to rely upon reverse engineering and a lot of guessing. Now, they can look into GPU functionalities like the clock and thermal management and implement targeted improvements on the open-source driver.\nDirector for Graphics at Red Hat, Christian Schaller, has posted a blog post explaining that NVIDIA's move won't have a major impact on drivers and Linux distributions initially.\nIn the long-term, though, the binary (closed-source) driver will begin taking advantage of GPL-only APIs in the kernel, and out-of-the-box support for new chipsets on Linux distributions will improve immensely.\nAs for the Nouveau driver, Schaller doesn't expect immediate benefits, but many positives will be introduced in the long run.\n\nFor the open-source community, it means that we will now have a kernel driver and firmware that allows changing the clocking of the GPU to provide the kind of performance people expect from the NVidia graphics card, and it means that we will have an open-source driver that will have access to the firmware and kernel updates from day one for new generations of NVidia hardware. - GNOME blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\u00a9 Techniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\nCISA orders agencies to patch Linux kernel bug exploited in attacksNew Akira ransomware decryptor cracks encryptions keys using GPUsNew Chirp tool uses audio tones to transfer data between devicesNew Auto-Color Linux backdoor targets North American govts, universitiesApiiro unveils free scanner to detect malicious code merges\n\n\n\n\nDriver\nKernel\nLinux\nNVIDIA\nOpen Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Toulas   \n              Bill Toulas is a tech writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience working on various online publications, covering open-source, Linux, malware, data breach incidents, and hacks.\n            \n\n\n Previous Article \nNext Article \n\n\nComments\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGT500  -  2 years ago \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nThanks for the article.

The new information comes from Kopte7kimi & talks about the block diagram of the next-gen architecture.\nNVIDIA GeForce Ada Lovelace GPU SM Block Diagram Detailed: Bigger & Better Than Ever For Gamers!\nThe NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPU architecture is no mystery anymore. We have learned the specific configurations that will power the next Gen AD10* series SKUs for GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards and we have also seen leaked specifications of the lineup. Now, it's time to talk purely about the next-generation graphics chip itself.\nRelated Story NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDPNVIDIA AD102 'Ada Lovelace' Gaming GPU 'SM' Block Diagram (Image Credits: Kopite7kimi):\n\nNVIDIA GA102 'Ampere' Gaming GPU 'SM' Block Diagram:\n\nStarting with the GPU configuration, Kopite7kimi compares the top AD102 GPU to various other GPUs from the green team. These include the gaming-focused Ampere GA102 and Turing TU102 while there's also the HPC-Focused Hopper GH100 and Ampere GA100 added to the list. I'll only compare the AD102 to its gaming predecessors since the HPC-focused designs are vastly different than consumer-centric offerings.\nThe NVIDIA Ada Lovelace AD102 GPU will feature up to 12 GPC (Graphics Processing Clusters). This is an increase of 70% versus GA102 which features only 7 GPCs. Each GPU will consist of 6 TPCs and 2 SMs which is the same configuration as the existing chip. Each SM (Streaming Multiprocessor) will house four sub-cores which is also the same as the GA102 GPU. What's changed is the FP32 & the INT32 core configuration. Each sub-core will include 128 FP32 units but combined FP32+INT32 units will go up to 192. This is because the FP32 units don't share the same sub-core as the IN32 units. The 128 FP32 cores are separate from the 64 INT32 cores.\nSo in total, each sub-core will consist of 128 FP32 plus 64 INT32 units for a total of 192 units. Each SM will have a total of 512 FP32 units plus 256 INT32 units for a total of 768 units. And since there are a total of 24 SM units (2 per GPC), we are looking at 12,288 FP32 Units and 6,144 INT32 units for a total of 18,432 cores. Each SM will also include two Wrap Schedules (32 thread/CLK) for 64 wraps per SM. This is a 50% increase on the cores (FP32+INT32) and a 33% increase in Wraps/Threads vs the GA102 GPU.\nNVIDIA Ada Lovelace 'AD103' GPU Specs 'Preliminary':\n\n\n\nGPU NameAD103GA102GA103TU102\n\n\n\n\nGPC7 (Per GPU)Same1.16x1.16x\n\n\nTPC6 (Per GPC)Same1.20xSame\n\n\nSM2 (Per TPC)SameSameSame\n\n\nSub-Core4 (Per SM)SameSameSame\n\n\nFP32128 (Per SM)SameSame2x\n\n\nFP32+INT32192 (Per SM)1.5x1.5x1.5x\n\n\nWarps64 (Per SM)1.33x1.33x2x\n\n\nThreads2048 (Per SM)1.33x1.33x2x\n\n\nL1 Cache192 KB (Per SM)1.5x1.5x2x\n\n\nL2 Cache64 MB (Per GPU)10.6x16x10.6x\n\n\nROPs32 (Per GPC)2x2x2x\n\n\n\nMoving over to the cache, this is another segment where NVIDIA has given a big boost over the existing Ampere GPUs. The Ada Lovelace GPUs will pack 192 KB of L1 cache per SM, an increase of 50% over Ampere. That's a total of 4.5 MB of L1 cache on the top AD102 GPU. The L2 cache will be increased to 96 MB as mentioned in the leaks. This is a 16x increase over the Ampere GPU that hosts just 6 MB of L2 cache. The cache will be shared across the GPU.\n\nFinally, we have the ROPs which are also increased to 32 per GPC, an increase of 2x over Ampere. You are looking at up to 384 ROPs on the next-gen flagship versus just 112 on the fastest Ampere GPU, the RTX 3090 Ti. There are also going to be the latest 4th Generation Tensor and 3rd Generation RT (Raytracing) cores infused on the Ada Lovelace GPUs which will help boost DLSS & Raytracing performance to the next level. Overall, the Ada Lovelace AD102 GPU will offer:\n\n2x GPCs (Versus Ampere)\n50% More Cores (Versus Ampere)\n50% More L1 Cache (Versus Ampere)\n16x More L2 Cache (Versus Ampere)\nDouble The ROPs (Versus Ampere)\n4th Gen Tensor & 3rd Gen RT Cores\n\nDo note that clock speeds, which are said to be between the 2-3 GHz range, aren't taken into the equation so they will also play a major role in improving the per-core performance versus Ampere. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards featuring the next-gen Ada Lovelace gaming GPUs are expected to launch in the second half of 2022 & are said to utilize the same TSMC 4N process node as the Hopper H100 GPU.\nNVIDIA CUDA GPU (RUMORED) Preliminary:\n\n\n\nGPUTU102GA102AD102\n\n\n\n\nFlagship SKURTX 2080 TiRTX 3090 TiRTX 4090?\n\n\nArchitectureTuringAmpereAda Lovelace\n\n\nProcessTSMC 12nm NFFSamsung 8nmTSMC 4N?\n\n\nDie Size754mm2628mm2~600mm2\n\n\nGraphics Processing Clusters (GPC)6712\n\n\nTexture Processing Clusters (TPC)364272\n\n\nStreaming Multiprocessors (SM)7284144\n\n\nCUDA Cores46081075218432\n\n\nL2 Cache6 MB6 MB96 MB\n\n\nTheoretical TFLOPs 16 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs~90 TFLOPs?\n\n\nMemory TypeGDDR6GDDR6XGDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Capacity11 GB (2080 Ti)24 GB (3090 Ti)24 GB (4090?)\n\n\nMemory Speed14 Gbps21 Gbps24 Gbps?\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth616 GB/s1.008 GB/s1152 GB/s?\n\n\nMemory Bus384-bit384-bit384-bit\n\n\nPCIe InterfacePCIe Gen 3.0PCIe Gen 4.0PCIe Gen 4.0\n\n\nTGP250W350W600W?\n\n\nReleaseSep. 2018Sept. 202H 2022 (TBC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Rolls Out GeForce Driver 572.60 To Fix Black Screen Issues Related To RTX 50 Series GPUs\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n64\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\n\n\n28\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n21\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n19\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1528\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia's decision to build its own lineup of Arm-based server CPUs, dubbed the Grace CPU Superchip and the Grace Hopper Superchip, charted the company's course to building out full systems with its CPUs and GPUs in the same box. That initiative moved closer to reality today as Nvidia announced at Computex 2022 that several major server OEMs will offer dozens of reference systems based on its new Arm CPUs and Hopper GPUs in the first half of 2023.\n\nNvidia tells us that these new systems, which we break down below, will co-exist with its existing lineup of reference servers, so the company will continue to support x86 processors from AMD and Intel for the foreseeable future.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)As a quick reminder, Nvidia's Grace CPU Superchip is the company's first CPU-only Arm chip designed for the data center and comes as two chips on one motherboard, while the Grace Hopper Superchip combines a Hopper GPU and the Grace CPU on the same board. The Neoverse-based CPUs support the Arm v9 instruction set and systems come with two chips fused together with Nvidia's newly branded NVLink-C2C interconnect tech.\n\nOverall, Nvidia claims the Grace CPU Superchip will be the fastest processor on the market when it ships in early 2023 for a wide range of applications, like hyperscale computing, data analytics, and scientific computing. (You can read the deep-dive details about the silicon here.)(Image credit: Nvidia)A slew of blue-chip OEM/ODMs, like Asus, Gigabyte, Supermicro, QCT, Wiwynn, and Foxconn, have dozens of new reference server designs planned for launch in the first half of 2023, indicating that Nvidia remains on track with its Grace CPU silicon.\u00a0The OEMs will craft each of the server designs from one of Nvidia's four reference designs that include server and baseboard blueprints. These servers will be available in 1U and 2U form factors, with the former requiring liquid cooling. \u00a0\n\nThe Nvidia CGX system for cloud graphics and gaming applications comes with the dual-CPU Grace Superchip paired with Nvidia's A16 GPUs. The Nvidia OVX servers are designed for digital twin and omniverse applications and also come with the dual-CPU Grace, but they allow for more flexible pairings with many different Nvidia GPU models.\u00a0The Nvidia HGX platform comes in two flavors. The first is designed for HPC workloads and only comes with the dual-CPU Grace, no GPUs, and OEM-defined I/O options. Meanwhile, on the far right, we see the more full-featured HGX system for AI training, inference, and HPC workloads with the Grace CPU + Hopper GPU Superchip, OEM-defined I/O, and support for the option of fourth-gen NVLink for connections outside of the server via NVLink switches. \u00a0\u00a0Notably, Nvidia will offer the NVLink option with its CPU+GPU Grace Hopper Superchip models, but not for systems powered by the dual-CPU Grace Superchip.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)Here we can see the two different 2U blades that can power the HGX systems. The dual-CPU 'HGX Grace' CPU Superchip blade has up to 1TB of LPDDR5x memory, provides up to 1TB/s of memory bandwidth, adheres to a 500W TDP envelope, can be cooled with either liquid or air, and supports two blades per node for up to 84 nodes per rack.\u00a0The HGX 'Grace Hopper' Superchip blade comes with a single Grace CPU paired with the Hopper GPU, providing 512 GB of LPDDR5x memory, 80GB of HBM3, and up to a combined 3.5 TB/s of memory throughput. As you'd expect, given the addition of the GPU, this blade comes with a higher 1000W TDP envelope and comes with either air or liquid cooling. This larger blade limits the HGX Grace Hopper systems to 42 nodes per rack.\u00a0Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Unsurprisingly, Nvidia offers all of these systems with its other important additive that is helping the company become a solutions provider: The 400 Gbps Bluefield-3 Data Processing Units (DPUs) that come as the fruits of its Mellanox acquisition. These chips offload critical work from the CPUs, allowing streamlined networking, security, storage, and virtualization/orchestration features.Nvidia already has CGX, OVX, and HGX systems available with x86 CPUs from both Intel and AMD, and the company tells us that it plans to continue to provide those servers and develop newer revisions with Intel and AMD silicon.\"x86 is a very important CPU that is pretty much all of the market of Nvidia GPUs today. We'll continue to support x86, and we'll continue to support Arm-based CPUs, offering our customers in the market the choice of wherever they want to deploy accelerated computing,\" Paresh Kharya, Nvidia's Senior Director of Product Management and Marketing, told us.\u00a0That doesn't mean that Nvidia will pull performance punches, though. The company recently demoed its Grace CPU in a weather forecasting head-to-head with Intel's Ice Lake, claiming that its Arm chip is 2X faster and 2.3X more efficient. Those same Intel chips currently power Nvidia's OVX servers.\u00a0The company hasn't spared AMD, either. Nvidia also claims that its Grace CPU Superchip is 1.5X faster in the SPECrate_2017_int_base benchmark than the two previous-gen 64-core EPYC Rome 7742 processors it uses in its current DGX A100 systems.We'll soon see if Nvidia's first foray into CPUs lives up to its claims. The reference CGX, OVX, and HGX systems will ship in the first half of 2023.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more CPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nasus\nx86\narm\nSupermicro\nComputex\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (0)\n\n\n\nPaul AlcornSocial Links NavigationManaging Editor: News and Emerging TechPaul Alcorn is the Managing Editor: News and Emerging Tech for Tom's Hardware US.

It's been depressing, to say the least. But over the course of 2022, prices have been steadily falling and are now at the point where the average cost for both GeForce RTX 30 and Radeon RX 6000 series graphics card models are nearly back to launch pricing.\n\n\nLooking at the glass as being half empty, the response is, 'Gee, how wonderful, prices finally normalize when new generation GPUs are on the horizon'. And that's a fair evaluation. But if looking at the glass half full, it's been a long wait to get back to this point, and it means you can upgrade your GPU without feeling like you've been punched in the gut.\n\n\nThat's the case if you live in Austria or Germany, anywhere. The folks at 3DCenter.org have been tracking graphics card prices at nine popular vendors in those regions, and there's a look at the updated graph...\n\n\n\n\nSource: 3DCenter.org\n\n\n\nAt their peak, retailer pricing for GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards were selling for a whopping 218 percent above MSRP, while Radeon RX 6000 series cards commanded a 116 percent premium. That was the situation in this same month a year ago. And now?\n\n\nPrices have been declining since the start of the year when GeForce cards were selling for 85 percent over MSRP and Radeon cards were priced 78 percent above. As of now, however, pricing premiums on GeForce and Radeon cards have fallen to 6 percent and 2 percent above MSRP, respectively, according to the latest GPU price tracking data.\n\n\n\nThere are caveats. The recently released GeForce RTX 3090 Ti and Radeon RX 65x0 series distort the average selling price. However, it's still a much better situation than it was. When looking at what the site considers just the \"core\" GPUs (Radeon RX 6800 XT, 6800, and 6700 XT, and GeForce RTX 3080 10GB, 3070, and 3060 Ti), the average markup over MSRP is 17 percent.\n\n\nWhat about in the US? It's a mix. For example, you can find a Zotac GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Amp Edition for $1,899.99 at Amazon, which is actually $100 below the MSRP for a Founders Edition (reference) model. And over at AMD's webstore, the Radeon RX 6950 XT, 6750 XT, and 6900 XT are all in stock at MSRP.\n\n\nThat's not the situation across the board, though. The lowest price GeForce RTX 3070 we can find is a Gigabyte Eagle OC model for $599.99 at Newegg, which is $100 above NVIDIA's reference pricing.

Nvidia has indeed announced it's moving over to an open-source Linux GPU kernel for its latest and greatest graphics cards. Previously open-source GPU anything was the sole preserve of AMD, but as of right now you can go to GitHub and download the source code for Nvidia's kernel modules on the Nvidia Open GPU Kernel Modules repo.The green team is calling this \"a significant step toward improving the experience of using NVIDIA GPUs in Linux, for tighter integration with the OS and for developers to debug, integrate, and contribute back.\" And, as someone who has bounced off various Linux distros hard in the past, I'm going to join in with the chorus of folk saying that it's about time.\u00a0Mainly I struggled in the past because I couldn't get my modern Nvidia graphics cards playing nice with such exotic things as a desktop environment or a multi-monitor setup. Let alone actually playing games. With this recent change, however, it means developers and distro providers will be more able to tightly integrate driver support into their software.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nIt's time for me to admit that AI-accelerated frame generation might actually be the way of the future and that's a good thing\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's latest 572.16 driver isn't just for the RTX 50-series, as 20, 30 and 40-series cards are also gifted with significant updates\n\n\n\nPreviously it was a bit of a crapshoot.You had to go with Nvidia's proprietary drivers, which had a one-size-fits-all approach to distro support, where it most certainly did not. Y'know, fit all.So, is this the Nvidia panacea to gaming on Linux? I spoke with Jonni Bidwell, technical editor of premier Linux publication, Linux Format, about why this has happened and what this announcement will actually mean for the end user.\"It's a good start certainly,\" he tells me. \"They have a huge range of hardware (much of the older stuff is now only supported via the reverse-engineered Nouveau driver) and they've chosen to open-source bits for new models. I'd say they've done this because lots of machine learning stuff is already geared towards Nvidia and CUDA. (Leela chess zero, the open-source chess neural network, for example, doesn't work awesomely with AMD and OpenCL).The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\"Having an entirely open stack is easier to debug and develop for. And hopefully no more not having graphics after a kernel update because something broke.\"(Image credit: Future)Will this mean with better Nvidia driver support we get higher performance in games? Sadly, probably not, at least not straight away.\"They say the drivers are 'alpha quality' for end users at the mo,\" says Bidwell. \"But the move will surely help gaming to some extent, though I doubt 'open' will immediately translate into 'moar fps'. Again it just means game devs don't have to hack around drivers so much, and it will be easier for wannabe driver developers to do the converse.\"The modules haven't been accepted into the kernel yet, and there likely will be some back and forth with that. Once they're in, it'll take a wee while before they're picked up by mainstream distributions.\"Steam in your hands(Image credit: Future, FromSoftware)Steam Deck review: Our verdict on Valve's handheld PC.\nSteam Deck availability: How to get one.\nSteam Deck battery life: What's the real battery life of the new device?\nHow loud is the Steam Deck? And will it pass the Significant Other test?\nSteam Deck - The emulation dream machine: Using Valve's handheld hardware as the ultimate emulator.Aside from the increased importance of machine learning, and the fact that Linux is prevalent in the data center and supercomputer environments, Nvidia going open is also going to be at least partly down to the competition.\"Nvidia has always been a black sheep for Linux,\" says Bidwell, \"as by this stage theirs is really the only proprietary driver that regular users have to deal with. And generally, they don't enjoy it. So it's as much about gaining parity with AMD's open driver strategy. Which was likewise glorious news when it was announced.\"This is indeed a significant moment in the cause of Linux, and for gaming on Linux. This year may not exactly be the 'Year of Linux Gaming' as a genuine alternative to Windows, but with Nvidia opening up, the success of the Steam Deck, and the potential of Valve's SteamOS 3.0 and its Proton tech, things are certainly looking more possible in that regard.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDave JamesSocial Links NavigationEditor-in-Chief, HardwareDave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the Colecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!).

He first started writing for Official PlayStation Magazine and Xbox World many decades ago, then moved onto PC Format\u00a0full-time, then PC Gamer, TechRadar, and T3 among others.

GPU-accelerated systems have become a mainstay not just in scientific computing, but edge computing, data centers and cloud systems.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Rev Lebaredian, vice president for Omniverse and simulation technology, speaking at ISC 2022.\nAnd AI-accelerated GPU computing has also become a cornerstone of modern high-performance computing. That\u2019s positioned supercomputing to realize the original intent of computer graphics: simulation.\nComputers, algorithms and AI have all matured enough that we can begin simulating worlds that are complex enough to be useful on an industrial scale, even using these simulations as training grounds for AI.\nWorld Simulation at an Inflection Point\nWith digital twins, a new class of simulation is possible, Lebaredian said.\nThese require precision timing \u2014 the ability to simulate multiple autonomous systems at the same time.\nThey require physically accurate simulation.\nAnd they require accurate ingestion of information from the \u201creal twin,\u201d and continuous synchronization.\nThese digital twin simulations will give us \u201csuperpowers.\u201d\nThe first one Lebaradian dug into was teleportation. \u201cJust like in a multiplayer video game any human anywhere on earth can teleport into that virtual world,\u201d Lebaradian said.\nThe next: time travel.\n\u201cIf you record the state of the world over time, you can recall it at any point, this allows time travel,\u201d Lebaradian said.\n\u201cYou can not only now teleport to that world, but you can scrub your timeline and go backwards to any point in time, and explore that space at any point in time,\u201d he added.\nAnd, finally, these simulations, if accurate enough, will let us understand what\u2019s next.\n\u201cIf you have a simulator that is extremely accurate and actually predictive of what will happen in the future if you understand the laws of physics well enough you essentially get time travel to the future,\u201d Lebaredian said.\n\u201cYou can compute not just one possible future, but many possible futures,\u201d he added, outlining how this could let city planners see what could happen as they modify a city, plan the road and change the traffic systems to find \u201cthe best possible future.\u201d\nModern supercomputing is unlocking these digital twins, which are extremely compute-intensive and require precision timing networking with extremely low latency.\n\u201cWe need a new kind of supercomputer, one that can really accelerate artificial intelligence and run these massive simulations in true real-time,\u201d Lebaradian said.\nThat will require GPU-accelerated systems that are optimized at every layer of the system to enable precision timing.\nThese systems will need to run not just on the data center, but reach the edge of networks to bring data into virtual simulations with precision timing.\nSuch systems will be key to advances on scales both small \u2014 such as drug discovery, and large \u2014 such as climate simulation.\n\u201cWe need to simulate our climate we need to look really far out, we need to do so at a precision that\u2019s never been done before, and we need to be able to trust our simulations are actually predictive and accurate, if we do that we have some hope we can deal with this climate change situation,\u201d Lebaradian said.\nBMW\u2019s iFACTORY: \u201cLean, Green and Digital\u201d\nBMW\u2019s Melchiorre provided an example of how this broad vision is being put to work today at BMW, as the automaker seeks to become \u201clean, green and digital.\u201d\nMichelle Melchiorre, senior vice president for product system, technical planning, and tool shop at BMW Group.\nBMW has built exceptionally complex digital twins, simulating its factories with humans and robots interacting in the same space, at the same time.\nIt\u2019s an effort that stretches from the factory floor to the company\u2019s data center, to its entire supply chain. This digital twin involves millions of moving parts and pieces that are connected to an enormous supply chain.\nMelchiorre walked his audience through a number of examples of how digital twins simulate various pieces of the plant, simulating how industrial machinery, robots, and people will move together.\nInside the digital twin of BMW\u2019s assembly system, powered by Omniverse, an entire factory in simulation.\nAnd he explained how they are leveraging NVIDIA technology to simulate entire factories before they\u2019re even built.\nMelchiorre showed an aerial image of the site where BMW is building a new factory in Hungary. While the real-world factory is still mostly open field, the digital factory is 80% complete.\n\u201cThis will be the first plant where we will have a complete digital twin much before production starts,\u201d Melchiorre said.\nIn the future, the iFACTORY will be real in all of BMW\u2019s plants, Melchiorre explained, from BMW\u2019s 100-year-old home plant in Munich to its forthcoming plant in Debrecen, Hungary.\u200b\n\u201cThis is our production network, not just one factory \u2013 each and every plant will go in this direction, every plant will develop into a BMW iFACTORY, this is our master plan for our future,\u201d Melchiorre said.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | SupercomputingTags: GPU | High-Performance Computing | Industrial and Manufacturing | Omniverse | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With that said, AMD did attempt to reignite the GPU segment with its Navi 24 powered Radeon RX 6500/6400 series graphics cards but with a largely lackluster feature set, they were met with lots of criticism. NVIDIA has also tried to release its own entry-level solutions within the GeForce 16 series family but those are getting old now. Based on new reports, it looks like NVIDIA is finally going to offer a successor to its GT 1030 graphics card, the GeForce GTX 1630.\nRelated Story Watch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For UnveilingWe don't have the exact specifications of this card yet but based on Videocardz information and what we have managed to learn from our own sources. the card will be positioned against the entry-level Navi 24 lineup and offer performance close to the GeForce GTX 1650. This should be a tad bit faster than the AMD Radeon RX 6400 graphics card. Obviously, you won't get the same performance level as the RTX 3050 which starts at $249 US (MSRP) but it looks like NVIDIA might be considering a $150 US pricing for the new variant considering the GTX 1650 already retails for $190 US.\n\nIn terms of specifications, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1630 might still rock the Turing TU117 GPU with 4 GB of memory running across a 128-bit bus interface. We can't say for sure if this card will still be equipped with GDDR6 or GDDR5 memory since the most entry-level GTX 1650 SKU features GDDR5 memory.\nThe GeForce GTX 1630 will also come with a sub-75W TDP and will not feature any dedicated ray-tracing or DLSS support. However, NVIDIA has enabled ray-tracing for non-RT core GPUs but the performance won't be anywhere near playable even on the lowest resolution possible. If priced right, the GeForce GTX 1630 can become a popular eSports card for E-cafes around the South Asian and Asian Pacific regions. There's no word on the launch date but it could be a silent launch and we might end up seeing some models at Computex 2022.\nNVIDIA GeForce 16 Series Specifications\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 2060 FEGeForce GTX 1660 Ti 6GB\nGeForce GTX 1660 SUPER 6GB\nGeForce GTX 1660 6GB\nGeForce GTX 1650 SUPER 4 GBGeForce GTX 1650 4 GBGeForce GTX 1630 4 GB\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture (GPU)\nTU106TU116-400TU116-300TU116-300TU116TU117\nTU106TU117\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n19201536 140814081280896512\n\n\nTensor Cores\n240N / AN / AN / AN / AN / AN / A\n\n\nRT cores\n30N / AN / AN / AN / AN / AN / A\n\n\nTexture Units\n120 96 8888805632\n\n\nROPs\n48484848323232\n\n\nBase Clock\n1365 MHz1500 MHz1530 MHz1530 MHzTBD1485 MHzTBD\n\n\nGPU Boost\n1680 MHz1770 MHz1785 MHz1785 MHzTBD1665 MHz1800 MHz\n\n\nMemory\n6GB GDDR66GB GDDR66GB GDDR66GB GDDR54GB GDDR54GB GDDR54GB GDDR6?\n\n\nMemory Bus\n192-bit192-bit192-bit192-bit128-bit128-bit64-bit\n\n\nMemory Clocks\n14 Gbps12 Gbps14 Gbps8 Gbps12 Gbps8 Gbps12\n\n\nL2 cache\n3 MB1.5 MB1.5 MB1.5 MB1.5 MB1.5 MB1.5 MB\n\n\nTDP\n160 W120W125W120W100W75W>75W\n\n\nTransistors\n10.8 billion6.6 billion6.6 billion6.6 billion6.6 billion4.7 billion4.7 billion\n\n\nDie Size\n445 mm\u00b2284mm2284mm2284mm2284mm2200mm2200mm2\n\n\nPrice\n$349$279$229$229$159$149$119?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n62\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n51\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n44\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n37\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n31\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

One feature to take advantage of those cores was DLSS, mainly to alleviate the performance drop when enabling ray tracing without losing much in terms of image quality.\nNot to be confused with DLSS, Nvidia's latest addition to their arsenal of AI-assisted features is called DLDSR, which stands for Deep Learning Dynamic Super Resolution.\nWhat's DLDSR?\nDLDSR is a method of supersampling aiming to improve over the older DSR (Dynamic Super Resolution). It renders supported games at a higher resolution than your monitor's native resolution, then shrinks the image to fit within the monitor's native output. This results in superior image quality with less flickering and better anti-aliasing.\nDLSS vs DLDSR: Upscale vs Downscale\nBoth DLSS and DLDSR use the Tensor cores in RTX GPUs, but each one tries to achieve something different. On the one hand DLSS renders at a lower resolution than native in order to gain performance and then upscales the image to the monitor's native with the Tensor cores helping to preserve some, if not all, of the native image quality.\nDLDSR does the opposite and downscales a higher resolution image, so it is best used when you have excess GPU power and want to improve on the eye candy.\n\nThis may be the case in older games, like Starcraft, which are not very demanding and more often than not have mediocre anti-aliasing solutions. Other usage scenario includes games that may not be the latest AAA ones but you would not call them old either, that have great performance on a wide variety of GPUs combined with nice visuals like Arkane's PREY or Capcom's Resident Evil Remake series. Games like these are ideal because their slow paced nature means that you pay attention to every detail, from texture quality to lighting and shadows, so DLDSR can help these graphical features stand out even more. You will mostly likely want to use it on a 1080p monitor as with anything higher than that the render resolution will end up being extremely high requiring massive amounts of GPU power as a result.\nAlso, it's best used with single-player games where frame rate is not of such an importance as with multi-player ones. You can for example aim for 60 fps and use DLDSR to improve image quality as much as your system resources allow. In general, depending on your GPU and monitor combo whenever there is substantial headroom above the 60fps, that is considered the base for smooth gaming, you can take advantage of that excess GPU power and put it into DLDSR. Also note that DLDSR works in every game whereas DLSS requires a game-specific implementation from the developers.\nWhere Does Deep Learning Come In?\nDSR and DLDSR are essentially the same up until the point where they render at a higher resolution but the similarities end there. While DSR applies \"a high-quality (Gaussian) filter\" as per Nvidia, to make the higher resolution image fit within the monitor, DLDSR uses some sort of machine learning filter for this task. This way, DLDSR manages to address a fundamental issue with DSR, which is uneven scaling. To better explain this we need to take a look first at how to enable DSR and DLDSR.\nHow Do I Enable It?\nDSR can be used with Nvidia GTX 700 series or newer, while DLDSR requires a GeForce RTX GPU. Open the Nvidia Control Panel and follow the steps as shown below.\nHere you will find various DSR Factors that are essentially multipliers of your monitor's native resolution. Each one represents a new resolution which you then need to apply in the game settings.\n\nThe first two factors use Deep Learning and are only available for RTX graphics cards, with the rest using the older DSR going up to 4x. Keep in mind that you can select either a DL scaling factor or the corresponding one from legacy scaling, but not both.\nUneven Scaling\nNow, here's the catch. DSR works best when the rendering is done at a resolution that is an integer factor of the monitor's native. When using a 1080p monitor, 4x DSR-Factors is ideal as each pixel of the 1920x1080 grid is produced based on information from a set of 4 pixels of the 4K DSR rendered image. But this as you can imagine requires a powerful enough GPU in the first place to be able to render 4K at a playable framerate. Failing to use an integer factor for DSR causes image artifacts and poor edge anti-aliasing.\nIn order to counter this Nvidia have implemented a DSR-Smoothness slider (you can find it underneath the DSR-Factors in the image above) to control the intensity of the Gaussian filter that is used. Increasing the amount of smoothness makes those image artifacts less noticeable at the cost of a blurrier image overall.\nOn the other hand, the machine learning filter used by DLDSR, does not suffer from the uneven scaling issue when using non-integer factors, like 1.78x and 2.25x, and it also seems to fare better as regards to anti-aliasing.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to showcase the final output of this with screenshots as every method we tried (Nvidia Ansel, in-game photographer mode, or just plain old Windows print screen) captures the image before the filtering process is applied. So every screenshot would look the same regardless of DSR or DLDSR. Feel free to try it for yourself if you wish to.\nWe can tell you however that DLDSR seems to be the better option already, but there is a little caveat.\nThe ML filter produces an over-sharpened image, which may not be a great deal to everyone, but should you want you can play around with the smoothness slider to tone down the intensity of the sharpening.\nPerformance Comparison and Visuals\nFor comparing performance between the various DSR and DLDSR factors we used a Windows 10 machine, an RTX 2060 paired with a Ryzen 5600X and 16GB of DDR4 RAM running at 3200 MT/s with CAS latency of 14 at XMP timings. Performance metrics were done using the integrated benchmark of Shadow of the Tomb Raider in the highest preset and the results are as follows.\n\nAs you can see, there's a significant performance drop over native 1080p when using DSR and DLDSR which is expected as it renders the game at a much higher resolution.\nBut, notice the small difference between DSR and DLDSR at the same render resolution, which can be explained by the processing overhead the Tensor cores introduce.\nNow what's interesting is Nvidia's claim that \"the image quality of DLDSR 2.25X is comparable to that of DSR 4X, but with higher performance.\" The performance part is definitely accurate, let's see if the quality claim holds water as well.\n\nAbove is a screenshot of Bethesda's Prey taken from Nvidia's marketing material. Pay closer attention to vertical and horizontal lines, for example at the supporting wires for the ceiling elements in the background.\n1620p DLDSR manages to recreate them much better than the native 1080p resolution and it also comes very close to the 4K DSR representation with a hefty boost in performance as well.\nNotice that based on this, 1080p and 1620p DLDSR seem to be performing the same, but this most likely happens because we are looking at a CPU bottleneck scenario. On a purely GPU bound situation we have seen that's not the case.\nUsing DLDSR and DLSS together\nWhen a game supports DLSS a good idea would be to use it alongside DLDSR to reclaim some of the performance loss while still keeping better image quality than native.\nDLDSR essentially forces DLSS to use a higher base resolution, as DLSS uses a fraction of the game's render resolution, producing a cleaner image as a result. You also take advantage of better anti-aliasing DLSS sometimes has, especially in cases where the game's TAA implementation is not so great.\nDLDSR vs Resolution Scaling\nSome games offer a resolution scaling or image scaling slider in their graphics settings menu as a additional method of anti-aliasing. Essentially it lets you determine a percentage of your native resolution (e.g. 125% or 150%) at which the rendering will be performed and then the image will be downscaled the same way we discussed above.\nResolution scaling differs from DLDSR as it is an in-game solution, rather than something that works at the driver/hardware level and it would potentially suffer from the same issues DSR does as it does not utilize any neural network to assist with the scaling filtering.\nIn general, DLDSR is preferable, but depending on the game engine and how it is implemented image scaling may fare better for a particular game, so you can play around with both and decide for yourself.\nPotential Issues\nDepending on the game, you may encounter a few issues when using DLDSR. In some cases the image is not scaled down correctly and you end up with the game screen being too large to fit within your monitor.\nA workaround would be to change on which device the scaling is performed on, from the monitor which is the default option, to the GPU and also use the checkbox underneath to make sure all programs use this exact scaling mode.\n\nThe problem with this workaround is that it sometimes breaks other games which behave correctly with scaling performed on the monitor. There is not much to do about it rather than change the scaling mode back and forth every time, depending on the game you are playing.\nAnother issue you may come across when using DLDSR in a variable refresh rate monitor, is that the G-Sync functionality stops working. You can solve it by going to Nvidia Control Panel and enable G-Sync for windowed and full screen mode.\n\nA little tip to make sure that G-Sync works as it should is to enable the framerate counter from the monitor's on-screen-display and check that it changes according to the game's framerate.\nThis shows the true refresh rate of the monitor while tools like RTSS only report the GPU's frame rate output. Lastly, DLDSR will make any kind of overlay (e.g. RTSS, Nvidia Frameview, Steam's overlay, etc) appear smaller than when using native resolution as they get scaled down, too. Keep in mind that your mileage may vary depending on the game you are playing and the monitor you are using and you may or may not encounter all of the issues mentioned above.\nNvidia DLDSR is yet another feature modern GPUs offer to make your gaming experience a little bit more enjoyable. Taking into account the findings when comparing ultra graphics preset versus high, it may be preferable to settle for lower than ultra settings and use the excess GPU performance headroom to give a boost to the render resolution as that will likely result in more noticeable image quality improvements, clarity and anti-aliasing. If you own a supported graphics card give DLDSR a chance and you may be impressed by the results.\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 17\n\n\n Got something to say?

Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorMay 30, 2022, 12:48pm EDTSave ArticleThis article is more than 2 years old.\n\nTwo industry events have provided the stage for NVIDIA to share their plans for a proprietary Arm CPU based product line that we believe will transform their own business and the AI/HPC industry landscape. NVIDIA used the annual Computex and International Super Computing (ISC) to stress that 1) the Grace \u201cSuperChip\u201d Arm CPU (due in 2023) represents a strategic thrust for the company, and 2) NVIDIA is not going to abandon its server partners while it transforms its business from providing GPU chips to delivering integrated systems that include CPUs, GPUs, and DPUs.\n\n\nAlong the way, NVIDIA shared its view of market opportunity sizing. Investors should note that NVIDIA is now projecting a $150B 2030 market in AI and HPC, $150B in \u201cDigital Twins\u201d (think Omniverse), and $100B in cloud-based gaming. Let that sink in. That is nearly a half trillion dollars of new business that NVIDIA and its competitors are chasing.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\nComputex: NVIDIA still loves their Server Partners\n\nWhen NVIDIA announced its intention to build its own Arm-based CPUs, many didn't fully comprehend the strategic intent CEO Jensen Huang has in mind. Accelerated computing is facing a memory problem. Getting data to and from storage over the network to a CPU then to an accelerator over relatively slow PCIe is a bottleneck. And moving instead of sharing data incurs capital and energy costs. Consequently, NVIDIA is building a three-chip future of CPUs, GPUs, and Bluefield NPUs that all share access to memory. Sounds geeky, but this is an approach that AMD and Intel are also pursuing, with supercomputers at Argon and Oakridge National Labs.NVIDIA disclosed a three-year roadmap for GPUs, CPUs, and DPUs at Computex this week.NVIDIA\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nSo, what will be the role OEMs and ODMs play in a world where NVIDIA designs and delivers complete systems, sans memory, sheet metal, fans, IO and power supplies? NVIDIA is extending its HGX model to ensure these important channel partners do not get left out. At Computex, NVIDIA announced new Grace-Hopper reference designs to enable fast time-to-market when Grace appears in volume in early 2023. And Taiwan\u2019s ODM community is prepared to adopt the first Grace powered system designs in two modes: dual Grace CPUs and Grace-Hopper accelerated systems.\nNVIDIA is developing two new products that will bring the Arm Grace CPU to data centers: the CPU+GPU ... [+] and the dual CPU Superchip.NVIDIA\n\n\nThe four new Grace-based reference designs will lower the cost and accelerate time to market for partners wanting to deliver state-of-the-art performance servers for HPC, AI, and cloud-based gaming & visualization. In addition, NVIDIA announced liquid cooled A100 and H100 GPU\u2019s that can lower power consumption by 30% and rack space by over 60%.There will be four flavors of reference designs for NVIDIA's partners to build into high-performance ... [+] servers.NVIDIA\nFinally, NVIDIA announced a slew of NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin edge servers at Computex, with strong adoption by Taiwanese ODMs. We note, however, that the large server vendors such as Dell, HPE, and Lenovo seemed left out of the party of data center and edge servers, but this is probably due to their rigorous testing cycles and conservative announcement policies.Jetson OrinNVIDIA\nAt ISC its all about Grace and Hopper with a sprinkling of Omniverse in HPC\nNVIDIA is facing increasing challenges from AMD and Intel, who won all three USA-based DOE Exascale supercomputer projects totaling over $1.5B in US government funding. In fact, the Frontier Supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Labs (ORNL) was announced at ISC this week at the #1 spot in the TOP500, with just over 1 Exaflop of performance based on AMD CPUs and GPUs with HPE Cray networking. While schedule issues have delayed Intel\u2019s crossing the Exascale finish line, HPE is busy installing the Ponte Vecchio / Xeon based exascale system at DOE\u2019s Argonne National Labs.\nNVIDIA is clearly intent on regaining its crown, lost at ORNL, with Grace-Hopper integrated systems. Having previously announced CSC\u2019s ALPS Grace-based system with 20 Exaflops of AI performance, NVIDIA announced \u201cVENADO\u201d at ISC, a 10 Exaflop (again, in AI performance) system using the Grace-Hopper Superchip to be installed at Los Alamos National Labs. Note that the TOP500 list does not measure \u201cAI Performance\u201d which is based on lower precision floating point, and NVIDIA has not yet disclosed the double-precision performance of either of its Grace wins.Los Alamos' Venado will the the first Grace-based supercomputer in the USA.NVIDIA\nNVIDIA also announced collaboration with the University of Manchester, using Omniverse to create the digital twin to model the operation of a fusion reactor. This is a classic use case example of Omniverse, which enables collaboration of engineers and scientists using 3D graphics to explore the behavior of complex systems in a virtual world to speed development and ensure design quality.\nThe UK AEA is using Omniverse to accelerate the development of a Fusion reactor.NVIDIA\nConclusions\nNVIDIA is well on its way to transform the company from a provider of high performance GPUs to a designer of high performance data centers for HPC and AI. This weeks announcements should alleviate any concerns customers may have that their trusted infrastructure providers would be relegated to a lower class of technology. We still await full performance data at scale for Grace-Hopper systems, but we are likely to get a glimpse of more data at the annual SuperComputing conference in November.\nEqually important is the monetization of NVIDIA\u2019s software arsenal in both AI and metaverse. The company highlighted a few factors here in the earnings call last week, pointing to software as a catalyst for increasing margins and revenue, projecting $150B in market potential for Digital Twins.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Disclosures: This article expresses the opinions of the author, and is not to be taken as advice to purchase from nor invest in the companies mentioned.

Being offered as an alterative to the traditional dual-slot air cooled cards, the liquid cooled cards come in a more compact single-slot form factor for both improved cooling and improved density. The liquid cooled A100 will be available in Q3, and a liquid cooled H100 will be available early next year.\nWhile liquid cooling is far from new in the datacenter, it\u2019s typically been reserved for more bespoke hardware with extreme cooling and/or density requirements, such as the upcoming generation of high-end NVIDIA H100 (SMX) servers. PCIe servers, by contrast, are all about standardization and compatibility. Which for server video cards/accelerators means dual slot cards designed for use with forced air cooling within a server chassis. This serves the market segment well, but the 300 to 350 Watt TDPs of these cards means that they can\u2019t get any thinner and still be effectively cooled by air \u2013 which in turn creates a 4 card limit for standard rackmount systems.\nBut times are changing, and liquid cooling is being implemented in datacenters in greater capacities both to keep up with cooling ever-hotter hardware, and to improve overall datacenter energy efficiency. To that end, NVIDIA will be releasing liquid cooled versions of their A100 and H100 PCIe cards in order to give datacenter customers an easy and officially supported path to installing liquid cooled PCIe accelerators within their facilities.\nThe cards (pictured above) are essentially a reference A100/H100 with the traditional dual-slot heatsink replaced with a single-slot full coverage water block. Designed to be integrated by server vendors, they use an open loop design that is meant to be used as part of a larger liquid cooling setup.\n\nBut other than changing the cooling system, the specifications of the cards remain unchanged. NVIDIA isn\u2019t increasing the TDPs or clockspeeds on these cards, so their performance should be identical to traditional air cooled cards (so long as they\u2019re not thermally throttling, of course). Put another way, these new cards are using liquid cooling to improve energy efficiency and density, rather than performance.\nThe first card out of the gate will be the liquid cooled version of the 80GB A100 PCIe accelerator. That will be available to customers in Q3 of this year. Meanwhile a liquid cooled version of the H100 PCIe is also under development, and NVIDIA expects that to be available in early 2023.\n\nIn the interim, NVIDIA has been working with Equinix in order to qualify the liquid cooled A100 within their datacenters, as well as to get an idea of the real-world power savings of the new hardware. Interestingly, NVIDIA is reporting a significant reduction in overall datacenter power usage from switching to liquid cooling \u2013 a 2000 server (4000 A100 card) setup saw its total power needs drop by 28%. According to NVIDIA, this is from a combination of overall power savings across the datacenter from the switch, including everything from improved video card energy efficiency from lower temperatures, to reduced energy needs from cooling water versus running large air chillers. All of which underscores why NVIDIA is promoting liquid cooled hardware as a power efficiency gain for datacenter operators who are looking to trim power usage.\nAnd while this first generation of liquid cooled hardware is focused on efficiency, according to NVIDIA that won\u2019t always be the case. For future generations of cards the company will also be looking at liquid cooling to improve performance at current energy levels \u2013 presumably by investing the datacenter-scale gains back into higher TDPs for the cards.\nFinally, while the bulk of NVIDIA\u2019s announcement today (as well as the case study) is focused on PCIe cards, NVIDIA is also revealing that they\u2019ve been working on official, liquid cooled designs for their HGX systems as well, which are used to house the company\u2019s more powerful SMX cards. A liquid cooled HGX A100 is already shipping, and a liquid cooled HGX H100 is slated to be released in Q4.\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n1 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nDolda2000 - Tuesday, May 24, 2022 - link\nLol, I guess IBM was leading the pack with liquid-cooled equipment after all. :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

The graphics card will be replacing the RTX 3080, a very popular gaming graphics card on its own.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Graphics Card - Purely Designed For Enthusiast Gamers\n[Launched- 16/11/22]\n[Our Review]\nWhile there's no denying the enthusiasm around the higher-end GeForce RTX 4090 series graphics cards that offer the best of the best gaming performance, the RTX 4080 series graphics cards are the tier that most high-end gamers will be getting considering it doesn't break your wallet and still offers a huge amount of gaming performance. It's simple, the RTX 4090 series will be aimed at users who want the best of the best without worrying about the amount of money they are spending while the RTX 4080 series is aimed at users who want the best gaming performance at the best possible price.\nThe previous GeForce RTX 3080 was touted to offer a huge improvement over the RTX 2080 and while that claim fell a little short, it looks like the RTX 4080 has the potential to exceed far beyond its predecessor due to several reasons which will be apparent in this roundup detailing its specs & performance figures.\n\nWe should expect similar things with the next-generation gaming powerhouse too but an important factor to consider is that GPUs are becoming more power-hungry and more pricey. It is a trend that might continue into the future as we get better products but in return, there's always a cost to pay for end consumers. So starting with what we know so far, first we should take a look at the brand new Ada Lovelace or AD10* class GPUs that will be powering the next-gen GeForce RTX 40 series cards.\nYou can also read the expected specs, prices, and performance of other upcoming RTX 40 GPUs in the posts below:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Series\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Series\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Series\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 Series\n\nNVIDIA's AD103 'Ada Lovelace' GPU - The Next-Gen Powerhouse\nStarting with the GPU configuration, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 series graphics cards are said to utilize the AD103 GPU core. Think of AD103 as an optimized version of AD102 that sits between the AD102 and AD104 GPUs. The GPU is said to measure around 400mm2-450mm2 and will utilize the TSMC 4N process node which is an optimized version of TSMC's 5nm (N5) node designed for the green team.\n\nThe NVIDIA Ada Lovelace AD103 GPU is expected to feature up to 7 GPC (Graphics Processing Clusters). This is the same GPC count as the Ampere GA102 GPU and one additional GPC over the GA103 GPU. Each GPU will consist of 6 TPCs and 2 SMs which is the same configuration as the existing chip. Each SM (Streaming Multiprocessor) will house four sub-cores which is also the same as the GA102 GPU. What's changed is the FP32 & the INT32 core configuration. Each sub-core will include 128 FP32 units but combined FP32+INT32 units will go up to 192. This is because the FP32 units don't share the same sub-core as the IN32 units. The 128 FP32 cores are separate from the 64 INT32 cores.\nSo in total, each sub-core will consist of 32 FP32 plus 16 INT32 units for a total of 48 units. Each SM will have a total of 128 FP32 units plus 64 INT32 units for a total of 192 units. And since there are a total of 84 SM units (12 per GPC), we are looking at 10,752 FP32 Units and 5,376 INT32 units for a total of 18,432 cores. Each SM will also include two Wrap Schedules (32 thread/CLK) for 64 wraps per SM. This is a 50% increase on the cores (FP32+INT32) and a 33% increase in Wraps/Threads vs the GA102 GPU.\nNVIDIA AD103 'Ada Lovelace' Gaming GPU Block Diagram:\n\nNVIDIA Ada Lovelace 'AD103' GPU Specs 'Preliminary':\n\n\n\nGPU NameAD103GA102GA103TU102\n\n\n\n\nGPC7 (Per GPU)Same1.16x1.16x\n\n\nTPC6 (Per GPC)Same1.20xSame\n\n\nSM2 (Per TPC)SameSameSame\n\n\nSub-Core4 (Per SM)SameSameSame\n\n\nFP32128 (Per SM)SameSame2x\n\n\nFP32+INT32192 (Per SM)1.5x1.5x1.5x\n\n\nWarps64 (Per SM)1.33x1.33x2x\n\n\nThreads2048 (Per SM)1.33x1.33x2x\n\n\nL1 Cache192 KB (Per SM)1.5x1.5x2x\n\n\nL2 Cache64 MB (Per GPU)10.6x16x10.6x\n\n\nROPs32 (Per GPC)2x2x2x\n\n\n\nMoving over to the cache, this is another segment where NVIDIA has given a big boost over the existing Ampere GPUs. The Ada Lovelace GPUs will pack 192 KB of L1 cache per SM, an increase of 50% over Ampere. That's a total of 2.5 MB of L1 cache on the top AD103 GPU. The L2 cache will be increased to 64 MB as mentioned in the leaks. This is a 10.6x increase over the Ampere GA102 GPU that hosts just 6 MB of L2 cache. The cache will be shared across the GPU.\nFinally, we have the ROPs which are also increased to 32 per GPC, an increase of 2x over Ampere. You are looking at up to 112 ROPs. There are also going to be the latest 4th Generation Tensor and 3rd Generation RT (Raytracing) cores infused on the Ada Lovelace GPUs which will help boost DLSS & Raytracing performance to the next level. Overall, the Ada Lovelace AD103 GPU will offer (versus the GA103 GPU):\n\n16.6% More GPCs (Versus Ampere)\n40% More Cores (Versus Ampere)\n50% More L1 Cache (Versus Ampere)\n16x More L2 Cache (Versus Ampere)\n16.6% More ROPs (Versus Ampere)\n4th Gen Tensor & 3rd Gen RT Cores\n\nNVIDIA AD103 'Ada Lovelace' Gaming GPU 'SM' Block Diagram:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080\n\n49 TFLOPS of peak single-precision (FP32) performance\n98 TFLOPS of peak half-precision (FP16) performance\n390 Tensor TFLOPS\n780 Tensor TFLOPs with sparsity\n113 RT-TFLOPs\n\nAt the heart of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 graphics card lies the Ada Lovelace AD103 GPU. The GPU measures 608,4mm2 and will utilize the TSMC 4N process node which is an optimized version of TSMC's 5nm (N5) node designed for the green team. The GPU features an insane 45.9 Billion transistors.\nNVIDIA Ada GPUs - AD102, AD103, AD104 For The First Wave of Gaming Cards\nNVIDIA is first introducing three brand new Ada GPUs which include the AD102, AD103 & AD104. The AD102 GPU is going to be featured on the GeForce RTX 4090, the AD103 is going to be used by the GeForce RTX 4080 16 GB graphics cards and the AD104 GPU is going to be featured on the GeForce RTX 4080 12 GB graphics cards.\nThe Ada GPUs are based on the TSMC 4N process node which is a custom process designed exclusively for NVIDIA. It is essentially an optimized version of the N5 (5nm) process, offering drastic increases in transistors, cores, and frequency. The top AD103 GPU packs 16% more cores and also offers 45.9 Billion transistors while offering over 2x the performance per watt.\nNVIDIA Ada AD103 GPU\nThe full AD103 GPU is made up of 7 graphics processing clusters with 12 SM units on each cluster. That makes up 84 SM units for a total of 10752 cores, 76 RT cores, 304Tensor Cores, 320 Texture Units, and a 256-bit bus interface in a 45.9 billion transistor package measuring 378.6mm2.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series Graphics Card Lineup (Rumored):\n\n\n\nGraphics CardGPUPCB VariantSM Units / CoresMemory / BusMemory Clock / BandwidthTBPPower ConnectorsLaunch\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Titan RTX ADAAD102-400?TBD144 / 18176?48 GB / 384-bit24 Gbps / 1.15 TB/s~800W2x 16-pinTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 TiAD102-400?TBD144 / 18176?24 GB / 384-bit24 Gbps / 1.15 TB/s~600W1x 16-pinTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 AD102-300PG136128 / 1638424 GB / 384-bit21 Gbps / 1.00 TB/s450W1x 16-pinQ4 2022\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080AD103-301/300PG139 SKU 36076 / 972816 GB / 256-bit23 Gbps / 716.8 GB/s320W1x 16-pinQ4 2022\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 TiAD104-400PG141 SKU 33160 / 768012 GB / 192-bit21 Gbps / 504.0 GB/s285W1x 16-pinQ1 2023\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070AD104-251/250PG141-SKU 345/344/34346 / 588812 GB / 192-bit21 Gbps / 504.0 GB/s200W1x 16-pin / 8-PinQ2 2023\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 TiAD106-350PG190 SKU 36134 / 43528 GB / 128-bit18 Gbps / 288.0 GB/s160-150W1x 16-pin / 8-PinQ2 2023\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060AD107-400PG173 SKU 37124 / 30728 GB / 128-bit18 Gbps / 288.0 GB/s115-110W1x 16-pin / 8-PinQ2 2023\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050AD107?TBDTBD6 GB / 96-bit?TBD100W1x 16-pin / 8-PinQ3 2023?\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Graphics Cards Specifications\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 will use 76 SMs of the 84 SMs for a total of 9728 CUDA cores. The GPU will come packed with 64 MB of L2 cache and a total of 112 ROPs which is simply insane. The clock speeds for the graphics card are rated at 2210 MHz base and 2510 MHz boost clocks and we have already seen over 3 GHz speeds with overclocking which you can read more about here.\nAs for memory specs, the GeForce RTX 4080 features 16 GB GDDR6X capacities that will be adjusted at 22.5 Gbps speeds across a 256-bit bus interface. This will provide up to 720 GB/s of bandwidth. This is still a tad bit slower than the 760 GB/s bandwidth offered by the RTX 3080 since it comes with a 320-bit interface but a lowly 10 GB capacity. To compensate for the lower bandwidth, NVIDIA could be integrating a next-gen memory compression suite to make up for the 256-bit interface.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 16 GB \"Official\" TBP -\u00a0320W\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 12 GB \"Official\" TBP -\u00a0350W\n\n\nAs far as the power consumption is concerned, the TBP is rated at 320W. The card will be powered by a single 16-pin connector which delivers up to 600W of power. Custom models will be offering higher TBP targets.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Graphics Cards Performance\nAs for the performance of these monster GPUs, NVIDIA shared the computational and gaming performance figures and it looks like the GeForce RTX 4080 will be sitting slightly ahead of the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti with around 50 TFLOPs of Compute power.\nJust for comparison's sake:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090: 83 TFLOPs (FP32) (2.5 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080: 49 TFLOPs (FP32) (2.5 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti: 49 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.86 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090: 36 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.69 GHz Boost clock)\n\nBased on a boost clock speed of 2.5 GHz, you get up to 49TFLOPs of compute performance and you can definitely squeeze out a lot more with an overclock as we had demonstrated with the RTX 4090. One should remember that compute performance doesn't necessarily indicate the overall gaming performance.

A hundred thousand of them to be exact.\nCardoso is a teacher, a CTO, an entrepreneur, a founding member of the MONAI open source consortium and a researcher in AI for medical imaging. In that last role, Cardoso and his team just discovered ways to create realistic, high resolution 3D images of human brains with AI.\nThe researcher at King\u2019s College London and CTO at the London AI Centre is making 100,000 synthetic brain images available free to healthcare researchers. It\u2019s a treasure trove that could accelerate understanding of dementia, aging or any sort of brain disease.\nAccelerating AI in Healthcare\n\u201cIn the past, many researchers avoided working in healthcare because they couldn\u2019t get enough good data, but now they can,\u201d said Cardoso.\n\u201cWe want to direct the energy of AI research into healthcare,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s a major donation compared to the world\u2019s largest repository of freely available brain images. The UK Biobank currently maintains multiple brain images taken from more than 50,000 participants, curated at an estimated cost of $150 million.\nSynthetic Data for Science\nThe images represent an emerging branch in healthcare of synthetic data, something that\u2019s already widely used in computer vision for consumer and business apps. Ironically, those fields also have access to open datasets with millions of real-world images.\nBy contrast, medical images are relatively scarce, typically only available to researchers connected to large hospitals, given the need to protect patient privacy. Even then, medical images tend to reflect the demographics the hospital serves, not necessarily the broader population.\nA fortunate feature of the new AI approach is it can make images to order. Female brains, male brains, old ones, young ones, brains with or without disease. Plug in what you need, and it creates them.\nThough they\u2019re simulated, the images are highly useful because they preserve key biological characteristics, so they look and act like real brains would.\nScaling with MONAI on Cambridge-1\nThe work required a supercomputer running super software.\nNVIDIA Cambridge-1, a supercomputer dedicated to breakthrough AI research in healthcare, was the engine. MONAI, an AI framework for medical imaging, provided the software fuel.\nTogether they created an AI factory for synthetic data that let researchers run hundreds of experiments, choose the best AI models and run inference to generate images.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done this work without Cambridge-1 and MONAI, it just wouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d Cardoso said.\nMassive Images, Up to 10x Speedups\nAn NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, Cambridge-1 packs 640 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, each with enough memory to process one or two of the team\u2019s massive images made up of 16 million 3D pixels.\nMONAI\u2019s building blocks include domain-specific data loaders, metrics, GPU accelerated transforms and an optimized workflow engine. The software\u2019s smart caching and multi-node scaling can accelerate jobs up to 10x, said Cardoso.\nHe also credited cuDNN and \u201cthe whole NVIDIA AI software stack that helped us work much faster.\u201d\nBeyond the Brain\nCardoso is working with Health Data Research UK, a national repository, to host the 100,000 brain images. The AI models will be available, too, so researchers can create whatever images they need.\nThere\u2019s more. The team is exploring how the models can make 3D images of any part of the human anatomy in any mode of medical imaging \u2014 MRIs, CAT or PET scans, you name it.\n\u201cIn fact, this technique can be applied to any volumetric image,\u201d he said, noting users may need to optimize the models for different types of images.\nMany Directions Ahead\nThe work points to many directions Cardoso described enthusiastically as if unloading the contents of multiple minds.\nSynthetic images will help researchers see how diseases evolve over time. Meanwhile his team is still exploring how to apply the work to body parts beyond the brain and what kinds of synthetic images (MRI, CAT, PET) are most useful.\nThe possibilities are exciting and, like his many roles, \u201cit can be a bit overwhelming,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many different things we can start thinking about now.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | NVIDIA in Europe | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With high-performance compute, the automaker can continuously iterate on sophisticated deep learning models, creating robust autonomous driving algorithms in a closed-loop environment.\n\u201cThe complex scenarios faced by mass-produced cars and the massive amount of data these fleets generate are the cornerstones of NIO\u2019s autonomous driving capabilities,\u201d said Yuli Bai, head of AI Platforms at NIO. \u201cBy using NVIDIA high-performance compute solutions, NIO can accelerate the path to autonomous driving.\u201d\nNIO has already launched intelligent vehicles developed on this infrastructure, such as its fully electric, intelligent flagship sedan, the ET7. Its mid-size performance sedan, the ET5 is scheduled to debut in September.\nIn addition to high-performance data center development, both models are built on the Adam supercomputer, powered by four NVIDIA DRIVE Orin systems-on-a-chip. These vehicles feature autonomous driving and intelligent cockpit capabilities that are continuously iterated upon and improved in the data center for a revolutionary customer experience.\nBuilding a High-Performance AI Infrastructure With NVIDIA GPUs and Networking\nThe role of the data center is to ingest, curate and label massive amounts of data for AI model training at scale.\nData collection fleets generate hundreds of petabytes of data and billions of images each year. This data is then used to optimize the deep neural networks (DNNs) that will run in the vehicles.\nNIO\u2019s scalable AI infrastructure is powered by NVIDIA HGX with eight A100 Tensor Core GPUs and NVIDIA ConnectX-6 InfiniBand adapters. This scalable supercomputer cluster consists of NVME SSD servers and interconnects through the high-speed NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand network platform.\nThis powerful infrastructure allows large amounts of deep learning training data to be transferred to supercomputer memory or NVIDIA A100 video memory at ultra-high speeds of up to 200Gbps.\nNVIDIA HGX A100 is a high-performance server platform designed for AI scenarios, including big datasets and complicated models like those that power autonomous vehicles. It incorporates a fully optimized NVIDIA AI software stack in NGC.\nThe platform sets a new compute density benchmark, condensing 5 petaflops of AI performance and replaces siloed infrastructures with a single platform for a wide range of complex AI applications.\nWith the HGX A100, NIO is able to flexibly develop and deploy scalable AI systems. It also enables the company to increase model development efficiency by up to 20x, allowing it to launch autonomous vehicles sooner and evolve to newer, faster architectures.\nForging Ahead\nNIO is already off to the races with its software-defined lineup, announcing plans to double the capacity of its plant in Hefei, China, to 240,000 vehicles per year, with a facility capable of producing up to 300,000.\nAs NIO scales production capabilities and continues its expansion into global markets, NVIDIA HGX is scaling with them, enabling the deployment of one of the most advanced AI platforms in the automotive industry.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Driving | NetworkingTags: Artificial Intelligence \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They will pioneer techniques in computational storage, pattern matching and more using BlueField and its NVIDIA DOCA software framework.\nAn Open API for DPUs\nThe efforts also will help further define OpenSNAPI, an application interface anyone can use to harness DPUs. It\u2019s a project of the Unified Communication Framework, a consortium enabling heterogeneous computing for HPC apps whose members include Arm, IBM, NVIDIA, U.S. national labs and U.S. universities.\nLANL is already feeling the power of in-network computing, thanks to a DPU-powered storage system it created.\nThe Accelerated Box of Flash (ABoF, pictured below) combines solid-state storage with DPU and InfiniBand accelerators to speed up performance-critical parts of a Linux file system. It\u2019s up to 30x faster than similar storage systems and set to become a key component in LANL\u2019s infrastructure.\nABoF places computation near storage to minimize data movement and improve the efficiency of both simulation and data-analysis pipelines, a researcher said in a recent LANL blog.\nTexas Rides a Cloud-Native Super\nThe Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) is the latest to adopt BlueField-2 in Dell PowerEdge servers. It will use the DPUs on an InfiniBand network to make its Lonestar6 system a development platform for cloud-native supercomputing.\nTACC\u2019s Lonestar6 serves a wide swath of HPC developers at Texas A&M University, Texas Tech University, and the University of North Texas, as well as a number of research centers and the faculty.\nMPI Gets Accelerated\nTwelve hundred miles to the northeast, researchers at Ohio State University showed how DPUs can make one of HPC\u2019s most popular programming models run up to 26 percent faster.\nBy offloading critical parts of the message passing interface (MPI), they accelerated P3DFFT, a library used in many large-scale HPC simulations.\n\u201cDPUs are like assistants that handle work for busy executives, and they will go mainstream because they can make all workloads run faster,\u201d said Dhabaleswar K. (DK) Panda, a professor of computer science and engineering at Ohio State who led the DPU work using his team\u2019s MVAPICH open source software.\nDPUs in HPC Centers, Clouds\nDouble-digit boosts are huge for supercomputers running HPC simulations like drug discovery or aircraft design. And cloud services can use such gains to increase their customers\u2019 productivity, said Panda, who\u2019s had requests from multiple HPC centers for his code.\nQuantum InfiniBand networks with features like NVIDIA SHARP help make his work possible.\n\u201cOthers are talking about in-network computing, but InfiniBand supports it today,\u201d he said.\nDurham Does Load Balancing\nMultiple research teams in Europe are accelerating MPI and other HPC workloads with BlueField DPUs.\nFor example, Durham University, in northern England, is developing software for load balancing MPI jobs using BlueField DPUs on a 16-node Dell PowerEdge cluster. Its work will pave the way for more efficient processing of better algorithms for HPC facilities around the world, said Tobias Weinzierl, principal investigator for the project.\nDPUs in Cambridge, Munich\nResearchers in Cambridge, London and Munich are also using DPUs.\nFor its part, University College London is exploring how to schedule tasks for a host system on BlueField-2 DPUs. It\u2019s a capability that could be used, for example, to move data between host processors so it\u2019s there when they need it.\nBlueField DPUs inside Dell PowerEdge servers in the Cambridge Service for Data Driven Discovery offload security policies, storage frameworks and other jobs from host CPUs, maximizing the system\u2019s performance.\nMeanwhile, researchers in the computer architecture and parallel systems group at the Technical University of Munich are seeking ways to offload both MPI and operating system tasks with DPUs as part of a EuroHPC project.\nBack in the U.S., researchers at Georgia Tech are collaborating with the Sandia National Laboratories to speed work in molecular dynamics using BlueField-2 DPUs. A paper describing their work so far shows algorithms can be accelerated by up to 20 percent with no loss in the accuracy of simulations.\nAn Expanding Network\nEarlier this month, researchers in Japan announced a system using the latest NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs riding our fastest and smartest network ever, the NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand platform.\nNEC will build the approximately 6 PFLOPS, H100-based supercomputer for the Center for Computational Sciences at the University of Tsukuba. Researchers will use it for climatology, astrophysics, big data, AI and more.\nMeanwhile, researchers like Panda are already thinking about how they\u2019ll use the cores in BlueField-3 DPUs.\n\u201cIt will be like hiring executive assistants with college degrees instead of ones with high school diplomas, so I\u2019m hopeful more and more offloading will get done,\u201d he quipped.\n\n\nCategories: NetworkingTags: Customer Stories | Events | High-Performance Computing | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | NVIDIA BlueField | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | NVIDIA in Europe | NVIDIA Quantum-2 | Science | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The report directly contradicts an earlier leak from reliable tipster Greymon55, who last month claimed that next-gen graphics cards from both AMD and Nvidia will likely launch in September. However, newer reports suggest that the launch of the Radeon RX 7000 series has been pushed back to Q4, 2022. \nBased on Nvidia's 'Ada Lovelace' architecture, the RTX 40-series cards will be upgraded over the RTX 30-series GPUs that form Nvidia's current graphics card lineup. The upcoming GPUs will compete with not only AMD's\u00a0forthcoming RX 7000-series cards but also Intel's Arc Alchemist GPUs,\u00a0which are also expected to launch later this summer.\nRelated: Is Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti Or Standard RTX 3090 The Better Buy?\nProlific tipster kopite7kimi has claimed that Nvidia's Ada Lovelace (RTX 40-series) graphics cards will come out in early Q3, 2022. That tweet on Sunday led many social media users and news outlets to speculate that the cards might appear at Gamescom in August or even later this month at Computex, which is all set to make a return this year following a two-year hiatus due to Covid. However, in another tweet earlier today, kopite7kimi specified that the cards would launch in mid-July, which means gamers will have just two more months to wait before finding out all about the new GPUs. There's no word yet on which cards in the RTX 40-series will launch first, but speculations suggest that Nvidia will initially release the high-end models, including the RTX 4090, RTX 4080 and RTX 4070, before rolling out the entry-level RTX 4060 and RTX 4050 SKUs. \n                        Nvidia's New GPUs Could Be Coming This Summer\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there's not a lot of information on the RTX 40 lineup, leaks in recent weeks have revealed a few tidbits about at least some of the cards in the upcoming lineup. For starters, persistent rumors in recent days have claimed that the RTX 4090 might be twice as fast as the RTX 3090. Earlier today, a new leak affirmed those rumors, even while stating that the new flagship could ship with only 126 streaming multiprocessors (SMs) enabled. The number is significantly lower than the 140-odd SMs that was expected previously. It also said that the card could have a 450W TDP, which is considerably lower than the 600W figure being touted previously.\nMeanwhile, a tweet from the same tipster late last month suggested that alongside the standard RTX 40-series products, Nvidia is also working on another AD102 SKU with 900W TGP and 48GB of GDDR6X memory clocked at 24Gbps. It will reportedly require twin 16pin PCIe connectors and have a higher frequency than the regular products. The tweet did not mention the card's name or whether it will even be commercially available, but online speculations suggest that if such an over-the-top card does exist, it will likely be marketed as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Ti.\nNext: Cryptominers Are Bypassing Nvidia's Anti-Mining Technology\nSource: kopite7kimi/Twitter (1, 2, 3) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nGPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tLilo & Stitch Animated Scenes the New Live-Action Trailer Recreates\n\t\t\n\n\nLilo and Stitch\n\nThe newest trailer for the live-action Lilo and Stitch movie has been released, and it recreates many scenes from the original animated Disney classic.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nBrian Scally\n\n\n1 hour ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tGeorge Clooney Has One Of The Best Broadway Bios I\u2019ve Ever Seen\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nKaila Hale-Stern\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Would Humans Do With Zombies In an Apocalypse?

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s initial next-gen GPU might be the RTX 4090, followed by the RTX 4080 and 4070, if the latest rumor is right.Actually, this isn\u2019t a fresh rumor as such, but a purported \u2018confirmation\u2019 from Kopite7kimi, a prolific hardware leaker on Twitter, meaning it\u2019s confirming info from their sources (of course, we have no official confirmation of anything yet, not even that Nvidia\u2019s next-gen Lovelace graphics cards will be the RTX 4000 family).Choose B. Confirmed.May 29, 2022Kopite7kimi tweeted in reply to 3D Center theorizing about Nvidia\u2019s possible staggered launch strategy for Lovelace GPUs, with two routes that Team Green is supposedly looking at taking: the RTX 4080, followed by the 4090, and then 4070, or the RTX 4090, followed by the 4080, then 4070. Kopite7kimi assured us the latter is the case.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nThe end of the Nvidia RTX 4000 series is nigh \u2013 with the RTX 4070 expected to sell out in weeks\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5080 GPU could sell out fast \u2013 and I\u2019m worried things might be even worse for the flagship RTX 5090\n\n\n\nAnalysis: Mind the GPU gaps\u2026As we mentioned, the idea that Nvidia\u2019s first Lovelace graphics card will be the RTX 4090 is nothing new. This rumor has been floating around for a while now, and we also recently heard about the RTX 4080 and 4070 following that flagship offering \u2013 so that all lines up with this new chatter from the grapevine.Our working theory as it stands is that the RTX 4090 could come out in September \u2013 Nvidia may pitch an initial reveal as early as July, mind, perhaps to run interference with Intel\u2019s Arc Alchemist desktop GPU launch \u2013 followed by the RTX 4080 and 4070 in November. Essentially, the expectation is the RTX 4090 will emerge and then a couple of months later, the 4080 and 4070.Although the way it sounds in this fresh Twitter revelation, the RTX 4080 could come before the RTX 4070 \u2013 which is entirely possible (anything is at this point, for that matter; all of these are just potential timeframes). Nothing is suggested about what kind of gap there might be between those two cards, if there is one.Whatever the case, the rumor mill does believe that Nvidia should have all these core Lovelace offerings out before the end of 2022, in some kind of staggered launch \u2013 likely including the RTX 4060, though of course that isn\u2019t mentioned here \u2013 and then other spins may follow later. Those may include the already persistently rumored RTX 4090 Ti, and maybe even a new Titan version for the Lovelace range.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.There are still lots of unknowns, including when AMD might make its move with next-gen RDNA 3 graphics cards \u2013 with the gossip indicating that mid-range GPUs will come first from Team Red, which could give Nvidia\u2019s rival the advantage if they\u2019re facing off against just a very expensive Lovelace flagship to begin with.Intel\u2019s long-awaited entry into the desktop GPU arena will also complicate things further, all hopefully to the benefit of the consumer when it comes to competitive pricing (and the further easing of GPU stock issues).Today\u2019s best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $39.99 $34.99ViewDeal ends Tue, Apr 1, 2025 $99.99 $79.99ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesNvidia\u2019s new budget GPU might be imminent \u2013 but don\u2019t get excited about itVia Wccftech\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

Labeled as 'BFGPU', a new breed of enthusiast & ultimate graphics card, these provide the best performance possible with the best possible PC gaming features in a package that's next to none.\nNVIDIA's direction with the BFGPU was to design a graphics card not just for the ultimate gamer but also for professional content creators too who also want to have the best graphics performance at hand to power the next generation of AAA gaming titles with superb visuals and insane fluidity. It's not just the FPS that matters these days, it's visuals, and a smoother frame rate too and this is exactly what the GeForce RTX 30 series is made to excel at.\n\nWe should expect similar things with the next-generation flagship too but an important factor to consider is that GPUs are becoming more power-hungry and more pricey. It is a trend that might continue into the future as we get better products but in return, there's always a cost to pay for end consumers. So starting with what we know so far, first we should take a look at the brand new Ada Lovelace or AD10* class GPUs that will be powering the next-gen GeForce RTX 40 series cards.\nYou can also read the expected specs, prices, and performance of other upcoming RTX 40 GPUs in the posts below:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Series\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Series\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Series\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 Series\n\nNVIDIA's AD102 'Ada Lovelace' GPU - The Next-Gen Powerhouse\nThe NVIDIA Ada Lovelace AD102 GPU features up to 12 GPC (Graphics Processing Clusters). These are 5 more SMs compared to the Ampere GA102 GPUs. Each GPU will consist of 6 TPCs and 2 SMs which is the same configuration as the existing chip. Each SM (Streaming Multiprocessor) will house four sub-cores which is also the same as the GA102 GPU. What's changed is the FP32 & the INT32 core configuration. Each sub-core will include 64 FP32 units but combined FP32+INT32 units will go up to 128. This is because half of the FP32 units don't share the same sub-core as the IN32 units. The 64 FP32 cores are separate from the 128 INT32 cores.\n\nSo in total, each sub-core will consist of 16 FP32 plus 16 INT32 units for a total of 32 units. Each SM will have a total of 64 FP32 units plus 64 INT32 units for a total of 128 units. And since there are a total of 144 SM units (12 per GPC), we are looking at a total of 18,432 cores. Each SM will also include two Wrap Schedules (32 thread/CLK) for 64 wraps per SM & their own L0 i-cache. This is a 33% increase in Wraps/Threads vs the GA102 GPU. The Register file size is 16,384 across a 32-bit lane. Each SM also carries its own 128 KB of L1 data cache and shared memory so that's 18 MB of L1 cache.\n\nMoving over to the cache, this is another segment where NVIDIA has given a big boost over the existing Ampere GPUs. The L2 cache will be increased to 96 MB as mentioned in the leaks. This is a 16x increase over the Ampere GPU that hosts just 6 MB of L2 cache. The cache will be shared across the GPU. The GPU will also feature up to 192 ROPs for the full-die.\n\nThere are also going to be the latest 4th Generation Tensor and 3rd Generation RT (Raytracing) cores infused on the Ada Lovelace GPUs which will help boost DLSS & Raytracing performance to the next level. Overall, the Ada Lovelace AD102 GPU will offer:\n\n71% More GPCs (Versus Ampere)\n71% More Cores (Versus Ampere)\n50% More L1 Cache (Versus Ampere)\n16x More L2 Cache (Versus Ampere)\n71% More ROPs (Versus Ampere)\n4th Gen Tensor & 3rd Gen RT Cores\n\nThe full die has not been featured on any GPU so far, not even the L40 which has 2 SMs disabled. It is likely that as yields progress, we will eventually see a gaming and workstation product using the full-fat AD102. Till then, the RTX 4090 is the top gaming graphics card while the RTX 6000 Ada is the top workstation solution.\nNVIDIA AD102 'Ada Lovelace' Gaming GPU Block Diagram:\n\nNVIDIA AD102 'Ada Lovelace' Gaming GPU 'SM' Block Diagram:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090\n\n82.6 TFLOPS of peak single-precision (FP32) performance\n165.2 TFLOPS of peak half-precision (FP16) performance\n660.6 Tensor TFLOPS\n1321.2 Tensor TFLOPs with sparsity\n191 RT-TFLOPs\n\nAt the heart of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card lies the Ada Lovelace AD102 GPU. The GPU measures 608,4mm2 and will utilize the TSMC 4N process node which is an optimized version of TSMC's 5nm (N5) node designed for the green team. The GPU features an insane 76.3 Billion transistors.\nNVIDIA Ampere \"GeForce RTX 30\" GPUs Full Breakdown:\n\n\n\nGraphics CardNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPERNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA Titan RTXNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU CodenameTU106GA104TU104GA102TU102GA102\n\n\nGPU ArchitectureNVIDIA TuringNVIDIA AmpereNVIDIA TuringNVIDIA AmpereNVIDIA TuringNVIDIA Ampere\n\n\nGPCs5 or 666667\n\n\nTPCs202323343641\n\n\nSMs404646687282\n\n\nCUDA Cores / SM641286412864128\n\n\nCUDA Cores / GPU2560588829448704460810496\n\n\nTensor Cores / SM8 (2nd Gen)4 (3rd Gen)8 (2nd Gen)4 (3rd Gen)8 (2nd Gen)4 (3rd Gen)\n\n\nTensor Cores / GPU320 (2nd Gen)184 (3rd Gen)368272 (3rd Gen)576 (2nd Gen)328 (3rd Gen)\n\n\nRT Cores40 (1st Gen)46 (2nd Gen)46 (1st Gen)68 (2nd Gen)72 (1st Gen)82 (2nd Gen)\n\n\nGPU Boost Clock (MHz)177017251800171017701695\n\n\nPeak FP32 TFLOPS (non-Tensor)9.120.310.629.816.335.6\n\n\nPeak FP16 TFLOPS (non-Tensor)18.120.321.229.832.635.6\n\n\nPeak BF16 TFLOPS (non-Tensor)NA20.3NA29.8NA35.6\n\n\nPeak INT32 TOPS (non-Tensor)9.110.210.614.916.317.8\n\n\nPeak FP16 Tensor TFLOPS\nwith FP16 Accumulate72.581.3/162.684.8119/238130.5142/284\n\n\nPeak FP16 Tensor TFLOPS\nwith FP32 Accumulate36.340.6/81.342.459.5/11965.271/142\n\n\nPeak BF16 Tensor TFLOPS\nwith FP32 AccumulateNA40.6/81.3NA59.5/119NA71/142\n\n\nPeak TF32 Tensor TFLOPSNA20.3/40.6NA29.8/59.5NA35.6/71\n\n\nPeak INT8 Tensor TOPS145162.6/325.2169.6238/476261284/568\n\n\nPeak INT4 Tensor TOPS290325.2/650.4339.1476/952522568/1136\n\n\nFrame Buffer Memory Size and\nType8 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR610 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR624 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Interface256-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory Clock (Data Rate)14 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps14 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth448 GB/sec448 GB/sec448 GB/sec760 GB/sec672 GB/sec936 GB/sec\n\n\nROPs6496649696112\n\n\nPixel Fill-rate (Gigapixels/sec)113.3165.6115.2164.2169.9193\n\n\nTexture Units160184184272288328\n\n\nTexel Fill-rate (Gigatexels/sec)283.2317.4331.2465509.8566\n\n\nL1 Data Cache/Shared Memory384058884416 KB8704 KB6912 KB10496 KB\n\n\nL2 Cache Size4096 KB4096 KB4096 KB5120 KB6144 KB6144 KB\n\n\nRegister File Size10240 KB11776 KB11776 KB17408 KB18432 KB20992 KB\n\n\nTGP (Total Graphics Power)215 Watts220W225W320W280W350W\n\n\nTransistor Count13.6 Billion17.4 Billion13.6 Billion28.3 Billion18.6 Billion28.3 Billion\n\n\nDie Size545 mm2392.5 mm2545 mm2628.4 mm2754mm2628.4 mm2\n\n\nManufacturing ProcessTSMC 12 nm FFN\n(FinFET NVIDIA)Samsung 8 nm 8N NVIDIA\nCustom ProcessTSMC 12 nm FFN\n(FinFET NVIDIA)Samsung 8 nm 8N NVIDIA\nCustom ProcessTSMC 12 nm FFN\n(FinFET NVIDIA)Samsung 8 nm 8N NVIDIA\nCustom Process\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Ada GPUs - AD102, AD103, AD104 For The First Wave of Gaming Cards\nNVIDIA is first introducing three brand new Ada GPUs which include the AD102, AD103 & AD104. The AD102 GPU is going to be featured on the GeForce RTX 4090, the AD103 is going to be used by the GeForce RTX 4080 16 GB graphics cards and the AD104 GPU is going to be featured on the GeForce RTX 4080 12 GB graphics cards.\nThe Ada GPUs are based on the TSMC 4N process node which is a custom process designed exclusively for NVIDIA. It is essentially an optimized version of the N5 (5nm) process, offering drastic increases in transistors, cores, and frequency. The top AD102 GPU packs 70% more cores and also offers 76.3 Billion transistors while offering over 2x the performance per watt.\nNVIDIA Ada AD102 GPU\nThe full AD102 GPU is made up of 12 graphics processing clusters with 12 SM units on each cluster. That makes up 144 SM units for a total of 18432 cores, 144 RT cores, 576 Tensor Cores, 576 Texture Units, and a 384-bit bus interface in a 76.3 billion transistor package measuring 608,5mm2.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Graphics Cards Specifications\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 will use 128 SMs of the 144 SMs for a total of 16,384 CUDA cores. The GPU will come packed with 96 MB of L2 cache and a total of 384 ROPs which is simply insane but considering that the RTX 4090 is a cut-down design, it may feature slightly lower L2 and ROP counts. The clock speeds are not confirmed yet but considering that the TSMC 4N process is being used. The clock speeds are rated at up to 2.6 GHz and NVIDIA is claiming over 3 GHz speeds with overclocking which you can read more about here.\nAs for memory specs, the GeForce RTX 4090 will feature 24 GB GDDR6X capacities that will be clocked at 21 Gbps speeds across a 384-bit bus interface. This will provide up to 1 TB/s of bandwidth. This is the same bandwidth as the existing RTX 3090 Ti graphics card and as far as the power consumption is concerned, the TBP is rated at 450W. The card will be powered by a single 16-pin connector which delivers up to 600W of power. Custom models will be offering higher TBP targets.\n\nNVIDIA Founders Edition Designed To Utilize Up To 600W of Power For Higher Overclocking\nAs for its brand new Founders Edition cards, the GeForce RTX 4090 24 GB and RTX 4080 16 GB, NVIDIA has produced a compact PCB similar to the ones we saw on the previous generation & designing a PCB like this helps improve airflow and cooling performance.\n\nNVIDIA says that they have further optimized the Dual Axial Flow Through system, increasing fan sizes and fin volume by 10%, offering 20% higher air flow and upgrading to a 23-phase power supply (20+3 Phase for RTX 4090). Memory temperatures are reduced, and the new, substantially more powerful Ada GPUs are kept cool in ventilated cases, giving gamers excellent overclocking headroom. NVIDIA went through a rigorous testing procedure and is said to have evaluated as many as 50 fan designs before finalizing the one we are getting on the new cards. The cooler is used to dissipate heat from the heatsink assembly that comprises a vapor chamber, a big jump from the previous design too.\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 also uses the same cooler as the RTX 4090 Founders Edition and since it has a lower TDP, it should deliver even better thermal performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nEach GeForce RTX 40 Series Founders Edition graphics card reduces cable clutter by leveraging the new standard GPU power input of next-gen ATX 3.0 power supplies, the PCIe Gen-5 16-pin Connector. This enables you to power GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards with just a single cable, improving the aesthetics of your build. If you are using a previous-gen power supply, an adapter cable is included in the box, allowing you to plug in three 8-pin power connectors, with an optional fourth connector for more overclocking headroom. ATX 3.0 power supplies will be available in October from ASUS, Cooler Master, FSP, Gigabyte, iBuyPower, MSI, and ThermalTake, with more models to come.\n\nOne advantage of the new 16-pin connector is that while the Founders Edition cards are designed at 450W & 320W, respectively, they can utilize the extra headroom provided through the new connector for extreme overclocking with the RTX 4090 going for that full 600W mark. The new power delivery also gives the RTX 40 series a 10x increase in response time to power transient management compared to the previous generation.\nThe new cards also feature DP 1.4a (4K 12-bit HDR @ 240Hz) and HDMI 2.1 (4K 120Hz HDR / 8K 60Hz HDR). All cards are compliant with the PCIe Gen 4 interface on existing motherboards and also feature full compliance with the Resizable-BAR technologies.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition PCB:\n\nNext-Gen Micron GDDR6X Dies Run 10C Cooler Thanks To New Process Node\nNVIDIA has also leveraged Micron's latest GDDR6X memory chips for its GeForce RTX 40 graphics cards which run 10C cooler, are more power efficient and since they are all 16Gb DRAM dies, they can be fused on one side of the PCB to be cooled better than dual-sided memory.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Graphics Cards Performance\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 is the first gaming card to hit the 100 TFLOPs compute horsepower limit.\n\nSo we decided it was time to test how far we can push the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition with some overclocking. To get to 100 TFLOPs, we first pushed the power limit and temp limit slider all the way to the max and upped the Core and Memory clocks by +275 and +1100 MHz, respectively. This wasn't enough as the card was being limited by its power design. That is when we landed our hands on MSI's latest Afterburner which allowed us to raise the core voltages. At 100%, we saw some performance regression so we had to stick with +55% which showed us some good results.\n\nWith the overclock applied on our NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card, we saw a maximum GPU core clock of 3150 MHz on the AD102 Ada GPU, a maximum power draw of 547W and our temps peaked at 69C. All of this was done on air and with no exotic liquid cooling, chillers or LN2 were used.\nAnd behold, we saw the magical number of not 100 but almost 101 TFLOPs right in front of our eyes. To put things into perspective, this is a 22% compute boost over the stock RTX 4090 and a 2.5x compute performance boost over the RTX 3090 Ti. The AD102 GPU also ripped apart the data-center-focused Hopper H100 GPUs by offering over 50% better FP32 performance. Ada Lovelace is truly a game changer and we can definitely see it become a popular compute and AI graphics card when Quadro variants of the said chip launch as the RTX 6000 ADA and L60.\n\n\nFP32 Compute Horsepower Comparisons (Higher is Better)\n\nCompute Power\n\n\n04080120160200240\n\n\n\n\n\n04080120160200240\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090 OC\n\n101\n\n\nRTX 4090 Stock\n\n83\n\n\nRTX 3090 Ti\n\n40\n\n\nRX 6900 XTX\n\n25\n\n\nXbox Series X\n\n12\n\n\nPlayStation 5\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will be a 2x compute performance uplift for each graphics card versus its predecessor and this is without even factoring in the RT and Tensor core performance which are expected to get major lifts too in their respective department. Now FLOPs aren't necessarily reflective of the graphics or gaming performance but they do provide a metric that can be used for comparison. A 2-2.5x gain over the RTX 3090 & RTX 3090 Ti would be very disruptive and it makes sense why NVIDIA is going so hard with higher power limits on their cards.\n\n\n\nGamers should expect 4K gaming to be buttery smooth on these graphics cards and with DLSS, we might even see playable 60 FPS at 8K resolution which is something that NVIDIA has been trying to achieve with its RTX 3090 series BFGPUs for a while now.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Graphics Cards Price & Availability\nNow coming to the prices, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti & RTX 3090 graphics cards are undoubtedly the most expensive single-chip GPUs to date.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Manuel Medir/Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\nIt took almost an entire year from their initial release, but the LHR (low hashrate) versions of Nvidia's RTX 30 series graphics cards have finally been completely unlocked by a mining software called Nicehash, restoring each card's respective mining capabilities.\n\nMany of the best graphics cards were nearly impossible to find available to buy over the last two years because of the global chip shortage, a broader supply chain crisis at ports around the world and demand for consumer tech putting even more pressure on the availability of semiconductors needed by AMD and Nvidia for their products.Part of this demand also included cryptominers who were buying up the available stock in bulk of popular GPUs during the height of the recent crypto currency boom. And while there are mixed opinions about how this affected overall availability for gamers and building hobbyists, there was certainly no love lost between the two groups which resulted in Team Green putting measures in place to make its consumer graphics cards less desirable to those hoping to use them to mine currencies such as Ethereum.Almost the entire RTX 3000-series of cards was re-released with hash rate limiters (not including the GeForce RTX 3090 as it was deemed too expensive to attract the mining market) which limited their ability to mine currencies like ETH, but several of these were quickly defeated, with some software able to unlock cards to 70-80% efficiency in a matter of weeks.\n\nAs reported by WCCFTech, NiceHash has now announced that it can utilize 100% of available mining speeds using these previously restricted Ampere-series cards, stating on its website that:\n\n\"We are very excited to tell you that\u00a0NiceHash QuickMiner (Excavator) is the first mining software to FULLY (100%) UNLOCK LHR cards! Now you can earn more profits than any other mining software on the market if you are using LHR graphics cards with NiceHash QuickMiner\".\n\nWe don't have an LHR model GPU to verify this claim ourselves, so take the statement with a pinch of salt, but its also worth noting that GPU stock levels and pricing is currently sitting at the best numbers we've seen for many months, so it's unlikely you'll be fighting off swarms of competition if cards are viable for mining again.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's RTX 5090 has already been pushed beyond its limit - ROG Astral model overclock reaches 3.45GHz and 35 Gbps VRAM\n\n\n\n\nBest mining GPU for mining crypto in 2025\n\n\n\nAnalysis: Don't worry about it \u2013 no, seriously(Image credit: Manuel Medir/Getty Images)This news is unlikely to cause another shortage of graphics cards or even drive up the price of the stock currently available, and that's for a few different reasons. The main piece of good news for gamers is that Ethereum, the world's second most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, started moving to proof-of-stake at the end of 2021.\n\nLet me explain. Proof-of-work is a system where computers compete against each other to be the first to solve complex puzzles, which left it open to miners using warehouses full of consumer graphics cards to solve those puzzles, earning some ETH in the process. Proof-of-stake instead uses validators to find a block based on the number of tokens they hold, removing the need for those 'puzzles' to be solved.\n\nThis switch from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake model has removed a lot of the demand of the graphics cards, so where Ethereum was previously the largest cryptocurrency that is primarily mined using graphics cards (Bitcoin has mostly been mined on ASICs over the last few years), it will soon be inefficient to do so.Sure, there are other currencies available that still use a Proof-of-work system, but these don't have the same grasp on the market that ETH did last year, so unless another crypto starts to rocket upwards in value, it'll take some time to see a similar situation unfold.\n\nIn reality, this shouldn't impact consumers who are trying to buy a new graphics card in any way, though it does mean that LHR versions of GPUs no longer serve the same purpose. With any luck, Nvidia continues to develop its hashrate limiting technology just in case we see a similar scenario unfold when it releases its Lovelace series of graphics cards to act as a deterrent.Today's best Graphics Cards deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $38.99View $63ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesIf you don't want to build a PC, buy a gaming laptop instead for gaming on the goGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJess WeatherbedSocial Links NavigationJess is a former TechRadar Computing writer, where she covered all aspects of Mac and PC hardware, including PC gaming and peripherals.

But the showdown had to take place on the surface of a Google Pixel phone, set in the living room of a live actor.\nWorking with advertising agency Omelet, the team at Impossible Objects brought this vision to life using accelerated virtual production workflows to blend visual effects with live action. Using Epic Games\u2019 Unreal Engine and NVIDIA RTX A6000-powered Dell Precision 7920 workstations, the team created all the stunning cinematics and graphics, from high-fidelity textures and reflections to realistic camera movement and lighting.\nThese advanced technologies helped the artists make instant creative decisions as they could view high-quality virtual imagery rendered in real time.\n\u201cWe can build larger, photorealistic worlds and not worry about relying on outdated creative workflows,\u201d said Joe Sill, founder of Impossible Objects. \u201cWith Unreal Engine and NVIDIA RTX-powered Dell Precision workstations, we brought these Diablo Immortal characters to life.\u201d\n\nReal-Time Technologies Deliver Impossible Results\nPreviously, to tackle a project like this, the Impossible Objects team would look at concept art and storyboards to get an idea of what the visuals were supposed to look like. But with virtual production, the creators can work in a nonlinear way, bridging the gap between imagination and the final high-resolution images faster than before.\nFor the Diablo Immortals project, Impossible Objects used Unreal Engine for previsualization \u2014 where the artists were able to make creative, intentional decisions because they were experiencing high-fidelity images in real time. Moreover, the previsualization happened simultaneously with the virtual art department and layout phases.\n\nThe team used NVIDIA RTX A6000-powered Dell Precision 7920 workstations \u2014 an advanced combination that allowed the artists to enhance the virtual production and creative workflows. The RTX A6000 GPU delivers 48 gigabytes of VRAM, a crucial spec when offline rendering in Unreal Engine. With more GPU memory, the team had room for more geometry and higher resolution textures.\n\u201cRendering would not have been possible without the RTX A6000 \u2014 we maxed out on its 48 gigs of memory, using all that room for textures, environments and geometry,\u201d said Luc Delamare, head of Technology at Impossible Objects. \u201cWe could throw anything at the GPU, and we\u2019d still have plenty of performance for real-time workflows.\u201d\nTypically, this project would have taken up to six months to complete. But the nonlinear approach enabled by the real-time pipeline allowed Impossible Objects to cut the production time in half.\nThe video game characters in the commercial were prebuilt and provided by Blizzard. Impossible Objects used Autodesk Maya to up-res the characters and scale them to perform better in a cinematic setting.\n\nThe team often toggled between compositing software, Autodesk Maya and Unreal Engine as they ported animation back and forth between the applications. And as the project started to get bigger, Impossible Objects turned to another solution: NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling, an AI rendering technology that uses a neural network to boost frame rates and produce sharp images.\n\u201cNVIDIA DLSS was incredibly important, as we were able to use it in the real-time workflow, even with characters that had high polygon counts,\u201d said Delamare. \u201cThis solution became really helpful, especially as the project started to get denser and denser.\u201d\nAt the animation stage, Unreal Engine and NVIDIA RTX allowed the team to simultaneously update cinematography and lighting in real time. The end result was fewer department handoffs, which resulted in time saved and efficient creative communication gained.\nWith all of these advanced technologies combined, Impossible Objects had the power to create a more efficient, iterative process \u2014 one that allowed the team to ditch linear pipelines and instead take on a much more creative, collaborative workflow.\nTo learn more about the project, watch the video below:\n\nLearn more about NVIDIA RTX technology in media and entertainment.\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | Media and Entertainment | NVIDIA RTX | Rendering \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It is aimed at edge AI, AIoT, robotics and embedded applications with a series of modules available later this year.\nThe Orin chip uses the Nvidia Ampere architecture GPU with 2048 cores, up to 12 ARM Cortex-A78AE CPU cores, deep learning and vision accelerators, high-speed interfaces, faster memory bandwidth, and multimodal sensor support capable of feeding multiple, concurrent AI application pipelines.\n\nNvidia boosts safety critical design with Jetson Orin AGX module\nNvidia robotics AI perception and simulation SDK\n\nThe Orin modules in the AGX format vary from a $899 module with eight A78AE cores at 200TOPS, out in July, to the top end at 275TOPS with 12 cores in October for $1599.\nThe smaller Orin NX modules, the same format as the low cost Jetson TX2 modules, vary from 100TOPS with eight cores at $599, out in September, to a lower cost $399 version providing 70 TOPS from six cores, out in December.\nNvidia says it uses its first silicon for production, presumably with redundancy in the design to provide the different versions from the same die to avoid problems with yield. The chip is built on an 8nm process at Samsung.\nNvidia says it now has over 1m developers using Jetson at over 6000 companies.\nBoard and system makers at the Computex 2022 in Taipei using the modules include AAEON, Adlink, Advantech, Aetina, AIMobile, Appropho, AverMedia, Axiomtek, EverFocus, Neousys, Onyx and Vecow.\nDesigns include servers, edge appliances and industrial PCs in fan and fanless configurations with multiple connectivity and interface options, also including specifications for commercial or ruggedized applications. There will also be carrier boards for the modules for custom system development.\n\u201cThe new Jetson AGX Orin is supercharging the next generation of robotics and edge AI applications,\u201d said Deepu Talla, vice president of Embedded and Edge Computing at Nvidia. \u201cThis momentum continues to accelerate as our ecosystem partners release Jetson Orin-based production systems in various form factors tailored towards specific industries and use cases.\u201d\nOther partners launching Jetson Orin-based systemsinclude Auvidea, Basler AG, Connect Tech, D3 Engineering, Diamond Systems, e-Con Systems, Forecr, Framos, Infineon, Leetop, Leopard Imaging, MiiVii, Quectel, RidgeRun, Sequitur, Silex, SmartCow, Stereolabs, Syslogic, Realtimes, Telit and TZTEK.\nPretrained models from Nvidia\u2019s NGC catalogue are optimized and ready for fine-tuning with the TAO toolkit and customer datasets to run on the modules. This reduces time and cost for production-quality AI deployments, while cloud-native technologies allow seamless updates throughout a product\u2019s lifetime.\nFor specific use cases, Nvidia provides the Isaac Sim\u00a0on Omniverse for robotics;\u00a0Riva, a GPU-accelerated SDK for building speech AI applications; the\u00a0DeepStream streaming analytics toolkit for AI-based multi-sensor processing, video, audio and image understanding; and Metropolis, an application framework, set of developer tools and partner ecosystem that brings visual data and AI together to improve operational efficiency and safety across industries.\nwww.nvidia.com\nRelated articles\n\nROS2 AI boost with Nvidia deal\u00a0\nEricsson builds digital twins for 5G networks\n\nOther articles on eeNews Europe\n\nWorld\u2019s largest commercial drone deployment uses German tech\nMicron to ship 232-layer 3D-NAND memory\nApple looks to e-ink displays for foldable phones\nFlexible printed battery drives $2 Bluetooth IoT tag\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        If you enjoyed this article, you will like the following ones: don't miss them by subscribing to :\n                                        \n\n                                            \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0eeNews on Google News\n                                        \n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinked Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLi-ion battery management platform with pre-validated firmware\nMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCelera samples analog IC designed by AI\nMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrowave antenna covers EMI measurements in the FR2 range\nMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\u00a2 off-line switcher for European energy regulations\nMarch 17, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInPsytech joins Intel Foundry IP alliance\nMarch 17, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia launches AI safety framework for driverless cars\nA second life for Nissan batteries in Norway\nEuropean Chips Act funds persuade ChipFlow to relocate to Spain\nFAMES makes its open call for 10nm, 7nm FD-SOI\nLightning fast internet where fibre fails\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost read articles\n\n\n\n\nMycronic moves into semiconductors with French MRAM buy\nSingle chip modulator from 10MHz to 1THz\nTI shows world\u2019s smallest microcontroller\nThe sunset of Northvolt\nGoogle to buy MEMS eye tracking startup for $115m\nAllegro backs new CEO as it faces onsemi bid\nNorthVolt sells industrial division for $6m, files for bankruptcy\nKulr signs private space battery deal\nIrresistible Materials for next generation 1nm EUV\nOpenLIght, Tower show 400G photonic chip\n\n\n\n\nRegister to our newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEmail\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAMES makes its open call for 10nm, 7nm FD-SOI\nMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightning fast internet where fibre fails\nMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite papers\n\n\n\nDAQ systems: The font of all knowledge PC-based DAQ systems simplify industrial data collection\nVirtual Prototyping Framework for Pixel Detector Electronics in High Energy Physics\nROBOTIC ARMS REACH FOR A NEW HORIZON\nonsemi EliteSiC 650 V SiC MOSFET M3S Series with Superior Switching Performance\nHigh Performance, Precision Analog Capability Enabled by the Treo Platform\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo webinar channel\n\n\n\n        Elektor & eeNews Europe\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXENSIV\u2122 Automotive Silicon Microphones \u2013 Clear Audio for a Safer Ride\nSeptember 30, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnetic Sensors \u2013 Unlock the Power of Efficiency\nMay 17, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\nSearch\n\n\nPrivacy Statement\n\n\n\n            All material on this site Copyright \u00a9 2025 European Business Press SA.

The graphics card will be replacing the RTX 3070, a very popular gaming graphics card in the $500-$600 US segment.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Card - Purely Designed For Enthusiast Gamers\n[Updated- 04/09/22]\nWhile there's no denying the enthusiasm around the higher-end GeForce RTX 4090 & GeForce RTX 4080 series graphics cards that offer the best of the best gaming performance, the RTX 4070 series graphics cards will be designed around the $500 US segment which is a high-end price range that still offers lots of performance at hand. It's simple, the RTX 4090 series will be aimed at users who want the best of the best without worrying about the amount of money they are spending while the RTX 4080 series is aimed at users who want the best gaming performance at the best possible price. The RTX 4070 will be the sweet spot for high-end gaming, offering a buttery smooth 2K game experience.\nThe previous GeForce RTX 3070 was touted to offer a huge improvement over the RTX 2070 and was said to offer performance faster than the RTX 2080 Ti but ended up mostly on par with the Turing flagship with only the RTX 3070 Ti exceeding the performance of the previous Turing GPU flagship. It looks like the RTX 4070 will be placed in a similar position where it might offer graphics performance on par or close to the RTX 3080 Ti but a 'Ti' variant going further ahead in graphics performance.\n\nWe should expect similar things with the next-generation gaming solution too but an important factor to consider is that GPUs are becoming more power-hungry and more pricey. It is a trend that might continue into the future as we get better products but in return, there's always a cost to pay for end consumers. So starting with what we know so far, first we should take a look at the brand new Ada Lovelace or AD10* class GPUs that will be powering the next-gen GeForce RTX 40 series cards.\nYou can also read the expected specs, prices, and performance of other upcoming RTX 40 GPUs in the posts below:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Series\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Series\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Series\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 Series\n\nNVIDIA's AD104 'Ada Lovelace' GPU - The Next-Gen Powerhouse\nStarting with the GPU configuration, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 series graphics cards are said to utilize the AD104 GPU core. The GPU is said to measure around 300mm2 and will utilize the TSMC 4N process node which is an optimized version of TSMC's 5nm (N5) node designed for the green team.\n\nThe NVIDIA Ada Lovelace AD104 GPU is expected to feature up to 5 GPC (Graphics Processing Clusters). This is the one less GPC than the GA104 GPU. Each GPU will consist of 6 TPCs and 2 SMs which is the same configuration as the existing chip. Each SM (Streaming Multiprocessor) will house four sub-cores which is also the same as the GA102 GPU. What's changed is the FP32 & the INT32 core configuration. Each sub-core will include 128 FP32 units but combined FP32+INT32 units will go up to 192. This is because the FP32 units don't share the same sub-core as the IN32 units. The 128 FP32 cores are separate from the 64 INT32 cores.\nSo in total, each sub-core will consist of 32 FP32 plus 16 INT32 units for a total of 48 units. Each SM will have a total of 128 FP32 units plus 64 INT32 units for a total of 192 units. And since there are a total of 60 SM units (12 per GPC), we are looking at 7,680 FP32 Units and 3,840 INT32 units for a total of 11,520 cores. Each SM will also include two Wrap Schedules (32 thread/CLK) for 64 wraps per SM. This is a 50% increase on the cores (FP32+INT32) and a 33% increase in Wraps/Threads vs the GA102 GPU.\nNVIDIA AD103 'Ada Lovelace' Gaming GPU 'SM' Block Diagram (Image Credits: Kopite7kimi):\n\nMoving over to the cache, this is another segment where NVIDIA has given a big boost over the existing Ampere GPUs. The Ada Lovelace GPUs will pack 192 KB of L1 cache per SM, an increase of 50% over Ampere. That's a total of 2 MB of L1 cache on the top AD104 GPU. The L2 cache will be increased to 48 MB as mentioned in the leaks. This is a 12x increase over the Ampere GA104 GPU that hosts just 4 MB of L2 cache. The cache will be shared across the GPU.\nFinally, we have the ROPs which are also increased to 32 per GPC, an increase of 2x over Ampere. You are looking at up to 160 ROPs versus just 96 on the GA104 Ampere GPU. There are also going to be the latest 4th Generation Tensor and 3rd Generation RT (Raytracing) cores infused on the Ada Lovelace GPUs which will help boost DLSS & Raytracing performance to the next level. Overall, the Ada Lovelace AD103 GPU will offer:\n\n5 GPCs vs 6 GPCs on GA104\n+25% Cores vs GA104 GPU\n50% More L1 Cache (Versus Ampere GA104)\nTwice More L2 Cache (Versus Ampere GA104)\n+66% ROPs (Versus Ampere GA104)\n4th Gen Tensor & 3rd Gen RT Cores\n\nNVIDIA AD104 'Ada Lovelace' Gaming GPU Block Diagram Mock-Up (Image Credits: SemiAnalysis):\n\nDo note that clock speeds, which are said to be between the 2-3 GHz range, aren't taken into the equation so they will also play a major role in improving the per-core performance versus Ampere.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Cards Specifications\nAs we saw with the GA104 GPU, NVIDIA can have various configurations of the AD104 GPU for its GeForce RTX 4070 series lineup. We realistically expect there to be two variants, the RTX 4070 and the RTX 4070 Ti. The former will be part of the initial lineup while the latter would launch as a mid-cycle refresh.\u00a0 The most entry-level GeForce RTX 30 had 23% fewer cores compared to the full chip but this time, the '80-class' graphics cards are going to be powered by their own chip rather than relying on the AD102 GPU that the flagships use. As such, we can expect anywhere from 6144 to the full 7680 core configuration.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 'Expected' Specifications\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 is going to be a cut-down configuration with a slightly higher core count than the RTX 3070 TI (6144 cores) allowing some room for a 'Ti' variant in the future with the full-fat configuration. The core count is expected to be 7168 which means 56 of the 60 SMs will be enabled. The GPU will come packed with 48 MB of L2 cache and up to 160 ROPs which is simply insane.\nThe clock speeds are not confirmed yet but considering that the TSMC 4N process is being used, we are expecting clocks between the 2.0-3.0 GHz range. The higher than usual clock speed bump comes from the fact that NVIDIA is making a two-node jump considering the Ampere GPUs with Samsung 8nm node was in reality a 10nm process node with some optimizations. NVIDIA is skipping 7nm and going straight for a 5nm node and not even the vanilla variant but an optimized version of it. With Pascal on the TSMC 16nm node, NVIDIA delivered a huge frequency leap and we can expect a similar jump this time around too.\nAs for memory specs, the GeForce RTX 4070 is expected to rock 10 GB GDDR6 capacities that are said to be clocked at 18 Gbps speeds across a 160-bit bus interface. The card may rock a TBP of 300W and the leaker also mentions that the pricing of this card would not be lower than the RTX 3070 or 3070 Ti graphics cards. Simply put, we can expect a price bump in the '70' class graphics segment.\n\nAs for its feature set, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 graphics cards will rock all the modern NV feature sets such as the latest 4th Gen Tensor Cores, 3rd gen RT cores, and the latest NVENC Encoder, and NVCDEC Decoder, and support for the latest APIs. They will pack all the modern RTX features such as DLSS, Reflex, Broadcast, Resizable-BAR, Freestyle, Ansel, Highlights, Shadowplay, and G-SYNC support too.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Series Preliminary Specs:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAD104-400?AD104-400?Ampere GA104-400Ampere GA104-300\n\n\nProcess NodeTSMC 4NTSMC 4NSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie Size~300mm2~300mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBDTBD17.4 Billion17.4 Billion\n\n\nPCBNVIDIA PG141-SKU331NVIDIA PG141-310 SKU341NVIDIA PG141NVIDIA PG142\n\n\nCUDA Cores~7680~768061445888\n\n\nTMUs / ROPsTBD / 160TBD / 160192/ 96184 / 96\n\n\nTensor / RT CoresTBD / TBDTBD / TBD192/ 48184 / 46\n\n\nBase ClockTBDTBD1575 MHz1500 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock~2.6 GHz~2.5 GHz1770 MHz1730 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute~40 TFLOPs~38 TFLOPs22 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPsTBDTBD42 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPsTBDTBD174 TOPs163 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity12 GB GDDR6X?12 GB GDDR6X?8 GB GDDR6X8 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus192-bit192-bit256-bit256-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed21 Gbps21 Gbps19 Gbps14 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth504 GB/s504 GB/s608 Gbps448 Gbps\n\n\nTBP~400W285W?290W220W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$599 US?$499 US?$599 US$499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)2022202210th June 202129th October 2020\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Cards Performance\nAs for the performance of the gaming GPUs, we can only use theoretical numbers here since the launch is a bit far away but based on what we know, the RTX 40 series cards might be the first gaming cards to hit the 100 TFLOPs compute horsepower limit.\nJust for comparison's sake:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti: ~103 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.8 GHz clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090: ~90 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.8 GHz clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080: ~50 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti: 40 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.86 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti: ~38 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070: ~36 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090: 36 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.69 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080: 30 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.71 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti: 22 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.77 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070: 20 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.72 GHz Boost clock)\n\nBased on a theoretical clock speed of 2.5 GHz, you get up to 36 TFLOPs of compute performance and the rumors are suggesting even higher boost clocks. Now, these are definitely sounding like peak clocks, similar to AMD's peak frequencies which are higher than the average 'Game' clock. A 36+ TFLOPs compute performance means more performance on a '70-class' GPU than an '80-class flagship' which will be a good bump. But one should keep in mind that compute performance doesn't necessarily indicate the overall gaming performance.\n\n\nFP32 Compute Horsepower Comparisons (Higher is Better)\n\nCompute Power\n\n\n020406080100120\n\n\n\n\n\n020406080100120\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090 Ti (Theoretical)\n\n100\n\n\nRTX 4090 (Theoretical)\n\n90\n\n\nRTX 4080 (Theoretical)\n\n50\n\n\nRTX 3090 Ti\n\n40\n\n\nRTX 4070 Ti\n\n38\n\n\nRTX 4070\n\n36\n\n\nRTX 3090\n\n36\n\n\nRTX 3080\n\n30\n\n\nRX 6900 XTX\n\n25\n\n\nRTX 3070 Ti\n\n22\n\n\nRTX 3070\n\n20\n\n\nXbox Series X\n\n12\n\n\nPlayStation 5\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will be around a 80% compute performance uplift for the GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card versus its predecessor and this is without even factoring in the RT and Tensor core performance which is expected to get major lifts too in their respective department. Now FLOPs aren't necessarily reflective of the graphics or gaming performance but they do provide a metric that can be used for comparison.\n\nGamers should expect 2K\u00a0 gaming to be buttery smooth on these graphics cards and with DLSS, we might even see playable 60 FPS at 4K resolution with DLSS enabled. But to be realistic, 1440p game titles would be the sweet spot for this graphics card.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Cards Price & Availability\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 was launched at $499 US but its refreshes have really messed up the prices. The RTX 3070 Ti launched at $599 US, a $100 US premium over the standard model but not offering a big enough performance boost to make the extra $ worth it.\nNVIDIA really needs to secure more gamers in the $500 US segment but they have to deliver a product that's worth the price. The RTX 2070 and RTX 3070 were a little underwhelming & while they did manage to close the gap with the previous-gen flagship, they still couldn't recapture the glory of the GTX 1070 which was a good bit ahead of the flagship Titan's that preceded it or the absolutely amazing price point of the GTX 970. With the performance leaps that are expected from the Ada Lovelace architecture, the RTX 4070 has the potential to become one stellar graphics card option in the $500 US price range. Also, if NVIDIA can simply ignore the refresh and give us a full-fat GA104 configuration at the $500 price point, that would be an insane value and one of the best graphics card in its class for some time to come.\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards are rumored for a mid-July reveal and a launch is expected in Q3 2022 so we will know for sure what NVIDIA is up to in the next few months.\nNVIDIA GeForce GPU Segment/Tier Prices\n\n\n\nGraphics Segment2023-20242022-20232021-20222020-20212019-20202018-20192017-20182016-20172014-2016\n\n\n\n\nTitan TierGeForce RTX 4090GeForce RTX 4090GeForce RTX 3090 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3090GeForce RTX 3090Titan RTX (Turing)Titan V (Volta)Titan Xp (Pascal)Titan X (Pascal)Titan X (Maxwell)\n\n\nPrice$1599 US$1599 US$1999 US\n$1499 US$1499 US$2499 US$2999 US$1199 US$1199 US$999 US\n\n\nUltra Enthusiast TierGeForce RTX 4080 SUPERGeForce RTX 4080GeForce RTX 3080 TiGeForce RTX 3080 TiGeForce RTX 2080 TiGeForce RTX 2080 TiGeForce GTX 1080 TiGeForce GTX 980 TiGeForce GTX 980 Ti\n\n\nPrice$999 US$1199 US$1199 US$1199 US$999 US$999 US$699 US$649 US$649 US\n\n\nEnthusiast TierGeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPERGeForce RTX 4070 TiGeForce RTX 3080 12 GBGeForce RTX 3080 10 GBGeForce RTX 2080 SUPERGeForce RTX 2080GeForce GTX 1080GeForce GTX 1080GeForce GTX 980\n\n\nPrice$799 US$799 US$799 US$699 US$699 US$699 US$549 US$549 US$549 US\n\n\nHigh-End TierGeForce RTX 4070 SUPER\nGeForce RTX 4070GeForce RTX 4070\nGeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16 GBGeForce RTX 3070 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3070GeForce RTX 3070 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3070GeForce RTX 2070 SUPERGeForce RTX 2070GeForce GTX 1070GeForce GTX 1070GeForce GTX 970\n\n\nPrice$599\n$549$599 US\n$499 US$599\n$499$599\n$499$499 US$499 US$379 US$379 US$329 US\n\n\nMainstream TierGeForce RTX 4060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 4060GeForce RTX 4060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 4060GeForce RTX 3060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3060 12 GBGeForce RTX 3060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3060 12 GBGeForce RTX 2060 SUPER\nGeForce RTX 2060\nGeForce GTX 1660 Ti\nGeForce GTX 1660 SUPER\nGeForce GTX 1660GeForce GTX 1060GeForce GTX 1060GeForce GTX 1060GeForce GTX 960\n\n\nPrice$449\n$299$399 US\n$299 US$399 US\n$329 US$399 US\n$329 US$399 US\n$349 US\n$279 US\n$229 US\n$219 US$249 US$249 US$249 US$199 US\n\n\nEntry TierRTX 3050 8 GB\nRTX 3050 6 GBRTX 3050RTX 3050GTX 1650 SUPER\nGTX 1650GTX 1650 SUPER\nGTX 1650GTX 1050 Ti\nGTX 1050GTX 1050 Ti\nGTX 1050GTX 950GTX 750 Ti\nGTX 750\n\n\nPrice$229\n$179$249 US$249 US$159 US\n$149 US$159 US\n$149 US$139 US\n$109 US$139 US\n$109 US$149 US$149 US\n$119 US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series graphics card are you looking forward to the most?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti (48 GB 600W)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 (24 GB 450W)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 (16 GB 340W)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 (12 GB 285W)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 (8 GB 235W)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 (8 GB 150W)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n153\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n87\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n75\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales;

O\u2019Riordan\non 05 MAY 2022\nin Amazon Braket, Announcements, Quantum Technologies\nPermalink\n Share\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, Amazon Braket, the fully-managed quantum computing service from AWS, launched Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs to provide customers a convenient way to run hybrid algorithms without worrying about managing the underlying infrastructure. With features such as priority access to quantum processing units (QPUs), Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs is designed for lower latency and faster runtime for applications such as variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA), or quantum machine learning (QML). Hybrid algorithms that combine quantum and classical resources are particularly important because today\u2019s quantum computers are highly sensitive to errors, which limits the size of useful computations that can be performed on these devices.\nAt this early stage of the technology, often dubbed the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, researchers exploring potential future applications of quantum computing are rapidly turning to this hybrid approach. This technique is inspired by machine learning, where a quantum algorithm iteratively \u201clearns\u201d by adjusting the circuit parameters via a classical optimization loop, to minimize the detrimental impact of errors in the computation.\nQuantum circuit simulators, which can simulate quantum devices in an idealized, noise-free setting offer an alternative to customers interested in investigating the convergence of hybrid algorithms, innovating better compilation techniques and identifying promising architectures to achieve the best performance in the NISQ era.\nA fundamental challenge with this approach, however, is that as researchers explore more advanced algorithms that require hundreds of thousands of circuit iterations to achieve desired performance, algorithm runtimes can often stretch to hours. While simulators offer the benefit of being always available, customers need a way to experiment and iterate even faster.\nToday, we are excited to announce that Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs now supports five high-performance embedded circuit simulators, which are available in the same container as your application code. As part of this launch, we support the high-performance lightning.qubit and lightning.gpu simulators from PennyLane, the latter of which is powered by the NVIDIA cuQuantum SDK, which comes with state-of-the-art features such as native GPU support for adjoint differentiation. These methods have significantly lower memory usage and can reduce the number of circuit executions required for your variational algorithm to converge by as much as 90%. Fewer circuit executions mean fewer round-trips between your algorithm code and the simulator, hence faster runtimes.\nFurthermore, by allowing you to scale-out your computation across several CPU or GPU instances, you can seamlessly take advantage of the elasticity of the cloud to run your algorithms, and in particular, accelerate your simulations, while still only paying for what you use. For certain problems such as QML, PennyLane\u2019s lightning.gpu simulator on NVIDIA GPUs can reduce algorithm runtimes by up to 100X when compared to running on your local laptop. Figure 1 shows the user workflow with Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs with QPUs, on-demand simulators and the newly launched embedded simulators.\n\n\nFigure 1. Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs architecture: You can use the Amazon Braket console, a notebook instance, or local integrated development environment (IDE) to call the Braket Hybrid Jobs API. Amazon Braket Hybrid jobs spins up a jobs container which hosts your algorithm code. In the top flow, the Jobs container then communicates with an on-demand simulator (SV1, DM1, TN1) or a QPU via a Braket API call. In the bottom flow, the simulator is embedded directly within the Jobs container, and can be distributed across multiple CPU or GPU instances to accelerate the job. Job results are stored in Amazon S3, while logs and metrics can be accessed via Amazon CloudWatch.\n\nEmbedded simulation with Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs\nAmazon Braket, NVIDIA, and PennyLane share the vision that accelerating research in quantum algorithms means providing customers with tools to simulate advanced algorithms faster, which requires a relentless focus on removing bottlenecks that can slow down algorithm convergence.\nIn March, NVIDIA released cuQuantum, a set of libraries for accelerating quantum circuit simulations on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs, and in collaboration with Xanadu, announced a new\u00a0GPU-accelerated simulator for PennyLane\u00a0called\u00a0lightning.gpu. Under\u00a0lightning.gpu\u2019s hood is cuStateVec, cuQuantum\u2019s state vector simulation library, which allows the flexible simulation of deep and highly entangled quantum circuits. Coupled with PennyLane\u2019s\u00a0lightning.gpu, and accessible through Amazon Braket, cuQuantum accelerates computationally intensive simulation workflows in quantum chemistry, quantum machine learning, and more, by orders of magnitude compared to CPU simulation. By seamlessly integrating machine learning frameworks in PennyLane with performant quantum circuit simulations on GPUs via cuQuantum, you can now experience high performance in quantum applications research.\nA key benefit of the pay-for-what-you-use model is that you have the freedom to accelerate your workloads even more by taking advantage of distributed computing. This is particularly crucial for algorithms such as QML, where GPUs can compute gradients in parallel. With this launch, you only need to bring your algorithm code. You can now seamlessly parallelize your hybrid algorithms across multiple GPU instances such as the p3.16xlarge instances by only changing a few lines of code. Amazon Braket handles the heavy lifting of setting up the distributed environment, managing node-to-node communication, speeding up the overall algorithm runtime by executing multiple circuits in parallel.\nAccelerate a QML workload with cuQuantum and PennyLane\nTo see the benefits of embedded simulators in action, let\u2019s consider an example from QML, which is an active area of research today. Traditional machine learning is a two-step process where a model first learns the best set of parameters that fit the input data (training), and then makes decisions on unseen data using those parameters (inference). In QML, data is often encoded as amplitudes of a quantum state, and quantum circuits play the role of the model. While quantum circuits of n qubits can speed up data processing in principle by encoding 2n\u00a0amplitudes, the errors prevalent in NISQ-era devices limit researchers\u2019 ability to explore advanced hybrid algorithms. With this launch, Amazon Braket enables customers to experiment with advanced QML algorithms through embedded simulators.\nLet\u2019s see this in action by considering the QML approach to a workload such as binary classification, a canonical use case for machine learning, spanning problems such as spam email identification to credit card fraud detection. The dataset used for this demonstration is the SONAR classification dataset from the UCI repository of benchmark machine learning datasets. It consists of 208 rows with 60 features and is modeled using a quantum neural network (QNN). The QNN is modeled as a quantum circuit (sometimes referred to as the hidden layer in classical machine learning) sandwiched between a dense classical input and output layer. Running this algorithm on 24-26 qubits would require evaluating nearly 200K circuits per iteration or epoch using a method such as the parameter-shift rule. By contrast, by leveraging the adjoint method available with the lightning simulators, this reduces the number down to a few hundred circuits.\n\n\nFigure 2. Figure showing the total training time per iteration/epoch (left panel) and costs per epoch (right panel) as a function of qubit count. The training was performed using c5.18xlarge CPU instances and p3.16xlarge instances, each with 8 GPUs. For parallel processing (labeled DP above), 1 and 4 p3.16xlarge instances were used.\n\nAs shown in the left panel of Figure 2 (dotted/red line), even with the performance benefits of the adjoint method, algorithm runtimes can stretch to several hours on a single instance as the qubit count increases. By leveraging the lightning.gpu simulator accelerated with cuQuantum SDK (dashed-dotted line), you can speed-up training by 10X. These results are obtained using a single p3.16.xlarge instance, which is powered by NVIDIA\u2019s V100 Tensor Core GPU to deliver high throughput and low latency. By lowering algorithm runtimes, these GPU instances deliver improved price-performance compared to CPUs, allowing you to push the boundaries of research on hybrid algorithms at a cost of only a few US dollars. Furthermore, as the dashed and solid black lines show, Amazon Braket\u2019s support for executing circuits in parallel allows you to take full advantage of multiple GPUs within a single instance, or across multiple instances to further reduce algorithm runtimes by another factor of 10, with little to no extra cost.\nConclusion\nResearch into hybrid quantum/classical algorithms is an important paradigm in the NISQ era of quantum computing where real-world applications of quantum computers are being explored. With the launch of embedded simulators for Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs, you can continue to push the boundaries of research and experiment more rapidly on hybrid quantum/classical algorithms by using performance-optimized software-based simulators from PennyLane powered by NVIDIA.

While we had previously heard about a Q3 2022 launch and September being a likely launch timeframe for next-gen cards, it looks like that may change and the launch could take place between July and August 2022.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\nQ3 early\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) May 15, 2022\n\nNVIDIA is so far finished with its desktop graphics cards within the Ampere GeForce RTX 30 series lineup. The last and most recent entry was the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti which brings the refresh to a close and we can now move forward to the next generation of gaming graphics cards. As for when the launch might take place, it looks like NVIDIA will host its own event since Gamescom 2022 is at the end of August and the rumor states early Q3. Also, It is very likely that we will not hear about any next-generation gaming products at Computex 2022 from NVIDIA. The reason is that NVIDIA has a huge marketing campaign planned for the post-unveil which includes teasers and clues, etc.\n\nThe graphics giant won't want to miss on the opportunity of building up hype by talking about the next-generation cards at Computex which is just a few weeks away. With that said, what we've seen so far in terms of leaks seems to point out that Ampere is shaping up to be a huge deal and can be as significant as the jump from Maxwell to Pascal. The GPU, the graphics card specs, and the power figures, all look insane now it's up to NVIDIA to price them right. But given that they are going to use the bleeding TSMC 4N process node, it is unlikely that we will get prices better than this gen.\nhttps://twitter.com/greymon55/status/1525832014955368448\nThere are also reports that the other team, AMD, has also made some changes to its RDNA 3 Navi 3X launch schedule. The previous aiming for a Q4 2022 launch for Navi 33 and 1H 2023 for the chiplet variants, it looks like the recent design changes may allow AMD to start production on the chips much earlier which could also be one reason why NVIDIA has moved its lineup ahead to Q3. Anyways, it looks like next-generation NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards are coming to us soon and we can't wait to see them in action!\nNVIDIA Ada Lovelace & Ampere GPU Comparison\n\n\n\nAda Lovelace GPUSMsCUDA CoresGraphics Card SeriesMemory BusAmpere GPUSMsCUDA CoresTop SKUMemory BusSM Increase (% Over Ampere)\n\n\n\n\nAD10214418432RTX 4090?384-bitGA1028410752RTX 3090 Ti384-bit+71%\n\n\nAD1038410752RTX 4080?256-bitGA103S607680RTX 3080 Ti256-bit+40%\n\n\nAD104607680RTX 4070?192-bitGA104486144RTX 3070 Ti256-bit+25%\n\n\nAD106364608RTX 4060?128-bitGA106303840RTX 3060192-bit+20%\n\n\nAD107243072RTX 4050?128-bitGA107202560RTX 3050128-bit+20%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich next-generation GPUs are you looking forward to the most?\n\n\n AMD RDNA 3 (Navi 3X Radeon RX GPUs)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA Ada Lovelace (GeForce RTX GPUs)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Intel ARC Alchemist  (ARC Graphics Cards)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n153\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n87\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n75\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Rather, they deal with a similar but smaller crypto-driven bump in GPU sales back in 2017.\nThe agency's full order (PDF) goes into more detail. During its 2018 fiscal year, Nvidia reported increases in its GPU sales but did not disclose that those sales were being driven by cryptocurrency miners. The SEC alleges that Nvidia knew these sales were being driven by the relatively volatile cryptocurrency market and that Nvidia didn't disclose that information to investors, misleading them about the company's prospects for future growth.\nNvidia did\u00a0disclose how cryptocurrency mining was affecting other segments of its business\u2014the company\u00a0made and sold some GPUs marketed exclusively to cryptocurrency miners. This created an impression that Nvidia was being transparent about the impact of cryptocurrency mining on its overall business, even though those CMP products didn't stop people from buying regular GeForce gaming GPUs to use for cryptocurrency mining.\nNvidia has not admitted fault but has \"agreed to a cease-and-desist order and to pay a $5.5 million penalty,\" the order says.\nIf you want to know why this failure to disclose might upset investors, recall the aftermath of the 2017-era crypto bubble, when Nvidia missed earnings expectations and lost billions in stock market value because of a collapse in demand for GPUs. The popping of that cryptomining bubble also led to a glut of inventory that retailers had trouble moving, even after price cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Things aren\u2019t \u201cback to normal\u201d yet, but GPU prices are steadily falling\n          \n\n            You still can't find things for MSRP, but prices are way down from their peaks.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Listing image:\n    Getty Images\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n      Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with a focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of operating systems like Windows and macOS.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Editor\u2019s note: This post is a part of our Meet the Omnivore series, which features individual creators and developers who use NVIDIA Omniverse to accelerate their 3D workflows and create virtual worlds.\nEdward McEvenue\nEdward McEvenue grew up making claymations in LEGO towns. Now, he\u2019s creating photorealistic animations in virtual cities, drawing on more than a decade of experience in the motion graphics industry.\nThe Toronto-based 3D artist learned about NVIDIA Omniverse, a 3D design collaboration and world simulation platform, a few months ago on social media. Within weeks he was using it to build virtual cities.\nMcEvenue used the Omniverse Create app to make a 3D representation of New York City, composed of 32 million polygons:\n\nAnd for the following scene, he animated a high-rise building with fracture-and-reveal visual effects:\n\nLight reflects off the building\u2019s glass windows photorealistically, and vehicles whiz by in a physically accurate way \u2014 thanks to ray tracing and path tracing enabled by RTX technology, as well as Omniverse\u2019s physics-based simulation capabilities.\nMcEvenue\u2019s artistic process incorporates many third-party applications, including Autodesk 3ds Max for modeling and animation; Epic Games Unreal Engine for scene layout; tyFlow for visual effects and particle simulations; Redshift and V-Ray for rendering; and Adobe After Effects for post-production compositing.\nAll of these tools can be connected seamlessly in Omniverse, which is built on Pixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description, an easily extensible, open-source 3D scene description and file format.\nReal-Time Rendering and Multi-App Workflows\nEDSTUDIOS, McEvenue\u2019s freelance company, creates 3D animations and motion graphics for films, advertisements and other visual projects.\nHe says Omniverse helps shave a week off his average delivery time for projects, since it eliminates the need to send animations to a separate render farm, and allows him to bring in assets from his favorite design applications.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge relief to finally feel like rendering isn\u2019t a bottleneck for creativity anymore,\u201d McEvenue said. \u201cWith Omniverse\u2019s real-time rendering capabilities, you get instant feedback, which is incredibly freeing for the artistic process as it allows creators to focus time and energy into making their designs rather than facing long waits for the beautiful images to display.\u201d\nA virtual representation of the ancient sculpture \u2018Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons\u2019 \u2014 made by McEvenue with Autodesk 3ds Max, Unreal Engine 5 and Omniverse Create.\nMcEvenue says he can output more visuals on one computer running Omniverse faster than he previously could with nine. He uses an NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti GPU and NVIDIA Studio Drivers to accelerate his workflow.\nIn addition to freelance projects, McEvenue has worked on commercial campaigns across Canada, the U.S. and Uganda as a co-founder of the film production company DAY JOB.\n\u201cOmniverse takes away a lot of the friction in dealing with exporting formats, recreating shaders or linking materials,\u201d McEvenue said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very intuitively designed, so it\u2019s incredibly easy to get up and running.\u201d\nWatch a Twitch stream replay that dives deeper into McEvenue\u2019s workflow, as well as highlights the launch of the Unreal Engine 5 Omniverse Connector:\n\nJoin In on the Creation\nCreators across the world can download NVIDIA Omniverse for free, and enterprise teams can use the platform for their 3D projects.\nJoin the #MadeInMachinima contest, running through June 27, for a chance to win the latest NVIDIA Studio laptop.\nLearn more about Omniverse by watching GTC sessions on demand \u2014 featuring visionaries from the Omniverse team, Adobe, Autodesk, Bentley Systems, Epic Games, Pixar, Unity, Walt Disney Studios and more.\nConnect your workflows to Omniverse with software from Adobe, Autodesk, Epic Games, Maxon, Reallusion and more.\nFollow Omniverse on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and Medium for additional resources and inspiration.

What better characterisation for the latest tippity-top-of-the-line GPU from Nvidia, who\u2019ve already produced the best graphics card for 4K in the RTX 3080? But rather than be overwhelmed by its power, I personally feel more like the RTX 3090 Ti is trying to trick, tempt and seduce me, Old Testament-style. \u201cRecommend meeeee\u201d it whispers, coasting through another maximum settings benchmark. \u201cTell evvvvvvveryone these frame rates are totally worth \u00a31879.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut I can\u2019t. Sorry. While I am a sucker for go-faster gear, the RTX 3090 Ti is just too far of a stretch, with its sometimes imperceptible performance differences to the \u00a31399 RTX 3090 and a tendency towards impractically gigantic partner card models.\r\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 New PC Games For May 2022\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti specs:\n\nCUDA Cores: 10,753\nBase Clock Speed: 1670MHz\nBoost Clock Speed: 1890MHz (as tested, stock is 1860MHz)\nVRAM: 24GB GDDR6X\nPower: 450W\nRecommended System Power: 850W\nPrice: From \u00a31899 / $2084\n\nI\u2019ll say this for the RTX 3090 Ti, though: it\u2019s not hard to find in stock, even if you can probably guess why. That \u00a31879 starting price gets you Nvidia\u2019s own Founders Edition ($2000 in the States), and the customised Zotac GeForce RTX 3090 Ti AMP Extreme Holo that I\u2019ve been testing is just a snip more at \u00a31899 / $2084. This model overclocks the GPU\u2019s already sky-high boost clock speed to 1890MHz, and because this uses a completely unrestrained version of Nvidia\u2019s GA102 processor, it can take advantage of all 10,753 cores. That's 256 more than the RTX 3090, which also has a lower stock boost clock of 1695MHz. Both cards come with 24GB of GDDR6X memory, far too much for any PC game to need, but the RTX 3090 Ti claims a slightly faster memory clock of 21Gbps to its junior\u2019s 20Gbps.\r\n\n\r\nIt\u2019s fast, basically, and here Zotac have made sure all those bunched-up cores don\u2019t get too toasty with a massive triple-fan cooler. After trying to find the money for it, this may prove to be your second problem with ever owning an RTX 3090 Ti: a lot of models are so  long that they\u2019ll struggle to fit inside a lot of conventional mid-tower cases. The Founders Edition isn\u2019t too excessive \u2013 it apparently measures the same as the RTX 3090 Founders Edition, 313mm \u2013 but this Zotac card I\u2019ve got is an immense 356mm long, enough that I had to detach my test rig\u2019s CPU cooler radiator and fans before it would fit in the NZXT H510 case. \r\n\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not just Zotac: Gigabyte, MSI, and Asus all make RTX 3090 Ti variants that exceed 320mm in length. Never has checking one\u2019s GPU clearances been so important.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nThe RTX 3090 Ti\u2019s power demands are steep, too. It even out-chugs the RTX 3090, for which Nvidia recommends a 750W PSU to fuel its 350W rated power usage: the RTX 3090 Ti instead wants an 850W PSU, and is rated at 450W. 450W for a single component! And it had better be a relatively high-end PSU with extra cables, as it needs three PCIe eight-pin connectors to slot into the included power adapter, not the usual one or two. \r\n\n\r\nAt least in the AMP Extreme Holo\u2019s case, some excesses have been curbed. With the caveat that my PC case\u2019s side panel was off, thanks to the displaced CPU cooler, core temperatures maxed out at 70\u00b0c, which is actually a very healthy level. And it runs quietly enough: after a spell of heavy load, I recorded the fans at 49dB from a 15cm distance, which won\u2019t be loud enough to overpower your desktop speakers or any of the best gaming headsets. Again, that\u2019s just with the side panel off, where it can\u2019t block any of the whirring as it normally would.\r\n\n\r\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti review: 4K benchmarks\r\n\n\r\nI haven\u2019t tested the just-announced AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT, so can\u2019t say if this the RTX 3090 Ti is the quickest gaming graphics card on the market, but it\u2019s surely in the top two. And 4K is its natural habitat \u2013 at this punishing resolution, it can still run just about anything at 60fps or higher, even on the highest possible graphics settings. Ray tracing can take its usual toll, but with some upscaling help from DLSS, the RTX 3090 Ti is never far from a slick frame rate.\r\n\nThe RPS test PC:\n\nCPU: Intel Core i5-11600K\nRAM: 16GB Corsair Vengeance LPX\nMotherboard: Asus TUF Gaming Z590-Plus WiFi\nPSU: Corsair RM850x\n\n\r\nTake Metro Exodus, one of the toughest games in our benchmark lineup. At 4K with the Ultra preset, it averaged a slick 83fps, and adding Ultra-quality ray tracing only dropped it to 53fps. DLSS then brought it back up to 75fps, ray tracing and all, with no noticeable loss to sharpness. Fine stuff.\r\n\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn also got a juicy DLSS bonus, with a combination of the Ultimate preset and Ultra-quality upscaling averaging 124fps. Not that this was strictly necessary, though, as even without DLSS the RTX 3090 Ti got 98fps out of the Ultimate preset as-is. Those with 144Hz and 120Hz monitors may join me in temptation after seeing results like 135fps in Hitman 3\u2019s Dubai benchmark, 159fps in Forza Horizon 4 and 75fps in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, all with their highest possible settings and without upscaling. \r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nThe RTX 3090 Ti also ploughed its way to 73fps in Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla and 75fps in Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey, both using their respective Ultra High presets, while Watch Dogs Legion got another 73fps with its own Ultra High setting. With the addition of Ultra-quality ray traced shadows this fell to 39fps, which isn\u2019t ideal, but Quality DLSS bumped it up to the magic number that is 60fps. Back on Shadow of the Tomb Raider, it\u2019s possible keep a high FPS and use the best quality ray tracing by lowering the SMAA setting from x4 to x1 \u2013 this got me 72fps on average \u2013 but DLSS is superior, as it overrode the game\u2019s own anti-aliasing to produce 103fps. To reiterate how strong the RTX 3090 Ti is: that\u2019s with the Highest quality preset and Ultra-quality ray tracing.\r\n\n\nFinal Fantasy XV also had a top-notch showing, averaging 61fps with the Highest preset and all bonus effects (like Nvidia HairWorks) turned on. With DLSS, that crept up to an even smoother 75fps. Total War: Three Kingdoms doesn\u2019t support upscaling, but the RTX 3090 Ti still became the first graphics card we\u2019ve tested to reach a 60fps average in the Battle benchmark while using Ultra quality settings. \r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nWhat takes the sheen of these results, however, is that most of them just aren\u2019t that far ahead of what the RTX 3090 has been pumping out since 2020. 60fps for Three Kingdoms is indeed great \u2013 but the RTX 3090 got 55fps with the same CPU. Is it really worth paying 35% more for 10% better performance, especially at higher frame rates where it\u2019s harder to tell the difference?\r\n\n\r\nThat\u2019s not the only single-digit advantage, either. The RTX 3090 also averaged 62fps in Watch Dogs Legion, a mere 8fps less than the RTX 3090 Ti, and the former\u2019s 35fps with ray tracing suggests the newer GPU isn\u2019t meaningfully better at handling those premium effects. The RTX 3090 also produced 79fps in Metro Exodus, hard to tell apart from the RTX 3090 Ti\u2019s 83fps.\r\n\n\r\nThen there\u2019s arguably the best-value 4K graphics card, the RTX 3080. With 57fps in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 68fps in Metro Exodus, 130fps in Forza Horizon 4, and 74fps in Horizon Zero Dawn \u2013 all on their respective maximum settings \u2013 it\u2019s awfully close to the RTX 3090 Ti for a GPU that now costs less than half as much.\r\n\n\r\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti review: 1440p benchmarks\r\n\n\r\nOn pure and simple FPS numbers, the RTX 3090 Ti does appear to gain a more substantial lead over its fellow RTX cards at 1440p. But it does so when all three are pushing high enough frame rates that the difference still won\u2019t be all that noticeable.\r\n\n\r\nMetro Exodus is again a prime example. On 1440p / Ultra, the RTX 3090 Ti averaged 116fps, which is 13fps more than the RTX 3090 and 23fps higher than the RTX 3080. A keen eye could discern the latter, but a 13fps difference above 100fps? That\u2019s nowhere near as stark as it would be when comparing, say, 30fps and 43fps.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nThere\u2019s no denying that, on the RTX 3090 Ti, Shadow of the Tomb Raider looks superb when running at 144fps with its Highest settings, Ultra-quality ray tracing and Quality DLSS all in play. The same goes for Watch Dogs Legion, which at 1440p got 93fps with the Ultra preset and 73fps with a combination of Ultra ray tracing and Quality DLSS. But diminishing returns are real, and the visual advantage over the cheaper cards just isn\u2019t there, even if the figures suggest otherwise. And sometimes they just don\u2019t: the RTX 3090\u2019s equivalent Watch Dogs Legion results were 81fps and 65fps respectively, so the Ti version only secures you an extra 8fps with Quality DLSS.\r\n\n\r\nTotal War: Three Kingdoms is a little better, its 120fps average on Ultra quality besting the RTX 3090 by 15fps and the RTX 3080 by 28fps. But for games that are generally less demanding, the case for the RTX 3090 Ti gets even weaker: it scored 179fps in Forza Horizon 4 on Ultra, but then the RTX 3080 scored 150fps, and even on a 240Hz monitor the difference in experience is hardly proportional to the difference in price.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nPartly why that\u2019s such a shame is that it\u2019d be nice to celebrate the RTX 3090 Ti\u2019s record-setting results without such caveats. Results like 87fps in Final Fantasy with all the settings trimmings, or 142fps in Ultimate-quality Horizon Zero Dawn up to 149fps with DLSS), or 103fps in Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla on Ultra High, or 212fps in Hitman 3\u2019s Dubai benchmark on Ultra. There\u2019s just nothing that leaves the other GPUs completely in the dust.\r\n\n\r\n Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti review: 1080p benchmarks\r\n\n\r\nI\u2019m gonna burn through these quickly, because spending two grand-ish on a graphics card only to play at 1080p is like hiring a personal teppanyaki chef to feed you turkey dinosaurs. Still, in the interests of completionism, at this res the RTX 3090 Ti breezed to 161fps in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 152fps in Total War: Three Kingdoms, 96fps in Final Fantasy XV, 180fps in Forza Horizon 4, 126fps in Metro Exodus, 153fps in Horizon Zero Dawn, 120fps in Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, 98fps in Watch Dogs Legion, and 215fps in Hitman 3\u2019s Dubai test. That\u2019s all with their respective maximum settings (including HairWorks and TurfEffects for Final Fantasy XV), though without any ray tracing. Slapping this on, at the best quality setting possible but without DLSS (which doesn\u2019t look so good at 1080p), got me 111fps in Metro Exodus and 73fps in Watch Dogs Legion.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nSome of these, especially Hitman 3 and Watch Dogs Legion, are only a hair faster than at 1440p \u2013 a sign that it\u2019s the test PC\u2019s Intel Core i5-11600K starting to cap performance, not the GPU. In other words, don\u2019t get this card for 1080p. Honestly. \r\n\n\r\nShould you get it for any resolution, though? There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with wanting the best, and for all my grumbling about value, I myself blew \u00a31399 on an RTX 3090 early in 2021 (back, in my defence, when the RTX 3080 cost almost as much). So I get the appeal. If anything, part of me craves the RTX 3090 Ti well \u2013 a little bit of logic always goes out the window when dealing with something this extravagant.\r\n\n\r\nNot all of it, mind, and deep down it\u2019s clear that the RTX 3090 Ti is not a smart buy. It\u2019s no longer necessary to pay cretinous resellers for the RTX 3080, which is only modestly slower, and the RTX 3090 is still available if you've got cash to burn and want to get over the 100fps mark more reliably. \r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nThe RTX 3090 Ti will deliver the fleeting pleasure of owning something that\u2019s technically even better, assuming you can fit it in your chassis. But once the faux-prestige falls away all it can really offer are a small handful of barely-visible frames per second and a fatter dent into funds that could go towards other impactful PC upgrades, like a new SSD or one of the best gaming CPUs. To say nothing of the upcoming AMD Radeon RX 7000 series, Nvidia\u2019s own next-gen GPUs, and the first Intel Arc graphics cards, all of which are set to launch this very year and could well offer even more alternatives for smooth high-res play.
