As of 11:21 a.m. ET, the stock was still down 3.5%.\nWhile the chipmaker was no doubt caught up in a down day for technology stocks, bearish comments by a couple of Wall Street analysts weighed further on its share price.\nSo what\nBarclays analyst Blayne Curtis lowered his price target on Nvidia to $200, down from $295, while maintaining his overweight (buy) rating on the stock, according to The Fly. The analyst is downplaying recent gains on the semiconductor space, believing there are more declines to come.\u00a0\nIn a note to clients on Monday, Curtis posited the rebound is a \"head fake,\" further suggesting that a \"large cut to earnings\" will happen during the next 12 to 18 months.\u00a0\nCurtis isn't the only one sounding the alarm. Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore was even more cautious, writing, \"The ongoing 'purgatory' stage of the semiconductor cycle continues to be in full effect as we head into [second quarter 2022] earnings season.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow what\nIt will be another month before Nvidia shares the results of its most recent quarter, so the musings of an analyst or two about the direction of the broader sector may or may not have a significant impact on the company's results.\nIf Nvidia's prior results are any indication, however, things may not be as bad as analysts are painting them. For its fiscal 2023 first quarter (ended May 1, 2022), the company generated record quarterly revenue of $8.29 billion, up 46% year over year. Excluding the one-time charge for the termination of the Arm acquisition, profits were equally impressive, as adjusted earnings per share of $1.36 climbed 49%.\u00a0\nEven if Nvidia falls victim to the trends weighing on the broader semiconductor industry, the future looks bright. The company is the undisputed leader in the discrete desktop GPU market with an 81% share in the first quarter. Furthermore, Nvidia is the go-to processor for cloud computing and data center operators, which is the company's fastest-growing business.\nNvidia stock has lost half its value during the ongoing bear market, which flies in the face of its robust results. Long-term investors will recognize this as an opportunity to get Nvidia shares for a discount.\n\n\n\nDanny Vena has positions in Nvidia. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Nvidia.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Analyst-in-residence, Quantum Computingfor\u00a0Moor Insights and StrategyFollow AuthorJul 12, 2022, 09:00am EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 2 years old.A portion of one of Google\u2019s Cloud TPU v4 Pods                  Google\nDigital transformation is responsible for artificial intelligence workloads being created at an unprecedented scale. These workloads require corporations to collect and store mountains of data. Even as business intelligence is being extracted from current machine learning models, new data inflows are being used to create new models and update existing models.\n\n\nBuilding AI models is complex and expensive. It is also very much different than traditional software development. Artificial intelligence models need specialized hardware for accelerated compute and high-performance storage as well as a purpose-built infrastructure to handle AI\u2019s technical nuances.\n\nIn today's world, many critical business decisions and customer-facing services rely on accurate machine learning insights. To train, run, and scale models as quickly and accurately as possible, an enterprise have the knowledge to choose the best hardware and software for its machine learning applications.\n\n\nBenchmarking\nML CommonsML Commons\nMLCommons is an open engineering consortium that has made it easier for companies to make machine learning decisions with its standardized benchmarking. Its mission is to make machine learning better for everyone. Tests are conducted and unbiased comparisons help companies determine which vendor best suits its artificial intelligence application requirements. The foundation for MLCommons began its first MLPerf benchmarking in 2018.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nMLcommons recently conducted a benchmarking program called MLPerf Training v2.0 to measure the performance of hardware and software used to train machine learning models. There were 250 performance results reported from 21 different submitters, including Azure, Baidu\nBIDU\n\nBIDU\n, Dell, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Google\nGOOG\n\nGOOG\n, Graphcore, HP\nHPQ\n\nHPQ\nE, Inspur, Intel-Habana Labs, Lenovo, Nettrix, NVIDI\nVIDI\n\nNVDA\n\nDIA\n\nVIDI\n\nNVDA\n\nDIA\nA, Samsung, and Supermicro.\n\nThis round of testing focused on determining how long it takes to train various neural networks. Faster model training leads to speedier model deployment, impacting the model\u2019s TCO and ROI.\nA new object detection benchmark was added to MLPerf Training 2.0, which trains the new RetinaNet reference model on a larger and more diverse dataset called Open Images. This new test reflects state-of-the-art ML training for applications like collision avoidance for vehicles and robotics, retail analytics, and many others.\n\n\nResults\nMachine learning has seen much innovation since 2021, both in hardware and software. For the first time since MLPerf began, Google\u2019s cloud based TPU v4 ML supercomputer outperformed NVIDIA A100 in four out of eight training tests covering language (2), computer vision (4), reinforcement learning (1), and recommender systems (1).Higher is better. TPUs demonstrated significant speedup in all five published benchmarks over the ... [+] fastest non-Google submission (NVIDIA on-premises). Taller bars are better. The numbers inside the bars represent the quantity of chips / accelerators used for each of the submissionsGoogle\nAccording to the graphic comparing the performance of Google and NVIDIA, Google had the quickest training times for BERT (language), ResNet (image recognition), RetinaNet (object detection), and MaskRCNN (image recognition). As for DLRM (recommendation), Google came in narrowly ahead of NVIDIA, but this was a research project and unavailable for public use.\nOverall, Google submitted scores for five out of the eight benchmarks, best training times are shown below:Data: MLCommons                                                                         Moor Insights & Strategy\nIn a discussion with Vikram Kasivajhula, Google\u2019s Director of Product Management for ML Infrastructure, I asked what approach Google used to make such dramatic improvements in the TPU v4.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been focusing on addressing the pain points of large model users who are innovating at the frontiers of machine learning,\u201d he said. \u201cOur cloud product is in fact, an instantiation of this focus. We have also been focusing on performance per dollar. As you can imagine, these models get incredibly large and expensive to train. One of our priorities is to make sure it is affordable.\u201d\nA one-of-a-kind submission\nA unique submission was made to MLPerf Training 2.0 by a Stanford graduate student, Tri Dao. Dao submitted an 8-A100 system for BERT training.\nNVIDIA also had a submission using the same configuration as Dao. I suspect it was a courtesy submission by NVIDIA to provide Dao with a documented point of comparison.\nNVIDIA finished training the BERT model with its 8-A100 in 18.442 minutes while Dao\u2019s submission only took 17.402 minutes. He achieved a faster training time by using a method called FlashAttention. Attention is a technique that mimics cognitive attention. The effect enhances some parts of the input data while diminishing other parts \u2014 the motivation is that the network should devote more focus to the small but important parts of the data.\nWrap up\nOver the past three years, Google has made a lot of progress with its TPU. Similarly, NVIDIA has used its A100 successfully for four years. A great deal of software improvement has been put into the A100, as evidenced by its long record of accomplishments.\nWe are likely to see NVIDIA submissions in 2023 using both its A100 and the new H100, a beast by any current standard. Everyone was hoping to see H100 performance this year, but NVIDIA did not submit it since it was not publicly available.\nSoftware improvements in general were obvious in the latest results. Kasivajhula said that hardware was only half the story of Google\u2019s improved benchmarks. The other half was software optimizations.\n\u201cMany optimizations were learned from our own cutting edge benchmark use cases across YouTube and search,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are now making them available to users.\u201d\nGoogle also made several performance improvements to the virtualization stack to fully utilize compute power of both CPU hosts and TPU chips. The results of Google\u2019s software improvements were shown by its peak performance on image and recommendation models.\nOverall, Google cloud TPUs offer significant performance and cost savings at scale. It will take time to find out if the advantages are enough to entice more customers to switch to Google Cloud TPUs.\nLonger term, Google\u2019s top results in the major categories may foreshadow NVIDIA achieving fewer top MLPerf results in the future. It is in the ecosystem\u2019s best interest to see heavy contention among multiple vendors for MLPerf top performance results.\nOne thing is for certain, MLPerf Training 2.0 was much more interesting than in previous rounds when NVIDIA claimed performance victories in almost every category.\nFull results of MLPerf Training 2.0 are available here.\n\nPaul Smith-Goodson is the Vice President and Principal Analyst for quantum computing, artificial intelligence and space at Moor Insights and Strategy.

In it, we said SIC required that each potential competing offer must announce a firm intention to make an offer by 5.00 p.m on July 25. The July 19 Hwa Hong announcement adds that each competing offeror must announce a firm intention to make on offer for the company or confirm to the board that they do not intend to make an offer by 5.00 p.m on July 25.  Sanjuro United, a consortium comprising four entities have made a 40 cents offer per share for Hwa Hong on June 7, which was 8.11% better than the original 37 cents offer. On June 22, a circular with the voluntary general offer of 40 cents was sent to shareholders. On June 8, Hwa Hong announced that Sanjuro's offer is a\u00a0mandatory general offer (MGO) as acceptances and purchases from the market coupled with Sanjuro\u2019s stake crossed 30%.  Based on the fee structure in the June 22 circular, we assumed that any competing offer would need to be better than 40 cents. \"According to the offer circular, Evercore is likely to be paid on a success basis should it obtain a better offer for shareholders and the fees involved are likely to have a negative impact on the current 40 cents offer price,\" we had said. Evercore Asia is the financial adviser tasked by the current Ong directors to undertake a strategic review of the company.  \u201cAs a result of the fees involved, IFA has indicated that estimated Adjusted RNAV of the Group as at 31 December 2021 will need to be reduced by up to approximately $0.0148 per share. Hence, any potential bidder looking to come up with an offer price will need to take into consideration the fees,\u201d we had suggested. Based on the arithmetic, we had assumed any competing offer would need to be above 41.5 cents to make sense to shareholders.  The current Ong directors of Hwa Hong point out that the circular did not state that the financial adviser\u2019s (FA) fees would or are likely to have a negative impact on the revised offer price of 40 cents; they have said that the fees would be borne by the company. Provenance Capital, the independent financial adviser (IFA) to the Hwa Hong board said: \"We note that in the event the offer becomes unconditional in all respects and the above estimated expenses of not more than $9.66 million are incurred, such expenses may have a material and adverse impact on the financial performance of the group for the current year, FY2022, and on the \u2026 estimated Adjusted RNAV of the group as at 31 December 2021 by a reduction of up to approximately $0.0148 per Share.\u201d   Story continues Success fee\u00a0According to Hwa Hong\u2019s latest announcement on July 19, Evercore will be paid a success fee if any offer for Hwa Hong either from Sanjuro or a competing offer goes unconditional. No fees are payable to Evercore if any offer - either from Sanjuro or a competiging offer - is not unconditional.Hwa Hong\u2019s announcement on July 19 says \u201cThe fee structure was intended to create a level playing field for all bidders and differentiating fee structures would have created an unfair advantage for the offeror. The fee structure could not be designed to create an advantage to one bidder over another, or in this case to the offeror versus any other potential interested party.\u201dThe July 19 announcement provides details of the fee structure. \u201cThe actual amount of the FA Fees payable by the company to Evercore will depend on the aggregate value of the consideration received by shareholders from the relevant offeror as at the close of the relevant offer,\u201d the announcement says.In the case of the Sanjuro offer, based on the Revised Offer Price of $0.40 per Share, the FA Fees will range from approximately $4.2 million to $8.4 million (in each case, including GST) and if a competing offer emerges between $0.40 and $0.50, the range of FA Fees would be correspondingly adjusted, the announcement says.The July 19 announcement also points out that the current Ong Directors, who are themselves shareholders, believed that the likelihood of the original Sanjuro offer becoming unconditional as to acceptances was remote. \u201cThis is supported by the fact that: (i) the Original Offer Price of $0.37 per Share falls outside of the IFA\u2019s estimated value range of between $0.40 and $0.43 per Share, and as such would have been inadequate and incapable of being recommended to Shareholders; and (ii) the Sanjuro Offer was unlikely to receive the necessary level of acceptances given the shareholding structure of the Company,\" the announcement says.The announcement adds that that at the point of Evercore\u2019s appointment, Sanjuro and its concert parties owned and controlled only 24.38% of the shares, while 34.57% of the shares were held in public hands, with the remaining 29.26% of the shares held by the current Ong Directors and their immediate family members.The current Ong directors believe that the competitive tension generated from the announcement of Evercore as the company\u2019s financial adviser and Evercore commencing a targeted and intensive exercise were the key considerations which caused the share price of the company to trade beyond the Original Offer Price, which in turn created the impetus for an increase in the Original Offer Price from $0.37 per share to $0.40 per share.Hwa Hong\u2019s share price last traded at $0.40 as at July 18.\u00a0See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore Hwa Hong's IFA says competing offer should consider higher fees  SIC requires Hwa Hong's directors to announce alternative offer by July 25 Sanjuro holds 38.2% of Hwa Hong, extends offer date to Aug 1  Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

Pelosi also bought more than $2 million in Tesla stock in March. Members of Congress are required to publicly disclose all trades made by themselves or their immediate family within 45 days. Sens. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) and Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) introduced a bill in January barring members of Congress and their family members from owning individual stocks, an idea to which Nancy Pelosi has signaled openness. When asked by a reporter last week if her husband ever traded on information provided by her, Pelosi replied: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\nChief Critic\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) called last week for a hearing to crack down on alleged insider trading from lawmakers and their families, citing the Pelosi and Nvidia deal. \u201cSpeaker Pelosi and her husband remain undeterred from cashing in,\u201d Hawley wrote in a letter to the head of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.).\nTangent\nThe Pelosis\u2019 trading activity is viral on social media: a Twitter account titled \u201cNancy Pelosi Stock Tracker\u201d tracking his holdings has 88,000 followers, while TikTok videos on the investments regularly generate millions of views.\n\nFurther Reading\nSenate Passes Bill To Boost U.S. Microchip Production\u2014Here\u2019s What\u2019s In It (Forbes)\n\nPelosi Exercises Tesla Stock Options To Buy $2 Million In Shares (Forbes)\nInside Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Husband\u2019s $5 Million Alphabet Options Windfall (Forbes)\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Derek SaulFollowingEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades"

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorJul 18, 2022, 03:52pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 2 years old.Well, not directly. However, the company is making it easier to develop code for quantum machines using GPUs.\n\nOk, let's face it. Programming quantum computers is hard. REALLY hard. While we do not expect NVIDIA to develop and market their own quantum system any time soon (never say never!), the company is helping developers use GPU\u2019s to simplify the coding task.\n\n\nWhat has NVIDIA announced?\nNVIDIA believes a \u201cbridging\u201d technology can help enable dynamic workflows across different architectures, with CPUs, GPUs, and quantum devices providing a hybrid quantum-classical computer platform. To enable this approach, NVIDIA has launched previews of the NVIDIA Quantum-Optimized Device Architecture (QODA), enabling programming in an integrated hybrid system and workflow.\n\nFor the programmer who wants to do algorithm research and build hybrid applications for future quantum advantage, a bridging technology is needed to enable dynamic workflows across disparate system architectures. The NVIDIA Quantum-Optimized Device Architecture (QODA) is a first-of-its-kind platform for hybrid quantum-classical computers, using CPUs, GPUs, and emulated QPUs to efficiently mimic how a hardware QPU would behave in a programmed situation.\n\nQODA provides an open, unified environment for some of today\u2019s most powerful computers and quantum ... [+] processors, improving scientific productivity and enabling greater scale in quantum research.NVIDIA\n\u201cQODA consists of both a specification and a compiler NVQ++. It delivers a unified programming model designed for quantum processors (either actual or emulated) in a hybrid setting\u2014that is, CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs working together,\u201d said the company.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nQuoda connects to any type of QPU backend, allowing accessibility to all users. Interestingly, NVIDIA has seen a 287X speedup in end-to-end Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) performance with 20 qubits and dramatically improved scaling compared to existing Pythonic frameworks.\n\nQODA features include:\n\n\nKernel-based programming model extending C++ for hybrid quantum-classical systems (full Python support is on the way).\nNative support for GPU hybrid compute, enabling GPU pre- and post-processing and classical optimizations.\nSystem-level compiler toolchain featuring split compilation with NVQ++ compiler for quantum kernels, lowering to Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) and Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR).\nStandard library of quantum algorithmic primitives\nInteroperable with partner QPUs as well as simulated QPUs using the cuQuantum GPU platform; partnering with QPU builders across many e different qubit types\n\n\n\n\nPartners include several supercomputer centers including NERSC, J\u00fclich, and Oak Ridge National Labs, and quantum pioneers Xanadu, Pasqal, Quantinuum, and others, however the big developers of QPUs (IBM, QCI, Google, Microsoft, Honeywell and others) seem missing at this time.\nConclusions\nWhile it is unlikely that NVIDIA will build a quantum computer any time soon, if ever, the company\u2019s GPUs and parallel software expertise can certainly help developers move forward to a time when a quantum computer can produce results that are superior to \u201ctraditional\u201d (i.e., digital) computer systems. Quoda is another example of NVIDIA\u2019s software and integrated systems approach that can deliver far more than its competitors who have only recently been able to match a 2 year old GPU in a few select benchmarks.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Taiwan Semiconductor Inc. (TSMC) has become the dominant force globally in the contract chipmaking sector, and Intel is keen on regaining the market share that it has lost in recent decades. If the CHIPS Act passes, Intel will move forward with an initial investment of $20 billion into a new Ohio \"mega site\" fab (up to $100 billion could eventually be invested in the site).But some in the U.S. semiconductor industry feel that the version of the CHIPS Act, which is set to be voted on as early as tomorrow by the Senate, unfairly benefits Intel. According to Reuters, the $52 billion in subsidies and tax benefits afforded by the bill will provide the bulk of the benefits to companies like Intel. Intel designs and manufactures the majority of its semiconductors, and the CHIPS Act heavily favors offsetting the cost of building new fabs in the U.S.\u00a0Other major U.S.-based companies that design and manufacture their own chips include Micron and Texas Instruments.A separate FABS Act (which has bipartisan support) would offer up to a 25% tax credit for the construction of fabs and the manufacturing equipment necessary to operate the facilities.\u00a0(Image credit: Intel)However, Intel's most direct competition in the client computing, graphics, and server/HPC markets comes from AMD and NVIDIA. While AMD and NVIDIA are U.S.-based and design their own microprocessors, they contract outside firms like TSMC and Samsung to produce their chips. As a result, they wouldn't be able to reap the full benefits of the $52 billion windfall from the U.S. government.The U.S. House of Representatives is currently debating a version of the FABS Act that would be more beneficial to companies like AMD and NVIDIA, as it would offer tax incentives also covering aspects of semiconductor design. However, even if those provisions were added, Intel still stands to gain the most from the CHIPS and FABS Acts than its peers.\"You have Intel that might get $20 billion with CHIPS Act plus $5 billion or $10 billion under the FABS Act,\" said an official for one unnamed Intel competitor that is opposed to the soon-to-be-voted upon version of the CHIPS and FABS Acts. \"So, $30 billion goes to your direct competitor, and you don't get a penny? That's going to cause problems in the market.\"Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has aggressively pushed for the CHIPS Act to pass, and has even threatened to back out of the Ohio fab if the package fails. \"We've made super clear to McConnell, to the Democrats, to the Republicans, that if this doesn't pass, I will change my plans,\" Gelsinger said last week. \"The Europeans have moved forward very aggressively, and they're ready to give us the incentives that allow us to move forward.\"\u00a0Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Gelsinger is referencing $43 billion in subsidies that the European Union is offering to support local manufacturing.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more CPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nCHIPS and Science Act\nSamsung\nMicron\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (54)\n\n\n\nBrandon HillSocial Links NavigationBrandon Hill is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware.

Obviously for favors and influence like this! https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/intel-corp/summary?id=D000000804\nHere's AMD's spending it's very little comparatively: https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/advanced-micro-devices/summary?id=D000023765\nSame with Nvidia, they spend comparatively very little: https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/nvidia-corp/summary?id=D000036303\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetteec\n\n\nConversely, AMD and NVIDIA could also fab their own chips in the USA and get a piece of the action, but they continue to use TSMC. While TSMC has fabs in Arizona, the parent company is located in Taiwan. Depending on the outcome in Ukraine, TSMC could be in crosshairs of a hostile takeover by Beijing. An absence of sufficient semiconductors in the USA is a consumer and national security disaster. Strong US semiconductor manufacturing provides insurance against these supply chain and intellectual property issues that would occur from a Chinese takeover of TSMC, and $52 billion is rather inexpensive to foster innovation, new jobs, and competition. Intel's new US-based fab will create 3000 permanent engineering, technical and administrative jobs, not to mention 7000 construction jobs.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEximo\n\n\nLiquidrider said:Didn't Intel buy up a bunch of TSMC supply? And then on top of it flip flopped on their china stance? Wait didn't they also release their new GPU to China Only?\n\nIntel already receives billions in government subsidies and tax breaks while AMD & Nvidia receive practically nothing. Absolutely insane congress is giving Intel another handout\n\nIntel is doing a slow roll out. The GPUs were built in Asia, so they got to market first to meet their release 'deadline'. The ones headed here were sent by ship, which takes a while and then through customs. They've been ramping up press lately so you should see GPUs on the shelves, probably before the end of the month would be my guess.\n\nUS reviewers have gotten their hands on the A380 and A750 so far.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthestryker\n\n\nI saw this report and rolled my eyes. Intel hardly needs the money either, but if they build fabs in the US that's a benefit in terms of jobs and future sector growth (ex: Ohio is seeing several suppliers coming with Intel) versus just getting a handout which is what the others seem to want. \n\nAs for comparing Intel to AMD and Nvidia: Intel already has around 50k US based employees and while I couldn't find US totals for the other two AMD has around 15.5k and Nvidia has around 22.5k worldwide. It's fair to say that the number of US based is a good amount lower than those figures and giving them a handout wouldn't change anything here.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbigdragon\n\n\nI really hate handouts to huge corporations. We can provide plenty of pork to Intel and other companies, but struggle to maintain the health, nutritional, and housing needs of our people. Intel doesn't need the handout. They're rich and profitable enough already. There are better ways to spend this money.\n\nHowever, getting more fabs built in the US is a huge priority. There should be several fabrication hubs spread around the globe. Concentrating everything in Taiwan was a huge mistake -- one pushed by greedy companies that are peers to Intel. The needs and complaints of companies that helped get us into this supply chain mess and single point of production failure have zero business making any noise about being left out. Ignore them. Keep the focus on building out more fabs here, not rewarding designers who shipped their designs off to cheaper production facilities.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkjfatl\n\n\nThe purpose of the bill is to encourage US manufacturing of IC's AMD and Nividia have the option of getting a US supplier to mate their parts., AMD and Nividia chose to get out of, or never enter the semiconductor fab business. AMD and Nividia could partner with Samsung, Micron, Global Foundries, or even Intel to get back in the Fab business.\n\nIsn't TSMC getting money from this as well?\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeffreyP55\n\n\ngggplaya said:Does no one else know about TSMC's FAB 21 being built in Arizona??? I'm sure it's one of the reason's Intel is building a fab in az as well.I live in Phoenix moving here from the SFBA (silicon valley) to here. Not many have techie skills. Mostly medical, fast food and department stores. Unless workers are imported from wherever. There will be intense. training.\nhttps://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmcs-arizona-fab-construction-emerges-at-breakneck-speed\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 54 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Flower\u2019s beastly 2800W power supply lands at $899 \u2014 enough juice to power a couple of RTX 5090 GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei's Microsoft Windows license for PCs expires this month, company launching PCs with Harmony OS: Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 50-series GPU scalping extends to system integrators \u2014 over $3,000 for a RTX 5090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO gets a $1 million salary plus $68 million in bonuses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNES consoles appear to run faster with age \u2014 APU frequency increased by up to 182 Hz after 35 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech giants call Trump tariffs 'big headache' \u2014 Foxconn CEO teases increased production in US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe week in chip news: Intel gets a new CEO, China chip smuggling, AMD dominates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi Pico powers $75 PicoCalc portable programming handheld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel's new CEO warns employees about 'tough decisions', but Wall Street cheers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI skips RDNA 4 and will not manufacture AMD Radeon 9000-series GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Her mission is to help developers pioneer this new realm with tools like NVIDIA Quantum Optimized Device Architecture (QODA). \u201cThis helps bring quantum computing closer to the HPC and AI communities.\u201d -Kristel Michielsen\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go on with today\u2019s classical computers alone because they consume so much energy, and they can\u2019t solve some problems,\u201d said Michielsen, who leads the quantum program at the J\u00fclich Supercomputing Center near Cologne. \u201cBut paired with quantum computers that won\u2019t consume as much energy, I believe there may be the potential to solve some of our most complex problems.\u201d\nEnter the QPU\nBecause quantum processors, or QPUs, harness the properties of quantum mechanics, they\u2019re ideally suited to simulating processes at the atomic level. That could enable fundamental advances in chemistry and materials science, starting domino effects in everything from more efficient batteries to more effective drugs.\nQPUs may also help with thorny optimization problems in fields like logistics. For example, airlines face daily challenges figuring out which planes to assign to which routes.\nIn one experiment, a quantum computer recently installed at J\u00fclich showed the most efficient way to route nearly 500 flights \u2014 demonstrating the technology\u2019s potential.\nQuantum computing also promises to take AI to the next level. In separate experiments, J\u00fclich researchers used quantum machine learning to simulate how proteins bind to DNA strands and classify satellite images of Lyon, France.\nHybrids Take Best of Both Worlds\nSeveral prototype quantum computers are now available, but none is powerful or dependable enough to tackle commercially relevant jobs yet. But researchers see a way forward.\n\u201cFor a long time, we\u2019ve had a vision of hybrid systems as the only way to get practical quantum computing \u2014 linked to today\u2019s classical HPC systems, quantum computers will give us the best of both worlds,\u201d Michielsen said.\nAnd that\u2019s just what J\u00fclich and other researchers around the world are building today.\nQuantum Gets 49x Boost on A100 GPUs\nIn addition to its current analog quantum system, J\u00fclich plans next year to install a neutral atom quantum computer from Paris-based Pasqal. It\u2019s also been running quantum simulations on classical systems such as its JUWELS Booster, which packs over 3,700 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs.\n\u201cThe GPU version of our universal quantum-computer simulator, called JUQCS, has given us up to 49x speedups compared to jobs running on CPU clusters \u2014 this work uses almost all the system\u2019s GPU nodes and relies heavily on its InfiniBand network,\u201d she said, citing a recent paper.\nRecently, classical systems like the JUWELS Booster use NVIDIA cuQuantum, a software development kit for accelerating quantum jobs on GPUs. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s great for cross-platform benchmarking, and for others it could be a great tool to start or optimize their quantum simulation codes,\u201d Michielsen said of the SDK.\nA100 GPUs (green) form the core of the JUWELS Booster that can simulate quantum jobs with the NVIDIA cuQuantum SDK.\nHybrid Systems, Hybrid Software\nWith multiple HPC and quantum systems on hand and more on the way for J\u00fclich and other research centers, one of the challenges is tying it all together.\n\u201cThe HPC community needs to look in detail at applications that span everything from climate science and medicine to chemistry and physics to see what parts of the code can run on quantum systems,\u201d she said.\nIt\u2019s a Herculean task for developers entering the quantum computing era, but help\u2019s on the way.\nNVIDIA QODA acts like a software bridge. With a function call, developers can choose to run their quantum jobs on GPUs or quantum processors.\nQODA\u2019s high-level language will support every kind of quantum computer, and its compiler will be available as open-source software. And it\u2019s supported by quantum system and software providers including Pasqal, Xanadu, QC Ware and Zapata.\nQuantum Leap for HPC, AI Developers\nMichielsen foresees JUNIQ providing QODA to researchers across Europe who use its quantum services.\n\u201cThis helps bring quantum computing closer to the HPC and AI communities,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will speed up how they get things done without them needing to do all the low-level programming, so it makes their life much easier.\u201d\nMichielsen expects many researchers will be using QODA to try out hybrid quantum-classical computers \u2014 over the coming year and beyond.\n\u201cWho knows, maybe one of our users will pioneer a new example of real-world hybrid computing,\u201d she said.\nSee the NVIDIA QODA site to learn more and apply for early interest. And get technical details on QODA here.\nImage at top courtesy of Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich / Ralf-Uwe Limbach\n\n\nCategories: Research | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | GPU Computing | Hardware | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | NVIDIA in Europe | Science | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nNVIDIA shares have been pummeled so far this year, recording a year-to-date loss of nearly 50 percent as the Federal Reserve\u2019s hawkish stance de-rated the high-flying stock, only to be further trampled by expectations of an upcoming recession and the attendant demand drought for NVIDIA\u2019s products, which are already reeling from an oversaturated market. However, the stock has seen limited strength in recent days amid expectations that a key piece of legislation is about to become a reality.\nTo wit, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America (CHIPS) Act aims to unlock around $52 billion in federal investments for the domestic semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing provisions as laid out in the US Innovation and Competition Act (USICA). With the US chip manufacturing market share declining from 37 percent in 1990 to just around 12 percent in 2021, the bill is widely deemed as an essential component in the bipartisan effort to restore America\u2019s cutting-edge advantage in the field of semiconductors.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB MemoryA procedural vote on the CHIPS Act is likely to come as soon as Tuesday. However, differences persist as the Democrats have been gunning for a CHIPS-plus approach, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi going on record to state:\n\u201cWe had been working constantly on the chips bill. And we need to have the transformative nature of research and education and the rest to make us continue to be preeminent in the world.\u201d\nThe passage of the CHIPS Act has gained urgency as Intel has refused to move forward on its $20 billion US fab initiative until the legislation is passed. Of course, given the sizable cash influx that NVIDIA and other semiconductor companies stand to gain from this legislation, it is hardly surprising that investors have been responding positively to any development on this count.\nThis brings us to the crux of the matter. As per the latest Periodic Transaction Report filed by Nancy Pelosi, her husband Paul Pelosi recently exercised 200 call options related to 20,000 NVIDIA shares. These options were purchased back in 2021 and carried an exercise price of $100.\nSource: https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/ptr-pdfs/2022/20021374.pdf\nNVIDIA shares closed at $157.62 on Friday. Consequently, the Pelosis are currently sitting on unrealized gains worth around $1.152 million from the recent exercise of NVIDIA options, barring any transaction fees.\n\nThe Pelosi's have accumulated 20,000 shares of $NVDA worth $8M+\nAll while a $52B CHIPS act has been stalled in Congress.\nYesterday Pelosi states, \"We are determined that we will pass a bill\" before congress heads to August recess.$NVDA stock jumps 4% on the news.\n\u2014 Nancy Pelosi Stock Tracker \u265f (@PelosiTracker_) July 15, 2022\n\nShould the CHIPS Act be approved within the next few days, NVIDIA shares are expected to extend nascent gains, netting a windfall for the Pelosis in the process.\nSource: https://unusualwhales.com/i_am_the_senate_member/Nancy%20Pelosi\nBear in mind that Nancy Pelosi and her husband have invested 3.3 percent of their portfolio in NVIDIA, as per a tabulation by UnusualWhales.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n153\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n87\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n75\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Though most of the hype has died down and valuations have contracted, such themes are not going anywhere. In fact, it may be wise to reconsider many of the fallen VR/AR stocks before they have a chance to heat up again.  Understandably, investors have soured on technology stocks, with rates poised to rise quickly. Inflation continues to linger, and a recession could easily curb demand for discretionary goods like mixed-reality headsets and all hardware needed to get into the metaverse. Further, nobody is really sure when the metaverse will be ready for prime time. Mark Zuckerberg thinks the metaverse represents a multi-billion-dollar opportunity. He may very well be right. However, the timeline is less certain. In an era of COVID-19 and Monkeypox, which was recently declared a global health emergency, the metaverse as Zuckerberg sees it may be closer than we think, as consumers look to stay in during periods when outbreaks are at a high point. Remote work isn't going anywhere, and the surge in at-home entertainment may very well be just beginning. In this piece, we used TipRanks' Comparison Tool to evaluate three stock giants that could become dominant forces in a metaverse market that could hit $475 billion in 2028.  Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia is a hardware innovator that could lay down the foundation for the metaverse. The chipmaker has an incredibly expensive stock due to its front-row seat to many of the hottest tech trends, from AI to the metaverse. The company's Omniverse real-time graphics platform is nothing short of exciting. The Omniverse Enterprise platform can help drive a revolution in automation. However, its applications could also help power the metaverses of tomorrow. Further, the firm's cutting-edge graphical-processing units (GPUs) will experience a surge in demand once the metaverse is ready for prime time. Nvidia is already a video-gaming powerhouse, with many of today's popular gaming PCs sporting Nvidia hardware. On the GPU front, Nvidia is a standout player that could continue to flex its muscles. Though shares are expensive, the magnitude of growth on the horizon could have the potential to be unfathomably high. Despite the lofty price tag on shares, Nvidia still has the Street\u2019s support; The stock has no fewer than 30 analyst reviews on record, and they break down 25 to 5 (or 5 to 1, if you prefer) in favor of the Buys over Holds, for a Strong Buy analyst consensus view. NVDA is currently priced at $181.63 and its $245.55 average price target indicates room for ~35% share appreciation from that level. (See NVDA stock forecast on TipRanks)   Story Continues   Apple (AAPL)Next up, we have iPhone maker Apple, which has made significant strides in AR in recent years. Though only a select few apps make the most of the latest iPhone's AR capabilities, we could see a surge in developers leveraging Apple's powerful AR toolkit once Apple launches a headset.All eyes are open to Apple's coming headset, rumored to include the powerful M2 chip and incredibly high-resolution screens. Simply put, the device will be expensive, perhaps pricier than an upscale iPhone.Accompanying the headset will likely be a cutting-edge operating system (rumored to be called realityOS or rOS). It seems like Apple is using the same playbook (or launchpad) it used when launching the first iPhone. I think Apple's headset could be a game-changer that gradually erodes the smartphone market.It's not just the visual aspect that Apple may have down. Apple's spatial audio could make the Apple mixed-reality experience that much more immersive. Undeniably, Apple's a force to be reckoned with in the audio department, with its hot-selling AirPods and Apple Music.Apple is no stranger to cannibalizing its own products, and it could be ready to do it again in 2023.Tech stocks tend to attract a lot of attention, especially Apple \u2013 the stock has 27 analyst reviews on record, and they include 20 Buys against 6 Holds and a single Sell, to give the company its Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares have an average price target of $179.89, indicating room for 11% growth from the current price of $162.51. (See AAPL stock forecast on TipRanks)  Microsoft (MSFT)Finally, we have software behemoth Microsoft, which could also make noise in the metaverse. Though Microsoft is best-known for enterprise software, the firm has steadily grown its share in the video-gaming market with its impressive Xbox console, Xbox Game Pass subscription service, and Xbox Cloud Gaming.Microsoft's expertise in gaming and the cloud could help smoothen the firm's transition into the metaverse. Indeed, the metaverse may not be just for play but for work.On that front, Microsoft's Teams Mesh product is an intriguing environment that could be the next step up from the conference calls that we're all too familiar with. A digital office environment would be more engaging and could bring back a lot of the presence lost with the transition to remote work.Microsoft is a fine pick to play software within the metaverse. Gaming and workplace collaboration will be two of the biggest draws to the metaverse, and it's hard to find a company that's excelled in both fields as well as Microsoft.What does the Street think? With 29 Buy ratings and no Holds or Sells, the message is clear: MSFT is a Strong Buy. The $331 average price target puts the upside potential at ~18%. (See MSFT stock forecast on TipRanks)  Bottom lineThe metaverse will be a game-changing technology, but the transition will not happen overnight. It's a trend that could accompany sizeable rewards over the next 10-15 years. The three stocks mentioned, I believe, are among the best ways to play the technological shift. Of the three metaverse plays in this piece, Wall Street expects the most from Nvidia over the next year, with around 35% expected returns.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks\u2019 Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks\u2019 equity insights.Disclaimer: The information contained in this article represents the views and opinion of the writer only, and not the views or opinion of TipRanks or its affiliates, and should be considered for informational purposes only.

The transaction comes after public pressure and call-outs by several prominent voices. Next: Get access to a new market-moving chart every day featuring a stock flashing clear technical signals. See today's pick now.\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has been one of the most high-profile\u00a0members of Congress when it comes to buying and selling stocks and options during her time in public office. A recent transaction by her husband Paul Pelosi faced public scrutiny and may have influenced a recent sale.\nWhat Happened: Pelosi announced the sale of a portion of NVIDIA Corporation NVDA shares in a filing.\nAs reported by Congresstrading, Pelosi and her husband sold 25,000 shares of NVIDIA Corporation on July 26 valued between $1 million and $5 million.\nIn the comment line of the filing, Pelosi said the shares were sold at an average price of $165.05 for a loss of $341,365.\nThe sale by Pelosi comes after public scrutiny over exercising calls of\u00a0the leading semiconductor stock done ahead of a vote on the CHIPS Act by Congress, which Pelosi publicly supported. The CHIPS Act could directly benefit NVIDIA Corporation.\n\u201cI think this comes in response to public pressure and the conflict of interest her stock position posed,\u201d the founder of Congresstrading.com, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of his site, told Benzinga.\nThe trade could be labeled as insider trading, with her husband getting knowledge of the progress of the CHIPS Act prior to the transaction. The sale by Pelosi comes days after it was announced a former Congressman was charged by the SEC for insider trading.\n\u201cIt is surprising to see the sale. Also, what\u2019s surprising here is that she sold and reported one day later. Usually she takes a couple of weeks. She wanted the public to know she cleared her books of this conflict of interest immediately.\u201d\nCongresstrading also noted Pelosi\u2019s filings typically come on Fridays, when the media may potentially bury the story over the weekend.\nRelated Link: Congresstrading Highlights Changes That Could Help, Pelosi's New Trade And Crypto Disclosures\u00a0\nWhy It\u2019s Important: The recent call option exercise by Paul Pelosi, a venture capitalist, faced scrutiny by the public and also drew the attention of Michael Burry and Edward Snowden.\nPelosi was asked at a press conference about her husband\u2019s stock and option activity recently.\n\u201cHas your husband ever made a stock purchase or sale based on info received from you?\u201d a reporter asked the Speaker of the House.\nPelosi responded \u201cNo, absolutely not\u201d and then left the podium and ended the questions.\nThe Nancy Pelosi Tracker on Twitter, which shares transactions by the Speaker of the House, noted the transaction history of NVIDIA Corporation by the Pelosis dates\u00a0back to May 2021. According to the account, the Pelosis still own 50 options on NVIDIA Corporation with a strike price of $100 and expiration of Sep. 16, 2022 that were purchased back on July 23, 2021.\nPelosi remains one of the most active filers of stock transactions in Congress due to her husband being a venture capitalist.\nTransactions in big technology stocks like NVIDIA, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Apple Inc AAPL and Alphabet Inc GOOGGOOGL have been favorites of Pelosi over the last two years. An investment in Tesla Inc TSLA ahead of clean energy initiatives and electric vehicle tax credits previously drew scrutiny.\nAn investment in the Visa Inc V IPO and the credit card company\u2019s attempt to influence the Congresswoman has also been a story over the years.\nThe Pelosis recently sold 5,000 shares of Visa that were acquired at the IPO price and netted a profit of $1,827,300.\nNVDA Price Action: NVIDIA shares are up 5% to $173.40 on Wednesday.\nPhoto: Creates with images from\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0and\u00a0Gage Skidmore\u00a0on Flickr\nNVDANVIDIA Corp$116.52-2.52%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum84.14Growth88.69Quality96.81Value6.97Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewAAPLApple Inc$212.34-0.78%GOOGAlphabet Inc$162.58-2.40%GOOGLAlphabet Inc$160.48-2.32%MSFTMicrosoft Corp$383.10-1.44%TSLATesla Inc$226.70-4.75%VVisa Inc$333.97-0.17%Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Inverse, Leveraged ETFs Offer Investors New Opportunities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenzinga\n\nJul. 15, 2022, 05:56 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew ETFs that offer investors the opportunity to be bullish or bearish on individual stocks hit the market this week. The new leveraged and inverse daily ETFs could be the first of many\u00a0and could take on some of the largest companies in the world.\nWhat Happened: The first eight single stock leveraged and inverse ETFs were launched this week by AXS Investments, a leading asset manager that seeks to provide alternative investments for growth and diversification.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to be the first firm to bring single-stock leveraged and inverse ETFs to U.S. investors,\u201d AXS Investments CEO Greg Bassuk. \u201cAXS has once again opened new access for investors, namely to express their high-conviction views on some of the most actively traded single stocks, regardless of whether their sentiment is bullish or bearish.\u201d\nHere are the first eight single-stock ETFs that offer daily exposure based on a bull or bear case.\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA): AXS TSLA Bear Daily ETF (NASDAQ:TSLQ)\n\t\t\n\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA): AXS 1.25X NVDA Bear Daily ETF (NASDAQ:NVDS)\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL): AXS 1.5X PYPL Bull Daily ETF (NASDAQ:PYPT), AXS 1.5X PYPL Bear Daily ETF (NASDAQ:PYPS)\nNike Inc (NYSE:NKE): AXS 2X NKE Bull Daily ETF (NASDAQ:NKEL), AXS 2X NKE Bear Daily ETF (NASDAQ:NKEQ)\nPfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE): AXS 2X PFE Bull Daily ETF (NASDAQ:PFEL), AXS 2X PFE Bear Daily ETF (NASDAQ:PFES)\nThe funds seek to return 100% or more of the daily return of the stock, with 1.25X representing 125%, 1.5X representing 150% and 2X representing 200%.\n\t\t\n\n\nAXS Investments previously filed to launch inverse and leveraged ETFs in February for the names above and several others that have not been listed yet. The filings also included Boeing Co\u00a0(NYSE:BA), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Salesforce\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:CRM) and Wells Fargo & Co\u00a0(NYSE:WFC).\nAn updated filing also shows the named funds of AXS TSLA Bull Daily ETF (NASDAQ:TSLU) and AXS 1.25X NVDA Bull Daily ETF (NASDAQ:\u00a0NVDB), which are not currently listed.\nAXS Investments highlights that the ETFs are riskier due to using leverage and may not be appropriate for every investor. The funds may also be appropriate only for active investors due to the volatility of the stocks.\nRelated Link: Want To Bet Against Cathie Wood? There's A New ETF For That\u00a0\nWhy It\u2019s Important: Inverse and leveraged ETFs have grown in popularity with investors being able to take advantage of being bullish or bearish on certain sectors or countries.\n\t\t\n\n\nAXS Investments previously launched the AXS 2X Innovation ETF (NASDAQ:TARK), which offers investors 2x daily exposure in a portfolio of innovative companies in the genomics, autonomous vehicles and internet sectors, mirroring the Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK).\nAXS Investments also offers the AXS Short China Internet ETF (NASDAQ:SWEB) featuring\u00a0daily short exposure to China-based internet companies.\n\u201cOur goal remains to be the leader in providing investors with access to the tools needed to build portfolios and to trade effectively in today\u2019s volatile markets,\u201d Bassuk said.\nBassuk added there\u2019s excitement for more items in the AXS Investments product pipeline \u201cfor 2022 and beyond.\u201d\nIn February, Direxion also filed for the Direxion Daily TSLA Bear 1X Shares, which would provide a bearish bet on Tesla shares for investors. Direxion currently offers several 3x leveraged ETFs allowing investors to bet on the bullish and bearish side for indexes like the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 and certain sectors.\n\t\t\n\n\nIn late 2021, Tuttle Capital launched the inverse ETF to the popular Cathie Wood-led Ark Innovation with the Tuttle Capital Short Innovation ETF (NASDAQ:SARK).\nThe Tuttle Capital Short Innovation ETF is up 87% since launching in November and up 59% year-to-date in 2022. Ark Innovation is down 55% in 2022.\nVolume for the AXS Investments Tesla Bear Daily ETF was $6 million in its first day of trading according to Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas. The other ETFs saw minimal volume on their first day of trading, which could impact the approval of other leveraged daily single stock ETFs.\nThere are around 80 single stock ETFs in the pipeline of the approval stage, including many targeting Tesla.\nPhoto:\u00a0Scott E Read\u00a0via Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStart Trading Futures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFind News\n\t\t\t\tNews\n\n\n\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n            See also:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                - Explore more categories\n            \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

A 27-year-old motorcycle racer from Florida, Henter had just won eighth place in the Venezuelan Grand Prix, the first race of the 1978 World Championships. He was daydreaming about his next race in Spain when he saw the other car driving straight towards him. Henter had been driving on the right side of the road, just as he did back home. Instinctively, he swerved right. But the other driver, faithful to his own British instincts, swerved left. It was a head-on collision. Henter\u2019s face broke the windshield and glass shards left him with detached retinas and eighty stitches on his face \u2014 including thirteen on each eyeball. Lying in the hospital, he thought to himself, Maybe I\u2019ll have to miss the race. The first operation to reattach his retina was successful, and Henter regained his sight in one eye \u2014 he could see light and some colors \u2014 but as scar tissue formed, the retina detached again. When he woke up after the second operation, Henter knew things were different this time. After the first operation, everything had been bright. But the second time, everything was dark. \u201cI had about ten minutes of despair in the hospital when I felt a very calming spirit in the room. Maybe it was an angel,\u201d Henter recalls. \u201cIt more or less said to me, \u2018Don\u2019t sweat it. Everything is going to be okay.\u2019\u201d Eh, blind people have been around for millennia, Henter remembers thinking to himself. If they made it, I can make it. His racing days were over, but Henter wasn\u2019t entirely at a loss. Before his motorcycling career began, Henter had earned a mechanical engineering degree from the University of Florida. He even had a couple of patents. Blindness made working as a mechanical engineer difficult. When he consulted Florida\u2019s Division of Blind Services, a counselor told him that computer programming was becoming a popular career for people who are blind.Henter went back to school for a degree in computer science. He learned to program by typing code out on the terminal and having a volunteer read the screen back to him. A local high school student read programming books for him, which he recorded and listened to on tapes. \u201cThat was pretty slow and tedious. But I learned how to program computers,\u201d says Henter.It wasn\u2019t until his first job when Henter got what he calls a \u201ctalking computer.\u201d This ancestral screen reader, created by Deane Blazie, could only read one character at a time. (For example, the word \u201cPRINT\u201d would be pronounced not as one syllable but as \u201cP-R-I-N-T.\u201d)Nonetheless, this was a game changer. Henter could perform his job without any assistance. When the next version \u2014 one that could read a word at a time \u2014 came out, Henter regularly called the company for tech support and became the most known user. Blazie, the head of the company \u2014 who would go down in history as one of the few sighted pioneers of the assistive technology industry \u2014 soon offered him a job. Years later, Henter recalls Maryland Computer Services with warmth, remembering a welcoming environment and colleagues who respected him.He learned to program by typing code out on the terminal and having a volunteer read the screen back to himHenter was both an engineer and an advocate for the product. He was sent on a trip to Chicago to train a high-profile customer \u2014 a businessman named Bill Joyce \u2014 on using a screen reader. An explosion in an industrial accident had left Joyce blind and partially deaf. The two men became close friends, bonding over their love of water skiing. (Although Henter had missed the chance of becoming a motorcycling champion, he would win the gold medal as best overall skier in the 1991 World Disabled Water Ski Championships and six national championships.) While training Joyce, Henter would throw ideas around the features he\u2019d like to add to screen readers. Eventually, Joyce proposed that they create a company together. In 1987, they founded Henter-Joyce and soon released the first version of their screen reader for DOS. They called it JAWS, which stands for Job Access With Speech, but is also a playful reference to another DOS screen reader called Flipper, like the dolphin in an eponymous 1960s TV show. JAWS was not the only screen reader in the market, but it had original features like the dual cursor \u2014 one application cursor for navigating elements on the page and another that could move freely like how our eyes move around the screen. It also had built-in Braille support and a scripting language for users to customize their workflow.By then, the computer industry had undergone a sea change: everyone was moving to graphic operating systems like Windows. Henter started getting worried calls from his users: \u201cWhen is the Windows version coming out? I\u2019m going to lose my job if I can\u2019t use Windows.\u201dThe leap from text to graphics presented a fiendish challenge. The data model behind the concept of the screen reader had to be completely reimagined. Nonetheless, in the winter of 1995, Henter-Joyce released JAWS for Windows months ahead of competitors. JAWS was so good that Microsoft bought the code and built on top of it to create its own native version. Microsoft\u2019s project eventually went nowhere, but JAWS would soon own the majority of market share.If you are sighted, chances are that you\u2019ve rarely thought about how a software engineer programs while blind. You may have not even given much thought to how people who are blind use computers at all. If you are a Mac user, you may have regarded VoiceOver \u2014 macOS\u2019s native screen reader \u2014 as an annoyance that pops up when you inadvertently press a certain combination of keys, only to swiftly turn it off.A screen reader allows its user to navigate a computer by audio \u2014 it\u2019s a primary interface to visual elements of a computer. In other words, screen readers are to blind or partially sighted users what monitors are to sighted users. The market for screen readers is hardly niche. In 2020, the estimated number of blind people worldwide was 49.1 million \u2014 comparable to the population of Spain or South Korea. An additional 255 million people have moderate to severe visual impairment. These millions of people may use magnification tools, Braille support, or screen readers. And while good statistics on blind programmers are hard to come by, in a recent Stackoverflow survey of developers, 1,142 people \u2014 approximately 1.7% of total participants \u2014 replied, \u201cI am blind / have difficulty seeing.\u201dNearly three decades have passed since JAWS for Windows was released, during which possibly tens of thousands of blind and partially sighted programmers entered software development. Just as it was in Henter\u2019s time, it\u2019s a field that is relatively inclusive for people who are blind, as the accessibility barriers are lower than in many hands-on jobs. These days, this is in no small part thanks to JAWS, a piece of software pioneered by a blind programmer. JAWS dates back to the same generation of software as Internet Explorer 1.0Very few pieces of software survive this long. JAWS dates back to the same generation of software as Internet Explorer 1.0, which officially retired last month after 27 years. The fact that JAWS has retained its usage share makes it an even greater rarity. The browser Mosaic, heralded in 1994 as the \u201cworld\u2019s standard interface,\u201d lasted only two years at the top before Netscape took over the market. Three years later, the majority of users were using Internet Explorer, which was overshadowed by Chrome just in twelve years. Chrome has reigned supreme for about a decade. JAWS has been the gold standard of screen readers for almost three times as long of a period. To return to the monitor analogy: a brand new top-of-the-line monitor and an older, lower-resolution model do more or less the same job. The high-resolution display is better, but a display with low resolution is still a display. However, a bad screen reader isn\u2019t bad the way that an outdated display is. Imagine a monitor with islands of dead pixels, incapable of displaying certain objects on the screen, incorrectly rendering or even outright inverting colors, or showing elements several pixels off from where they should be. In other words, bad screen readers aren\u2019t just mediocre; they lie. There\u2019s a good reason why JAWS has remained so popular, even with its hefty price tag.Bad screen readers aren\u2019t just mediocre; they lieThat said, the price of JAWS is no small barrier. One home license currently costs $1,000 ($1,285 for a professional license), and future updates cost extra. Annual licenses that cost $95 ($90 for students) are available only in the U.S. 89% of people with vision loss come from low-income and middle-income countries. For a long time, a good, reliable screen reader was simply not an option for the majority of blind or partially sighted people around the world.It was only in 2019 that an open-source alternative \u2014 NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA) \u2014 finally overtook JAWS in popularity. (JAWS took back its dominant market share in 2020, but just barely). This revolution in accessibility began in an unlikely place: a music camp for kids in the small Australian town of Mittagong. In 1994, a 10-year-old Michael Curran met nine-year-old Jamie Teh at a weeklong music camp for young Braille-reading students around Australia. Each boy saw something of himself in the other and quickly bonded over their mutual interest in computers. Teh had been interested in programming ever since he got his first computer, a Commodore 64. Because the Commodore 64 did not have a screen reader, Teh, like Henter, had to get other people to read the screen for him. When a seven-year-old Teh finally got an Apple II, which did have a screen reader, he could at last access everything on the computer on his own. \u201cBut my dad would have to read programming books to me because ebooks weren\u2019t a thing back then,\u201d says Teh. \u201cSo my poor dad would come into my room and read these books, which were the most boring thing in the world for him. But I just loved it.\u201d\u201cMy dad would have to read programming books to me because ebooks weren\u2019t a thing back then.\u201dA few years later, Curran and Teh started making both music and software together. (Their interests often blended; one of their projects added accessibility in audio engineering software, enabling people who are blind to do music production and sound engineering.) They often spent nights in each other\u2019s houses, engrossed in late-night philosophical conversations. The same question came up time and time again: Why isn\u2019t there a free screen reader for people who are blind? Why does it have to cost thousands of dollars?In 2006, Curran took a break from university. With free time on his hands, he started to put his ideas into practice, hacking together the prototype of what would become NVDA. \u201cThere were many people, even in the blindness community, way more qualified than me back then. In fact, there were even people who used to talk about creating a free screen reader,\u201d says Curran. \u201cThe one difference between me and them is that I wrote the first line of code.\u201dTeh had a full-time job but he joined a few months later. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how serious it was going to be, but it was fun and interesting,\u201d says Curran. \u201cBecause we both very strongly believed in the concept of open source, we made NVDA completely open source.\u201d\u201cThe one difference between me and them is that I wrote the first line of code.\u201dA year later, Mozilla approached the duo and funded Curran to attend the CSUN Assistive Technology Conference, the largest conference of its kind hosted by the Center on Disabilities at California State University, Northridge. There, Curran met like-minded enthusiasts from across the world. That was when they realized NVDA had reached escape velocity. It was no longer their pet project. Shortly thereafter, Curran and Teh founded NV Access, a nonprofit with a governance structure to take the project long-term.In its early years, users considered NVDA good enough for home use but unsuited for professional tasks. The fact that it was free gave people the impression that its quality wasn\u2019t on par with commercial screen readers. But that began to change as the project grew. The number of contributors ballooned, and NVDA expanded to more than 60 languages. Accessibility teams at Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla wanted to work together to make NVDA integrate well with their platforms and browsers.According to the bi-annual survey of screen reader users conducted by WebAIM\u2014 a Utah-based organization that provides web accessibility solutions \u2014 JAWS had been the most popular primary screen reader since the survey began in 2009. But since 2019, NVDA has rivaled JAWS in popularity.The NVDA community is enthusiastic, even passionate about the software. Discussions comparing one screen reader to another \u2014 very much like the iPhone vs. Android or Chrome vs. Firefox debates \u2014 can become religious. (\u201cI realize I\u2019m opening up a can of worms,\u201d wrote one user to the NVDA community\u2019s mailing list, asking how three different screen readers compare.) Some community members are young \u2014 Curran can remember \u201ckids who got interested in NVDA\u201d when they were \u201clike 13 or just starting high school.\u201d Some of these young users would go on to study computer science, becoming developers themselves. Three generations of blind programmers have been writing software for each other since Henter began JAWS in the 80s. Tuukka Ojala, a blind software developer based in Finland, is one of those kids that Curran speaks of. Ojala had always been curious about technology and computers, but the first computer he used at school had no screen reader installed. \u201cWhen other kids were learning handwriting, I spent the same time learning touch typing,\u201d Ojala says. \u201cIt was more or less a fancy typewriter.\u201d Things changed when he got his own computer for the first time, a machine that came with a demo version of JAWS. \u201cIt would run for like 40 or 45 minutes at a time, and I had to reboot the computer,\u201d says Ojala. He couldn\u2019t afford the license, let alone the price of future upgrades. Still, in less than a year, while running the JAWS demo in those short increments, he\u2019d learned to program.In 2011, Ojala made a bet with a friend on how long he could stick with NVDA, which was still in its early stages. \u201cBack then, the primary reason for using NVDA was not that it was actually better than JAWS in significant ways,\u201d Ojala tells me. The bet was supposed to last a month. More than a decade later, Ojala is still using NVDA even though price is no longer an issue. \u201cThe features NVDA has or chooses to develop are more tailored to what I need,\u201d says Ojala. Upgrades are quick and add-ons \u2014 like optical character recognition (OCR) \u2014 are extensive. \u201cI\u2019ve used NVDA for most of the time I\u2019ve used computers.\u201dAt his company, Ojala primarily works on backend systems. \u201cI often describe myself as someone who is interested in backend but still cares about the whole software, so I do usability testing as well,\u201d says Ojala. \u201cI like to understand how the end users use it even though I don\u2019t work with the front end as much.\u201d Accessibility screw-ups, technological or not, are massively scalableBut only a handful of software tools give Ojala a frictionless experience. For most companies, accessibility isn\u2019t a priority, or worse, something that they pay lip service to while doing the bare minimum to meet regulatory compliance. Ojala\u2019s pet peeve is people thinking that accessibility is a feature, a nice-to-have addition to your product. When they tack on accessibility later, without thinking about it from the very beginning, Ojala can tell \u2014 it feels haphazard. (Imagine first creating a product with a colorless UI, then to add colors later as an afterthought, only to use the wrong color combination.)Accessibility screw-ups, technological or not, are massively scalable. Take for example, how US dollar bills are identically sized for every denomination. Before smartphones, blind Americans would have had to carry around a separate \u2014 and costly \u2014 device just for identifying the bills, or otherwise place trust in every cashier they met. (Many other currencies use differently sized bills for exactly this reason). When systems don\u2019t build in accessibility, the burden passes to individuals with disabilities to make up for it on their own, often by buying expensive technologies. Makeshift solutions are only necessary because of the thoughtlessness of the people who designed the system. As a sighted programmer, I\u2019d been oblivious to the world of screen readers until I came across a post titled \u201cI\u2019m a software engineer going blind, how should I prepare?\u201d One recent evening, I tried navigating my personal website, eyes closed, with macOS\u2019 native screen reader VoiceOver. I was soon mortified to learn that underneath the ostensibly clean interface was a chimeric HTML structure. As I made ad hoc changes to my website \u2014 mainly written in a language called Go \u2014 over the years, I had mangled the HTML hierarchy so much that it was rendered inaccessible even to myself.The history of screen readers is as much a transcendent achievement for the blind programmers who pioneered the field as it is a rebuke to sighted programmers, without whose neglect non-native screen readers might not have to exist. \u201cAs a blind person, I want to go to the local computer store, buy a computer and just use it. I shouldn\u2019t have to go and buy or even have to download another screen reader,\u201d Curran says. Blind programmers shouldn\u2019t have to be the ones writing tools for blind people. But nevertheless, they\u2019ve done exactly that. They have built \u2014 sometimes on top of each other, sometimes chaotically and in parallel \u2014 software that is life-changing in the literal sense. And their legacies endure, not just in the operating systems that have adopted their products, but in the programmers who have come after them. Henter relied on volunteers to read screens out loud for him; Teh\u2019s father read programming books to him as a child. For Ojala, screen readers have been part of his life as a programmer from the start. It took Ojala quite a long time to figure out why sighted people kept asking, \u201cHow can you code?\u201d It seemed like a big deal to them, but he couldn\u2019t make out why. \u201cMy way of working is the only way I know,\u201d Ojala says. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any other ways to code.\u201dSee More: CreatorsFeaturesTechMore in Accessibility WeekSee allHow to make the most of Android\u2019s accessibility featuresJR RaphaelJan 9, 2023CommentsComment Icon BubbleHow to make the most of your iPhone\u2019s accessibility featuresJoe StanganelliJul 15, 2022CommentsComment Icon BubbleTech journalism\u2019s accessibility problemMonica ChinJul 15, 2022CommentsComment Icon BubbleMost PopularMost PopularAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?Leaked Apple meeting shows how dire the Siri situation really isInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

She allowed bipartisan groups of lawmakers to draft bills and hold a public hearing.\u00a0\n\n\n\"I've said to the House Administration Committee, review all the bills that are coming in and see which ones \u2014 where the support is in our caucus,\" Pelosi said. \"If members want to do that, I'm okay with that.\"\nLawmakers are currently deliberating on several congressional stock-trade bills. No vote on any of the bills has yet been scheduled.\u00a0\nInsider's \"Conflicted Congress\" project, in addition to work from other outlets, identified 65 members of Congress \u2014 both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 who violated an insider trading and conflicts-of-interest law, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act.\n\n\nWhile Pelosi herself does not trade stocks, her husband Paul Pelosi is a frequent investor. Insider collected each of Paul Pelosi's trades that the speaker reported in 2021 and 2022. Many of his trades appear to be worth millions \u2014 an Insider analysis from 2021 found that the speaker is ranked as the 14th wealthiest member of Congress with an estimated net worth of at least $46,123,051.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi\n\n\nApple\n\n\nVisa\n \nMore \n\n\n\n\npolitics enterprise\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n      subscribers.

To put things in true perspective, we're talking about 3-year-old silicon that to put it mildly was pretty pathetic back then, often losing out to then 2-year older Radeon RX 570.\nThis GeForce GTX 200mm2 die codenamed TU117 is back, but this time with 42% fewer cores (512 cores), 42% fewer texture mapping units, and half as many ROPs at just 16. The core clock frequency has been bumped up by 7% to 1,785 MHz, but we're getting an embarrassingly small 64-bit wide memory bus with 4 GB of GDDR6 memory for a bandwidth of just 96 GB/s, a 25% reduction from the old GTX 1650.\n\nBased on those figures, the GTX 1630 is going to cost like... $50? What we mean to say is, the original GTX 1650 represented poor value at $150 at launch three years ago, and AMD's recently released Radeon RX 6400 kind of sucks at $160, so for sure something as weak as the GTX 1630 will be priced well under $100 in 2022.\nWell, apparently no. Rumor is this model will cost at least $150, with many models said to cost between $170 and $200. In fact, EVGA is currently listing their SC Gaming dual fan model for $200, which is complete madness.\n\nWe kind of understood the nonsense pricing for bad products like the Radeon RX 6500 XT during the height of the mining boom, but now that the boom is over and graphics card sales have slowed to a crawl, we don't get what Nvidia's playing at here.\nAnyway, we'll talk more about pricing soon, for now let's go over the test system specs. We're using our Ryzen 9 5950X GPU test system \u2013 and yes, we know no one is going to pair a budget graphics card with this CPU \u2013 but the point is to test GPU performance and therefore wish to avoid introducing a CPU bottleneck which would skew the data.\n\nFor our low-end to entry-level testing we typically use medium quality settings, or settings that make sense for a given title. We've tested games at 1080p and 1440p, though in this instance we'll focus more on the more relevant 1080p results.\nBenchmarks\nStarting with Assassin's Creed Valhalla using the medium quality preset, we see that the GTX 1630 was good for just 32 fps on average, that's a truly miserable result.\nFor comparison, the old GTX 1050 Ti was 22% faster and AMD's almost useless RX 6400 was 53% faster using PCIe 3.0, or ~70% faster in a PCIe 4.0 system, a truly embarrassing result for Nvidia.\n\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider was released back in 2018, so it's older than even the TU117 silicon the GTX 1630 is based on, so we test this title using the highest quality preset. The old GTX 1650 was good for 47 fps while the RX 6400 managed 53 fps using PCIe 4.0, the GTX 1630 though was good for just 30 fps. A miserable result for this new GPU.\n\nWatch Dogs: Legion has been turned down to medium, but even here the GTX 1630 was only good for 35 fps on average making the old GTX 1050 Ti almost 10% faster, while the RX 6400 using PCIe 3.0 was a whopping 51% faster, and we can't stress enough how uninspiring AMD's offering is at $160. So what does that say about the 1630?\n\nRainbow Six Siege is the only game we've been able to play at over 60 fps and we're doing it with the ultra quality preset. Performance was actually comparable to the RX 6400, though the GTX 1050 Ti was still 18% faster.\n\nF1 2021 fans can look forward to sub-60 fps performance using the dialed-down 'high' quality preset. Here the GTX 1630 was almost 10% slower than the RX 6400 using PCIe 3.0 and over 30% slower than the budget Radeon GPU when using PCIe 4.0. It's also worth noting that the GTX 1050 Ti was again much faster, this time delivering 24% greater performance.\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn is rather memory intensive and as a result the GTX 1630 falls off a cliff, or more of an anthill really as it never had far to fall to begin with. Shockingly, the GTX 1050 Ti was 31% faster while the RX 6400 using PCIe 3.0 was an insane 66% faster.\n\nThe Far Cry 6 performance was weak as you might expect, though it did at least match the GTX 1050 Ti and that meant the RX 6400 was at least 38% faster, or 81% faster when using PCIe 4.0.\n\nInterestingly, the GTX 1630 actually performed \"okay\" in Doom Eternal, spitting about 57 fps on average. Still a weak result overall, but decent relative to the Radeon competition, which is very weak. The GTX 1630 did fall short of the GTX 1050 Ti and was slower than the ancient technology that is the Radeon RX 570.\n\nMoving on to Resident Evil Village, we tested using the 'balanced' quality preset which is a medium-type option. The GTX 1630 was capable of just 32 fps on average making the GTX 1050 Ti 22% faster, while the RX 6400 was an absurd 88% faster using PCIe 3.0.\n\nThings couldn't improve in Death Stranding, where the GTX 1050 Ti was 20% faster than the GTX 1630, while the RX 6400 was 75% faster. More truly appalling results for Nvidia's new, but not really new, entry-level graphics card.\n\nAs we've come to expect, the GTX 1630 is horrible when testing Hitman 3 as it managed just 27 fps on average with the medium quality settings, making the GTX 1050 Ti 52% faster and the GTX 1650 111% faster.\n\nLastly, we have Cyberpunk 2077 and this time the GTX 1630 is able to match the 1050 Ti, but with just 22 fps on average at 1080p using the medium quality settings, it was completely unplayable.\nPower Consumption\n\nThe GeForce GTX 1630, like the 1650, is a 75W graphics card, meaning it can do away with external power and just pull what it needs from the PCIe x16 slot. However, for reasons unknown Gainward has stuck a 6-pin PCIe power connector on their 'Ghost' model, meaning external power is mandatory for use with this model.\nBasically no GTX 1630 should have external power, though like the GTX 1650, it's possible PCIe slot-only models will be even slower, though surely the 1630 is bloody slow enough. Anyway, the GTX 1630 only uses slightly less power than the GTX 1050 Ti, meaning performance per watt is somehow worse.\n12 Game Average\n\nMoving on to the 12 game average data, we see just how inadequate the GTX 1630 is for gaming, delivering 37 fps on average, which means the GTX 1050 Ti is typically 16% faster and the RX 6400 almost 40% faster using PCIe 3.0, or a little over 60% faster using PCIe 4.0. The GTX 1650 is also typically 65% faster and the old RX 570 almost 80% faster.\nCost per Frame\nGiven the data we've just seen, the cost per frame seems a bit pointless as you obviously shouldn't buy the GeForce GTX 1630, but let's take a look anyway and have a quick discussion. It's rare that a new entry-level GPU scores so poorly, but the 1630 is something quite special \u2013 and obviously not in a good way.\n\nShould this new GPU become available for $150, it will be a disaster, representing the worst value we've seen in a long time. This price sees it come in at a cost of just over $4 per frame, an 18% premium over the already useless GTX 1650 and 22% over the RX 6400 using PCIe 3.0, or 43% more expensive than the PCIe 4.0 configuration.\nRight now we recommend gamers spend at least $330 on the Radeon RX 6600. Yes, that's just over twice the price, but that's actually a usable GPU that offers a great gaming experience with almost 4x the performance of the GTX 1630. What's scary is the fact that some GTX 1630 models could sell for as much as $200, resulting in a cost per frame of $5.40, a 90+% premium when compared to the RX 6400 using PCIe 4.0.\nWorking out how much the GTX 1630 needs to cost in order to match the already underwhelming RX 6400 using PCIe 4.0, the answer to that is $105. Then in order to match the RX 6600 it can't cost more than $87. But given you'd need to play most games using low quality settings, the GTX 1630 needs to be even cheaper, no more than $70 seems reasonable to us.\nWhat We Learned\nThe GeForce GTX 1630 is an utter embarrassment if marketed as a gaming graphics card. We don't see a single redeeming feature to speak of, and unless it goes on sale for less than $100, it should be completed ignored or used creatively for some Nvidia memes.\n\nIf you're after a sub-$200 graphics card, you are far better off turning to the second hand market for the time being. Checking out eBay, you'll find GTX 1650 Super cards regularly selling for around $150. That's as cheap as we imagine the GTX 1630 will be available for and the 1650 Super offers about 125% more performance.\nThose not wanting to go second hand are better off digging deep and coughing up the cash for the Radeon RX 6600, which as we just showed is significantly better value despite costing a little over $300.\n\nFinally, if you must buy brand new and you want to spend less than $200, get the Radeon RX 6400. It's a significantly better product despite it's crappy nature in its own right. Nvidia has done the seemingly impossible with the GTX 1630, making the horrible Radeon product look somewhat good in comparison.\nWe can't wait for the DDR4 version of the GTX 1630 that will no doubt get quietly pushed out in a few months. Until that time, this is the worst GPU we've looked at in quite some time.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nNvidia GeForce GTX 1630 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6400 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3050 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6500 XT on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6600 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 55\n\n\n Got something to say?

Nvidia has become synonymous with graphics processing units (GPUs), a technology that also\u00a0helped shape the future of self-driving cars. That said, one could assume its logo represents AI governance, or simply, the jaw-dropping visuals its graphics cards are known for. While those might not entirely be wrong, it seems like there's a lot more depth behind Nvidia's logo and the name of the company itself.\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, the company didn't even have a name when it first started out. In an interview with Fortune, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang explained that he, along with co-founders Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, couldn't think of a name so they labeled all their files \"NV,\" which stood for \"next version.\" However, the company still needed a proper name, which led its founders to research words containing those two letters. After stumbling upon the Latin word \"invidia,\" the name apparently \"stuck.\" The question now is, how does that relate to the now-famous Nvidia eye logo that peeps out of most gaming rigs on the market?\n\n\n\nWhat does the Nvidia logo mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviewimage/Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's logo says a lot about the company in many ways, and there are various clues that could tie the eye to its name's origins. For starters, the name itself means \"envy\" in Latin, and Nvidia reportedly used the tagline \"green with envy\" in promoting some of its GPU lineup (via wccftech). Although this alone goes fittingly well with its logo and color scheme, the word's etymology is also closely associated with the word \"vision.\" One could say Nvidia foresaw a multibillion-dollar industry before it had even bloomed when it was first established in 1993.\nAdvertisement\n\nAt a time before gaming PCs were even a thing, the company already had hope that computers would soon be a popular product for gaming (via Nvidia). Over two decades later, Jensen Huang not only received the highest honor in the semiconductor sector, but his company had also surpassed industry rival and pioneer Intel in valuation (via VentureBeat). Now, Nvidia's eye can be found in various graphics and AI-related hardware and software, as well as in the form of a tattoo on the arm of its CEO, as per Fortune. Of course, vision also plays a major role in the company's philosophy just as much as its graphical application.\n\n\n\nNvidia saw the bigger picture\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloomberg/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nIn 2011, Huang spoke at Stanford about the importance of vision and perspective in realizing goals. During its humble beginnings, Nvidia was the only company that saw potential in consumer GPUs. As a result, it prompted about 70 other start-ups to follow suit years later, according to Huang. However, the visionary CEO didn't want to stop there, as he believed 3D graphics could have an even broader range of applications than with just video games. Speaking at an MSOE conference, Huang explained how Nvidia was envisioning the industry's future instead of simply coming up with products.\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Nvidia's market was virtually non-existent when it began, Huang wanted to \"democratize\" its own graphics hardware and software in hopes of creating a new industry. Doing so allowed everyone, from game developers to software engineers, to have a platform to build upon, with GPU applications eventually expanding into other sectors like healthcare and automotive. The results? Huang emphasized that Nvidia is the only independently operating company left standing among all of its competitors. In a way, Nvidia's eye logo is a fitting representation of how its vision led to its success, while the word \"envy\" serves as a byproduct of just that when it comes to its competition.\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Wilson \u2022\nJul 12, 2022 at 04:49pm EDT\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA launched its flagship AD102-based graphics card, the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti, during the decline of pricing on graphics cards during the first quarter of 2022. During this time, we have seen the cryptocurrency market crashing and an overabundance of RTX 30 series graphics cards. Several strained messages from suppliers complaining of overstocks of GPUs have caused pricing to drop well below the MSRP costs of GPUs. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti debuted in March with estimated retail pricing of $2000. That same card is now selling for $1600, $400 less than the MSRP. That is an enormous cost drop for NVIDIA's best and most efficient premium GPU.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Founders Edition graphics card price drops to $1599, a 20% drop compared to MSRP\nOne of NVIDIA's official sales partners is the online retailer Best Buy, selling Founders Edition models in the United States. The retailer apparently dropped the cost to attract attention to the card. While that is somewhat true, this is not considered an official price reduction from NVIDIA. The GPU designer authorized Best Buy to reduce the price through a retailer discount allowed by NVIDIA. The question remains, \"How long is this pricing going to stick?\"\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostContent Creators Dream GPU\nThe GeForce RTX 3090 Ti is an artists\u2019 dream and tailored for advanced creators, allowing them to edit insanely large models, work on production-quality video, or edit in multiple apps at the same time. Rendering in applications such as Blender, Maya or Cinema4D not only requires a more powerful GPU, they require more GPU memory. The RTX 3090 Ti delivers between 42%-102% more performance than the RTX 2080 Ti and TITAN RTX in these rendering apps. And because the RTX 3090 Ti features a massive 24 GB of memory, it can handle datasets that are twice as large as those that fit into the memory footprint of the original RTX 3080 Ti.\nVideo editors will see huge advantages as well. For example, working with 8K RAW projects in DaVinci Resolve featuring REDCODE, Raw (R3D) files uses most of the 10GB of memory available on the original GeForce RTX 3080 Ti. Adding a GPU memory-intensive effect such as Temporal Noise reduction, or SpeedWarp retiming can easily exceed the memory available on the RTX 3080 Ti, resulting in out-of-memory errors within the application. Performing the same memory-intensive operations with the RTX 3090 Ti allows editing to continue normally without having to reduce the project complexity.\nSource: Best Buy via VideoCardz\nThe same card listed above on Best Buy's website is pictured below on NVIDIA's official website. Readers will notice the pricing of the card above is reduced, while NVIDIA is remaining to keep the cost at MSRP.\nSource: NVIDIA via VideoCardz\nThe timing of the reduction seems pretty strategic, as September will be the last month when any retailer can sell the maximum amount of RTX 30 series graphics cards outside of this current month. We will then start seeing the launch of RTX 40 series cards, the successor to the current series on the market, which will impact costs even more after the announcement later this year.\nNews Sources: VideoCardz, Best Buy, NVIDIA\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n141\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n110\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nA Mac Studio Cluster Of Four Units, All Featuring Apple\u2019s Latest M3 Ultra, Consume Less Than Half The Power Of A Network Switch When Running At Idle\n\n\n\n83\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n36\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1480\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1157\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia and its partners have launched a new GeForce gaming bundle for anyone looking at buying one of the best graphics cards. The Face Your Demons bundle is only for buyers of high-end systems (desktops and laptops) with GeForce RTX 3080 or better GPUs, or for these GPUs sold individually. Starting today and running until September, qualifying buyers can get the following four titles with their purchase: Ghostwire: Tokyo, DOOM Eternal, and DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods Parts One and Two.(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia published a US promo page with the various terms and conditions. Multiple partners have also hit social media to promote the bundle. A cursory glance at Twitter shows hardware partners like Asus ROG, Acer, and Zotac promoting the bundle, which kicks off today. Meanwhile, retail partners worldwide were also seen promoting Face Your Demons, including Micro Center, Komplett, Scan Computers, and more.\n\nUnfortunately, this bundle is for high-end buyers only. That means purchasing a graphics card or system featuring the RTX 3080 and above. For example, Asus sells both laptops and graphics cards that qualify for the bundle, Acer has both desktops and laptops, while Zotac only sells dedicated graphics cards. To be clear, the qualifying GPUs that must be part of your purchase are the GeForce RTX 3080, 3080 Ti, 3090, and 3090 Ti.(Image credit: Nvidia)It's interesting to see this high-end-only GPU promotion from Nvidia and partners, as it hints it's currently hardest to shift these SKUs. The recent price action and pricing trends over recent months also suggest that Nvidia and its partners have had to cut the higher-end SKUs the deepest to gain sales traction. For example, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 Gaming OC 12G is currently being sold at an all-time-low of $729 at Newegg, where it previously sold for $1,349.\n\nIf we continue with the above logic, it would indicate that RTX 3070 Ti and below GPUs don\u2019t need any bundling help (yet?) to shift units from the shelves. Perhaps the stock situation is better for the retailers too, meaning there isn\u2019t as much inventory to worry about holding.\n\nLast month AMD began redemptions for its Raise the Game bundle promotion. AMD\u2019s bundle was much more generous to higher-end GPU buyers, but at least entry- and mid-market buyers got some treats, unlike with Nvidia\u2019s bundle today.\n\nFor anyone tempted by either the Nvidia or AMD graphics card and games bundles, our roundup of the Best Amazon Prime Day Graphics Card Deals is a great place to start. It's also great to see bundles back for both green and red team GPUs, and we hope it continues with the introduction of the highly anticipated GeForce Ada Lovelace RTX40 series graphics cards, and Radeon RDNA 3 RX 7000 series graphics cards, due later this year.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nasus\nrdna\nZotac\nrtx\nRadeon\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (1)\n\n\n\nMark TysonSocial Links NavigationNews EditorMark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

That means purchasing a graphics card or system featuring the RTX 3080 and above.The cards that really need bundles or rebates are the more mid-range to lower-end models. Many 3080s and above are actually relatively close to their intended MSRPs now, while anything lower seems to still be marked up by around 25-30%, as retailers don't want a take a loss on cards they bought at high prices before the crypto market collapsed.\n\nIt's interesting to see this high-end-only GPU promotion from Nvidia and partners, as it hints it's currently hardest to shift these SKUs.It could also be more that they know these cards will be the soonest to be replaced by new models. Nvidia tends to release higher-end models first, so it's possible that we will see 40-series cards in the $700+ range on the market within a few months or so, while cards in the sub-$500 range will likely take longer, with most probably not launching before the end of the year. So, they're rushing to get existing high-end units sold before the new ones get announced and they become a lot harder to sell near those prices, but there's less rush to move the mid-range models, at least for now. So it's not necessarily that the retailers have less stock of those cards, just that they know they have some additional months to sell them.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 1 Comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm debuts new Snapdragon G handheld gaming PC chips to compete with Intel and AMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina to spend $55 billion on R&D in 2025 \u2014 Semiconductor, AI and quantum computing fields to benefit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBambu Lab Announces New Printer: H2D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotherboard dies after marathon 100-hour BIOS update process, vigil attended by thousands online\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD boasts its Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is up to 12.2x faster than Lunar Lake in AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreeware image editor GIMP 3.0 arrives after seven years of incubation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle's Gemini 2.0 Flash is reportedly capable of removing watermarks \u2014 Also found to generate AI celebrity photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi and ChatGPT bring AI conversations to your retro rotary phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI Afterburner update enables RTX 50 series owners to push their GDDR7 VRAM up to 36 GT/s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD manager reports 45% GPU retail market share in Japan \u2014 Eyes 70% as the next target\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

People who want a more affordable new GPU from Team Green may be disappointed if this new leak is accurate.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nSorry, AMD, Nvidia's price tags for its RTX 5000 GPUs could win me over\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5080 GPU could sell out fast \u2013 and I\u2019m worried things might be even worse for the flagship RTX 5090\n\n\n\nAnalysis: Oh, RTX 4080 where art thou?(Image credit: Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock)Recent rumors suggest that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 will be an incredibly powerful graphics card, and could seriously outperform the RTX 3090 Ti, which is currently Nvidia\u2019s most powerful (and expensive) GPU.However, if this leak is accurate, it\u2019s a surprising move from Nvidia. The company usually releases a range of GPUs for the launch of a new architecture series, so only releasing one will be quite a departure.The RTX 4090, like the RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti, will also likely be a rather niche product due to its price, size, power demands and performance.The more affordable RTX 4080, RTX 4070 and RTX 4060 GPUs will likely have a much broader appeal \u2013 but these may not come out until 2023.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.If this leak is accurate, it may be evidence that Nvidia is struggling to get hold of enough chips (supplied by chip maker TSMC) to make numerous GPU models, and a sign that the global chip shortage is continuing to have repercussions.While we have no doubt that Nvidia will sell every RTX 4090 that it makes, thanks to pent-up demand and hype over the new Lovelace architecture, if it is indeed only launching a single, very expensive, graphics card towards the end of this year, that could be good news for its rival AMD, which is launching its next-gen RDNA 3 GPUs around the same time, and will likely offer much more affordable alternatives.\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nMatt HansonSocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, Core TechMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Core Tech, looking after computing and mobile technology.

Smith  \n\n Contributor, PCWorld   Jul 15, 2022 3:45 am PDT \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to buy a computer monitor, graphics card, or laptop without seeing AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync branding. Both promise smoother, better gaming, and in some cases both appear on the same display. But what do G-Sync and FreeSync do, exactly \u2013 and which is better?\nG-Sync vs. Freesync: The basics\nAMD\u2019s FreeSync and Nvidia\u2019s G-Sync seem complex, but the basics are straightforward. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\n\nAMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync provide smooth gameplay on compatible displays.All versions of AMD FreeSync, and Nvidia\u2019s G-Sync Compatible, are based on VESA Adaptive Sync.Most AMD FreeSync displays can sync with Nvidia graphics hardware, and most G-Sync Compatible displays can sync with AMD graphics hardware. This is unofficial, however.Nvidia G-Sync and G-Sync Ultimate displays use proprietary Nvidia G-Sync modules that only sync with Nvidia graphics cards.\nWhat is adaptive sync, anyway?\nAdaptive sync solves several problems that can seriously degrade the experience of using a PC.\nThe first problem is screen tearing.\u00a0 A display without adaptive sync will refresh at its set refresh rate (usually 60Hz, or 60 refreshes per second) no matter what. If the refresh happens to land between two frames, well, tough luck \u2013 you\u2019ll see a bit of both. This is screen tearing.\n\n\n\n\nScreen tearing is ugly and easy to notice, especially in 3D games. To fix it, games started to use a technique called V-Sync that locks the framerate of a game to the refresh rate of a display. This fixes screen tearing but also caps the performance of a game. It can also cause uneven frame pacing in some situations.\n\n\n\n\nVanessaezekowitz / Wikimedia Commons\nAdaptive sync is a better solution. A display with adaptive sync can change its refresh rate in response to how fast your graphics card is pumping out frames. If your GPU sends over 43 frames per second, your monitor displays those 43 frames, rather than forcing 60 refreshes per second. Adaptive sync stops screen tearing by preventing the display from refreshing with partial information from multiple frames but, unlike with V-Sync, each frame is shown immediately.\n\nThe result? Adaptive sync delivers smooth, consistent motion without screen tearing.\nAMD FreeSync vs. Nvidia G-Sync: Which is better?\nEnthusiasts can offer countless arguments over the advantages of AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync. However, for most people, AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync both work well and offer a similar experience. In fact, the two standards are far more similar than different.\n\n\nAll variants of AMD FreeSync are built on the VESA Adaptive Sync standard. The same is true of Nvidia\u2019s G-Sync Compatible, which is by far the most common version of G-Sync available today.\n\n\n\n\nVESA\nVESA Adaptive Sync is an open standard that any company can use to enable adaptive sync between a device and display. It\u2019s used not only by AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync Compatible monitors but also other displays, such as HDTVs, that support Adaptive Sync.\n\nPut simply: AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync Compatible are the same thing.\nAMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync Compatible are so similar, in fact, they\u2019re often cross compatible. A large majority of displays I test with support for either AMD FreeSync or Nvidia G-Sync Compatible will work with graphics hardware from the opposite brand.\n\n\nAMD FreeSync vs. Nvidia G-Sync: What\u2019s the difference?\nAMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync Compatible are built on the same open standard. Which leads to an obvious question: if that\u2019s true, what\u2019s the difference?\nThis is where G-Sync becomes a bit confusing.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis top-tier 1080p gaming monitor supports both freesync and g-sync compatible\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nAcer Nitro XV272\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia G-Sync Compatible, the most common version of G-Sync today, is based on the VESA Adaptive Sync standard. But Nvidia G-Sync and G-Sync Ultimate, the less common and more premium versions of G-Sync, use proprietary hardware in the display.\nThis is how all G-Sync displays worked when Nvidia brought the technology to market in 2013. Unlike Nvidia G-Sync Compatible monitors, which often (unofficially) works with AMD Radeon GPUs, G-Sync is unique and proprietary. It only supports adaptive sync with Nvidia graphics hardware.\n\n\nIt\u2019s usually possible to switch sides if you own an AMD FreeSync or Nvidia G-Sync Compatible display. If you buy a G-Sync or G-Sync Ultimate display, however, you\u2019ll have to stick with Nvidia GeForce GPUs. (Here\u2019s our guide to the best graphics cards for PC gaming.)\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis luxurious quantum dot oled monitor features g-sync ultimate\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nAlienware AW3423DW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$644.99 at  Dell Home  | \n$699.99 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\nThis loyalty does net some perks. The most important is G-Sync\u2019s support for a wider range of refresh rates. The VESA Adaptive Sync specification has a minimum required refresh rate (usually 48Hz, but sometimes 40Hz). A refresh rate below that can cause dropouts in Adaptive Sync, which may let screen tearing to sneak back in or, in a worst-case scenario, cause the display to flicker.\n\nG-Sync and G-Sync Ultimate support the entire refresh range of a panel \u2013 even as low as 1Hz. This is important if you play games that may hit lower frame rates, since Adaptive Sync matches the display refresh rate with the output frame rate.\nFor example, if you\u2019re playing Cyberpunk 2077 at an average of 30 FPS on a 4K display, that implies a refresh rate of 30Hz \u2013 which falls outside the range VESA Adaptive Sync supports. AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync Compatible may struggle with that, but Nvidia G-Sync and G-Sync Ultimate won\u2019t have a problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA 32-inch 4K monitor with AMD Freesync premium pro\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nDell G3223Q\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$439.99 at  Amazon  | \n$599.99 at  Dell  | \n$629.99 at  Dell Home \n\n\n\n\nAMD FreeSync Premium and FreeSync Premium Pro have their own technique of dealing with this situation called Low Framerate Compensation. It repeats frames to double the output such that it falls within a display\u2019s supported refresh rate.\nOther differences boil down to certification and testing. AMD and Nvidia have their own certification programs that displays must pass to claim official compatibility. This is why not all VESA Adaptive Sync displays claim support for AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync Compatible.\nAMD FreeSync vs. Nvidia G-Sync: HDR\nAMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync include mention of HDR in their marketing. AMD FreeSync Premium Pro promises \u201cHDR capabilities and game support.\u201d Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate boasts of \u201clifelike HDR.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\nThis is a bunch of nonsense. Neither has anything to do with HDR, though it can be helpful to understand that some level of HDR support is included in those panels. The most common HDR standard, HDR10, is an open standard from the Consumer Technology Association. AMD and Nvidia have no control over it. You don\u2019t need FreeSync or G-Sync to view HDR, either, even on each company\u2019s graphics hardware.\n\n\nPC gamers interested in HDR should instead look for VESA\u2019s DisplayHDR certification, which provides a more meaningful gauge of a monitor\u2019s HDR capabilities.\nHow to use AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync on your desktop\nAMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync are easy to use with a desktop PC.\nBoth standards are plug-and-play with officially compatible displays. Your desktop\u2019s video card will detect that the display is certified and turn on AMD FreeSync or Nvidia G-Sync automatically. You may need to activate the respective adaptive sync technology in your monitor settings, however, though that step is a rarity in modern displays. \nDisplays that support VESA Adaptive Sync, but are not officially supported by your video card, require you dig into AMD or Nvidia\u2019s driver software and turn on the feature manually. This is a painless process, however \u2013 just check the box and save your settings.\n\n\nHow to use AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync on your laptop\nAMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync are also available for use with laptop displays. Unsurprisingly, laptops that have a compatible display will be configured to use AMD FreeSync or Nvidia G-Sync from the factory.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe ultra-thin Alienware x14 includes a g-sync display\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nAlienware x14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note of caution, however: not all laptops with AMD or Nvidia graphics hardware have a display with Adaptive Sync support. Even some gaming laptops lack this feature. Pay close attention to the specifications.\nLaptops can also support AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync when connected to an external display.\nWhat\u2019s next for AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync?\nThe future of AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync is murky.\n\n\nVESA\u2019s Adaptive Sync is on its way to being the common adaptive sync standard used by the entire display industry. Though not perfect, it\u2019s good enough for most situations, and display companies don\u2019t have to fool around with AMD or Nvidia to support it.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis 4k 144hz monitor supports freesync and g-sync compatible, and has hdmi 2.1 for consoles\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nTUF Gaming VG28UQL1A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$449 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\nThat leaves AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync searching for a purpose. AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync Compatible are essentially certification programs that monitor companies can use to slap another badge on a product, though they also ensure out-of-the-box compatibility with supported graphics card. Nvidia\u2019s G-Sync and G-Sync Ultimate are technically superior, but require proprietary Nvidia hardware that adds to a display\u2019s price. This is why G-Sync and G-Sync Ultimate monitors are becoming less common.\nMy prediction is this: AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync will slowly, quietly fade away. AMD and Nvidia will speak of them less and less while displays move towards VESA Adaptive Sync badges instead of AMD and Nvidia logos.\nIf that happens, it would be good news for the PC. VESA Adaptive Sync has already united AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync Compatible displays. Eventually, display manufacturers will opt out of AMD and Nvidia branding entirely \u2013 leaving VESA Adaptive Sync as the single, open standard. We\u2019ll see how it goes.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Matthew S. Smith, Contributor, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\nMatthew S.

The latest Adrenalin Edition 22.7.1 update includes AMD Noise Suppression, which will reduce background audio noise using a real-time deep learning algorithm.AMD Noise Suppression works very similarly to RTX Broadcast, allowing you to filter unwanted background noise from your own microphone or even from someone else\u2019s device if you\u2019re on a call. AMD has integrated its Noise Suppression feature directly into the Adrenalin interface, so you don\u2019t need to download a separate app like Nvidia requires to use RTX Broadcast.Unfortunately, it won\u2019t be available to many AMD customers to start. While AMD originally wrote it would work with Ryzen 5000-series CPUs \u2014 not just AMD graphics \u2014 it turns out that\u2019s wrong. \u201cAMD Noise Suppression technology is only supported on AMD Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards and mobile GPUs, and Ryzen 6000 Series processors with RDNA 2 graphics,\u201d reads a correction from AMD\u2019s Warren Eng to The Verge.If you do have those newer RDNA 2 graphics on a supported chip, though, the feature can be enabled in the audio and video section of the Adrenalin software.You can enable AMD Noise Suppression in the Adrenalin software. Image: AMDNvidia wowed us with RTX Voice (now RTX Broadcast) a couple of years ago, and since then we\u2019ve seen Discord, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet all add background noise suppression. While it\u2019s great to have support from many different apps, the implementations vary and the beauty of RTX Broadcast and AMD Noise Suppression is that it creates a virtual microphone that you can use across any app.Alongside background noise suppression, AMD\u2019s latest drivers also include more OpenGL optimizations. AMD says Minecraft will see a performance increase of up to 85 percent over the previous driver. Radeon Boost with Variable Rate Shading has also been added to Elden Ring, Valorant, and Resident Evil Village. This will essentially use different shading rates in parts of an image to improve image quality and performance.AMD\u2019s Radeon Super Resolution upscaling feature will now be supported on discrete Radeon RX 5000 and RX 6000 series GPUs in laptops, and now includes borderless fullscreen support. This driver-based solution will upscale and improve any game\u2019s performance where AMD\u2019s superior FidelityFX Super Resolution hasn\u2019t been integrated.Correction, 7:18PM ET: AMD originally wrote that Ryzen 5000 CPUs could take advantage of the feature, but told us after publication that it was wrong \u2014 only RX 6000 graphics cards and Ryzen 6000 APUs with RDNA 2 graphics are supported.See More: EntertainmentGamingNewsPC GamingTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

The report comes from Benchlife (via Videocardz) who have managed to get a list of the new MSRPs for the top-tier Ampere lineup.\nNVIDIA Might Be Issuing A Price Cut On Its High-End GeForce RTX 30 Graphics Card Including RTX 3090 Ti, 3090, 3080 Ti & 3080\nOver the last couple of days, we have seen a massive price drop on graphics cards. These not just include NVIDIA GeForce graphics cards but also the AMD Radeon lineup too.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSThe huge price drop comes as a reaction to the crypto crash which has resulted in a huge amount of used GPUs flooding the market and also the fact that the next-gen graphics cards from both manufacturers are going to launch in the coming months and AMD & NVIDIA don't want to sit on stockpiles of current-gen inventory which won't easily sell once the new generation of cards enters the market. That is unless NVIDIA and AMD can get rid of the majority of this inventory right now by offering price cuts and promotions such as game bundles, etc.\nNVIDIA, to make room for their high-end GeForce RTX 40 series graphics card lineup, is reportedly planning on cutting the prices of various high-end GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards. The new prices are expected to be lower than the original MSRPs which these cards never sold at in their 2 years lifespan since launch and only happen to be selling now when the new generation is on the verge of launching.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Graphics Card New MSRPs 'Rumored' (Credits: Benchlife):\n\n\n\n\nOriginal MSRP\nNew MSRP (7/13)\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3090Ti\n$1,999.00\n$1,499.00\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3090\n$1,499.00\n$1,299.00\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080Ti\n$1,199.00\n$1,099.00\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080 (12GB)\n-\n$799.00\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080 (10GB)\n$699.00\n-\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3070Ti\n$599.00\n-\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3070\n$499.00\n-\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3060Ti\n$399.00\n-\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3060\n$329.00\n-\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3050\n$249.99\n-\n\n\n\nStarting with the new prices, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti will be sold at $1499.99 US (MSRP - $1999.99 US), RTX 3090 will be sold at $1299.99 US (MSRP - $1499.99 US), RTX 3080 Ti will be sold at $1099 US (MSRP - $1199.99 US), the RTX 3080 12 GB which never got an MSRP will be sold at $799.99 US while the RTX 3080 10 GB will be sold at its MSRP of $699.99 US.\nThe new MSRPs are strictly for the Founders Edition variants but we have seen various custom models selling for far less than the MSRPs. The recent Amazon Prime Day listings showed many cards listed even below the new MSRPs which is good for users in dire need of a new graphics card but for those who can wait, they may as well save the money and grab an RTX 40 series graphics card when they launch.\n\nRTX 3090 Ti price cut does now seem to be global\nOnce you add to cart, rebate is applied, taking price from \u00a31879 to \u00a31599 pic.twitter.com/rYJPy06aXr\n\u2014 Charlie (@ghost_motley) July 14, 2022\n\nAt the same time, we don't want to force anyone away from purchasing these graphics cards since we don't know how well the supply is going to be for the GeForce RTX 40 series lineup. As we saw with the GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards, NVIDIA had a tough time dealing with scalpers and the same could very well happen at the start of the RTX 40 series launch. Whether NVIDIA and its retail partners have proper precautions in place to deal with scalpers this time remains to be seen.\nAll major US retailers such as BestBuy and Newegg have currently listed the high-end GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards at the new NVIDIA MSRPs as you can see below:\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series Graphics Card Prices at Newegg:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series Graphics Card Prices at BestBuy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nIn fact, the only place where the new prices aren't mentioned is NVIDIA's own Store but it makes sense since NVIDIA hasn't officially announced the price cuts by themselves and will reportedly do so this week.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n153\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n87\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n75\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock/Future)\n\n\n\n\nA number of recent news items over the past few weeks have given us more insight into the soon to be announced next-gen graphics cards and processors, and if what we've heard is true, it looks like we've decided that energy efficiency and conservation is for suckers and newbs.First, there's long been rumors that the next-gen Nvidia Lovelace graphics cards are going to be energy hogs, but earlier this week reliable Twitter leaker Kopite7kimi posted some supposed specs for a high-end Nvidia RTX 4000-series card, possibly a Titan-class card, that could have upwards of 800W of power draw.Now, we're hearing news from Wccftech that the soon-to-be-announced AMD Ryzen 7000-series desktop processors appear to be throwing off any pretense at efficiency as well, with a reported 170W TDP for the top-tier Ryzen 9 chip.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nBuilding a gaming PC is too expensive, and GPUs really aren't helping\n\n\n\n\nI'm tired of waiting for AMD's entry-level Ryzen 9000 series chips\n\n\n\nAssuming you paired these two components together and nothing else, you'd have nearly a whole kilowatt of power being sucked up by just the processor and graphics card, meaning that everything else will absolutely push this system over the 1000W line.Without question, this would likely be the best gaming PC ever built, but is it even worth it at this point?Do we really need this much power?Plenty of the best graphics cards are energy sinks, like the Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti which has a rated TGP of 450W. It is unquestionably powerful, and it can make the best PC games look amazing, but I've had the priviledge of playing these games on all of this high-end hardware, and I can honestly say that the 4K eye candy that you'll get from an RTX 3090 Ti is very real, but the RTX 3070 or even the RTX 3060 Ti looks more than sweet enough for the vast majority of people.As for 170W for, let's say, an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X, this would definitely make for a very powerful processor, but one whose power is absolutely wasted on the consumer market. This kind of power would be a multitasking champ, no doubt, but it's getting to be the processor equivalent of juggling a half-dozen knives while riding a circus bear in a tutu and balancing a bottle on your nose. An impressive feat, but it's ultimately just a spectacle. Nobody ever really needs to do this many things that necessitate this kind of performance in everyday life.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Meanwhile, Intel seemed to be going in the right direction before Alder Lake with an emphasis on improving efficiency on their processors, but the 12th-gen chips seem to have reversed a lot of that good work in order to reclaim the company's previous best-in-class performance.Accepting good enoughThere is a notion that only 1.25x or 1.5x performance increases can be considered a success, and that you need to pull off this kind of thing every one to two years. Some are talking about 2x performance increases for Nvidia Lovelace, and who knows what Intel Raptor Lake will bring.\u00a0At some point, we're amassing all this computing power at the consumer level for the sake of amassing this power because we can. Then we just go and use it to stream Netflix.This is not to say that performance increases aren't worth pursuing, but we should aim to match performance with our needs, not introduce this kind of performance and then look for new ways to use it \u2013 at least that can't be the default assumption every time.\u00a0There's nothing wrong with Nvidia coming out and saying that the RTX 4090 isn't any more powerful than the RTX 3090, but that it uses half the energy, or that it cost a fifth of the price. Value and efficiency seem to have been completely thrown by the wayside, and that isn't just a mistake, it's increasingly unethical.Performance at all costs actually imposes real, concrete costsA Color-Enhanced Satellite View Of The Northwest Portion Of The Dixie Fire On August 17, 2021 (Image credit: Pierre Markuse / Flickr)There are two major issues with performance being the only metric that seems to matter anymore.First, energy isn't free; not environmentally, and not economically. As it stands, rising carbon emissions are projected to make large, heavily populated swaths of the planet partially if not entirely uninhabitable at an accelerating pace. Our flagrant misuse of scarce energy resources requires producing more carbon emissions to keep up with our actual needs, and the trade-off simply isn't worth it.\u00a0The consequences are assumed to be far enough in the future for most people to believe that it's a problem that we can solve tomorrow. That simply isn't true, as the recent heatwave in Europe and the continuing wildfires in the Western United States make plainly obvious, not to mention one of the worst droughts in recent history in parts of the Global South that gets far less, if any, attention the way middle- and upper-class families fleeing their suburban homes in California do.What will it take?If that can't convince us to be more rational about what we consider \"progress\" let's just point out a simple economic reality here: getting to this level of performance is just going to make these products even more expensive, pricing even more people out as families struggle with inflation and rising energy costs.The current generation of graphics cards is already out of reach for most because they are just too expensive. This trend looks to continue in the future, making essential technology for the modern economy something that only the well-off can afford, whether that means families or affluent gamers buying wildly overpowered showpieces or rich countries that can afford to make research investments in these increasingly expensive technologies while universities in poorer countries increasingly get pushed aside.All of this is a recipe for widening social divides at a time when everyone is going to be under more pressure than ever from a changing climate for everything from vaccines to drinking water.I love computers and I am a lifelong PC gamer, so I get it, I really do. But I can also tell you that the performance of the RTX 3090 Ti, as impressive as it is has seriously diminishing returns after a while.

Now, AMD has launched a similar tool for computers powered by its chips, and it could vastly improve your gaming and live streaming experience or lead to cleaner recordings. AMD's Noise Suppression tool can reduce background chatter and sounds in real time through the use of a deep learning algorithm.The feature works for both input and output devices, which means it can not only suppress noise captured on your mic, but also noise coming from someone else's. It can help you stay focused if you're in a meeting or attending online classes, for instance, because it can block the sounds of somebody's barking dog or crying baby in the background.That said, Noise Suppression is only available for computers with Ryzen 5000 series and newer processors, as well as for systems with Radeon RX 6000 series and newer graphics cards. If you know your computer has the components needed to access the feature, make sure to upgrade to the latest version of AMD Software before heading to the Settings page.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementUnder Audio Settings in the Audio & Video tab, you'll see a toggle to enable the feature. You can also choose to switch it on for either your input or your output device or for both of them at the same time. The next time you fire up a game or a communications app, such as Microsoft Teams or Slack, you can take advantage of the benefits of the noise suppression tool, so long as you select the \"AMD Streaming Device\" option as your input and/or output device.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

Events ranged from tech demos to virtual meditation and yoga classes to an exclusive Q&A with NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang.\nThe three stories below highlight the meaningful work of our interns \u2014 who are roughly half undergrads, half grad students \u2014 and the connections they\u2019ve been forging.\nBailey Tinkers His Way Into Computer Engineering\nEver since he started tinkering with PC parts at age 12, Darryl Bailey \u2014 a computer engineering student at Georgia Tech \u2014 knew he wanted to work with computers.\nHe\u2019s doing just that this summer as an ASIC verification intern on the Compute Express Link team, which ensures bug-free pre-silicon design across multiple GPUs. So far, he\u2019s worked on a dashboard that will simplify the workflows of design verification engineers.\n\u201cThis project specifically has a high impact because the script is going to be used by all design verification engineers at NVIDIA,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really cool feeling to have my code out there in action.\u201d\nBailey hasn\u2019t just been gaining technical skills here. He\u2019s also honed his work style and learned how to use soft skills to most effectively wield the hard skills he\u2019s acquired at school.\n\u201cThe most important thing I\u2019ve gotten out of this internship is that we\u2019re all just one big team,\u201d he said. \u201cI realized that as much as I want to learn and dive into everything related to computers, it\u2019s also okay to just focus on one thing, because we\u2019re all working together towards the final goal.\u201d\nKulkarni Pioneers a Path in Engineering\n\nThis summer, Seema Kulkarni, an electrical and computer engineering student at the University of Texas at Austin, joined NVIDIA as a software R&D intern working on NVIDIA Omniverse, a virtual world simulation and collaboration platform for 3D workflows.\nKulkarni comes from a background with limited early exposure to careers in tech. Her academic journey initially suggested a future in finance and marketing. But, wanting to make a more tangible impact, she switched over to engineering.\n\u201cI really loved sitting in on the Women\u2019s Leadership Panel hosted by the University Recruiting team because it felt inspiring to know that even as a woman, you can stay in technical fields for a long time and love it,\u201d she said. \u201cSeeing these female leaders drive innovation here at NVIDIA affirmed that no matter where you\u2019re at, there\u2019s always room to flourish.\u201d\nSo far, Kulkarni has been working on projects like building asset validators that will simplify user interface for NVIDIA Omniverse users and debugging Universal Scene Description code to resolve critical issues. It\u2019s taught her to be a better software engineer because it\u2019s challenged her to think in the way that the engineers that came before her did.\nKim Kicks Off Her Second Round in Technical Writing\nWriting may not be the first thing that comes to mind when one thinks about an internship at NVIDIA.\nBut as JJ Kim, a marketing major from Boston University, points out, communication is key in any business, even in tech.\nThis summer, Kim\u2019s returning for her second stint on the enterprise marketing team as a technical writing intern. She\u2019s assisted with SIGGRAPH preparations and is churning out explainer blogs, which break down technical concepts in a digestible, approachable way.\n\u201cI always feel like I\u2019m learning new things when I write these explainer blogs because they do such a good job of helping someone like me \u2014 who has limited technical knowledge \u2014 understand what it is that NVIDIA technology does and the impact that it\u2019s making,\u201d she said.\nKim says what\u2019s brought her back for a second internship is NVIDIA\u2019s inclusive, welcoming culture.\n\u201cEveryone is so willing to help, which makes work feel like such a safe environment,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to try new things out or ask questions because I have such an amazing team of experienced people to work with.\u201d\nRead more about NVIDIA\u2019s internship program.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Engineers are using the NVIDIA Omniverse 3D simulation platform as part of a proof of concept that promises to become a model for putting green energy to work around the world.\nDubbed Gigastack, the pilot project \u2014 led by a consortium that includes Phillips 66 and Denmark-based renewable energy company \u00d8rsted \u2014 will create low-emission fuel for the energy company\u2019s Humber refinery in England.\nHydrogen is expected to play a critical role as the world moves to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels over the coming years. The market for hydrogen fuel is predicted to grow over 45x to $90 billion by 2030, up from $1.8 billion today.\nThe Gigastack project aims to showcase how green energy can be woven into complex, industrial energy infrastructure on a massive scale and accelerate net-zero emissions progress.\nTo make that happen, new kinds of collaboration are vital, explained Ahsan Yousufzai, global head of business development for energy surface at NVIDIA, during a conversation about the project in an on-demand panel discussion at NVIDIA GTC.\n\u201cTo meet global sustainability targets, the entire energy ecosystem needs to work together,\u201d Yousufzai said. \u201cFor that, technologies like AI and digital twins will play a major role.\u201d\nThe system \u2014 now in the planning stages \u2014 will draw power from \u00d8rsted\u2019s massive Hornsea 1,218-megawatt offshore wind farm, the largest in the world upon its completion in January last year.\n\nHornsea will be connected to ITM Power\u2019s Gigastack electrolyzer facility, which will use electrolysis to turn water into clean, renewable hydrogen fuel.\nThat fuel, in turn, will be put to work at Phillips 66\u2019s Humber refinery, decarbonizing one of the U.K.\u2019s largest industrial facilities.\nThe project is unique because of its scale \u2014 with plans to eventually ramp up Gigastack into a massive 1-gigawatt electrolyzer system \u2014 and because of its potential to become a blueprint for deploying electrolyzer technology for wider decarbonization.\nWeaving all these elements together, however, requires tight collaboration between team members from Element Energy, ITM Power, \u00d8rsted, Phillips 66 and Worley.\nWorley \u2014 one of the largest global providers of engineering and professional services to the oil, gas, mining, power and infrastructure industries \u2014 turned to Aspen Technology\u2019s Aspen OptiPlant, sophisticated software that\u2019s a workhouse for planning and optimizing some of the world\u2019s most complex infrastructure.\n\u201cWhen you have a finite amount of money to be spent, you want to maximize the number of options on how facilities can be designed, fabricated and constructed,\u201d explained Vishal Mehta, senior vice president at Worley.\n\u201cThis is the importance of rapid optioneering, where you\u2019re able to run AI models and engines with not only mathematics but also visual representation,\u201d Mehta said. \u201cPeople can come up with ideas and, in real time, move them around with mathematical equations changing in the background.\u201d\nWorley relied on AspenTech\u2019s OptiPlant to develop a 3D conceptual layout of the Gigastack green hydrogen project. The industrial optimization software combines decades of process modeling expertise with cutting-edge AI and machine learning.\nThe next step: connecting OptiPlant\u2019s sophisticated physics-based plant piping and layout capabilities to build a 3D conceptual layout of the plant with Omniverse, potentially allowing teams to work together on plant design in real-time \u2014 connecting their various 3D software tools, datasets and teams together.\n\u201cWith a traditional model review, it\u2019s one person leading the way, but here we have this opportunity for everybody to be immersed in the facility,\u201d said Sonali Singh, vice president of product management for performance engineering at AspenTech. \u201cThey can really all collaborate by looking at their individual priorities.\u201d\nOmniverse can be the platform on which they further build their digital twin of the growing facility, enabling connection of simulation data and AIs, capturing knowledge from human and AI collaborators working on the project and bringing intelligent optimization.\nTo learn more, watch the on-demand GTC session and explore the Gigastack project.\nFind out how Siemens Gamesa and Zenotech are accelerating offshore wind farm simulations with NVIDIA\u2019s full-stack technologies.

The intelligent EV is poised to redefine the grand tourer category with innovative, software-defined capabilities that bring luxurious cruising to the next level.\nThe vehicle\u2019s marquee features include an in-vehicle AI assistant and autonomous driving system powered by NVIDIA DRIVE Orin.\nThe GT badge first appeared on vehicles in the mid-20th century, denoting smooth performance with a roomy interior for longer joy rides. Since then, the segment has diversified, with varied takes on horsepower and body design.\nThe HiPhi Z further iterates on the vehicle type, emphasizing smart performance and a convenient, comfortable in-cabin experience.\nSmooth Sailing\nAn EV designed to be driven, the GT HiPhi Z also incorporates robust advanced driver assistance features that can give humans a break on longer trips.\nThe HiPhi Pilot ADAS platform provides dual redundancy for computing, perception, communication, braking, steering and power supply. It uses the high-performance AI compute of NVIDIA DRIVE Orin and 34 sensors to perform assisted driving and parking, as well as smart summon, which transports the car autonomously to the driver with the touch of an app.\nDRIVE Orin is designed to handle the large number of applications and deep neural networks running simultaneously for autonomous driving capabilities. It\u2019s architected to achieve systematic safety standards such as the ISO 26262 ASIL-D.\nWith this high level of performance at its core, the HiPhi Pilot system delivers seamless automated features that remove the stress from driving.\nIntelligent Interior\nStaying true to its GT DNA, the HiPhi Z sports a luxurious interior that delivers effortless comfort for both the driver and passengers.\nThe cabin includes suede bucket seats, ambient panel lights and a 23-speaker audio system for an immersive sensory environment.\nIt\u2019s also intelligent, with the HiPhi Bot AI companion that can automatically adjust aspects of the vehicle experience. The AI assistant uses a vehicle-grade, adjustable, high-speed motion robotic arm to interact with passengers. It can move back and forth in less than a second, with control accuracy of up to 0.001 millimeters, performing a variety of delicate movements seamlessly.\nThe GT HiPhi Z is currently on display in Shenzen, China, and will tour nearly a dozen other cities. Human Horizons plans to release details of the full launch at the Chengdu Auto Show in August.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This is the most apparent in the mainstream, prime time battleground: Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3070 versus AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 6750 XT.\nGrab some popcorn, the entire family, and some 3D glasses, the show is about to start! Can the refreshed RX 6750 XT compete with the RTX 3070\u2019s popularity amongst gamers? We\u2019ll cover the specs, pricing, performance, and which of these two hotrods deserves your hard-earned cash. Oh, both companies have a few software tricks up their sleeves, too, such as Nvidia\u2019s DLSS and AMD\u2019s RSR resolution-scaling technologies.\n\n\n[For a complete rundown of today\u2019s graphics card scene, see our best GPUs for PC gaming roundup.] \nNvidia RTX 3070 vs. AMD RX 6750 XT: Price\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$520 at  Newegg \n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s safe now\u2014GPUs are available everywhere. Prices have quickly returned to MSRP, and below in some cases. While the GeForce RTX 3080 and above tier of GPUs have seen the biggest price drops, you can expect the retail on the RTX 3070 to be much closer to $499 (and generally under $579 for most models, though some models remain more expensive.) The AMD Radeon RX 6750 XT is also right in that $499 to $549 spot.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIs it really safe to buy, though? With Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4000 and next-gen AMD RDNA 3 graphics cards on the horizon, today\u2019s MSRP prices are not as sweet as you\u2019d think. We surmise that there is still another round of price drops to come upon the announcement of next generation hardware, so tread these waters carefully.\nNvidia RTX 3070 vs. AMD RX 6750 XT: Performance\nPerformance is key in this portion of the market, where price pressure makes every ounce that can be squeezed from the silicon extra valuable.\u00a0\n\nIn Watch Dogs Legion, the RX 6750 XT draws even at 1440p, and the opens up an imperceptible lead as the resolution increases. This is with the software magic disabled, such as DLSS and ray tracing.\n\n\n\n\nA minor victory for the 6750 XT at 1080p.\nThiago Trevisan\nThe close story continues in a similar fashion with Horizon Zero Dawn, but this time the RTX 3070 eeks out a minor victory. Also note that the RX 6750 XT has a very minor performance bump over the RX 6700 XT that it replaces.\u00a0\n\n\nSome games, such as Borderlands 3, seem to perform better on the AMD GPUs such as the RX 6750 XT, giving it a win over the RTX 3070.\n\n\n\n\nThiago Trevisan\nYou\u2019ve seen the pure hardware power of the GPUs above, so what happens when we introduce other technology in the mix?\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s take AMD\u2019s Smart Access Memory and Radeon Super Resolution, two driver-level features that work in any game. Nvidia can also take advantage of turbocharged software, though its great DLSS solution requires active developer integration into games (as does AMD\u2019s rival FSR). These technologies allow you to balance a high level of performance with a visually optimal experience.\u00a0\nIs the RX 6750 XT faster than the RTX 3070 as AMD claims in the graphic below? Yes, but that is greatly helped by using the RSR and SAM technologies covered above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s software magic to bring it over the top.\nThiago Trevisan\nNvidia still maintains a sizable advantage when it comes to ray tracing, however. As demonstrated by switching it on Ultra in Watch Dogs Legion, Nvidia has a dominant lead with it activated\u2014and this is without DLSS active. It can be argued that ray tracing presents diminishing returns for most games, but it can still have an impressive visual impact. As the RTX 3070 and RX 6750 XT are entering the higher performance tiers of GPUs, it should be of interest to the mid- and high-end gamers.\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is still king when it comes to ray tracing.\nThiago Trevisan\nNvidia RTX 3070 vs. AMD RX 6750 XT: Power and other things to know\nThe RTX 3070 and RX 6750 XT are not power hungry compared to their larger brethren, but still pack a 220W TDP on the Nvidia side, and a TDP of 250W for the 6750 XT. This means you\u2019ll need a decent power supply, and adequate case air flow. They\u2019re entering the higher tier of GPUs, with performance equaling last generation\u2019s top dog: the RTX 2080 Ti.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RTX 3070 can have a big cooler, too! Thiago Trevisan\nThese GPUs are fantastic for 1080p high-refresh gaming, as well as 1440p. That\u2019s their sweet spot. While they can do 4K, some games may require the power of, say, an RTX 3080 and above class of GPUs.\nSo, is the RX 6750 XT upgrade enough to beat the RTX 3070?\nIt\u2019s a tough time to be a GPU: prices have plummeted. But they\u2019re still high enough in relation to the proximal release of the next-generation GPUs that people are right to be wary of buying now.\u00a0\n\n\nThe release of the 6750 XT came during this decline \u2013 therefore relegating it to the sidelines rather quickly. It certainly has the performance chops to match or beat the RTX 3070 in many cases, especially with the AMD SAM and RSR boost it gets. Generally, the RTX 3070 is still a more popular offering\u2014and it does excel in ray tracing over the AMD option if that\u2019s your thing.\u00a0\nThe advantage would still play in the RTX 3070\u2019s favor long term, but AMD certainly has put up a great fight, at a lower average cost than Nvidia\u2019s option. If you can find one at a significant discount over the other, that may also be a deciding factor.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$520 at  Newegg \n\n\n\n\nThe smart money is on waiting longer, however. RTX 4000 and AMD\u2019s own offerings are going to be here soon, and that will depress prices on the current lineup of GPUs even further. While one can\u2019t wait forever, the unique circumstances of the current market make it logical to wait just a bit more. You\u2019ll likely be rewarded with an even better price, or better performance as the case with the next-generation releases.\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Thiago Trevisan, Contributor, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\nThiago Trevisan is a Mac and PC enthusiast for over 20 years, and has written for PCWorld and Macworld since 2021.

The vehicles will run on the Pony.ai autonomous driving controller (ADC), built on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin.\nThe joint venture plans to produce a mixed fleet of new energy and internal combustion engine vehicles, with the goal of increasing the share of alternative powertrains over time.\nLong-haul trucks play a vital role in the global economy. Around the world, companies delivered a total of 257 billion packages in 2021 \u2014 a number expected to nearly double in four years, according to Guidehouse consultancy.\nThe addressable market for trucking is substantial. In 2021 alone, heavy truck sales in China exceeded 1.3 million units, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers reported.\nAt the same time, persistent worker shortages are putting pressure on the industry, with drivers making up 25-30% of the total cost of long-haul trucking.\nCompanies are beginning to turn toward autonomous trucks to help ease these bottlenecks \u2014\u00a0 Guidehouse estimates that, by 2032, more than 1.2 million automated trucks and buses will be deployed worldwide each year, with more than half of those vehicles operating in China.\nPony.ai and SANY are working to deliver automated solutions even sooner, with small-scale deliveries beginning this year, and mass production planned for 2024. Within a few years, the venture will reach an annual production of around 10,000 trucks.\nFrom Horsepower to AI Power\nThe new joint venture is able to achieve near-term deployment by building these autonomous trucks on the high-performance, automotive-grade NVIDIA DRIVE Orin system-on-a-chip.\nIn June, Pony.ai unveiled its latest generation ADC, designed for the low-latency and real-time deep neural network (DNN) performance necessary for safe autonomous driving. The AV platform includes both single and dual DRIVE Orin configurations, achieving 254 and 508 trillion operations per second (TOPS), respectively.\nAs a software-defined compute platform, DRIVE Orin is designed to handle large numbers of applications and DNNs simultaneously, while achieving systematic safety standards, to ensure safe, highly advanced intelligent driving.\nWith DRIVE Orin, Pony.ai and SANY\u2019s autonomous trucks can seamlessly handle the demands of long-haul shipping, running around the clock.\nWorking Together for More Intelligent Delivery\nCollaboration is a key driver behind deploying autonomous vehicles in the short term.\nIn addition to working with SANY, Pony.ai recently formed a joint venture with logistics platform provider Sinotrans, one of the largest logistics companies in China, to develop an intelligent logistics network.\nBy combining smart fleet management with software-defined vehicles, these joint ventures are poised to revolutionize delivery, creating a powerful standard and framework for future development in the industry.\nAnd with NVIDIA DRIVE Orin at the core, these fleets are redefining horsepower for the long haul.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In its home market alone, around 4 million chest X-rays a year are analyzed by Lunit AI models.\nLunit has partnered with GE Healthcare, Fujifilm, Philips and Guardant Health to deploy its AI products. Last year, it achieved FDA clearance for two AI tools: one that analyzes mammograms for signs of breast cancer, and another that triages critical findings in chest X-rays. It\u2019s also received the CE mark in Europe for these, as well as a third model that analyzes tumors in cancer tissue samples.\n\u201cBy going public, which is just one step in our long journey, I strongly believe that we will succeed and accomplish our mission to conquer cancer through AI,\u201d said Brandon Suh, CEO of Lunit.\nLunit raised $60 million in venture capital funding late last year, and its current market cap is some $320 million, based on its latest closing price. Following its recent regulatory approvals, the startup is expanding its presence in the U.S. and the European Union. It\u2019s also developing additional AI models for 3D mammography.\nBrandon Suh, CEO of Lunit, beats a drum in celebration of the company\u2019s IPO at the Korean Exchange.\nForging Partnerships to Deploy AI for Radiology, Oncology\nLunit has four AI products to help radiologists and pathologists detect cancer and deliver care:\n\nLunit INSIGHT CXR: Trained on a dataset of 3.5 million cases, this tool detects 10 of the most common findings in chest X-rays with 97-99% accuracy.\nLunit INSIGHT MMG: This product reduces the chance that physicians overlook breast cancer in the screening mammography by 50%.\nLunit SCOPE IO: Demonstrating 94% accuracy, this AI helps identify 50% more patients eligible for immunotherapy by analyzing tissue slide images of more than 15 types of cancer, including lung, breast and colorectal cancer.\nLunit SCOPE PD-L1: Trained on more than 1 million annotated cell images, the tool helps accurately quantify expression levels of PD-L1, a protein that influences immune response.\n\nGE Healthcare made eight AI algorithms from INSIGHT CXR available through its Thoracic Care Suite to flag abnormalities in lung X-rays, including pneumonia, tuberculosis and lung nodules.\nFujifilm incorporated INSIGHT CXR into its AI-powered product to analyze chest X-rays. Lunit AI connects to Fujufilm\u2019s X-ray devices and PACS imaging system, and is already used in more than 130 sites across Japan to detect chest nodules, collapsed lung, and fluid or other foreign substances in the lungs.\nPhilips, too, is adopting INSIGHT CXR, making the software accessible to users of its diagnostic X-ray solutions.\u00a0And Guardant Health, a liquid biopsy company, made a $26 million strategic investment in Lunit to support the company\u2019s innovation in precision oncology through the Lunit SCOPE tissue analysis products.\nAccelerating Insights With NVIDIA AI\nLunit develops its AI models using various NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs, including NVIDIA A100 GPUs, in the cloud. Its customers can deploy Lunit\u2019s AI with an NVIDIA GPU-powered server on premises or in the cloud \u2014 or within a medical imaging device using the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform.\nThe company also uses NVIDIA TensorRT software to optimize its trained AI models for real-world deployment.\n\u201cThe goal here is to optimize our AI in actual user settings \u2014 for the specific NVIDIA GPUs that operate the AI,\u201d said Donggeun Yoo, chief of research at Lunit.\nOver the years, Lunit has presented its work at NVIDIA GTC and as an NVIDIA Inception member at the prestigious RSNA conference for radiology.\n\u201cIt was very helpful for us to build credibility as a startup,\u201d said Yoo. \u201cI believe joining Inception helped trigger the bigger acknowledgements that followed from the healthcare industry.\u201d\nJoin the NVIDIA Inception community of over 10,000 technology startups, and register for NVIDIA GTC, running online Sept. 19-22, to attend the session \u201cAccelerate Patient-Centric Innovation with Makers and Breakers in Healthcare Life Science.\u201d\nSubscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | Jetson | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Wade was no longer the law of the land, Americans have started turning to a different institution to protect their lives: their employer. The tech and games industry is no different. Staff at Nvidia, which is headquartered in Silicon Valley but has offices in other states as well, have been disappointed that the graphics card manufacturer has not taken a stance on their right to life-saving healthcare.Suggested ReadingSquare Enix Announces A Big RPG Sale In The Best Way PossibleMaster Mai Shiranui's Ferocious Flame Stocks In Street Fighter 6Assassin's Creed Shadows Is A Game For Animal LoversLive Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'\n\n\n\n\n\nShare Share this VideoFacebookTwitterEmailRedditLinkview videoLive Forever in the Universe of New World: AeternumSuggested ReadingSquare Enix Announces A Big RPG Sale In The Best Way PossibleMaster Mai Shiranui's Ferocious Flame Stocks In Street Fighter 6Assassin's Creed Shadows Is A Game For Animal LoversLive Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'\n\n\n\n\n\nShare Share this VideoFacebookTwitterEmailRedditLinkLive Forever in the Universe of New World: AeternumEmployees at the chip giant had expected better from Nvidia because it had previously supported causes such as pride and women in leadership. One source that spoke to Kotaku on the condition of anonymity recalled that the company had taken the initiative to relocate employees who were working out of Ukraine during the invasion. \u201cA lot of tech companies [think] there\u2019s kind of a cost benefit analysis of taking a stance on things like [abortion],\u201d the current Nvidia employee told Kotaku. \u201c[They] don\u2019t want to be political.\u201d Another frustrated employee wanted \u201cclear messaging from the top\u201d and \u201ca substantial response\u201d to the recent legal attacks on trans rights and abortions. Kotaku reached out to Nvidia about its stance on abortion rights, but did not get a response by the time of publication.AdvertisementRelated Content$10 Bundle Includes Hundreds Of Games, Helps Fund Access To AbortionPlayStation Boss Asks Staff To Respect All Abortion Opinions In Email About CatsRelated Content$10 Bundle Includes Hundreds Of Games, Helps Fund Access To AbortionPlayStation Boss Asks Staff To Respect All Abortion Opinions In Email About CatsGuaranteed access to abortions has become an important issue for employees because the GPU maker has offices in trigger law states such as Texas and Missouri, and some employees have raised the concern in company Slack channels. \u201cAt the start of [Roe being struck down], the majority of [Slack] messages were like: \u2018We just want leadership to say that we know this affects our employees,\u201d said a current employee at Nvidia. \u201cPeople in Missouri and Texas are looking for specifics about what kind of help they can expect.\u201d AdvertisementKotaku was able to obtain screenshots from the \u201cWomen in Technology Resource Group\u201d channel in the Nvidia corporate Slack server. One staff member said, \u201cI personally already know of at least one employee that\u2019s having to arrange and pay for their own relocation in response to these laws [against abortion].\u201d Another felt \u201cshocked that there has been zero corporate communication\u201d because of Nvidia\u2019s expanding office in Austin, Texas. At the time of writing, the company lists 253 open jobs in Texas, the most openings at any location outside of California. The company also has offices in Alabama and Utah, where abortion is either illegal or will only be available to rape victims. AdvertisementThe chair of the women\u2019s resource group at Nvidia reached out to HR about the matter, and then relayed the following response to the group: \u201cLeadership is aware and we also encourage you to please use the suggestion box.\u201d One employee pointed out that they already had an entire thread dedicated to the issue, and expressed frustration that employees were expected to take the initiative \u201con our own time.\u201d ZeniMax is another tech company that drew employee ire over its failure to immediately support employees in trigger law states. But while the publisher\u2019s response was not timely or adequate, Nvidia\u2019s affected employees are still waiting for their executives to act on their loss of reproductive rights at all.Advertisement\u201cPersonally, I would like leadership to say that [they\u2019re] going to do everything [they] can to make sure our insurance continues to cover this,\u201d a current employee told Kotaku. The employee noted that Nvidia\u2019s health insurace covered out-of-state expenses for abortions, but felt concerned that material support for abortion was left to a third party that did not have employees\u2019 best interests in mind. They also expressed concern about the possibility that the insurance company could change its policies, or that Nvidia could switch to an insurance plan that did not provide coverage for abortions. \u201cI would appreciate some kind of commitment from leadership to doing everything they can to make sure that we do have coverage in the event that anybody needs it.\u201d Update 07/07/2022 5:19 p.m. ET: An Nvidia spokesperson provided the following comment:  Our focus remains on supporting the health and  wellness needs of our employees and their families. We will continue to  assist employees who need to travel for care, including reimbursement of  travel costs.Continue reading"

Data from what Biden described as the \u201cmiraculous telescope\u201d are also being soaked up by a new generation of GPU-accelerated AI created at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\nAnd Morpheus, as the team at UC Santa Cruz has dubbed the AI, won\u2019t just be helping humans make sense of what we\u2019re seeing. It will also use images from the $10 billion space telescope to better understand what it\u2019s looking for.\nThe image released by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Monday represents the deepest and sharpest infrared images of the distant universe to date. Dubbed \u201cWebb\u2019s First Deep Field,\u201d the image of galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 is overflowing with detail.\nAnswering Questions\nNASA reported that thousands of galaxies \u2014 including the faintest objects ever observed in the infrared \u2014 have appeared in Webb\u2019s view for the first time.\nAnd Monday\u2019s image represents just a tiny piece of what\u2019s out there, with the image covering a patch of sky roughly the size of a grain of sand held at arm\u2019s length by someone on the ground, explained NASA Administrator Bill Nelson.\nThe telescope\u2019s iconic array of 18 interlocking hexagonal mirrors, which span a total of 21 feet 4 inches, are peering far deeper into the universe and deeper into the universe\u2019s past than any tool to date.\n\u201cWe are going to be able to answer questions that we don\u2019t even know what the questions are yet,\u201d Nelson said.\nStrange New Worlds\nU.S. President Joe Biden unveiled the first image from the $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope Monday. It shows galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 as it appeared 4.6 billion years ago. The combined mass of this galaxy cluster acts as a gravitational lens, magnifying much more distant galaxies behind it.\nThe telescope won\u2019t just see back further in time than any scientific instrument \u2014 almost to the beginning of the universe \u2014 it may also help us see if planets outside our solar system are habitable, Nelson said.\nMorpheus \u2014 which played a key role in helping scientists understand images taken on NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope \u2014 will help scientists ask, and answer, these questions.\nWorking with Ryan Hausen, a Ph.D. student in UC Santa Cruz\u2019s computer science department, UC Santa Cruz Astronomy and Astrophysics Professor Brant Robertson helped create a deep learning framework that classifies astronomical objects, such as galaxies, based on the raw data streaming out of telescopes on a pixel-by-pixel basis.\n\u201cThe JWST will really enable us to see the universe in a new way that we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cSo it\u2019s really exciting.\u201d\nEventually, Morpheus will also be using the images to learn, too. Not only are the JWST\u2019s optics unique, but JWST will also be collecting light galaxies that are further away \u2014 and thus redder \u2014 than were visible on the Hubble.\nMorpheus is trained on UC Santa Cruz\u2019s Lux supercomputer. The machine includes 28 GPU nodes with two NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs each.\nIn other words, while we\u2019ll all feasting our eyes on these images for years to come, scientists will be feeding data from the JWST to AI.\nThe University of California Santa Cruz made the image available in\u00a0a zoomable format, allowing people to hone in on individual galaxies for a closer look.\nWant to zoom in on individual galaxies? UC Santa Cruz has made these images available in an expandable format.\u00a0\nTune in: NASA and its partners will release the full series of Webb\u2019s first full-color images and data, known as spectra, Tuesday, July 12, during a live NASA TV broadcast.\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 Astrophysicist Brant Robertson Using AI to Glean Insights from James Webb Space Telescope \u2013 Ep. 171\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Supercomputing | The AI PodcastTags: Aerospace | GPU | GPU Computing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Similarly, an exabyte is a memory subsystem packing a quintillion bytes of data.\nThe \u201cflop\u201d in exaflop is an abbreviation for floating point operations. The rate at which a system executes a flop in seconds is measured in exaflop/s.\nFloating point refers to calculations made where all the numbers are expressed with decimal points.\n1,000 Petaflops = an Exaflop\nThe prefix peta- means 1015, or one with 15 zeros behind it. So, an exaflop is a thousand petaflops.\n\nTo get a sense of what a heady calculation an exaflop is, imagine a billion people, each holding a billion calculators. (Clearly, they\u2019ve got big hands!)\nIf they all hit the equal sign at the same time, they\u2019d execute one exaflop.\nIndiana University, home to the Big Red 200 and several other supercomputers, puts it this way: To match what an exaflop computer can do in just one second, you\u2019d have to perform one calculation every second for 31,688,765,000 years.\nA Brief History of the Exaflop\nFor most of supercomputing\u2019s history, a flop was a flop, a reality that\u2019s morphing as workloads embrace AI.\nPeople used numbers expressed in the highest of several precision formats, called double precision, as defined by the IEEE Standard for Floating Point Arithmetic. It\u2019s dubbed double precision, or FP64, because each number in a calculation requires 64 bits, data nuggets expressed as a zero or one. By contrast, single precision uses 32 bits.\nDouble precision uses those 64 bits to ensure each number is accurate to a tiny fraction. It\u2019s like saying 1.0001 + 1.0001 = 2.0002, instead of 1 + 1 = 2.\nThe format is a great fit for what made up the bulk of the workloads at the time \u2014 simulations of everything, from atoms to airplanes, that need to ensure their results come close to what they represent in the real world.\nSo, it was natural that the LINPACK benchmark, aka HPL, that measures performance on FP64 math became the default measurement in 1993, when the TOP500 list of world\u2019s most powerful supercomputers debuted.\nThe Big Bang of AI\nA decade ago, the computing industry heard what NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang describes as the big bang of AI.\nThis powerful new form of computing started showing significant results on scientific and business applications. And it takes advantage of some\u00a0 very different mathematical methods.\nDeep learning is not about simulating real-world objects; it\u2019s about sifting through mountains of data to find patterns that enable fresh insights.\nIts math demands high throughput, so doing many, many calculations with simplified numbers (like 1.01 instead of 1.0001) is much better than doing fewer calculations with more complex ones.\nThat\u2019s why AI uses lower precision formats like FP32, FP16 and FP8. Their 32-, 16- and 8-bit numbers let users do more calculations faster.\nMixed Precision Evolves\nFor AI, using 64-bit numbers would be like taking your whole closet when going away for the weekend.\nFinding the ideal lower-precision technique for AI is an active area of research.\nFor example, the first NVIDIA Tensor Core GPU, Volta, used mixed precision. It executed matrix multiplication in FP16, then accumulated the results in FP32 for higher accuracy.\nHopper Accelerates With FP8\nMore recently, the NVIDIA Hopper architecture debuted with a lower-precision method for training AI that\u2019s even faster. The Hopper Transformer Engine automatically analyzes a workload, adopts FP8 whenever possible and accumulates results in FP32.\nWhen it comes to the less compute-intensive job of inference \u2014 running AI models in production \u2014 major frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch support 8-bit integer numbers for fast performance. That\u2019s because they don\u2019t need decimal points to do their work.\nThe good news is NVIDIA GPUs support all precision formats (above), so users can accelerate every workload optimally.\nLast year, the IEEE P3109 committee started work on an industry standard for precision formats used in machine learning. This work could take another year or two.\nSome Sims Shine at Lower Precision\nWhile FP64 remains popular for simulations, many use lower-precision math when it delivers useful results faster.\nHPC apps vary in the factors that impact their performance.\nFor example, researchers run in FP32 a popular simulator for car crashes, LS-Dyna from Ansys. Genomics is another field that tends to prefer lower-precision math.\nIn addition, many traditional simulations are starting to adopt AI for at least part of their workflows. As workloads shift towards AI,\u00a0 supercomputers need to support lower precision to run these emerging applications well.\nBenchmarks Evolve With Workloads\nRecognizing these changes, researchers including Jack Dongarra \u2014 the 2021 Turing award winner and a contributor to HPL \u2014 debuted HPL-AI in 2019. It\u2019s a new benchmark that\u2019s better for measuring these new workloads.\n\u201cMixed-precision techniques have become increasingly important to improve the computing efficiency of supercomputers, both for traditional simulations with iterative refinement techniques as well as for AI applications,\u201d Dongarra said in a 2019 blog. \u201cJust as HPL allows benchmarking of double-precision capabilities, this new approach based on HPL allows benchmarking of mixed-precision capabilities of supercomputers at scale.\u201d\nThomas Lippert, director of the J\u00fclich Supercomputing Center, agreed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re using the HPL-AI benchmark because it\u2019s a good measure of the mixed-precision work in a growing number of our AI and scientific workloads \u2014 and it reflects accurate 64-bit floating point results, too,\u201d he said in a blog posted last year.\nToday\u2019s Exaflop Systems\nIn a June report, 20 supercomputer centers around the world reported their HPL-AI results, three of them delivering more than an exaflop.\nOne of those systems, a supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, also exceeded an exaflop in FP64 performance on HPL.\nA sampler of the June 2022 HPL-AI results.\nTwo years ago, a very unconventional system was the first to hit an exaflop. The crowd-sourced supercomputer assembled by the Folding@home consortium passed the milestone after it put out a call for help fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and was deluged with donated time on more than a million computers.\nExaflop in Theory and Practice\nSince then, many organizations have installed supercomputers that deliver more than an exaflop in theoretical peak performance. It\u2019s worth noting that the TOP500 list reports both Rmax (actual) and Rpeak (theoretical) scores.\nRmax is simply the best performance a computer actually demonstrated.\nRpeak is a system\u2019s top theoretical performance if everything could run at its highest possible level, something that almost never really happens. It\u2019s typically calculated by multiplying the number of processors in a system by their clock speed, then multiplying the result by the number of floating point operations the processors can perform in one second.\nSo, if someone says their system can do an exaflop, consider asking if that\u2019s using Rmax (actual) or Rpeak (theoretical).\nMany Metrics in the Exaflop Age\nIt\u2019s another one of the many nuances in this new exascale era.\nAnd it\u2019s worth noting that HPL and HPL-AI are synthetic benchmarks, meaning they measure performance on math routines, not real-world applications. Other benchmarks, like MLPerf, are based on real-world workloads.\nIn the end, the best measure of a system\u2019s performance, of course, is how well it runs a user\u2019s applications. That\u2019s a measure not based on exaflops, but on ROI.\nLearn more about high performance computing on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\n\n\nCategories: ExplainerTags: Artificial Intelligence | Hardware | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | Science | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Yang\u2019s artistic collaborations include major publishing organizations and global entertainment companies, and his artwork has been selected for international A-class CG galleries and competition shortlists.\nA Fractal Art Masterclass, Courtesy of NVIDIA Studio\u00a0\nYang started each Into the Void piece in Daz Studio or Autodesk 3ds Max, generating a very basic 3D shape and carefully extracting its dimensions. He then used one of his preferred fractal art applications, including Chaotica, Mandelbulb3D or, more recently, JWildfire.\nFractal artwork includes 3D mathematical shapes that are infinitely complex.\nTraditionally, these 3D-heavy apps operated exclusively on CPU architecture, with limited speed and excruciating slowdowns. Newer technology using NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs and the OpenCL programming framework dramatically accelerates the creative process so now, complex fractal geometry can be generated, previewed and modified in seconds \u2014 a boon for Yang\u2019s efficiency.\nGraphical dynamics visual effects created using Tyflow in Autodesk 3ds Max, powered by NVIDIA PhysX.\nYang then started to build mathematical formulas to create the fractal art pieces. The formulas, ever-changing samples expressed in 3D, required random trial-and-error combinations until Yang reached a satisfactory result.\nNext, he added some stylish 2D effects before importing the raw files into NVIDIA Omniverse, a 3D design collaboration and world simulation platform.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/studio-itns-wk12-create-01.mp4\n\u00a0\nBy using Omniverse\u2019s NVIDIA vMaterials library, which is derived from physical, real-world materials, Yang built cosmic voids with photorealistic details such as glass and metal pieces.\nYang constantly experiments with new colors and textures to further provoke thought.\nYang further refined textures with the Adobe Substance 3D Painter Connector. He applied Smart Materials \u2014 a feature that automatically adjusts the scene to show realistic surface details \u2014 tweaking the piece until the perfect combination presented itself.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/studio-itns-wk12-create-materials-02.mp4\n\u00a0\nThe Omniverse Create app allowed Yang to adjust lighting and shadows, all in original quality, for final compositing and rendering. His GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU powered the built-in RTX Renderer, unlocking hardware-accelerated ray tracing for fast and interactive 3D modeling.\n\nYang then turned to the NVIDIA Canvas app to quickly generate a variety of sky and space backgrounds. This process took mere minutes and was far more efficient than searching for backgrounds or even creating several from scratch.\nIn Photoshop, Yang applies the Canvas backgrounds and adjusted colors to his liking. Final exports were rapidly generated, and the Into the Void masterpiece was complete. By entering In the NVIDIA Studio, viewers can now enter the void.\nYang noted his entire creative workflow is accelerated by GPUs, with his ASUS ProArt Studio laptop serving as a necessity rather than a luxury.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how to deal without real-time ray tracing and AI acceleration of RTX GPUs,\u201d Yang said.\nFractal Origins\nFor Yang, fractal artwork manifests the purest form of his introspective views on origins. \u201cThe world was originally empty,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything from basic particles to real matter came from the void. No one knows when, where and how things in the known world appear.\u201d\n\u201cInto the Void\u201d series by Xueguo Yang.\nYang hopes to give audiences a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as his art deconstructs and reconstructs places, scenes, memories or any form of beauty that can often be taken for granted.\nThe idea of \u201cexploring\u201d rather than \u201ccreating\u201d comes from Yang\u2019s strong interests in nature, physics, philosophy and traditional Chinese medicine.\nThe series is a journey through time and space, tracing an origin in the void, he said.\nHumanoid presence invokes the presence of Tao.\nYang intentionally adds human consciousness into the void when creating fantasy worlds.\nYang\u2019s journey is fueled by music, especially rock and heavy metal, which strongly influences his expression with color and texture.\n\u201cWithout physical media, all creation begins in the void,\u201d Yang noted. \u201cAll the essence is just the electrons and energy shuttling in the machine and human consciousness.\u201d Chinese culture calls this Tao, or seeking meanings in the unknown world, which is what Yang seeks to express.\nCG artist, educator and curator Xueguo Yang.\nCheck out more of Yang\u2019s work.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Omniverse, including tips, tricks and more on the Omniverse YouTube channel.

They\u2019re all typically chips, or modules with multiple chips, but under the hood the QPU is a very different beast.\nSo, What\u2019s a QPU?\nA QPU, aka a quantum processor, is the brain of quantum computers that uses the behavior of particles like electrons or photons to calculate differently than traditional processors, with the potential to make certain types of calculations faster. \nQPUs rely on behaviors like superposition, the ability of a particle to be in many states at once, described in the relatively new branch of physics called quantum mechanics.\nBy contrast, CPUs, GPUs and DPUs all apply principles of classical physics to electrical currents. That\u2019s why today\u2019s systems are called classical computers.\nQPUs could advance cryptography, quantum simulations and machine learning and solve thorny optimization problems.\n\n\n\nQPUsGPUs\n\n\n\n\nQuantum processing unitsGraphics processing units\n\n\nRelies on quantum physicsRelies on classical physics\n\n\nUses qubits that can be more than 0 and 1Uses bits that are either 0 or 1\n\n\nUses states of subatomic particlesUses electricity switched in transistors\n\n\nGreat for cryptography and simulating quantum effectsGreat for HPC, AI and classical simulations\n\n\n\n\nHow Does a Quantum Processor Work?\nCPUs and GPUs calculate in bits, on/off states of electrical current that represent zeros or ones. By contrast, QPUs get their unique powers by calculating in qubits \u2014 quantum bits that can represent many different quantum states.\nA qubit is an abstraction that computer scientists use to express data based on the quantum state of a particle in a QPU. Like the hands on a clock, qubits point to quantum states that are like points in a sphere of possibilities.\nThe power of a QPU is often described by the number of qubits it contains. Researchers are developing additional ways to test and measure the overall performance of a QPU.\nMany Ways to Make a Qubit\nCorporate and academic researchers are using a wide variety of techniques to create the qubits inside a QPU.\nThe most popular approach these days is called a superconducting qubit. It\u2019s basically made from one or more tiny metallic sandwiches called Josephson junctions, where electrons tunnel through an insulating layer between two superconducting materials.\nQubits inside IBM\u2019s Eagle superconducting QPU.\nThe current state of the art creates more than 100 of these junctions into a single QPU. Quantum computers using this approach isolate the electrons by cooling them to temperatures near absolute zero with powerful refrigerators that look like high-tech chandeliers. (See image below.)\nA Qubit of Light\nSome companies use photons rather than electrons to form qubits in their quantum processors. These QPUs don\u2019t require expensive, power-hungry refrigerators, but they need sophisticated lasers and beam splitters to manage the photons.\nA refrigeration unit for a superconducting quantum computer.\n\u00a0\nResearchers are using and inventing other ways to create and connect qubits inside QPUs. For example, some use an analog process called quantum annealing, but systems using these QPUs have limited applications.\nIt\u2019s early days for quantum computers, so it\u2019s not yet clear what sorts of qubits in what kinds of QPUs will be widely used.\nSimple Chips, Exotic Systems\nTheoretically, QPUs may require less power and generate less heat than classical processors. However, the quantum computers they plug into can be somewhat power hungry and expensive.\nThat\u2019s because quantum systems typically require specialized electronic or optical control subsystems to precisely manipulate particles. And most require vacuum enclosures, electromagnetic shielding or sophisticated refrigerators to create the right environment for the particles.\nD-Wave shows qubits and QPU in a full system.\nThat\u2019s one reason why quantum computers are expected to live mainly in supercomputing centers and large data centers.\nQPUs Do Cool Stuff\nThanks to the complex science and technology, researchers expect the QPUs inside quantum computers will deliver amazing results. They are especially excited about four promising possibilities.\nFirst, they could take computer security to a whole new level.\nQuantum processors can factor enormous numbers quickly, a core function in cryptography. That means they could break today\u2019s security protocols, but they can also create new, much more powerful ones.\nIn addition, QPUs are ideally suited to simulating the quantum mechanics of how stuff works at the atomic level. That could enable fundamental advances in chemistry and materials science, starting domino effects in everything from the design of lighter airplanes to more effective drugs.\nResearchers also hope quantum processors will solve optimization problems classical computers can\u2019t handle in fields like finance and logistics. And finally, they may even advance machine learning.\nSo, When Will QPUs Be Available?\nFor quantum researchers, QPUs can\u2019t come soon enough. But challenges span the gamut.\nOn the hardware level, QPUs are not yet powerful or dependable enough to tackle most real-world jobs. However, early QPUs \u2014 and GPUs simulating them with software like NVIDIA cuQuantum \u2014 are beginning to show results that help researchers, especially in projects exploring how to build better QPUs and develop quantum algorithms.\nResearchers are using prototype systems available through several companies like Amazon, IBM, IonQ, Rigetti, Xanadu and more. Governments around the world are beginning to see the promise of the technology, so they\u2019re making significant investments to build ever larger and more ambitious systems.\nHow Do You Program a Quantum Processor?\nSoftware for quantum computing is still in its infancy.\nMuch of it looks like the kind of assembly-language code programmers had to slog through in the early days of classical computers. That\u2019s why developers have to understand the details of the underlying quantum hardware to get their programs running.\nBut here, too, there are real signs of progress toward the holy grail \u2014 a single software environment that will work across any supercomputer, a sort of quantum OS.\nSeveral early projects are in the works. All struggle with the limitations of the current hardware; some are hampered by the limits of the companies developing the code.\nFor example, some companies have deep expertise in enterprise computing but lack experience in the kind of high-performance environments where much of the scientific and technical work in quantum computing will be done. Others lack expertise in AI, which has synergies with quantum computing.\nEnter Hybrid Quantum Systems\nThe research community widely agrees that for the foreseeable future, classical and quantum computers will work in tandem. So, software needs to run well across QPUs, CPU and GPUs, too.\nResearchers described a hybrid classical-quantum computer in a 2017 paper.\nTo drive quantum computing forward, NVIDIA recently announced the NVIDIA CUDA-Q, an open platform for programming hybrid quantum systems.\nCUDA-Q includes a high-level language that\u2019s concise and expressive so it\u2019s powerful and easy to use. With the platform, developers can write programs that run on QPUs in quantum computers and GPUs simulating QPUs in classical systems.\nNVIDIA CUDA-Q is a unified platform for programming any hybrid quantum-classical computer.\nCUDA-Q will support every kind of quantum computer and every sort of QPU.\nAt its launch, quantum system and software providers including Pasqal, Xanadu, QC Ware and Zapata expressed support for the platform. Users include major supercomputing centers in the U.S. and Europe.\nCUDA-Q builds on NVIDIA\u2019s extensive expertise in CUDA software, which accelerates HPC and AI workloads for scientific, technical and enterprise users.\nWith a beta release of CUDA-Q expected before the end of the year, the outlook for QPUs in 2023 and beyond is bright.\n\u2014Yunchao Liu, a Ph.D. candidate in quantum computing at the University of California, Berkeley, assisted in the research for this article.\n\nLearn more about quantum computing on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\n\n\nCategories: ExplainerTags: Artificial Intelligence | Cybersecurity | GPU Computing | Hardware | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | Science | Simulation and Design | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Customers can now tap into the power of the A10 GPU to accelerate a broad range of workflows and applications, including virtual desktops, computer-aided design (CAD), rendering, simulation, AI inferencing and analytics.\nThe NVads A10 v5 instances provide enterprises with a consistent cloud platform that can be scaled to meet the needs of users across multiple workloads, and professionals can take advantage of the revolutionary graphics capabilities of NVIDIA RTX.\nGPU Virtualization Brings Flexibility, Lower Starting Cost\nPreviously, deploying virtual desktops or workstations in the cloud was expensive, because GPU acceleration required users to access an entire GPU \u2014 it was impossible to divide that GPU resource and share it across multiple users. But using GPU-partitioning (GPU-P), the right-sized virtual machine can now be provisioned based on the user\u2019s workload.\nWith the introduction of the NVads A10 v5 instances, Microsoft Azure becomes the first tier 1 cloud provider to support GPU virtualization on NVIDIA GPUs with Microsoft Azure GPU-P capabilities.\nThe NVIDIA A10 GPU, which has 24GB of memory, can be flexibly partitioned and allocated to accelerate graphics or compute workloads. With GPU partitioning, customers can choose the most cost-effective, right-sized instances to run their varied workloads, starting at a 4Q profile size \u2014 or one-sixth of a whole GPU \u2014 and going all the way up to two full A10 GPUs for a total of 48GB for larger, more complex workloads.\nA10 Brings Powerful Virtual Performance\nBased on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, the A10 GPU features second-generation RT Cores, bringing up to 2.5x the graphics performance versus the previous generation, T4. The A10 also enables unprecedented photorealism, 3D designs and visual effects, supported by the latest enhancements in AI, ray tracing and simulation.\nSupport for NVIDIA RTX technology also means that the NVads A10 v5 instances have the broadest ecosystem of supported rendering engines, giving users a more seamless experience with accurate shadow detail and lighting, reduced noise and enhanced photorealistic accuracy.\nEquipped with third-generation NVIDIA Tensor Cores, the A10 provides up to 2.5x the performance for inference versus the T4, and brings AI to graphics workloads with capabilities like Deep Learning Super Sampling, AI denoising, and enhanced editing for select applications.\nPowerful Performance for Tackling Any Workflow\nBuilt on top of NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation technology, the NVads A10 v5 instances can support powerful virtual workstations. Small- to medium-sized CAD models, game development and geospatial information systems can be cost-effectively deployed in the cloud on fractional GPUs.\nGPU resources can be scaled up to a whole A10 GPU or across multiple ones for more demanding workloads such as intelligent video analytics, AI inferencing, complex CAD modeling, simulation, seismic exploration, visual effects and rendering.\nThis also expands cloud instances to support new workloads, such as augmented and virtual reality, with NVIDIA CloudXR technology.\nNVIDIA and Microsoft have worked with independent software vendors to test and validate the CAD and CAE applications that customers wish to deploy in the cloud. Through the testing and validation program, customers get:\n\nInsights on the best configuration for running their workloads on Azure\nInsights on expected performance of their applications\nGuidance on application setup, as well as insights on the expected costs based on application usage\nAccess to a curated recipe guide for setting up the CAD or CAE application on Azure\n\nBuild and Scale End-to-End AI Solutions\nWhen it comes to compute workloads, the NVIDIA A10-based instances provide the power developers need to build AI solutions and deploy them at scale \u2014 without a single code change \u2014 as they can develop and deploy on the same platform.\nAdditionally, data scientists and developers can more quickly create business value from AI using NVIDIA\u2019s open-source frameworks, toolkits and pretrained models available on NGC.\nOrganizations are looking to provision accelerated computing resources faster, so employees can work with larger models, have more visually rich online experiences, access the tools they need from anywhere, and accelerate productivity. With the flexibility and power of Azure NVads A10 v5 instances, companies have a more affordable way to help them stay on the leading edge of innovation.\nThe new NVads A10 v5 instances are now available on Azure.

With DLSS available for every major game engine, adoption has accelerated rapidly, and we have even more DLSS games to announce today.\nThis July, NVIDIA DLSS comes to Loopmancer and Hell Pie. During today\u2019s Nacon Connect streaming event it was announced that The Lord of the Rings: Gollum\u2122 and Stellrising will be launching this September with both NVIDIA DLSS and ray tracing. And, we can confirm that NVIDIA DLSS will be available at launch in both Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, and A Plague Tale: Requiem.\nMachine learning is one of the hottest trends in the tech world and an undeniable advantage for DLSS. NVIDIA DLSS is the only AI-powered super resolution tech, and that advantage translates to game performance boosts of up to 2X. Being the only available super resolution technology that can tap into the power of a deep learning neural network, NVIDIA DLSS also maintains uncompromised image quality.\nAI technologies and ray tracing are revolutionizing the way we play and create, and at the forefront of this game-changing movement is NVIDIA RTX, the fastest and most advanced platform for bleeding-edge applications and games. Read on to learn about the latest implementations of NVIDIA DLSS, and the latest games to leverage GeForce RTX RT Cores that accelerate ray tracing workloads to otherwise unobtainable frame rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: Gollum Launches September With NVIDIA DLSS & Ray Tracing\nBased on the books by J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum\u2122 is a story-driven stealth adventure game from Daedalic Entertainment, creators of Deponia and many other highly regarded games. Take on a perilous journey as the deformed and twisted Gollum, chasing the only thing that\u2019s precious to him: the One Ring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen The Lord of the Rings: Gollum\u2122 launches this September, GeForce RTX gamers can explore the game\u2019s varied locations with immersive ray-traced reflections and shadows, accelerated by NVIDIA DLSS. \u00a0\nTo learn more about The Lord of the Rings: Gollum\u2122, and to wishlist it, head to Steam.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteelrising Available September 8 With NVIDIA DLSS & Ray Tracing\nSpiders, developer of Greedfall, is launching a new action-RPG this September. Called Steelrising, it\u2019s set in an alt-history Paris in 1789. Louis XVI has crushed The French Revolution using a merciless mechanical army, but the revolution\u2019s not over just yet, as it rekindles with you, Aegis, a nimble automaton. Discover the city's secrets, shape your playstyle with unique abilities, and cross paths with Marie-Antoinette, Lafayette, and Robespierre, who may help or hinder your quest to reclaim Paris and right history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt launch, Steelrising will boast immersive ray-traced reflections, and its performance will be accelerated by the one and only NVIDIA DLSS.

The problem: those on the other end of the call hear it all, too, from your roommate\u2019s vacuum cleaner to background conversations at the cafe you\u2019re working from.\nNow, work by a trio of graduate students at the University of Washington who spent the pandemic cooped up together in a noisy apartment, lets those on the other end of the call hear just you \u2014 rather than all the stuff going on around you.\nUsers found that the system, dubbed \u201cClearBuds\u201d \u2014 presented last month at the ACM International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services \u2014 improved background noise suppression much better than a commercially available alternative.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re removing your audio background the same way you can remove your visual background on a video call,\u201d explained Vivek Jayaram, a doctoral student in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering.\nOutlined in a paper co-authored by the three roommates, all computer science and engineering graduate students at the University of Washington \u2014 Maruchi Kim, Ishan Chatterjee, and Jayaram \u2014 ClearBuds are different from other wireless earbuds in two big ways.\nThe ClearBuds hardware (round disk) in front of the 3D printed earbud enclosures. Credit: Raymond Smith, University of Washington\nFirst, ClearBuds use two microphones per earbud.\nWhile most earbuds use two microphones on the same earbud, ClearBuds uses a microphone from both earbuds and creates two audio streams.\nThis creates higher spatial resolution for the system to better separate sounds coming from different directions, Kim explained. In other words, it makes it easier for the system to pick out the earbud wearer\u2019s voice.\nSecond, the team created a neural network algorithm that can run on a mobile phone to process the audio streams to identify which sounds should be enhanced and which should be suppressed.\nThe researchers relied on two separate neural networks to do this.\nThe first neural network suppresses everything that isn\u2019t a human voice.\nThe second enhances the speaker\u2019s voice. The speaker can be identified because it\u2019s coming from microphones in both earbuds at the same time.\nTogether, they effectively mask background noise and ensure the earbud wearer is heard loud and clear.\nClearBuds isolate a user\u2019s voice from background noise by performing voice separation using a pair of wireless, synchronized earbuds. Source: Maruchi Kim, University of Washington\nWhile the software the researchers created was lightweight enough to run on a mobile device, they relied on an NVIDIA TITAN desktop GPU to train the neural networks. They used both synthetic audio samples and real audio. Training took less than a day.\nAnd the results, users reported, were dramatically better than commercially available earbuds, results that are winning recognition industrywide.\nThe team took second place for best paper at last month\u2019s ACM MobSys 2022 conference. In addition to Kim, Chatterjee and Jayarm, the paper\u2019s co-authors included Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, an associate professor at the Allen School; Shwetak Patel, a professor in both the Allen School and the electrical and computer engineering department; and Shyam Gollakota and Steven Seitz, both professors in the Allen School.\nRead the full paper here: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3498361.3538933\nTo be sure, the system outlined in the paper can\u2019t be adopted instantly. While many earbuds have two microphones per earbud, they only stream audio from one earbud. Industry standards are just catching up to the idea of processing multiple audio streams from earbuds.\nNevertheless, the researchers are hopeful their work, which is open source, will inspire others to couple neural networks and microphones to provide better quality audio calls.\nThe ideas could also be useful for isolating and enhancing conversations taking place over smart speakers by harnessing them for ad hoc microphone arrays, Kim said, and even tracking robot locations or search and rescue missions.\nSounds good to us.\nFeatured image credit: \u00a0Raymond Smith, University of Washington\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Mobile \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Using NVIDIA CloudXR, Varjo XR-3 headsets and Lenovo Android tablets, audiences saw the virtual Porsche with photorealistic lighting and shadows.\nAll images courtesy of Autodesk.\nAudiences could view the virtual race car side by side with a physical car on site. With this direct comparison, they witnessed the photorealistic nature of the AR model \u2014 from the color of the metals, to the surface of the tires, to the environmental lighting.\nThe stunning demo, which was shown through an Autodesk VRED collaborative session, ran on NVIDIA RTX-based virtual workstations.\nThere were two ways to view the demo. First, NVIDIA CloudXR streamed the experience to the tablets from a virtualized NVIDIA Project Aurora server, which was powered by NVIDIA A40 GPUs on a Lenovo ThinkStation SR670 Server. Attendees could also use Varjo headsets, which were locally tethered to NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs running on a Lenovo ThinkStation P620 workstation.\n\nPowerful XR Technologies Behind the Streams\nUp to five users at a time entered the scene, with two users wearing headsets to see the Porsche car in mixed reality, and three users on tablets to view the car in AR. Users were represented as avatars in the session.\nWith NVIDIA CloudXR, the forum attendees remotely streamed the photorealistic Porsche model. Built on NVIDIA RTX technology, CloudXR extends NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation software, which enables users to stream fully accelerated immersive graphics from a virtualized environment.\n\nThis demo used a virtualized Lenovo ThinkStation SR670 server to power NVIDIA\u2019s Project Aurora \u2014 a software and hardware platform for XR streaming at the edge. Project Aurora delivers the horsepower of NVIDIA RTX A40 GPUs, so users could experience the rich, real-time graphics of the Porsche model from a machine room over a private 5G network.\nThrough server-based streaming with Project Aurora, multiple users from different locations were brought together to experience the demo in a single immersive environment. With the help of U.K.-based integrator The Grid Factory, Project Aurora is now available to be deployed in any enterprise.\nLearn more about advanced XR streaming with NVIDIA CloudXR.\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: CloudXR | NVIDIA RTX | Transportation | Virtual Reality \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

NVIDIA in May announced they are transitioning to an open-source kernel driver approach, but that current kernel driver is not in shape for upstreaming and due to the heavy use of the GPU System Processor (GSP) that source release hasn't been a huge help yet for the reverse-engineered Nouveau driver. With the upcoming Linux 5.20, Nouveau has some display patches.\r Earlier this month were a few Nouveau patches queued into DRM-Next for Linux 5.20 and yesterday DRM maintainer David Airlie queued up some display code patches for this driver. This is some refactoring to the Nouveau DRM driver's display code for cleaning up of some functions, some common class handling around NV50 hardware, and just other low-level code improvements for the display functions. As usual, these Nouveau DRM changes were worked on by Red Hat's Ben Skeggs as the Nouveau DRM maintainer, tested by Red Hat's Lyude Paul, and merged by Red Hat's David Airlie as the primary DRM subsystem maintainer.\r This new pull isn't really notable for end-users. Sadly no major progress to report on bettering the Nouveau driver support for recent generations of NVIDIA hardware. The best open-source support now remains with the GeForce GTX 600/700 series due to no firmware restrictions and able to (manually) re-clock the hardware to its optimal clock frequencies. Past the GTX 700 series there are signed firmware images to deal with and not yet any proper support for putting the hardware to its optimal/peak clock frequencies and thus very slow performance.\rPast the GTX 750 \"Maxwell1\", the signed firmware mess continues to restrict the Nouveau driver from currently achieving decent performance due to the power management firmware and current inability to run the hardware at its rated clock speeds. So until major changes from NVIDIA either to an upstream-compatible kernel driver or significant help for Nouveau, the upstream open-source NVIDIA kernel driver remains in a rather sad, stagnate shape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24 Comments \n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\nRelated News\nNouveau On NVIDIA Turing GPUs & Newer Will Now Prefer NVK+Zink For OpenGLKarol Herbst Steps Down As Nouveau Maintainer Due To Linux Kernel's Toxic Environment\"NOVA-Core\" Patches Propose Building New NVIDIA Driver Piece-By-Piece In The Linux KernelMesa NVK Vulkan Driver Adds VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate SupportNouveau With NVK Vulkan Driver Running More Games, Increasing Feature SetMore NVK Driver Improvements Merged For Mesa 24.3\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Startup Ups Game for Cricket, Football and More With Vision AI\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSingapore\u2019s TVConal uses NVIDIA Metropolis, TAO toolkit and SDKs to build an AI-enabled video analytics platform that automatically flags the ins and outs of sports matches.\t\t\t\n\n\nJuly 27, 2022 by Angie Lee \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Sports produce a slew of data. In a game of cricket, for example, each play generates millions of video-frame data points for a sports analyst to scrutinize, according to Masoumeh Izadi, managing director of deep-tech startup TVConal.\nThe Singapore-based company uses NVIDIA AI and computer vision to power its sports video analytics platform, which enables users \u2014 including sports teams, leagues and TV broadcasters \u2014 to gain performance insights from these massive amounts of data in real time.\nShort for Television Content Analytics, TVConal provides video analytics for a variety of sports, with a focus on cricket, tennis, badminton and football.\nIts platform \u2014 powered by the NVIDIA Metropolis application framework for vision AI \u2014 can detect important in-game events, model athlete behavior, make movement predictions and more. It all helps dissect the minute details in sports, enabling teams to make smarter decisions on the field.\nTVConal is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a free program that supports startups revolutionizing industries with cutting-edge technology.\nAutomated Match Tagging\nMatch tagging \u2014 creating a timeline of significant in-game events \u2014 is crucial to sports video analytics. Tags are used to generate detailed reports that provide performance statistics and visual feedback for referees, coaches, athletes and fans.\nSince plays and other in-game events occur in mere instants, up to 20 loggers work together to accomplish live tagging for some sports matches, according to Izadi. This can be time consuming and labor intensive.\nWith TVConal\u2019s platform, sports analysts can extract insights from video frames with just a few clicks \u2014 as AI helps to automatically and accurately tag matches in real time. This gives analysts time to dig deeper into the data and provide more detailed feedback for teams.\nThe platform can also catch critical moments or foul plays that the naked eye might miss.\n\u201cIf a player does an illegal action that\u2019s beyond a human\u2019s ability to process in a few milliseconds, the platform can detect that and inform the umpires to take an action just in time,\u201d Izadi said.\nTVConal\u2019s platform is built using NVIDIA Metropolis, which simplifies the development, deployment and scale of AI-enabled video analytics applications from edge to cloud. Metropolis includes pretrained models, training and optimization tools, software development kits, CUDA-X libraries and more \u2014 all optimized to run on NVIDIA-Certified Systems based on the NVIDIA EGX enterprise platform for accelerated computing.\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s software tools, frameworks and hardware allow us to iterate faster and bring ideas to market with shortened life cycles and reduced costs,\u201d Izadi said.\nNVIDIA-accelerated compute resources used in TVConal\u2019s platform include the NVIDIA Jetson platform for AI at the edge, RTX 3090 workstations on premises, and V100 and A100 Tensor Core GPUs in the cloud.\nTVConal uses the NVIDIA DeepStream SDK to simplify video processing pipelines; NVIDIA pretrained models and the TAO toolkit to accelerate AI training; and the NVIDIA TensorRT SDK to optimize inference.\nDeepStream enabled the TVConal team to process live video and audio streams in real time \u2014 the necessary speed to match video frame rates. In addition, the TensorRT library helped TVConal convert its machine learning models to more quickly process data, while maintaining accuracy.\nAnd as a member of NVIDIA Inception, TVConal has access to technical resources, industry experts and go-to-market support.\nThe company\u2019s clients include international production company NEP Group, the Pakistan Cricket Board and others.\n\u201cThere is an increasing volume of sports content to extract value from,\u201d said Izadi, highlighting that the global sports analytics market size is expected to grow over 20% by 2028. \u201cAutomated video processing is revolutionary in sports, and we are excited to build more advanced models and pipelines to keep the revolution going.\u201d\nAdditional innovative players worldwide are using NVIDIA Metropolis for sports analytics, including startups Pixellot, Track160 and Veo.\nWatch an on-demand NVIDIA GTC session about how AI is revolutionizing the sports industry \u2014 better predicting competition outcomes, improving performance and increasing viewers\u2019 quality expectations.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Metropolis and apply to join NVIDIA Inception.\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | CUDA | Customer Stories | Data Science | DeepStream | Inception | Metropolis | NVIDIA EGX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(Image Credits:Moore's Law is Dead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card reportedly offers nearly twice the performance of the RTX 3090 in the 3DMark Time Spy Extreme benchmark.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Almost Twice As Fast As RTX 3090 in 3DMark Time Spy Extreme Benchmark, Reportedly Hits 3 GHz Clocks With Ease\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card is going to be the green team's flagship offering for 2022. There have been various leaks and rumors around the card throughout the year but from what we can tell, the launch is more or less expected around Q4 2022. With 3-4 months left in its launch, now the rumors are shifting the focus from specifications to performance numbers.\nRelated Story NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\nRTX 4090, TSE >19000\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) July 18, 2022\n\n\nyes\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) July 18, 2022\n\nKopite7kimi was the first to report that the NVIDIA AD102 GPUs would be the first graphics chips to hit 100 TFLOPs of compute horsepower. Now the same leaker has shared the performance data in 3DMark Time Spy Extreme. According to the leaker, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 will deliver a total graphics score of over 19,000 points in the Time Spy Extreme benchmark.\n\n\n3DMark Time Spy Extreme Graphics\n\nScore\n\n\n04000800012000160002000024000\n\n\n\n\n\n04000800012000160002000024000\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090\n\n19k\n\n\nRTX 3090 Ti\n\n11.3k\n\n\nRX 6950 XT\n\n10.7k\n\n\nRTX 3090\n\n10.1k\n\n\nRTX 3080\n\n8.9k\n\n\nRTX Titan\n\n7.1k\n\n\nRTX 2080Ti\n\n6.6k\n\n\nRTX 2080\n\n5.1k\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we compare it to existing cards, this score would put the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 at least 90% faster than the RTX 3090 and 70% faster than the RTX 3090 Ti. This is indeed a massive jump but we have to remember that we are talking about a purely synthetic workload here. Gaming on the graphics card might be a whole different story and we don't know whether this score is based on final clocks/optimizations or not. The leaker also states that for NVIDIA, it will be very easy to hit a clock speed of over 3 GHz which aligns with previous reports of TSMC's 4N process node giving a huge boost to clock frequencies on Ada Lovelace GPUs.\n\nSo does NVIDIA, also easy.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) July 18, 2022\n\n\n19000 is a conservative score, so I wrote \">19000\". \ud83d\udcaa\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) July 18, 2022\n\n\u00a0\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 'Rumored' Specifications\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX RTX 4090 graphics card is expected to be powered by the top AD102-300 GPU but it is only the 'Ti' variant that will feature the full chip. The GeForce RTX 4090 will utilize a slightly cut-down configuration.\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 will use 128 SMs of the 144 SMs for a total of 16,384 CUDA cores. The GPU will come packed with 96 MB of L2 cache and a total of 384 ROPs which is simply insane. The clock speeds are not confirmed yet but considering that the TSMC 4N process is being used, we are expecting clocks to hit or even exceed the 3.0 GHz range. The core count is a 56% increase over the RTX 3090 so a lot of things such as clocks, cache, architecture and various other technologies are pushing the performance up by such a huge margin.\nAs for memory specs, the GeForce RTX 4090 is expected to rock 24 GB GDDR6X capacities that will be clocked at 21 Gbps speeds across a 384-bit bus interface. This will provide up to 1 TB/s of bandwidth. This is the same bandwidth as the existing RTX 3090 Ti graphics card and as far as the power consumption is concerned, the TBP is said to be rated at 450W which means that TGP may end up lower than that. The card will be powered by a single 16-pin connector which delivers up to 600W of power. It is likely that we may get 500W+ custom designs as we saw with the RTX 3090 Ti.\nThe graphics card is expected to launch in October 2022 and will be followed by the rest of the Ada Lovelace GPU-powered lineup of graphics cards.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti & RTX 4090 'Preliminary' Specs:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAda Lovelace AD102-350?Ada Lovelace AD102-300?Ampere GA102-350Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess NodeTSMC 4NTSMC 4NSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie Size~600mm2~600mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBDTBD28 Billion28 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores18432161281075210496\n\n\nTMUs / ROPsTBD / 384TBD / 384336 / 112328 / 112\n\n\nTensor / RT CoresTBD / TBDTBD / TBD336 / 84328 / 82\n\n\nBase ClockTBDTBD1560 MHz1400 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock~2800 MHz~2600 MHz1860 MHz1700 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute~103 TFLOPs~90 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPsTBDTBD74 TFLOPs69 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPsTBDTBD320 TOPs285 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity24 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus384-bit384-bit384-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed24.0 Gbps21.0 Gbps21.0 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth1152 GB/s1008 GB/s1008 GB/s936 Gbps\n\n\nTGP600W450W450W350W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$1999 US?$1499 US?$1999 US$1499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)2023?October 2022?29th March 202224th September 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Rolls Out GeForce Driver 572.60 To Fix Black Screen Issues Related To RTX 50 Series GPUs\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n67\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n49\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n43\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nTesla Records Its Best Sales Week Of The Year So Far In China As Bulls Flock To Poke Holes In Mark Rober\u2019s FSD-Denigrating Video\n\n\n\n28\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Similar AI enhancements have also been added to Elgato\u2019s audio and video software, Wave Link and Camera Hub.\nPowerful Broadcast AI audio and video effects transform content creation stations into home studios.\nCreators and gamers with GeForce RTX GPUs can benefit from NVIDIA Broadcast\u2019s\u00a0AI enhancements\u00a0to CORSAIR and Elgato microphones and cameras, elevating their live streams, voice chats and video conference calls.\nPlus, entertainer Jakeem Johnson, better known by his Twitch name BigCheeseKIT, demonstrates how a GeForce RTX 3080 GPU elevates his thrilling streams with AI-powered benefits.\nAdvanced AI Audio\nThe NVIDIA Broadcast integration enables AI-powered noise removal and room echo removal audio features in CORSAIR iCUE and Elgato Wave Link that unlocks new levels of clarity and sharpness for an exceptional audio experience.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/studio-itns-wk14-broadcast-noise-removal.mp4\n\u00a0\nNoise removal in Elgato Wave Link is built as a virtual studio technology (VST), enabling users to apply the effect per audio channel, and supported in compatible creative apps such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Audition and Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve.\nRunning on Tensor Cores on GeForce RTX GPUs, the new features use AI to identify users\u2019 voices, separating them from other ambient sounds. This results in noise cancellation that dramatically improves audio and video call quality. Background noises from fans, chatter, pets and more disappear, leaving the speaker\u2019s voice crystal clear.\nBroadcast also cancels room echoes, providing dampened, studio-quality acoustics in a wide range of environments without the need to sound-proof walls or ceilings.\nCORSAIR\u2019s integration takes a new version of these effects that can separate body sounds. This upgrade adds support to popular capabilities, like muting the friend who forgets to turn on the push-to-talk feature on a video call while they chew their lunch.\nAI audio effects are ready to be integrated into nearly the entire lineup of CORSAIR headsets.\nThese Broadcast features are available on nearly the entire lineup of CORSAIR headsets. Users seeking a premium audio experience should consider headsets like the VOID RGB ELITE WIRELESS with 7.1 surround sound, HS80 RGB WIRELESS with spatial audio or the VIRTUOSO RGB WIRELESS SE.\nThe Elgato Wave XLR unlocks AI audio effects.\nFor Elgato creators, noise removal can now be enabled in the Wave Link app. This makes AI-enhanced audio possible for Wave mic users, plus XLR microphones thanks to the Elgato Wave XLR.\nUnrestr(AI)ned Video Effects\nNVIDIA Broadcast\u2019s video technologies integrated into the Elgato Camera Hub include the virtual background feature.\nThe \u2018background replacement\u2019 AI video feature.\nAI-enhanced filters powered by GeForce RTX GPUs offer better edge detection to produce a high-quality visual \u2014 much like those produced by a DSLR camera \u2014 using just a webcam. Supported effects include blur and replacing the background with a video or still image; eliminating the need for a greenscreen.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/studio-itns-wk14-camera-hub-backgrounds.mp4\n\u00a0\nBackground blur and background replacement are now available in Elgato Camera Hub. Creators can apply AI video effects with Facecam, or their studio camera using Cam Link 4K.\nSet Up for Streaming Success\nAccessing these NVIDIA Broadcast technologies is fast and simple.\nIf an eligible CORSAIR headset or the ST100 headset stand is recognized by iCUE, it will automatically prompt installation of the NVIDIA Broadcast Audio Effects.\nElgato Camera Hub now features a new Effects tab. Once selected, users will be prompted to download and install Broadcast Video Effects. For Elgato Wave Link, creators will first need to install the Broadcast Audio Effects, followed by the new noise removal VST.\nAfter installation, Broadcast options will appear within iCUE, Wave Link and Camera Hub.\nCheck out the installation instructions and FAQ.\nBroadcast features require GeForce RTX GPUs that can be found in the latest NVIDIA Studio laptops and desktops. These purpose-built systems feature vivid color displays, along with blazing-fast memory and storage to boost streams and all creative work.\n\nPick up an NVIDIA Studio system today to turn streams into dreams.\nStream Like a Boss In the NVIDIA Studio\nIf there\u2019s one thing BigCheeseKIT encapsulates, it\u2019s energy.\n\nBigCheeseKIT enjoyed early success as a Golden Joystick award nominee, serving as an ambassador for Twitch and Norton Gaming. He said that the highlight of his career, undoubtedly, was joining T-Pain\u2019s exclusive gaming label, Nappy Boy Gaming.\nA natural entertainer, BigCheeseKIT\u2019s presence, gaming knowledge and authenticity dazzle his 60,000+ subscribers. Powered by his GeForce RTX 3080 GPU and live-streaming optimizations from NVIDIA Studio \u2014 such as better performance in OBS Studio, BigCheeseKIT has the resources and know-how to host professional streams.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having my own television channel, and I\u2019m the host or entertainer,\u201d said the artist.\n\nBigCheeseKIT streams exclusively with OBS Studio, benefitting massively from the dedicated GPU-based NVIDIA Studio encoder (NVENC), which enables seamless streaming with maximum performance.\n\u201cUsing NVENC with my live streams makes my quality 20x better,\u201d said BigCheeseKIT. \u201cI can definitely see the difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuality and consistency,\u201d BigCheeseKIT noted.\u00a0\u201cNVIDIA hasn\u2019t failed me.\u201d\n\nOBS Studio\u2019s advanced GPU-accelerated encoding also unlocks higher video quality for streaming and recorded videos. Once he started using it, BigCheeseKIT\u2019s system immediately became built to broadcast.\nFor on-demand videos, BigCheeseKIT prefers to edit using VEGAS Pro. MAGIX\u2019s professional video editing software takes advantage of GPU-accelerated video effects while using NVENC for faster encoding. Overall, the artist said that his creative workflow \u2014 charged by his GPU \u2014 became faster and easier, saving valuable time.\nFor aspiring streamers, BigCheeseKIT offered these words of wisdom: \u201cStream like everyone is watching. Be yourself, have fun and don\u2019t let negativity get to you.\u201d\nNappy Boy Gaming\u2019s newest member: BigCheeseKIT.\nHead over to BigCheeseKIT\u2019s Twitch channel to subscribe, learn more and check out his videos.\nNVIDIA Broadcast and the SDKs behind it \u2014 which enable third-party integrations like the ones described above \u2014 are part of the NVIDIA Studio tools that include AI-powered software and NVIDA Studio Drivers.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

It involves a wide range of scientific disciplines, including biology, chemistry, and pharmacology, as well as computer science. AstraZeneca and NVIDIA collaborated on developing MegaMolBART so\u00a0the computational drug discovery process happens in real-time and is interactive. The application searches, screens, and organizes large-scale drug-like compound databases.\nThrough an intuitive web-based UI, chemists\u00a0can explore analogues among compounds while data scientists can perform routine cheminformatics tasks like clustering and dimensionality reduction against the RAPIDS\u00a0libraries, accelerated by GPUs.\nTransformers have shown the ability to embed the dense and continuous representation of chemical space, which adheres to the rules of chemistry and captures the underlying distribution of molecules in the database. This confers the correct inductive bias needed for one-shot learning and other problems where data is limited, or labels are not available.\nFor this solution we chose Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) for orchestration, since it makes it easy for customers to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications.\nSolution\nIn this blog we will focus on the new NVIDIA MegaMolBART solution. The solution will allow customers to explore MegaMolBART, a transformer model of the latent space of small molecules obtained through self-supervised learning of compounds represented by SMILES\u00a0.\nDownstream applications of these models include property prediction and novel drug-like compound generation.\u00a0For more information about this project, see the\u00a0GitHub repository\u00a0and the\u00a0NGC page.\nThe AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages.\u00a0For this solution we chose AWS CDK\u2019s Python bindings for its simplicity.\nArchitecture\nArchitecture of the MegaMolBART solution is illustrated in the below figure.\n\nWe start with creating the base infrastructure for this solution, which includes the virtual private cloud (VPC) that spans across multiple Availability Zones with public and private subnets. Next, we create an Amazon ECS cluster with Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights\u00a0enabled. We also add an AWS Cloud Map namespace for service discovery and an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) for data persistence.\nWe implemented scaling at both the cluster instance level and the task level to cope with spiky loads.\nDeploy NVIDIA\u00a0MegaMolBART\nWe used AWS CDK\u00a0Python library to create the resources described in the previous section. AWS CDK uses\u00a0AWS CloudFormation\u00a0under the hood\u00a0to declaratively create resources in your AWS account. You can find the AWS CDK code and configuration templates for this project\u00a0here.\nClone the project\u2019s GitHub repository and deploy the stack.\n\ngit clone git@github.com:aws-quickstart/quickstart-nvidia-cheminformatics.git\ncd quickstart-nvidia-cheminformatics\n\n\nWe suggest using virtual environments with Python. You can create one by running:\n\npython3 -m venv .venv\n\nAfter the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following step to activate your virtualenv:\n\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n\nIf you are using a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:\n\n.venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n\nOnce the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies:\n\npip install -r requirements.tx\n\nAt this point you can now synthesize the AWS CloudFormation template for this code.\n\ncdk synth\n\nTo deploy, run:\n\ncdk deploy\n\nThe deployment process takes around 20 \u2013 25 minutes. Most of this time is spent downloading the ChEMBL database.\nAt the end of the deployment, you will see the URL for the CuChem service:\n\nGoing to that URL from your browser should take you to the application\u2019s user interface, which would look like the following image.\n\nFor a more detailed instructions on how to use the service, check out the awesome\u00a0tutorial\u00a0by NVIDIA.\nMonitoring\nThe solution uses Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights to collect, aggregate, and summarize metrics and logs.\u00a0Amazon CloudWatch automatically collects metrics for containers, such as CPU, memory, disk, and network. It also provides diagnostic information, such as container restart failures, to help you isolate issues and resolve them quickly.\n\nYou can also set Amazon CloudWatch alarms on metrics that Container Insights collects. You can find Amazon ECS monitoring best practices here.\nAWS Cloud Map for Service Discovery\nOur solution includes two Amazon ECS services. The CuChem service provides the front-end for users and\u00a0MegaMolBART service acts as the back-end worker service for generating novel molecules.\nCuChem containers discover the address of the\u00a0MegaMolBART containers using AWS Cloud Map service discovery. When the back-end workers scale, CuChem containers will automatically discover new\u00a0MegaMolBART containers.\nTask Placement on GPUs\nBoth containers that are used in this solution strictly require NVIDIA Tesla cards, which makes\u00a0p3 instances a great choice. In this post, the cluster only has p3.2xlarge container instances. In case your cluster has other instance types, you can use Amazon ECS task placement constraints to ensure Amazon ECS schedules your tasks on specific Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance families.\nHere\u2019s a snippet of achieving that with AWS CDK at the task level:\n\n            placement_constraints=[\n                ecs.PlacementConstraint.member_of(\n                    \"attribute:ecs.instance-type =~ p3.*\"\n                )\n            ]\n\n\nBy adding this task placement constraint, we make sure Amazon ECS schedules the task on p3 type instances.\nBootstrapping Chembl Database\nCuChem container needs the Chembl Database to operate.\u00a0Whenever Amazon ECS creates a new task, it will first run the init_container\u00a0container before executing other containers in the task. The init container downloads the database for CuChem and persists it on the attached Amazon EFS file system. As Amazon EFS is a shared file system, once the model data has been downloaded, subsequent spawns of this init container will skip downloading data.\nThe solution uses Amazon ECS ContainerDependency to define the order in which Amazon ECS should start the containers in the task.\nHow to Load Test\nBoth services, CuChem and MegaMolBART, are configured to scale automatically using Amazon ECS service auto scaling. Amazon ECS will add tasks when the aggregate CPU usage within a service exceeds 30%. We found 30% works best when it comes to reacting to spikes.\nFor cluster capacity autoscaling we setup step scaling since it is the recommended approach by the Amazon ECS best practices guide.\u00a0We set the steps as the following: Below 15% CPU utilization 1 instance will be removed; above 30% CPU utilization 1 instance will be added; above 50% CPU utilization 1 instance will be added.\nThe following figure shows the relationship between the number of tasks and the number of container instances against a spiking CPU.\u00a0We spin up more tasks and more instances to bear the traffic, and as the traffic scales down we scale down with it.\n\nIn order to load test our service we can use a tool such as\u00a0JMeter. In our testing we found that one p3.2xlarge instance can support up to 20 simultaneous molecule generation requests.\u00a0In order to handle more users, we need to add more instances using cluster autoscaling.\nWe created three use cases with JMeter: the first use case is simply rendering the home page; the second use case is selecting a subset of molecules; the third use case is running MegaMolBART to create novel molecules. As expected under heavy load, MegaMolBART service fails the most since it is the most intense process this application provides.\nUnder heavy load, we observed 5% of the\u00a0MegaMolBART requests fail. Rendering the home page and selecting a subset of molecules seem to have good performance and can take heavier loads. Optimizations such as reducing the container image size and leveraging the GPU with the algorithm itself could make MegaMolBART more scalable.\nCost Analysis\nAWS CDK templates included with this solution tag the resources it creates. You can use AWS Cost Explorer to monitor the usage.\nThe screenshot below shows a breakdown of costs. As expected, most of the charges are for the GPU instance (p3.2xlarge).\n\nRunning this solution with 1 instance costs approximately $75 a day in us-west-2.\n\nConclusion\nThis post described how to use NVIDIA MegaMolBART and CuChem on Amazon ECS containers to generate novel molecules for drug discovery. Amazon ECS and AWS CDK simplify the creation of the underlying infrastructure to execute containerized workloads at scale and enable repeatable deployments. AWS CDK supports multiple programming languages such as TypeScript, JavaScript, C#, Java, and Python, which many fellow scientists are already familiar with. We chose Python as the preferred language because of its popularity in data science. Combining the power and simplicity of Amazon ECS with containerized workloads, we aim to help AWS customers speed up research and lower the barriers to entry for development efforts for drug discovery.

That\u2019s 47 percent above the average asking price for research-and-development space in Santa Clara, according to data from Colliers, which reported the lease.It\u2019s unclear when the lease will start or when Nvidia will move in.Sign Up for the undefined NewsletterSIGN UPThe Cupertino-based Sobrato Organization, which owns Mission Technology Park, renovated the campus and its four buildings between 2016 and 2020, adding new facades, lobbies with canopies, amenity areas, solar panels and landscaping.Despite that work, Sobrato didn\u2019t sign any tenants for the properties until this year, according to the source close to the Nvidia deal. Three of the center\u2019s four buildings \u2014 2431, 2441 and 2451 Mission College Boulevard \u2014 stand vacant.The Nvidia headquarters is on San Tomas Expressway, 2 miles south of its newly leased building. The headquarters consists of 1.76 million square feet of office and research space, either owned or leased, according to the company\u2019s annual report last spring. In February, the company completed a new 750,000-square-foot structure there dubbed Voyager.Nvidia, founded in 1993, also leases multiple data centers in Santa Clara, including buildings next to its campus headquarters.\u2013 Dana Bartholomew\nRead more\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCommercial\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSan Francisco\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nPrologis buys 112-acre theme park in Santa Clara\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPolitics\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSan Francisco\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nSan Jose, Santa Clara to end housing cap, allowing 32K homes in North San Jose\n\n\n\nTagsCommercial Real EstateIndustrial MarketSanta ClaraRecommendedAll MarketsAll MarketsChicagoLos AngelesNationalNew YorkSan FranciscoSouth FloridaTexasRecommended For YouAbout usContact usPrivacy policyTerms and ConditionsSubscribeCorporate SubscriptionsAdvertiseHelp centerCareersShopAll rights reserved \u00a9 2025 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.450 West 31st Street, New York, NY 10001 Phone: 212-260-1332"

Tan Boon Hun   8 July 2022 15 min read            Where Can I Spend My NS55 Credit Vouchers in Singapore?     NS55 Hometeamns background   Source: HomeTeamNS.sg Who Is Eligible for the NS55 Voucher? Serving National Service (NS) is often one of the most momentous events in a Singaporean male\u2019s life, and perhaps one of the most unique features of Singapore. After all, one cannot underscore the importance of NS more, for it is our only line of defence against any potential external threats that Singapore might face.  As such, as MINDEF marks 55 years of National Service, it is indeed an occasion worth celebrating. First announced in March, the NS Recognition Package is to be disbursed by MINDEF for NSMens\u2019 and NSFs\u2019 contributions to Singapore's defence. It consists of S$100 NS55 credit vouchers and a complimentary one-year SAFRA or HomeTeamNS membership. So who is eligible? If you are NSmen or NSF as of May 2022, you are then qualified for the benefits. Do note that you need to register by 31 December 2022 in order to redeem the complimentary SAFRA or HomeTeamNS membership. How Do You Claim the Vouchers? The credits, which will be valid for a year, will be disbursed digitally for convenience from July 1 to July 31. You can download the LifeSG mobile application on your mobile phone to redeem the credits. Here are four easy steps to do so: In your LifeSG mobile application, scroll to \u201cBenefits and Support\u201d Locate \u201cNS55 credits\u201d and tap on \u201cView Details\u201d Tap on \u201cScan QR code to pay\u201d and scan the QR code provided by the merchant After entering the amount to pay, that\u2019s it! You will have successfully paid for your purchase using the NS55 credits.  For some people, the LifeSG app might not reflect the S$100 credits yet. Some might not even be able to see the \u201cBenefits and Support\u201d section in the app. But fear not - the credits are issued on a rolling basis, so just be patient. Eventually, you should receive them by the end of July 2022. \u2018Life Hack\u2019 to Get the Vouchers in Cash   Sheng Siong Paynow Machine   Source: Sheng Siong, Sengkang West Facebook Some of you might wonder, why are the rewards in the form of credit vouchers and not cash? Perhaps it is to ensure recipients will spend the credits with Singapore-registered businesses via the LifeSG app. Disbursed cash might end up being spent outside Singapore - for instance, being used to pump petrol in Johor Bahru, which is a notorious favourite pastime of Singaporeans. However, it is understandable that having your S$100 being restricted to just a few businesses that accept PayNow transactions is inconvenient. As such, users have uncovered a way to \u2018convert\u2019 these credits to cash.  Sheng Shiong ATMs apparently can be used to dispense cash from the PayNow option. However, due to a $0.20 convenience fee, users can only withdraw a maximum of $90 from the machine, as withdrawing $100 would require a $100.20 credit instead. The remaining $9.80 can be kept as credits in the LifeSG app for use at other merchants.   Story continues So what are these other merchants that you can spend your credits on?Full List of MerchantsLuckily for you, we have compiled a list of all participating merchants and their promotions for you in a handy table.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

The rupee was aided by dollar sales by foreign banks and exporters during the session, a trader at a mid-sized private bank said.   Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

For the latest on the open-source platform for hybrid quantum-classical computing, see the CUDA Quantum page.\nNVIDIA today announced a unified computing platform for speeding breakthroughs in quantum research and development across AI, HPC, health, finance and other disciplines.\nThe NVIDIA Quantum Optimized Device Architecture, or QODA, aims to make quantum computing more accessible by creating a coherent hybrid quantum-classical programming model. QODA is an open, unified environment for some of today\u2019s most powerful computers and quantum processors, improving scientific productivity and enabling greater scale in quantum research.\u00a0\u00a0\nHPC and AI domain experts can use it to easily add quantum computing to existing applications, leveraging both today\u2019s quantum processors, as well as simulated future quantum machines using NVIDIA DGX systems and a large installed base of NVIDIA GPUs available in scientific supercomputing centers and public clouds.\n\u201cScientific breakthroughs can occur in the near term with hybrid solutions combining classical computing and quantum computing,\u201d said Tim Costa, director of HPC and Quantum Computing Products at NVIDIA. \u201cQODA will revolutionize quantum computing by giving developers a powerful and productive programming model.\u201d\nLeading quantum organizations are already using NVIDIA GPUs and highly specialized NVIDIA software \u2013 NVIDIA cuQuantum \u2013 to develop individual quantum circuits. With QODA, developers can build complete quantum applications simulated with NVIDIA cuQuantum on GPU-accelerated supercomputers.\nToday, at the Q2B conference in Tokyo, NVIDIA announced QODA collaborations with quantum hardware providers IQM Quantum Computers, Pasqal, Quantinuum, Quantum Brilliance and Xanadu; software providers QC Ware and Zapata Computing; and supercomputing centers Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\n\u201cQuantinuum is partnering with NVIDIA to enable users of Quantinuum\u2019s H-series quantum processors, powered by Honeywell, to program and develop the next generation of hybrid quantum-classical applications with QODA,\u201d said Alex Chernoguzov, chief engineer at Quantinuum. \u201cThis ties together the best performing classical computers with our world-class quantum processors.\u201d\n\u201cThe hybrid quantum-classical capabilities developed by NVIDIA will enable HPC developers to accelerate their existing applications by providing an efficient way to program quantum and classical resources in a consolidated environment,\u201d said Yudong Cao, chief technology officer at Zapata. \u201cNear-term applications in chemistry, drug discovery, materials science and more can now be seamlessly integrated with quantum computing, driving new discoveries in these fields as practical quantum advantage emerges.\u201d\nLearn more about NVIDIA QODA and watch the NVIDIA special address.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics and ignited the era of modern AI.

That brought the tally of penthouses sold to four out of six at the 510-unit, 99-year leasehold,\u00a0high-end condo completed in October 2017. The project is located in the heart of the CBD in prime District 1.

With just two duplex penthouses remaining, SingLand deliberated whether to sell them as bare units or fully furnished. When the Covid pandemic struck, the developer saw that there was a need for units fitted out and furnished for immediate occupation, says Lim. Both duplex penthouses have soaring 5.2m ceilings, four en suite bedrooms, living, dining area and kitchen on the lower level, while the entertainment room and private roof terrace are on the upper level. However, the layouts and sizes of the penthouses are different, and the views vary too, as they are situated on different stacks of the 54-storey condominium tower.    The living and dining area of the 6,200 sq ft, $18.8 million duplex penthouse designed by Angela Lim of SuMisura (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) A tale of two penthouses That led SingLand to appoint two celebrated interior designers with starkly different design philosophies to put their stamp on the remaining penthouses: Angela Lim, director of SuMisura, and Peter Tay of Peter Tay Studio. The design approach taken by each is very different \u2014 which was what the developer wanted, says SingLand\u2019s Lim. \u201cThe target audience for each penthouse is very different too,\u201d he adds. The smaller penthouse is the 6,200 sq ft duplex on the 52nd floor. The penthouse is north-facing, and commands a panoramic view of the CBD skyline, the Marina Bay Floating Platform and Johor Bahru skyline in the distance. It is designed by SuMisura.   Story continues When SuMisura\u2019s Lim first visited the bare unit, she saw an opportunity. \u201cVery seldom do you find a penthouse with this ceiling height,\u201d she says. \u201cThe white walls, white ceiling gave us a white canvas to work with. There was so much we could do.\u201d  Lim of SuMisura: We wanted to create a cohesive look with the rose gold and bronze details of our bespoke furniture pieces and fittings \u2013 from the wall scones to the chandeliers and the room divider (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)She felt it was important to layer the cavernous space in order to give it a sense of order. With natural light flooding the penthouse during the day, the interiors tend to be very bright. She saw this as an opportunity to create a darker and cosier interior.Dark panelling was introduced at the entrance foyer, and a divider made of steel in rose gold finish was installed to complement that. The divider was designed with fins and apertures so that the view from there would not be compromised.To satisfy the future owners\u2019 storage needs, at the foyer is a wall-mounted console with a recess and lights for display, that also doubles as a shoe cabinet with ventilation at the bottom. Additional storage space was created under the staircase, camouflaged behind wall panelling.Layering, customisationThe living and dining area as well as adjoining balcony of the penthouse has been demarcated by SuMisura as an entertainment space. Three of the en suite bedrooms, including the master bedroom and the corridor leading to them, can be closed off via a concealed door.  One of the four bedrooms at the penthouse designed by SuMisura as a hidden home office (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)Located off the dining area is the fourth bedroom, which SuMisura\u2019s Lim has converted into a \u201chidden home office\u201d, with its doorway likewise concealed by the dark timber panelling at the dining area.Furniture pieces and fixtures were customised by SuMisura exclusively for the penthouse. This includes the royal blue velvet eight-seater sofa in the living room, the dining table of ebony wood and rose gold edges, with matching dining chairs upholstered in velvet and leather, with rose gold trim and back handles.\u201cWe wanted to create a cohesive look with the rose gold and bronze details of our bespoke furniture pieces and fittings \u2014 from the wall scones to the chandeliers and the room divider,\u201d says SuMisura\u2019s Lim.Transformed spacesThe entertainment space on the upper level functions as a family room and is also an ideal area to entertain friends and enjoy the view. It opens out to a private roof terrace of about 200 sq m (2,153 sq ft), which is ideal for an extended entertainment area. SuMisura has furnished the space with an al fresco dining set next to the outdoor kitchen and a pool table. \u201cYou can enjoy the view in the comfort of your own home,\u201d she says.  The entertainment room designed by SuMisura on the upper level of the 6,200 sq ft duplex penthouse (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)Both the dry and wet kitchens have been fitted by the developer with top-end Gaggenau kitchen appliances, solid surface kitchen countertops and quality cabinetry.To break the monotony of a long corridor leading to the bedrooms, SuMisura installed mirrors at regular intervals to reflect glimpses of the bedroom interiors.Of the three bedrooms, the master bedroom has been the most transformed. To create a more spacious master bedroom, the walk-in wardrobe was removed. New wardrobes were constructed along the walls of the master bedroom. \u201cNot only did we shift the wardrobe space to the side, we more than compensated for it by increasing the amount of wardrobe space,\u201d she says.The 6,200 sq ft penthouse has a price tag of $18.8 million ($3,032 psf), which includes the $1 million worth of interior design and furnishing by SuMisura.  The master bedroom designed by SuMisura with wardrobe space moved to the sides of the wall (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)\u201cWe envisioned the buyer to be a well-travelled C-suite expatriate or family office key personnel who intends to relocate to Singapore with his or her family,\u201d says SingLand\u2019s Lim.\u2018All about lighting and the stage\u2019The other penthouse on the 53rd floor is larger at 6,814 sq ft. With a view of Sentosa Cove, the Tanjong Pagar container terminal and the future Greater Southern Water, Peter Tay visualised the penthouse as a stage. His design is therefore \u201call about lighting and the stage\u201d, he says.To capitalise on the view outside, Tay darkened the interior by using dark wood panelling for the ceiling. He complemented it by creating a stucco ceiling feature, inspired by the dome and skylight at the Pantheon in Rome. \u201cAt night, it\u2019s going to be very beautiful because it will be dim inside, and you can see Sentosa lit up,\u201d he says.To capture some of the skyline view into the apartment, Tay wrapped part of the ceiling and wall of the living room with highly polished reflective steel. He designed a sliding screen to block off the view of the neighbouring buildings from the dining room. The sliding screen presented some challenges: As it was too big to be brought into the lift, it had to be welded and spray-painted on site at the penthouse. The effort paid off, as the screen acts as a backdrop, he points out.  Tay of Peter Tay Studio: The penthouse at V on Shenton is all about lighting and the stage (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)Tay envisions the potential buyer to be a successful broker or trader in the financial sector. His design approach was to create something \u201cquiet and calm\u201d for the interiors. \u201cI want to create the feel of a luxury hotel \u2014 like The Edison Shanghai or Aman Tokyo \u2014 a laid-back, private sanctuary in an urban setting,\u201d he adds.Quiet calm, with hint of nostalgia\u201cThe port terminal played an important role in Singapore\u2019s history, and it will make way for the Greater Southern Waterfront in the future,\u201d says Tay. \u201cThis penthouse will appeal to someone who understands the significance of the location, its past and future.\u201dWith that in mind, Tay handpicked furniture pieces that had a hint of nostalgia. He points to the Ralph Lauren table which he says is \u201ca classic\u201d. The onyx and marble feature wall in the living room is also designed like a stage. \u201cAt night, when the lights are turned off in the room, this will be the only feature that is illuminated in the interior and it will direct your attention to the main stage, which is the view outside,\u201d he says.Tay clad the lift lobby and entrance foyer in steel panels of champagne gold, which draws the attention down the long corridor leading to the bedrooms. The panels along the corridor are of dark wood and \u201cfloating\u201d above the floor, and are illuminated underneath. The doors of the bedrooms are stained a dark colour to match the timber panels. \u201cI designed them as makeup rooms before you enter the stage,\u201d he says.  Master bedroom designed by Peter Tay with feature wall of champagne coloured polished steel (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)The same style of quiet understated luxury extends to the bedrooms. \u201cIt\u2019s not all bling,\u201d he says. In the second bedroom, which Tay designed as a child\u2019s bedroom, he moved the wardrobe to a more prominent location at the opposite wall. \u201cInstead of being overlooked, the wardrobe should be something that is beyond functional, something that children will enjoy putting their things in,\u201d he adds. He added a touch of the whimsical by designing the bed frame of the bed like a house.Within the master bedroom is a feature wall of champagne coloured steel, a continuation of the one outside. This time, it has a contrasting matte and highly polished finish. \u201cYou can still see the light reflected on it,\u201d says Tay.Designing trophy homesHe has turned the entertainment room on the upper level into a sanctuary. \u201cYou can come here, sit down to read or admire the view outside,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted the space to be simple and clean.\u201dThe entertainment room opens out to a spacious private roof terrace of 230 sq m (2,476 sq ft). \u201cIt\u2019s ideal for a corporate penthouse, as the roof terrace alone can hold an event for at least 50 people,\u201d says SingLand\u2019s Lim.  The 230 sqm (2,476 sq ft) roof terrace of the 6,814 sq ft duplex penthouse is large enough for corporate events of up to 50 people (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)Three years ago, Tay had also designed the penthouse next door on the 53rd floor, while Topic Studio had fitted out the unit on the 52nd floor directly below. Both units were purchased by the same owner in December 2019.In fact, Tay has been behind the design of many super penthouses: \u201cI just finished the design of the super penthouse for Binance CEO [Zhao Changpeng] at Hilltops,\u201d he says. \u201cI did the super penthouse that James Dyson bought at Wallich Residence.\u201dThe price for the 6,814 sq ft penthouse designed by Tay is $20.8 million ($3,053 psf). That includes the $1 million worth of furnishings and fittings incorporated into the design. \u201cWe envision this penthouse to appeal to the successful global entrepreneur, and this could be one of his trophy homes,\u201d says SingLand\u2019s Lim.The first penthouse sold at V on Shenton was also the largest \u2014 a 7,255 sq ft, duplex penthouse. The owner purchased it for $13.418 million ($1,849 psf) in August 2012. It was leased out for $48,000 a month in April this year, according to URA rental data. The unit was said to be just partially furnished.  The 510-unit V on Shenton, a 99-year leasehold prime condo in prime District 1 was completed in 2017 (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)The next penthouse to be sold was in January 2019, when a smaller, 3,918 sq ft, four-bedroom simplex fetched $10.08 million ($2,573 psf). That deal was brokered by SRI.Priced just over $3,000 psfSingLand has appointed PropNex, Huttons and SRI to handle the marketing of these two remaining penthouses at V on Shenton.According to Bruce Lye, managing partner of SRI, owner-occupiers who want a fuss-free, ready-to-move-in penthouse are likely to be attracted to these units.Given the development\u2019s location in the heart of the CBD, and proximity to Tanjong Pagar, the pricing of the penthouses at just over $3,000 psf, together with interior design, \u201cis a steal\u201d, he says. \u201cThe views are also stunning, with one penthouse having unblocked views of the sea and Sentosa, and the other, of the CBD and Marina Bay.\u201d  View of the CBD Core and the Marina Florating Platform from the roof terrace of the 52nd floor penthouse (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)Lye reckons the two penthouses will appeal to foreigners, given the convenience of its location in the CBD, which is where most new arrivals want to set up their new office.Nearby at Wallich Residence in Tanjong Pagar, two junior penthouses of 3,509 sq ft on the 61st and 60th floors were sold for $17.5 million ($4,987 psf) and $17 million ($4,885 psf) in January 2020 and October 2021 respectively. Meanwhile, the triplex penthouse of 21,108 sq ft on the 62nd to 64th floors was first purchased by Dyson for $73.8 million ($3,496 psf) in 2019, and sold over a year later to Indonesian-born Chinese American Leo Koguan for $62 million ($2,937 psf).Recent units at Wallich Residence sold by the developer have been at prices ranging from $5.1 million ($2,854 psf) for a 1,787 sq ft unit on the 40th floor to $7.8 million ($3,875 psf) for a 2,013 sq ft unit on the 59th floor, according to caveats lodged.Units at V on Shenton have changed hands in the resale market at prices ranging from $1.8 million ($1,900 psf) for a 947 sq ft, two-bedder on the 10th floor to $3.918 million ($2,200 psf) for a 1,765 sq ft, three-bedder on the 40th floor, according to caveats lodged in May.

It is a 1,765 sq ft, three-bedroom unit on the 49th floor. SingLand has engaged UNO Interior to design the unit, which is on the market for $4.45 million ($2,521 psf). The unit has views of Marina Bay and Raffles Place, says SingLand\u2019s Lim.For such high-rise luxury homes, it is the views that command a premium. According to Lim, the view of the two penthouses at V on Shenton would not be blocked by any upcoming developments. \u201cThe view of Marina Bay and the Greater Southern Waterfront is going to be priceless,\u201d he says.

Last year, the state recorded property transactions worth RM19.22 billion ($6 billion), up nearly 15% from the RM16.79 billion clocked in 2020, according to data cited by Malaysian real estate company Zerin Properties.  Read also:\u00a0Daintree Residence Offers You The Best Value Property prices in Johor are expected to gradually pick up this year as the borders between Malaysia and Singapore reopen, providing a crucial boost to the economy. Since land borders between the countries were reopened on April 1, the number of travellers passing through the Woodlands and Tuas Checkpoints has steadily increased \u2014 hitting a high of over 282,000 travellers per day during the first weekend of July.    Johor\u2019s property market is geared for recovery as the reopening of Malaysia and Singapore\u2019s borders offer a crucial boost to the economy (Picture: Bloomberg) The return of Singapore visitors to Johor, along with the wider easing of pandemic-related safety measures, is expected to revive various sectors such as retail, tourism and hospitality. This will, in turn, provide an uplift to the real estate market as sentiment improves. Already, the property market in the state\u2019s capital Johor Bahru is seeing an increase in activity.  At Setia Sky 88, a freehold condominium in the city by Malaysian-listed developer S P Setia, interest has picked up considerably from both local and Singaporean buyers. \u201cWe have been bringing in several groups from Singapore to Johor Bahru for viewings at Setia Sky 88,\u201d says Vincent Kwa, manager at S P Setia International. Landmark development Setia Sky 88 comprises three towers spanning 55 storeys each, making it one of the tallest residential buildings in the city. There are a total of 588 units, comprising a mix of one-bedroom apartments going up to three-bedroom plus study, with sizes ranging from 678 sq ft to 1,389 sq ft. The development, which was completed in 2017, is designed as an upscale residential offering. Units come equipped with fixtures and appliances, including kitchen cabinets, bedroom wardrobes, refrigerator and washing machine cum dryer. Besides round-the-clock security and concierge services, residents have access to a variety of facilities spread across several different levels.    Setia Sky 88, a completed development by Malaysian-listed develop S P Setia, is expected to benefit from catalytic developments in Johor Bahru (Picture: S P Setia)   Story continues At level three, residents have access to a visitor\u2019s lounge and business centre while recreational facilities are available on levels eight and nine, including an infinity pool, squash court, gym, theatre and music room. On levels 42 to 44, another pool is available with views overlooking the city, in addition to a wine lounge and karaoke room.A key appeal of the development is its location at the heart of the city. Situated just a short drive away from the Sultan Iskandar Customs, Immigration and Quarantine Complex (CIQ BSI), it offers convenient access to the Johor-Singapore Causeway. Residents at Setia Sky 88 can take a free shuttle bus service provided that goes to the checkpoint daily. The proximity to Singapore is a reason why Setia Sky 88 is popular among Singaporean buyers, who make up the second largest group of purchasers after Malaysians, notes S P Setia\u2019s Kwa.  The pool on level 42 of Setia Sky 88 offers panoramic views of the city (Picture: S P Setia)Affordable quantumSingaporean buyers at Setia Sky 88 include both those buying for investment purposes as well as those looking to occupy the unit themselves, Kwa adds. A major draw is the more affordable quantum of units at the development relative to homes in Singapore. \u201cFor Singaporeans, they\u2019re able to buy a bigger property compared to what they could get in Singapore, at more affordable prices,\u201d he explains. Units are still available at Setia Sky 88, with prices starting from $155,000 for a one-bedroom apartment.While the Johor state government imposes a minimum purchase price for foreigners at RM1 million for high-rise residential properties, Setia Sky 88 is exempted from the requirement, with no restrictions on foreign ownership on units priced below RM1 million. Currently, foreigners that own property in Malaysia are subject to a Real Property Gains Tax of 30% on gains made if they dispose of their property within the first five years of ownership, or 10% from the sixth year onwards.  The gym at Setia Sky 88 (Picture: S P Setia)Catalytic projectsAs Johor returns to a state of normalcy, major infrastructure projects have resumed and are expected to propel the state\u2019s development. Among these is the much anticipated Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link \u2014 a 4km cross-border rail project that connects a terminal at Singapore\u2019s Woodlands North to a Malaysian terminal in Bukit Chagar, located next to the Johor Bahru checkpoint.It is scheduled for completion by the end of 2026. When it commences operations, the RTS Link is expected to carry up to 10,000 passengers per hour in each direction, with the journey time between both stations taking roughly five minutes. S P Setia International\u2019s general manager Neo Keng Hoe believes the RTS Link and the improved connectivity to Singapore further enhance the value proposition of Setia Sky 88 to Singaporeans. \u201cThe better connectivity will be useful for those looking for a second home or a holiday home in the Johor Bahru city centre,\u201d he says.  Woodlands Bus Interchange. Connectivity between Johor Bahru and Singapore is expected to further improve with the completion of the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (Picture: Albert Chua/The Edge Singapore)The construction of an RM4 billion integrated development connected to the Bukit Chagar RTS Link station is also currently underway. Dubbed Coronation Square, the development is targeted at revitalising the city centre and will include a shopping mall, residential and office towers, a hotel and medical suites.The project will be completed in phases from this year, with full completion targeted by 2028. It is the first project under the Ibrahim International Investment District (IIBD), a 250-acre development project by the Johor state government to transform Johor Bahru into a world-class metropolis.Meanwhile, the state government is also pushing other projects to improve connectivity within Johor. The construction of the Iskandar Rapid Transit (IRT) \u2014 which connects Johor\u2019s air, land and sea transport hubs \u2014 is scheduled to start this year, while a proposal for a light rail system within the Johor Bahru metropolitan region is currently being assessed.See Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) Kuala Lumpur-Singapore HSR cancellation may dampen growth of properties in Johor  Daintree Residence Offers You The Best Value  Daintree Residence: Accentuating the draw of Beauty World En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

In May, the LTA had announced the increase of ERP rates \u2013 also by S$1 \u2013 at eight locations across 19 periods, staggered across dates in May and June.  These remain unchanged, the LTA said.

(PHOTO: Roslan RAHMAN / AFP)  \u00b7 ROSLAN RAHMAN via Getty Images SINGAPORE \u2014 Over half of Singapore workers surveyed said they would consider leaving their jobs if asked to return full-time to the workplace. A majority of these workers are between the ages of 18 to 44, according to the \u201cPeople at Work 2022: A Global Workforce View\u201d report by ADP Research Institute. In comparison, only around 20 per cent of Singapore workers above 45 years old would contemplate leaving if their employer insist on them returning to the workplace full-time.  The reluctance could be a potential friction point as some industries, such as construction, manufacturing and food and beverage may not be able to implement a hybrid work system, according to the statement by ADP on Monday (4 July). The F&B and retail industries also have a higher reliance on younger workers, as compared to other industries. The report, which explored employees\u2019 attitudes towards work and their hopes for their future workplace, surveyed 32,924 workers across 17 countries in November last year. In Singapore, a total of 1,907 workers between 18 and 55 years old and above were polled. Also read: Free food?

The resistance is most acute amongst workers aged between 18 and 24 years old, with 71 per cent saying they would consider quitting if required to return to their workplace full-time. This compares with 61 per cent of 35- to 44-year-olds and 56 per cent of 45- to 54-year-olds.   Younger workers are more likely to quit if asked to work from office full time. (PHOTO: ADP Research Institute)   Career change The report also conducted surveys in other aspects of work, including how satisfied workers were, and their priorities in their careers. In Singapore, 75 per cent of respondents have considered a major career change in the last 12 months, This may be due, in part at least, to only one in eight Singaporeans feeling that their job or industry is secure. Around 31 per cent of them described themselves as \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with work, while 52 per cent are \u201csomewhat\u201d satisfied. Compared to other respondents in Asia Pacific, Singapore workers were least satisfied in their current employment and the least optimistic about their workplace in the next five years.   Story continues   Singapore scored the lowest for job satisfaction and optimism amongst its peers. (PHOTO: ADP Research Institute)  While salary was the key priority in a job across the Asia Pacific region, it is by far the single most important factor for Singapore workers, with 71 per cent ranking it it as the top element. Despite this, only 63 per cent of Singapore staff are likely to ask for a raise if they feel they deserve one.Around 42 per cent of workers in Singapore rated flexibility of working hours as important, while 32 per cent said that enjoyment of the day\u2019s work is key.When asked what they expect to achieve in their current companies within the next 12 months, 50 per cent of Singapore workers indicated that they expected to get a pay raise, while 45 per cent are expecting a bonus. Only 31 per cent expect a promotion.  Singapore employees think they work 8.4 hours a week on average for free. (PHOTO: ADP Research Institute)  Singapore respondents also felt that they spent 8.4 hours on average a week working for free, which includes working over lunch breaks, and staying past office hours.Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingapore  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

In a week when rail unions are planning to strike over pay freezes and job cuts, front-runner Truss said she would introduce a new law in her first 30 days that would guarantee a minimum level of service on \"vital national infrastructure\" and also raise the minimum threshold for trade union strike votes.  Truss is trying to set the agenda for the leadership contest against former finance minister Rishi Sunak, by appealing to the Conservative Party membership, who will appoint their next leader, and Britain's prime minister, on Sept. 5. Both candidates have tilted to the right to win over a membership which, according to one academic study tends to be older, male, southern English and supporters of Brexit. \"We need tough and decisive action to limit trade unions\u2019 ability to paralyse our economy,\" Truss said in a statement. \"I will do everything in my power to make sure that militant action from trade unions can no longer cripple the vital services that hard-working people rely on.\" Britain faces a summer of disruption as workers across the economy, struggling with a rising cost of living squeeze, resort to strike action in disputes over pay and conditions. Rail workers brought services near to a standstill last month, British lawyers involved in criminal trails have staged walkouts, while teachers and doctors are threatening to strike. The contest was launched when Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation earlier this month after a mass rebellion by the party's lawmakers triggered by the latest in a series of scandals that had fatally undermined trust.

Chief Executive Officer Zhu Su has been trying to offload at least one of his so-called good-class bungalows in the past couple of weeks, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The sale plans mark a turnaround from last year, when Zhu tweeted that he was \u201cthinking about buying all the good-class bungalows in Singapore\u201d to turn them into parks and regenerative farming sites.  Zhu, who is in his mid-30s, and his wife, Tao Yaqiong Evelyn, purchased the two-story, six-bedroom home in the upscale Yarwood neighbourhood late last year for S$48.8 million under a trust, public records show. In Singapore, a good-class bungalow is the local equivalent of a mansion. Zhu didn\u2019t immediately respond to emails seeking comment.  Zhu\u2019s official address is listed at Balmoral Road, an exclusive estate that\u2019s a five-minute drive to Singapore\u2019s famous Orchard Road shopping belt. The couple also owns at least one other good-class bungalow at Dalvey Road, which was purchased under Tao\u2019s name, according to public records.

This week, a British Virgin Islands court ordered the company \u2014 founded by Zhu and former Credit Suisse Group AG trader Kyle Davies \u2014 to liquidate after failing to repay creditors. Singapore\u2019s central bank on Thursday reprimanded the company for providing false information and exceeding the maximum amount of money it was allowed to manage. It\u2019s also looking into whether there were more breaches by the firm of its rules.  The Yarwood house, sitting on at least 15,000 square feet (1,400 square meters) of land behind a metal gate on a leafy street, is going through some renovation work, according to observations made during a visit by Bloomberg. A new two-story house with a basement, attic and swimming pool is being built on the Dalvey site and construction is expected to be completed next year.

Take a step back. On May 13, Sanjuro United, a consortium formed by the shareholders of four parties, EL, CSGL, RAL and EIPL (EIPL is owned by Ong Choo Eng, one of six sons of the patriarch Ong Chay Tong), announced\u00a0a voluntary conditional offer\u00a0of 37 cents\u00a0to its shareholders. The current Ong directors of Hwa Hong, which comprise the sons of three of Ong Choo Eng\u2019s brothers, appointed Evercore Asia to perform a strategic review and to source for better offers.  On June 14, Sanjuro revised its offer to 40 cents. Subsequently a circular was dispatched to shareholders where Provenance Capital, the independent financial adviser (IFA)\u00a0to the current Ong directors,\u00a0has stated that the offer is fair and reasonable. The IFA also pointed out that while the revalued net asset value (RNAV) can be as high as 50.5\u00a0cents, fair value is 40-43\u00a0cents.  According to the offer circular, Evercore is likely to be paid on a success basis should it obtain a better offer\u00a0for shareholders and the fees involved are likely to have a negative impact on the current 40 cents offer price. The IFA stated in the offer circular: \u201cAs a result of the fees involved, IFA has indicated that estimated Adjusted RNAV of the Group as at 31 December 2021 will need to be reduced by up to approximately $0.0148 per share. Hence, any potential bidder looking to come up with an offer price will need to take into consideration the fees.\u201d Based on the arithmetic, any competing offer would need to be above 41.5 cents to make sense to shareholders.   Story continues The circular adds that the total fees can only be determined at the close of the transaction because of the success fees to Evercore in the event of a competing offer. Provenance has also stated that its fees are not based on a success basis. \u201cFor the purpose of disclosure, our IFA advisory fee is not on a success basis,\u201d Provenance says.As at July 5, Sanjuro's stake coupled with acceptances and buys in the open market stood at 38.2%.\u00a0The current Ong directors hold 29.26%, other Ong family\u00a0 holds 10.9% and City Developments 5.11%.\u00a0See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore SIC requires Hwa Hong's directors to announce alternative offer by July 25 Sanjuro holds 38.2% of Hwa Hong, extends offer date to Aug 1  Closing date for Hwa Hong offer is extended to July 6 Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

While the company\u2019s stock value spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently fallen below its highest value recorded during the beginning of the market frenzy, Amazon has bounced back considerably. Amazon also has a proven track record of returning to new heights even after major setbacks. For example, the online retailer lost a quarter of its value in 2016 but came back stronger after this period of economic uncertainty ended. This track record can make Amazon an attractive choice when building a long-term portfolio.\u00a02. NVIDIA Corp.

The semiconductor chip industry shortage has made a wide range of consumer products more expensive, including everything from used cars to laptop computers. While this trend is likely to continue, chip manufacturer NVIDIA may be poised for a comeback after the shortage ends. NVIDIA produces semiconductor chips required for some of the top trends in tech, including artificial intelligence and cloud computing.

There are a few steps that you can take to determine if a particular company is safe to add to your investments, including the following.Evaluate the IndustryWhen studying a company, first consider under what industry the corporation falls. For example, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) are in the technology sector, while Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) and Amazon are in the consumer discretionary sector. Generally, industries related to consumer staples are considered more stable than emerging industries since people will always need necessities such as food, clothes, and household items, even during periods of low economic growth.\u00a0Many companies in technology are viewed as somewhat risky, especially those focused on emerging technology. Still, the largest companies in the sector that have displayed stable growth and have widespread adoption of their products tend to be reliable investment options. Technology continues to gain more of a foothold in everyday life, and established companies in this space are at the forefront of this expansion. By selecting a company from an established industry, you can have confidence that a steady stream of revenue will support the company even during periods of economic crisis.\u00a0Consider Market CapitalizationMarket capitalization, the total value of the company's outstanding stock, is another essential factor in evaluating a stock's safety. You can find the market cap by multiplying the number of outstanding shares of a company by the share price. Often, large-cap companies are referred to as \u201cblue chip stocks\u201d and are likely to be included in large index funds.\u00a0Large-cap companies are recognized by a market cap of over $10 billion. Large-cap companies are considered conservative investments because to reach such a high valuation, they have delivered years of solid returns and risen to the highest level of business success. A company this rooted is unlikely to fail, even during times of market volatility.\u00a0Analyze Financial FactorsSafe stocks to invest in are characterized by several indicators of financial health. You can calculate the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio by dividing the share price by the company's earnings per share over the last year. A high PE ratio may signal the company is overvalued, while a low PE ratio may imply the stock is undervalued. Study the company's balance sheet and credit rating. Is it saddled with debt? A company with a poor credit rating is not creditworthy and likely to default. If a company defaults, the stock price will plummet. Other indicators to keep an eye on are earnings per share, dividend yield and projected earnings growth.Review HistorySafe investments will have a proven track record of financial success. While new stocks may show high returns, this does not necessarily mean that they are stable investments that will be able to make it through market lows. Instead, you want to look for a stock with a strong reputation and successful track record. To tell if a stock is showing consistent returns, check if it consistently paid dividends. While a stock might not be dramatically climbing in value, consistent dividends mean that the company has been able to maintain its returns to investors, which is a good sign when searching for long-term investments.\u00a0Prioritize DiversificationA critical aspect of selecting safe stocks and building a stable portfolio is diversification. It\u2019s not a good idea to have all your eggs in one basket, for example, by investing only in multiple stocks within a single industry. Despite the relative strength of an industry, at times, global and economic factors that adversely affect particular sectors may come into play, lowering the value of all stocks in a sector.\u00a0When you diversify your stock portfolio, these price declines can be offset by unaffected investments in other industries. One way to diversify without investing in many different stocks is to invest in stock indexes or ETFs. These investments are traded like single company stocks; however, when you own a share, you actually invest in a basket of various securities within an industry or that follow an index like the S&P 500. By adding safe stocks to your portfolio, you can diversify your investments and set yourself up for long-term stability. \u00a0Do Safe Stocks Always Gain Value?As much as it is hoped that quality stocks will continually gain value, all stocks fluctuate in value to some extent over time. Even safe stocks may experience times of resistance, mainly when the stock market as a whole is in a period of decline. While safe stocks may not always rise in value, they tend to show fewer price fluctuations when compared to competing investments.\u00a0A lower-risk stock differs from other investments because it can withstand the test of time, riding out market lows and highs while providing relatively steady returns. You may be inclined to think that a stock producing the highest returns would be the best investment; however, many new companies provide explosive returns but plummet in price when they encounter market resistance. Instead of looking for a chart that only goes up, look for steady growth over many years.\u00a0When investing in safe stocks, it\u2019s important to remember that ups and downs are expected and that panic selling during a low period is often one of the worst things you can do. When you invest in a low-risk stock with a proven track record and strong company finances, the price will most likely rebound naturally as the market stabilizes. Remember that the stock market is never guaranteed and that even stocks that experts consider safe can plummet in value. This is part of the reason why it\u2019s so important to diversify your portfolio with a wide range of investment types and sectors.\u00a0Invest in the Best Safe Stocks With These Top BrokersBefore you can begin buying and selling investments, you\u2019ll need to create an account with an online broker.

According to notable Twitter leaker @kopite7kimi, Nvidia\u2019s upcoming RTX 4090 desktop GPU scored higher than 19,000 points on the 3DMark Time Spy Extreme synthetic benchmark test. If accurate, that makes the RTX 4090 the fastest Nvidia gaming card yet, nearly doubling the score of a standard RTX 3090 and topping the current leader, an LN2 cooled EVGA RTX 3090 Ti Kingpin Edition, by around 30%.  RTX 4090, TSE >19000 \u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) July 18, 2022  This is a single, nonspecific benchmark score, so you shouldn\u2019t take it as gospel. However, the source has a clean track record and previous rumors have suggested that the forthcoming GPU could be capable of such significant gains. In fact, this same leaker wrote in May that the RTX 4090 can easily \u201cachieve 2x performance\u201d of the RTX 3090, and an even earlier rumor suggested we could be getting a 2.5x increase. Gamers hoping for the latter should still be interested by the rumored Time Spy Extreme score\u2014a 2x boost is massive compared to the 10-20% performance gains we see in a typical refresh.\n\n\n There is just one asterisk to put on that score, something that is sure to make a few AMD fans snicker in delight. If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on RTX 40-series rumors then you probably share our concern: Nivdia\u2019s next flagship cards are rumored to reach a total board power of 600 watts of power consumption (or 450 watts for the card itself). If the RTX 4090 actually requires so much power, then this benchmark score isn\u2019t as impressive of an achievement as it seems. What we really want is efficiency gains to go along with performance upgrades. If those rumored power specs hold true, then heat management will also be a serious concern. Vendors will need to get clever with their cooling systems to prevent the card from overheating. Bigger heatsinks and more effective fans will be paired with larger power supply units to keep RTX 4090-equipped systems running. Not to mention that Nvidia could risk scrutiny from government bodies given the renewed emphasis on energy prices and lowering power consumption.\n\n\n\nOther rumors suggest the RTX 4090, which will be the first Lovelace GPU released, will hit clock speeds of up to 2.5GHz or slightly higher. When Nvidia releases its RTX 40-series GPUs later this year\u2014possibly in October\u2014they will compete against AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 7000 series, the first based on a new RDNA 3 design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily Newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\n\n\r\n          Select\r\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\n\n\r\n          Select\r\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\nSign me up\n\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human: \n\n\n\n\n\nLatest news\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              A Meticulous Breakdown of Trump\u2019s Desperate Attempt to Take Credit for the Starliner Crew\u2019s Return            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              Roku Tests Putting Ads In the Worst Place            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              The Panels We\u2019re Most Excited for at Star Wars Celebration Japan            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              DOGE Broke Into the Offices of a Pro-Peace Nonprofit: Report            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              Immaculate Feather Fossil Reveals the Unlikely Preserving Power of Volcanoes            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              Stephen King\u2019s Cujo Gets an Unexpected Yet Exciting Director            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n              Italian Newspaper Creates Entirely AI-Generated Edition            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMagic: The Gathering\u2018s New Expansion Wants You to Behold Some Dragons            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest of CES 2025 Awards \n\nBest of CES 2025 Awards \u279c\n\n\n\n\nLatest news\n\n\n\n\n            A Meticulous Breakdown of Trump\u2019s Desperate Attempt to Take Credit for the Starliner Crew\u2019s Return          \n\n            3/18/2025, 3:15 pm          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Roku Tests Putting Ads In the Worst Place          \n\n            3/18/2025, 3:10 pm          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            The Panels We\u2019re Most Excited for at Star Wars Celebration Japan          \n\n            3/18/2025, 3:00 pm          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            DOGE Broke Into the Offices of a Pro-Peace Nonprofit: Report          \n\n            3/18/2025, 2:55 pm          \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Reviews\n\n\n\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Shadows Shows Ubisoft Still Hasn\u2019t Made Assassin\u2019s Creed          \n\n            3/18/2025, 1:00 pm          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            The Atari Asteroids Watch Is So Beautiful, I Don\u2019t Care How Poorly It Tells Time          \n\n            3/14/2025, 7:00 am          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Apple MacBook Air M4 Review: Feeling Ever So Blue          \n\n            3/11/2025, 9:00 am          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Apple Mac Studio Review: A Hefty Little Powerhouse          \n\n            3/11/2025, 9:00 am          \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud835\udd4f\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSitemap\nEdici\u00f3n ES\nAusgabe DE\nEdi\u00e7\u00e3o PT\nEdition FR\nAccessibility\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nAdvertising\nReprints & Permissions\nYour Privacy Choices\nProduct reviews\n\n\nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n\u00a92025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

(Image Credits:Moore's Law is Dead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a new rumor published over at Chiphell Forums, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card will come in both 450W & 600W variants & be priced lower than the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti's MSRP.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Graphics To Come In 450W & 600W TGP Flavors, Priced Lower Than RTX 3090 Ti, Alleges Rumor\nThe rumor states that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 might be the only \"Ada Lovelace\" powered graphics card launching and hitting retail shelves this year with the other variants possibly slipping into Q1 2023. A similar rumor was also started by prominent leakers over on Twitter and it is highly likely that we might get to see NVIDIA announce the other cards but the launch will take place a bit later.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostOne reason for this delay could be the fact that NVIDIA is very serious about its existing GPU inventory and AIBs could have asked the green team to wait a bit more before launching new cards & that is also why we are seeing the existing flagship lineup drop down the $1000 US price range in retail sites. NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3080 Ti which had an MSRP of $1200 US is already being sold for lower than $800 US while the RTX 3090 which had an MSRP of $1500 US is currently on offer for $1000 US.\n\nThe more interesting part is the TGP figures. It is stated that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card will come in both 450W and 600W TGP flavors. The reference design is most likely going to be kept at 450W but AIBs will have the option to go up to 600W in their custom designs. Furthermore, it is clarified that the 450W and 600W variants will have the same frequency (boost clock) limit but the higher TGP variant will have a lower chance of hitting its TGP wall and may end up providing a slightly better performance uplift within games. NVIDIA's AIB partners will mention if the card uses the 450W or 600W TGP figure on their box packages which is something that we haven't seen in the last few generations.\n\nAbout RTX 4090, we will see her soon. Nothing to say.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) July 25, 2022\n\nFinally, and the most important bit of this rumor, the Forum member states that NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4090 will have a lower MSRP than the RTX 3090 Ti. The RTX 3090 Ti had an MSRP of $1999 US & the RTX 3090 had an MSRP of $1499 US. Note how the rumor doesn't state a lower MSRP than the standard RTX 3090 but the more expensive RTX 3090 Ti. So we might just get another price bump over the previous Non-Ti **90 model around $1699-$1799 US. With that said, I think NVIDIA should really be using the $1499 US tag as the MSRP of the previous Non-Ti **90 model since it is already way high of a price to pay for a graphics card.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 'Rumored' Specifications\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX RTX 4090 graphics card is expected to be powered by the top AD102-300 GPU but it is only the 'Ti' variant that will feature the full chip. The GeForce RTX 4090 will utilize a slightly cut-down configuration.\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 will use 128 SMs of the 144 SMs for a total of 16,384 CUDA cores. The GPU will come packed with 96 MB of L2 cache and a total of 384 ROPs which is simply insane. The clock speeds are not confirmed yet but considering that the TSMC 4N process is being used, we are expecting clocks to hit or even exceed the 3.0 GHz range. The core count is a 56% increase over the RTX 3090 so a lot of things such as clocks, cache, architecture, and various other technologies are pushing the performance up by such a huge margin. We have already seen over 2x uplift in the performance versus an RTX 3090 graphics card in rumors.\nAs for memory specs, the GeForce RTX 4090 is expected to rock 24 GB GDDR6X capacities that will be clocked at 21 Gbps speeds across a 384-bit bus interface. This will provide up to 1 TB/s of bandwidth. This is the same bandwidth as the existing RTX 3090 Ti graphics card and as far as the power consumption is concerned, the TBP is said to be rated at 450W which means that TGP may end up lower than that.

The updates are available right now, and I've just upgraded my Camera Hub software so I can blur out the background on my Elgato Facecam.Or else pretend I'm anywhere else right now, preferably somewhere with sub-zero temperatures. Mmm, frostbite would feel so good right now.A new tab appears at the top of the Camera Hub software, allowing you to use the AI-powered Nvidia tech to blur your background, remove it entirely, or replace it with something else. And it's fine, but still not a 100% reliable thing to cut you out of backgrounds.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's impressive AI-based computer tuneup tool G-Assist launches next month but the best bit is missing\n\n\n\n\nLogitech has announced an 'intelligent streaming assistant' in Streamlabs to tell you when your live stream sucks\n\n\n\nYou need an RTX graphics card, because part of the software relies on the Tensor Cores, but even with the GeForce RTX 3090 in my home machine I still get shimmering on my hair and gaming chair where it phases in and out of reality.It's the audio side of Nvidia Broadcast that's the most impressive, however, and that uses AI to filter out background noise, and conversations, as well as compensate for fan noise. It can also offer different acoustics, countering echo in non-padded rooms. And that's being brought into effect with nearly all the Corsair headsets, Elgato mics, and XLR microphones using the Elgato Wave XLR.Stream machine(Image credit: Rode, Samson, Blue)Best microphone for gaming: make sure you're heard\nBest webcams: be seen while you get your stream on\nBest capture cards: lessen the load with a dedicated cardThe standalone Nvidia Broadcast app can be used in conjunction with any RTX graphics card (and we've also had its forerunner, RTX Voice, running on GTX cards, too) and will work on any microphone or webcam as well. But that means it's just another app to go wrong, and I spent a lot of time at the start of PC Gamer team meetings holding up a 'hold on a sec' finger to my camera while I restarted Nvidia Broadcast or switched audio inputs, just so everyone could hear what I was saying.Integrating it into the software of particular peripherals, however, ought to at least make it more seamless to use when it comes to jumping on that Zoom call. Well, that's the theory anyways\u2014I've got the Elgato Facecam at home and the Elgato Wave:3 microphone in the office, so we'll see how it gets on.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\nDave JamesSocial Links NavigationEditor-in-Chief, HardwareDave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the Colecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!).

Log in.\n\n\n\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi reported that her husband sold all of his stock in chip-maker NVIDIA.\nThe document states Paul Pelosi sold 25,000 shares worth up to $5 million \u2014 at a reported loss.\nThe trade comes as Congress is set to pass a $54 billion bill to bolster US chip manufacturing and research.\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi husband, Paul Pelosi, has sold all of his stock in NVIDIA on Tuesday as Congress is set to pass the \"CHIPS-plus\" bill.\n\n\nPaul Pelosi sold between $1 million and $5 million worth of NVIDIA stock, or 25,000 shares, at an average price of $165.05 on July 26, according to a mandatory congressional financial disclosure filed Tuesday by the speaker. Members of Congress are only required to report the values of their trades in broad ranges.\nThe disclosure states that by selling the shares, Paul Pelosi suffered a \"total loss of $341,365.\"\n\n\nThis disclosure of a financial loss is notable because Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, rarely volunteers such detailed information about her husband's stock and stock option trades.\nBut the Pelosis have faced significant questions and criticism from the right in recent days about the timing of Paul Pelosi's NVIDIA investments. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nInsider previously reported that Paul Pelosi exercised 200 call options, or 20,000 shares, of NVIDIA worth between $1 million and $5 million on June 17, 2022, at a strike price of $100.\n\n\nPaul Pelosi's trades come at a time when Congress is set to pass the \"CHIPS-plus\" bill, which will invest $54 billion in stateside semiconductor manufacturing and research. NVIDIA, a producer of graphics processing units and developer of integrated circuits, was one of many companies to sign an open letter in June asking leaders of Congress to pass the bill.\nLast week, Pelosi denied\u00a0at a press conference that her venture capitalist husband traded stocks using information she's given him.\u00a0\n\"Absolutely not,\" Nancy Pelosi said.\n\n\nCongress considering stock ban\nThe speaker's husband's trades also arise at a time when Congress is debating whether its members and their spouses should even be allowed to buy, sell, and hold individual stocks at all.\n\n\n\n                                Related stories\n                              \n\n\n\nPelosi herself originally opposed the idea, saying: \"We are a free market economy. They should be able to participate in that.\"\nShe ultimately backtracked after sharp criticism from members of Congress on both sides of the aisle and the general public, allowing bipartisan groups of lawmakers to draft bills and hold a public hearing.\n\n\n\"I've said to the House Administration Committee, review all the bills that are coming in and see which ones \u2014 where the support is in our caucus,\" Pelosi said. \"If members want to do that, I'm okay with that.\"\nDespite several proposed bills from Republicans and Democrats in both chambers, not a single one has been brought to a vote. Rep. Abigail Spanberger told Insider that she thinks leadership is \"trying to run out the clock\" and that the push has been halted by \"anyone who has the ability to move\" the bills forward.\nSpeaker Pelosi herself does not trade stocks, but her husband is a frequent investor.\n\n\nInsider collected each of his trades that the speaker reported in 2021 and 2022.

AMD are openly working on next-gen, RDNA 3-based Radeon GPUs, and Intel are gearing up for the full launch of their Arc Alchemist cards before the end of summer \u2013 yet there\u2019s not been so much as a single presentation slide on Nvidia\u2019s wares. Not the kind of hype-building you\u2019d expect, given how many of the current generation\u2019s best graphics cards have GeForce badges.\r\n\n\r\nArriving to fill that info void are, inevitably, leaks. If you don\u2019t regularly hang out in PC hardware circles, know that there\u2019s a veritable cottage industry of in-the-know insiders: anonymous but widely known tipsters like Greymon55 and kopite7kimi, who\u2019ve shared enough accurate details on previous GPU and CPU launches that at least some of their sources are solid. Recently, unannounced Nvidia cards like the RTX 4070, RTX 4080 and especially the RTX 4090 have become this industry\u2019s hottest commodities, meaning leakers are also the primary source of GeForce details for the gaming tech world at large.\r\n\n\n\n\n\nSteam Deck: The Second Opinion\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\r\nI\u2019m not here to dunk on leaks. Leaks can be fun, and leaks can be accurate, and sometimes they\u2019re both. But amidst the excitement of sneaking a peek at future tech, and the feeling that you might have just bested the corporate PR machine, a diet that consists solely of Twitter tips can blind us to their limitations as an information source.\r\n\n\r\nThe rise in RTX 40 leaks might actually be the most perfect example I\u2019ve seen of this because, by leakers\u2019 own admissions, most of the meaningful details on these graphics cards are in flux. They\u2019re still in development, and almost everything we as PC owners would want to know about them is subject to change. If not actively changing as we speak.\r\n\n\r\nAgain, some leakers do have decent track records, so I don\u2019t believe kopite7kimi was knowingly telling porkies about the RTX 4090 reveal taking place mid-July. But it clearly didn\u2019t, so either that information was outdated at the time, or the reveal window was only ever a possibility to begin with. Another apparent insider, wjm47196, has more recently claimed an October release date for the RTX 4090 (the AD102 mentioned is its underlying graphics processor). But again, even if that\u2019s an earnestly held belief, it could just as easily be based on outdated, incomplete or merely provisional plans.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nSometimes it\u2019s not even an issue of unconfirmed details, but of hardware or software that couldn\u2019t possibly be finalised. Performance and benchmark-based leaks are the juiciest of all, but where the RTX 40 series is concerned, they\u2019re going be running on drivers that aren\u2019t even close to being ready for launch day. So when someone says the RTX 4090 scores nearly twice as high as the RTX 3090 in 3DMark\u2019s Time Spy Extreme test, or can hit 160fps+ in Control at 4K\u2026 I mean, sounds great, but realistically it\u2019s not going to reflect the performance that PC players will see at home. So how useful are these reports, beyond the self-evident reveal that a new GPU will be faster than the old one?\r\n\n\r\nAgain, there\u2019s no evidence to suggest an intentional spread of misinformation, and my own belief is that independent tip providers are as vital a part of the gaming/tech fabric as conventional reporting. But right now, with the RTX 40 series in particular, there just aren\u2019t that many truths to tell \u2013 only maybes and probablies, waiting to coalesce into actual products.\r\n\n\r\nI get why that\u2019s frustrating, partly because leaks are the only regular source of anything to do with one of the biggest PC hardware developments of the next year. That\u2019s another issue, really: unlike with games, where hype is built but can\u2019t be acted upon until release day, there are undoubtedly people out there who are currently deciding whether to upgrade their GPU now or wait for the next Nvidia generation. Specs, performance and release date info are therefore relevant to real purchasing decisions right now, so although there\u2019s a lot of a pre-release interest in leaked data, that's all the more reason to be wary of possible inaccuracies.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nIs there anything truly compelling to come out of these early RTX 40 series leaks? Perhaps one detail, and by no means a small one: kopite7kimi, Greymon55, and wjm47196 have all reported that the RTX 4090 will launch first and separately, with the RTX 4080 and RTX 4070 following later. Greymon55 and wjm47196 have also both said that the RTX 4090 release will happen this year, with the other two cards (both based on different underlying processors) coming in 2023. It still feels like that could change, but you simply don\u2019t get matching leak smoke like this without some genuine fire.\r\n\n\r\nBeyond that, Nvidia\u2019s next RTX GPUs remain mysterious. Mystery will, of course, invite rumours, and in fairness these should become more detailed and accurate as the cards themselves are finalised. In the meantime, though, remember that a peep behind the scenes will rarely tell the whole story.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor.

So today we're going to look at what we believe to be the best value segment.\nSo far and for the past few months, our advice since has been as follows: if you can, avoid buying a high-end graphics card such as the RTX 3080 or better. We believe these are still overpriced and prices will continue to drop, particularly after next-gen GPUs land in a few months. But if you're desperate for a GPU and have waited out the crypto boom, we recommend going for something more mid-range to low-end as these products won't decline as much in terms of pricing, and their replacements are still far off in comparison.\n\nTherefore we've been recommending parts such as the Radeon RX 6600, and right now you can snap one up for less than $300. But it wouldn't be right to simply recommend the Radeon without a GeForce alternative and for that we have the GeForce RTX 3050, which comes slightly more expensive at around $330.\n\nToday we're going to see how the two compare across 51 games at 1080p and 1440p using the Ryzen 7 5800X3D and 32GB of dual-rank, dual-channel memory. Display drivers used were the Radeon Adrenalin Edition 22.6.1 and GeForce GPU Game Ready 516.59. As usual we'll go over the data for about a dozen of the games tested and then we'll take a look at all 51 games in a single graph.\nBenchmarks\nStarting with Fortnite using the medium quality preset, we see that both GPUs keep frame rates above 100 fps at 1080p and even 1440p. That said, the Radeon 6600 was up to 20% faster at 1080p, seen when looking at 1% lows, while it was 21% faster at 1440p. That's a significant performance advantage that gamers will certainly notice.\n\n\nNext we have a 2022 release in Tiny Tina's Wonderlands and wow, the performance with the RTX 3050 using the high quality preset was pretty horrible, especially relative to the Radeon RX 6600.\nPerformance at 1080p was 66% greater with the Radeon GPU and 44% stronger at 1440p where the difference will be even more noticeable. We're looking at 2 tiers of additional performance with the RX 6600, an embarrassing result for Nvidia in this title given pricing.\n\nThe RTX 3050 also gets obliterated in God of War. At 1080p the Radeon 6600 is an insane 63% faster, pushing the average frame rate up from 60 fps to 98 fps. That's more than an extra tier of GPU performance right there.\nMeanwhile, things only get worse for the 3050 at 1440p where the RTX 3050 was up to 81% faster, going from just 37 fps to a very smooth 67 fps.\n\nIt's more of the same with Forza Horizon 5, a complete demolition with the RX 6600 delivering 60% more performance at 1080p and almost 50% at 1440p. Granted, the RTX 3050 still provides perfectly playable performance using the high quality preset, but you're getting much higher performance with the Radeon GPU, meaning you can either increase visuals further, or enjoy a truly high refresh rate experience.\n\nPUBG has always been better suited to Nvidia hardware and although the Radeon 6600 still wins here, it's a very slim margin, resulting in more of a draw. The Radeon GPU was 5% faster at 1080p and 9% faster at 1440p.\n\nDying Light 2 is yet another 2022 release where the RX 6600 cans the RTX 3050, this time delivering 49% more frames at 1080p and 34% more at 1440p. Those are massive margins, particularly at 1080p where the RTX 3050 fell short of 60 fps while the Radeon 6600 averaged 79 fps.\n\nFar Cry 6 was released late last year and although this is an AMD sponsored title, performance between Radeon and GeForce GPUs is typically competitive. Yet here the RTX 3050 gets left behind, trailing by a 30% margin at 1080p and 28% at 1440p.\n\nNext we have Apex Legends and like PUBG, the results here are semi-competitive as the Radeon 6600 was just 15% faster at 1080p and 8% faster at 1440p. The 1440p margin is quite small, though 15% at 1080p is quickly becoming a significant performance difference, it's just a lot smaller than the 50%+ margins we've seen in a lot of the recently released titles.\n\nInterestingly, both GPUs max out at around 350 fps in our Counter-Strike benchmark, while the RX 6600 was 18% faster at 1440p. As you'd expect, both did deliver highly playable performance for this older and forgiving title, but when pushed a bit harder the Radeon 6600 did come out on top.\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla is known to play well with AMD hardware and this matchup is no exception. This time the Radeon RX 6600 enjoyed a 42% performance advantage at 1080p and a 33% win at 1440p. Basically, the 1% lows of the Radeon 6600 matched the average frame rate of the RTX 3050, which is an embarrassing result for the RTX 3050.\n\nDespite the fact that Watch Dogs Legion is an Nvidia sponsored title, the RTX 3050 doesn't enjoy any kind of advantage here. Rather it's another easy win for the Radeon RX 6600, delivering 41% greater performance at 1080p and 29% greater performance at 1440p.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 was tested using slightly dialed down quality settings, but even so it's still a very demanding title, and perhaps a little too demanding for the RTX 3050 which couldn't reach 60 fps at 1080p. The Radeon RX 6600 did manage to break the 60 fps barrier with a 70 fps average, making it 35% faster at 1080p, and then 27% faster at 1440p.\n\nNext we have Sniper Elite 5 and this is our first time testing this title. For these mid-range GPUs we settled for the medium quality preset which admittedly was a tad easy as the RTX 3050 managed 144 fps at 1080p. Still, it's possible to boost performance by around 30% with the RX 6600 and perhaps the 28% boost at 1440p is more relevant as that got us into high refresh rate territory.\n\nAnother new game that makes its way into our testing is Hunt: Showdown. For this test we opted for the medium quality preset. The Radeon RX 6600 was 31% faster at 1080p and 21% faster at 1440p, a handy performance advantage and that meant high refresh rate gaming was possible at 1080p.\n\nF1 2022 is another new title that of course will be replacing F1 2021 in our battery of benchmarks. Here we have more competitive data than what we've seen from the bulk of the testing. This time the Radeon RX 6600 is roughly 20% faster at both tested resolutions, a favorable margin for the Radeon GPU, but it's also less than half that of other newly released titles.\n\nIn Halo Infinite the Radeon RX 6600 is 20% faster at 1080p and close enough to the same at 1440p where we see an 18% margin. The RTX 3050 doesn't get as thrashed here, but typically we view a 20% margin at a similar price point as a devastating loss for the slower product.\n\nLast up we have Assetto Corsa Competizione a.k.a. ACC for all you racing simulator fans and this is another game that sees a ~20% margin in favor of the RX 6600 at 1080p and then 15% faster at 1440p. Using medium quality settings either GPU appears to work well enough, but the fact that you're getting some 20% more frames out of the Radeon GPU while a chunk of change does make it the obvious option.\nPerformance Summary\nThat was a devastating match up for Nvidia, but we have only looked at 17 of the 51 games tested. Let's now see how the GeForce RTX 3050 and Radeon RX 6600 stack up across all the games tested...\n\nAt 1080p, the Radeon RX 6600 was on average 29% faster across 51 games. There were just 5 titles with single-digit margins between the two GPUs, with 75% of all the games tested favoring the Radeon by a 20% margin or greater.\nInterestingly, a lot of the games where AMD crushed Nvidia are newer titles that scale well with Resizable BAR such as Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, God of War, Forza Horizon 5, Dying Light 2 and Assassin's Creed Valhalla. Overall this is a clear win for the Radeon RX 6600.\n\nThings didn't improve much for the RTX 3050 at 1440p, where the margin remained at 23% in favor of the RX 6600 on average. There were more mixed results though, for example, the RTX 3050 managed to come out on top in Metro Exodus, Doom Eternal and Warhammer III, but was utterly destroyed in God of War where it ran into some kind of performance issue. Most games favored the Radeon 6600 by 20% or more though.\nWhat We Learned: Easy Win\nClearly you would be mad not to buy the Radeon RX 6600 in this comparison. It's over 20% faster while costing at least 15% less, so there's basically no angle we could take where the RTX 3050 is worth even considering.\nIn this segment, ray tracing performance isn't worth discussing and even DLSS is a bit of a tough sell because it generally doesn't work that well at 1080p, though it can help to improve 1440p performance without noticeably diminishing image quality. FSR 2.0 is nearly as good as DLSS in terms of quality and game adoption so far is decent, although Nvidia has the clear advantage, it's not as significant in this performance tier.\n\nLooking at power consumption, there's no change from our day-one review of these GPUs, but in short, the GeForce RTX 3050 and Radeon RX 6600 use about the same amount of power. and you can comfortably power either of them with a basic 500w PSU.\nIf you've got a budget of ~$350, you could argue a more direct competitor for the RTX 3050 in terms of pricing would be the RX 6600 XT, which can be had for around $360. The 6600 XT is ~15% faster than the vanilla 6600 tested today, so in our opinion it's not worth spending almost 30% more on that GPU, which is why we opted for the 6600. But when compared to the RTX 3050, the 6600 XT would be about 10% more expensive for about 40% more performance, so it's obviously still a far better deal.\n\nAs disappointed as we initially were with the Radeon RX 6600's performance at $330 at launch, in the current climate it's managed to shape up as one of the best deals going around, now selling below that MSRP. The RTX 3050, on the other hand, promised gamers an end to crazy high prices by offering decent performance at the $250 price point, but ultimately that never came to fruition.\nWith next-gen GPUs right around the corner and the promise of significant performance gains, now is not the time to spend big on old technology. However for a more humble budget, the Radeon RX 6600 will let you enjoy PC gaming and wait to see what the next generation has in store.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nAMD Radeon RX 6600 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3050 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6600 XT on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6700 XT on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 44\n\n\n Got something to say?

Several recent Linux kernel series haven't even seen any Nouveau DRM/KMS driver pull requests with changes. For the upcoming Linux 5.20 cycle, a Nouveau set of changes were sent in today to DRM-Next but it's quite tiny.\r The state of the Nouveau open-source driver stack remains rather sad. While there has been some work on Ampere GPU acceleration now that the firmware binaries are out, it's still in the early stages. Over in Mesa space, there is early work towards Vulkan support but the Gallium3D code with OpenGL is their primary focus but still seeing seldom changes. There's also been the Gallium3D OpenCL work by Red Hat too for Nouveau but still not anything robust for end-users at this time. Most problematic is the \"best\" Nouveau support remains with the aging GeForce GTX 600/700 \"Kepler\" (and GTX 750 \"Maxwell1\") series due to not requiring any signed firmware images and there having re-clocking support available. The re-clocking support allows for operating the graphics cards at their rated frequencies rather than being limited to the low clock frequencies programmed at boot time. Even there though that re-clocking still needs to be carried out manually by the user.\rThe nearly ten year old GeForce GTX 780 Ti remains basically the top-end graphics card for Nouveau open-source usage at this time. For lacking re-clocking with the GeForce GTX 900 series and later and the mess around the binary firmware files, Nouveau remains an unfortunate mess for the more recent generations of NVIDIA GPUs. Now with Linux 5.20, David Airlie stepped up today to queue up some changes worked on by Ben Skeggs -- both engineers from Red Hat. These changes though amount to some basic fixes and code improvements.\r Airlie wrote with today's pull request for DRM-Next, \"This is a set of misc nouveau patches skeggsb left queued up, just flushing some of them out.\"\r So nothing to get excited about but at least there is some changes for Nouveau with Linux 5.20.\r Meanwhile on NVIDIA's open GPU kernel driver front, there is nothing new to report at this point. The code would need to be significantly reworked/written before being mainlined among other obstacles in the way. Nothing there is happening for Linux 5.20 but would be a much longer-term effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17 Comments \n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\nRelated News\nNouveau On NVIDIA Turing GPUs & Newer Will Now Prefer NVK+Zink For OpenGLKarol Herbst Steps Down As Nouveau Maintainer Due To Linux Kernel's Toxic Environment\"NOVA-Core\" Patches Propose Building New NVIDIA Driver Piece-By-Piece In The Linux KernelMesa NVK Vulkan Driver Adds VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate SupportNouveau With NVK Vulkan Driver Running More Games, Increasing Feature SetMore NVK Driver Improvements Merged For Mesa 24.3\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

In particular, we\u2019re finding a massive swing to edge inferencing. NVIDIA is a big part of this push, wanting to drive adoption of their GPUs outside the data center.

In particular, we\u2019re finding a massive swing to edge inferencing. NVIDIA is a big part of this push, wanting to drive adoption of their GPUs outside the data center. Still, the fact is that enterprises need to make more decisions more quickly, so AI infrastructure needs to get closer to the data.\n\nRemember Hub-and-Spoke?\nIn the \u201cold days,\u201d we talked about the edge in terms of data creation and how to get that data back to the data center quickly and efficiently by employing the traditional hub-and-spoke methodology. That design gave way to the hierarchical design, based on core, access, and distribution with lots of redundancy and hardware and the sole purpose of getting data back to the primary data center. All that data collected at the edge just to be transported back to the main data center for processing and then pushed back to the edge devices proved inefficient, costly, and time-consuming.\nSo maybe that hub-and-spoke design wasn\u2019t so bad after all. With the push to deliver more intelligence at the edge with AI and the disruption of cloud computing, it appears that design is significantly impacting network design, edge deployments, and where data is being processed. In fact, this year\u2019s HPE Discover conference had a tagline that would have been very familiar in any year prior to the cloud craze if you just swapped core for cloud, \u201cThe Edge-to-Cloud Conference.\u201d\nJumping on the Edge Momentum\nHPE wasn\u2019t the only vendor to realize the importance of edge-to-cloud computing for the industry, with Dell Technologies delivering a similar story during the Dell Technologies World event. IBM, Lenovo, NetApp, and Supermicro have also been vocal on the need to do more at the edge while utilizing cloud resources more effectively.\nWhat is driving the laser focus of edge computing? Customers are generating volumes of data at the edge collected from sensors, IoT devices, and Autonomous Vehicle data collections. Proximity to data at the source will deliver business benefits, including faster insights with accurate predictions and faster response times with better bandwidth utilization. AI inferencing at the edge (actionable intelligence using AI techniques)\u00a0improves performance, reduces time (inference time), and reduces the dependency on network connectivity, ultimately improving the business bottom line.\nWhy Not Do Edge Inferencing in the Cloud?\nWhy can\u2019t edge inferencing be done in the cloud? It can, and for applications that are not time-sensitive and deemed non-critical, then cloud AI inferencing might be the solution. Real-time inferencing, though, has a lot of technical challenges, latency being primary among them. Further, with the continued growth of IoT devices and associated applications requiring processing at the edge, it may not be feasible to have a high-speed cloud connection available to all devices.\nEdge computing brings its own challenges that include on-site support, physical and application security, and limited space leading to limited storage. Today\u2019s edge servers deliver adequate computational power for traditional edge workloads, with GPUs adding more power without more complexity.\nGrowth of Edge Options\nInterestingly, the smaller systems providers have primarily dominated the edge infrastructure market. Supermicro, for instance, has been talking 5G and data centers on telephone poles for years, and Advantech and many other specialty server providers have been doing the same. But as the GPUs have improved and, more importantly, the software to support them, the entire notion of AI at the edge is becoming more real.\n\nWe\u2019ve recently seen this transition in our lab in a few different ways. First, new server designs bring NVIDIA\u2019s single slot, low-power GPUs like the A2 and the ever-popular T4. Recently both Lenovo and Supermicro have sent us servers to evaluate that have integrated these GPUs, and the performance has been impressive.\nSuperMicro IoT SuperServer SYS-210SE-31A with NVIDIA T4\nSecondly, there\u2019s a significant emphasis by infrastructure providers to deliver edge solutions with metrics tied directly to data center staples like low latency and security. We recently looked at some of these use cases with the Dell PowerVault ME5. Although\u00a0pitched as an SMB storage solution, the ME5 generates a lot of interest for edge use cases due to its cost/performance ratio.\nUltimately though, the edge inferencing story is pretty simple. It comes down to the GPU\u2019s ability to process data, often on the fly. We\u2019ve been working on expanding our testing to get a better idea of how these new servers and GPUs can work for the edge inferencing role. Specifically, we\u2019ve looked at popular edge workloads like image recognition and natural language processing models.\n\nTesting Background\nWe are working with the MLPerf Inference: Edge benchmark suite. This set of tools compares inference performance for popular DL models in various real-world edge scenarios. In our testing, we have numbers for the ResNet50 image classification model and the BERT-Large NLP model for Question-Answering tasks. Both are run in Offline and SingleStream configurations.\nThe Offline scenario evaluates inference performance in a \u201cbatch mode,\u201d when all the testing data is immediately available, and latency is not a consideration. In this task, the inference script can process testing data in any order, and the goal is to maximize the number of queries per second (QPS=throughput). The higher the QPS number, the better.\nThe Single Stream config, in contrast, processes one testing sample at a time. Once inference is performed on a single input (in the ResNet50 case, the input is a single image), the latency is measured, and the next sample is made available to the inference tool. The goal is to minimize latency for processing each query; the lower the latency, the better. The query stream\u2019s 90th percentile latency is captured as the target metric for brevity.\nThe image below is from an NVIDIA blog post about MLPerf inference 0.5, which visualizes the scenarios very well. You can read more about the various scenarios in the original MLPerf Inference paper here.\n\nEdge Inferencing \u2013 Lenovo ThinkEdge SE450\nAfter reviewing the ThinkEdge SE450, we worked with Lenovo to run MLPerf on the NVIDIA A2 and T4 in the system. The goal was to get an idea of what the SE450 could do with just a single GPU. It should be noted the system can support up to four of the low-power NVIDIA GPUs, and it\u2019s logical to take these numbers and extrapolate them out to the number of desired cards.\n\nFor this testing, we worked directly with Lenovo, testing the various configurations in our lab with both the NVIDIA A2 and T4. With MLPerf, vendors have a specific test harness that\u2019s been tuned for their particular platform. We used Lenovo\u2019s test harness for this edge inferencing benchmarking to get an idea of where these popular GPUs come out.\nThe results from the tests for the A2 and T4 in the SE450 in our lab:\n\n\n\nBenchmark\nNVIDIA A2 (40-60W TDP)\nNVIDIA T4 (70W TDP)\n\n\nResNet50 SingleStream\n0.714ms latency\n0.867 latency\n\n\nResNet50 Offline\n3,032.18 samples/s\n5,576.01 samples/s\n\n\nBERT SingleStream\n8.986ms latency\n8.527ms latency\n\n\nBERT Offline\n244.213 samples/s\n392.285 samples/s\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the NVIDIA T4 did really well throughout, which is surprising to some based solely on its age. The T4\u2019s performance profile is a pretty apparent reason why the T4 is still wildly popular. That said, the A2 has a meaningful latency advantage over the T4 in real-time image inferencing.\nUltimately the decision on GPU is tuned for the specific task at hand. The older NVIDIA T4 consumes more power (70W) and uses a PCIe Gen3 x16 slot while the newer A2 is designed to operate on less power (40-60W) and uses a PCIe Gen4 x8 slot. As organizations better grasp what they\u2019re asking from their infrastructure at the edge, the results will be more meaningful, and edge inferencing projects will be more likely to succeed.\nFinal Thoughts\nVendors are racing to develop smaller, faster, more rugged servers for the edge market. Organizations from retail to factories to healthcare are clamoring to gain quicker insights into the data collected at the source. Improving inference time, reducing latency, with options to improve performance, and utilizing emerging technology will quickly separate the winners and losers.\n\nThe edge market is not standing still as organizations find new ways to utilize the insights gathered from the ever-expanding number of IoT devices. Our team sees a major opportunity for those that can move quickly in their respective industries to take advantage of AI at the edge, which includes this edge inferencing use case.\nWe expect the prominent IT infrastructure players to respond with innovative solutions for this specific use case over the next year. Also, and maybe more importantly, we expect to see many advancements in software to help democratize the use of GPUs in these edge use cases. For this technology to be transformative, it must be easier to deploy than it is today. Given the work we\u2019re seeing not just from NVIDIA but from software companies like Vantiq, Viso.ai, and many others, we are optimistic that more organizations can bring this technology to life.\nEngage with StorageReview\nNewsletter\u00a0|\u00a0YouTube\u00a0| Podcast\u00a0iTunes/Spotify\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \nFacebookTwitterPinterestEmail \n\n\n\n \n\nBrian Beeler\nBrian is located in Cincinnati, Ohio and is the chief analyst and President of StorageReview.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprevious post\n\n\n\nLenovo ThinkSystem SR630 V2 Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext post\n\n\n\nStarWind SAN & NAS over Fibre Channel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRUSTED VENDORS\nProducts and solutions from our affiliate partners:\n\n\n\n\n        Ubiquiti\n      \n\n\n\n\n        Newegg\n      \n\n\n\n Amazon\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletterSubscribe to the StorageReview newsletter to stay up to date on the latest news and reviews.

Probably, though, the metaverse will creep up on us like the Web did, so that \"it almost happened when you didn't know it.\" Tiernan Ray for ZDNetWhen it was first introduced by Meta's Mark Zuckerberg last fall, there was skepticism in some corners about the metaverse, the systems of avatars and virtual worlds that Zuckerberg is building and which he says will be the next version of the internet.\u00a0Richard Kerris, who runs a team of a hundred people at chip giant Nvidia who work on building technology for the metaverse, known as Omniverse (more here), is not at all skeptical about that future world.\u00a0He is skeptical about one thing, though.\u00a0\"The only thing I'm skeptical about is how people tend to talk about it,\" Kerris told ZDNet, on a recent trip through New York City to meet with developers.\"People are misinterpreting metaverse as a destination, a virtual world, a this or that,\" Kerris observed. \"The Metaverse is not a place, it's the network for the next version of the Web.\"Just replace the word metaverse with the word network, it'll start to sink in.\"The network, in the sense that Kerris uses it, is a kind of sinewy technology that will bind together rich media on many websites, especially 3D content.\u00a0Also: At CES 2022, Nvidia sets the stage for AI everywhere\"In much the same way the Web unified so many things [\u2026] the next generation of that Web, the core underlying principles of that will be 3D, and with that comes the challenge of making that ubiquitous between virtual worlds.\"The end result would be, in much the same way you can go from any device to any website without having to load something in \u2014 remember the old days --\u00a0What browser do you have? What extension?, etc. \u2014 all that went away with HTML being ratified. When we can do that with 3D, it's going to be transformative.\"No surprise being from Nvidia, which sells the vast majority of graphics chips (GPUs) to render 3D, Kerris made the point that, \"We live in a 3D world; we think in 3D,\" but the Web is a 2D reality. \"It's limited,\" he said, with islands of 3D rendering capabilities that never interconnect.Also: Nvidia expands Omniverse with a new GPU, new collaborations\"The consistency of the connected worlds is what is the magic that's taking place,\" he said. \"I can teleport from one world to another, and I don't have to describe it each time that I build it.\"The analog to HTML for this new 3D ecosystem is something called USD, universal scene description. As ZDNet's Stephanie Condon has written, USD is an interchange framework invented by Pixar in 2012, which was released as open-source software in 2016, providing a common language for defining, packaging, assembling, and editing 3D data.\u00a0(Kerris, an Apple veteran, has something of a spiritual if not actual tie to Pixar, having worked at LucasFilm for several years in the early noughts. See more in his LinkedIn profile.)\u00a0USD is capable of describing numerous things in a 3D environment, from lighting to the physics behavior of falling objects.\u00a0In practice, Kerris imagines the Omniverse-enabled, USD-defined metaverse as a road trip where people hop from one 3D world to the next as effortlessly as browsing traditional sites. \"I can go from a virtual factory to a virtual resort to a virtual conference room to a virtual design center, to whatever,\" said Kerris.Also: Nvidia's new Omniverse tools will make it easier than ever to build virtual worldsWithin those environments, 3D rendering will allow people to move past the cumbersome sneakernet of file sharing. \"And it allows a lot more capability in what I do,\" he said, offering the example of product designers.\u00a0\"With metaverse, and ubiquitous plumbing for 3D, we'll be in that 3D environment at the same time, and rather than sharing a Web page, we can move around. You can look at something on this side of the product. I can be looking at something else, but it's like we're in the same room at the same time.\"Nvidia, said Kerris, started down the path on USD six or seven years ago \"because we simulate everything we build [at Nvidia] before we build it in the physical world,\" he said. Nvidia has peers in industry working on realizing technology, including Ericsson, which wants to simulate antennae. \"They all want a reality simulation,\" he said of companies in the USD fold.\u00a0Using the technology, said Kerris, one can go much deeper into the realm of digital twins, simulations of products and structures that allow for intervention, experimentation, and observation.\"Until the advent of consistent plumbing, it was done in a representative mode,\" he said, such as an illustration of a building in Autodesk. \"It wasn't true to reality. I couldn't show you exactly how it would be in a windstorm,\" which isn't good because, as he put it, \"I want to be damn straight about stuff I'm building in the physical world.\"The \"core base of a situation that's true to reality,\" using USD, will allow designers to more accurately simulate, backward and forward, including things such as tensile strength.\u00a0\"I'd love to have a house that's structurally sound before I design the marble finish,\" he observed. \"If I'm building a digital twin of a house I'm building, it's layers of stuff on there, things for structural engineers, and polish that others are going to come in and finish.\" The important thing is knowing it's \"true to reality\" for materials and things holding the structure together, he said.By making possible those richer interactions in 3D, Kerris said, \"In the same way that the Web transformed businesses, and experiences, and communication, so will the metaverse do that, and in a more familiar environment, because we all work in 3D.\"Different companies are contributing to USD in different ways. For example, Nvidia has worked with Apple to define what's called rigid body dynamics.\u00a0\"And there's more to come,\" he said.Nvidia has been developing the Omniverse tools as a \"platform,\" what Kerris calls \"the operating system for the metaverse.\"\"People can plug into it. They can build on top of it. They can connect to it. They can customize it \u2014 it's really at their disposal, much the same way an operating system is today.\"The USD standard has come \"quite far\" in terms of adoption, Kerris said, with most 3D companies using it. \"Every company in entertainment has a USD strategy today,\" he observed. \"The CAD [computer-aided design] and mechanical engineering, it's coming. They either have plans or they are participating in helping to define what's necessary.\"\"HTML was the same way in early days,\" he said. It lacked support for video in early days, with third-party plugins such as Adobe Flash dominating before standards evolved.Will digital twins ignite the world's imagination about the metaverse? It seems somewhat too industrial-focused, ZDNet observed.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ordinary people will gain interest as they realize it is connectedness, not a single destination. \"As they realize it's the next generation of the Web, I can visit a remote location without the need of a headset, or [without] installing specific browsers. That's one aspect,\" Kerris said. \"In their everyday life, as we share photos today, you'll be able to share objects. You know, your kid comes home, and they made something and they'll be able to share it with the grandparents.\"\"It'll just become part of what you do, whether you're buying a piece of furniture for your house and you'll go into your phone. You'll sync with the home. You'll drop the furniture in. You'll walk around it \u2014 that's the thing people will take for granted, but it's the seamless connection.\"\u00a0The same for designing one's custom car finish, he offered. \"You'll actually be connected to the factory making that car\" to check out all the aspects of it.\u00a0\"It's going to change everything,\" he said.\u00a0There will be multiplier effects, said Kerris, as digital twins allow for trialing multiple scenarios, such as with training robots.\u00a0\"Today, they would plug a computer into that robot, and input it with information\" to train the robot in one physical space, he said. In a digital twin environment, with a robot in the simulated room, \"You can train not only one robot but hundreds,\" using \"hundreds of scenarios the robot could encounter.\"\"Now, that robot is going to be thousands of times smarter than it would have been if you'd only trained it one time.\" Nvidia has, in fact, been pursuing that particular approach for many years by doing autonomous driving training of machine learning in simulated road environments.Although autonomous driving hasn't reached its promised development, Kerris believes the approach is still sound. \"I can build a digital twin of Palo Alto,\" the Silicon Valley town. \"And I can have thousands of cars in that simulation, driving around, and I can use AI to apply every kind of simulation I can think of \u2014 a windstorm, a kid running out, chasing a ball, an oil slick, a dog \u2014 so that these cars in simulation are learning many thousands of times more scenarios than a physical car would.\"Nvidia has been doing work, combining the simulated trials with real-world driving with car maker Mercedes for Level 5 autonomous driving, the most demanding level.\u00a0\"The efficiency is pretty amazing,\" he said, meaning, how well the autonomous software handles the road scenarios. \"By using synthetic data to train these cars, you have a higher degree of efficiency\" when combining scenarios.\"I would much rather trust myself riding in a car trained in a simulated environment than [in] one trained in a physical environment.\" There still will be a role for the real-world data that comes from cars on the road.\u00a0As for the time frame for the vision, Kerris noted that \"we are seeing it already in warehouses,\" which are rapidly adopting the robot-training regime. That includes Amazon, where a developer downloaded Omniverse and evangelized it within Amazon. The enterprise version of Omniverse, which is a subscription-based product, was taken up by Amazon for more extensive robot training.Amazon currently is in production with the software for its pick-and-place robots.\u00a0\"The beauty is they discovered by using synthetic data generation they were able to be more efficient with stuff rather than just rely on the camera\" on the robot for object detection. Those cameras often would get tripped up by reflective packing tape on packages, Kerris said. Using synthetic Omniverse-generated data got around that limitation. That's one example of being more efficient in robotics, he said.Consumers will probably feel the effects of such simulations in the results.\"There are a hundred thousand warehouses on the planet,\" Kerris said. \"They are all looking at using robotics to be safer, more efficient, and to better utilize the space.\" People \"may not be aware that's taking place, but they'll reap the benefits of it.\"In some situations, consumers will \"know, because they're getting things a lot faster than in past,\" he said. \"Behind the curtain, things will be much more efficient than they were six months ago.\" The same goes for retailers such as Kroger, which is using Omniverse tools to generate synthetic data to plan how to get produce to consumers faster.\u00a0As for self-driving cars, \"The presumption that all these cars will be autonomous today, it's a bit \u2014 it's not there yet,\" he conceded. \"But will we have autonomous taxis, and things that will take us form here to there? Oh, yeah, that's easy.\"\u00a0But, \"For a car that drives up to you and it will drive you to New Jersey autonomously? We have a little ways to go.\"As for direct consumer experiences, \"People will start to see the ability to experience locations,\" Kerris said. Leisure industry executives are interested, for example, in how to showroom a hotel room to consumers in advance of a trip in a way better than photos. \"I'm going to allow you to teleport into the room, experience it, so your decision will be based on an immersive experience. Look at the window, see what my view is going to be,\" Kerris said.\u00a0The impact on education \"is going to be huge,\" Kerris said. Today, physical location means some inner-city schools might not experience lavish field trips. \"An inner-city school is not exactly going to have a field trip to do a safari in Africa,\" he mused. \"I think that virtual worlds [that] are seamlessly connected can bring new opportunities by allowing everybody to have the same experience no matter what school they're in.\"\u00a0An avatar of researcher such as Jane Goodall could \"inspire learning,\" he suggested. \"Think about what that does for a student.\"While emphasizing 3D, Kerris is not pushing virtual reality or augmented reality, the two technologies people tend to focus on. Those things are part of the picture, but 3D doesn't have to be with a headset on, he asserted.For one thing, today's VR tools, such as VR videos on YouTube that use conventional VR headsets, have been quite limited, Kerris said. \"It's not seamless; it's not easy; it's not like a website,\" he observed.   In addition to stints at Apple, Amazon, and LucasFilm, Kerris briefly ran marketing for headset developer Avegant. Those headsets were not VR. They were made to be private, immersive movie screens attached to your face using Texas Instruments DLP projection chips. The quality of the product, Kerris reflected, \"was phenomenal,\" but it was too expensive to make, costing $800 at retail. And the fact that a laser would project onto the retina \"scared everyone,\" he said. (Avegante is still in business, developing a technology called liquid crystal-on-silicon.)What needs to happen is for today's disparate virtual environments to receive that sinewy tissue of USD and related technology. \"They're all disconnected,\" said Kerris of today's proto-metaverse, such as Oculus Rift. \"If they were just simple websites, where you could bop around and go experience it, the opportunity would be much greater.\"\u00a0Rather than having to have an Oculus headset, \"If I could experience it with this being a window into that world,\" he said, holding up his smartphone, \"chances are a lot higher I would go check it out.\"Will USD make that happen?  \"Yes.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has silently confirmed the release of a new RTX 3050 variant today, but it's a slower model aimed at the OEM market only. This variant comes with a slight reduction in core clocks and CUDA cores. But all its other core specifications, including the memory configuration and TDP, remain the same.Unfortunately, Nvidia has not stated why this new model was created, which is barely any different from the standard model. The neutered version comes with an 11% reduction in CUDA core counts from 2560 to 2304 (20 SMs to 19 SMs) and around a 2% reduction in core clocks.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)In real-world use, the performance degradation between the two cards shouldn't be noticeable at all with such a minor deviation in core count and especially clock speeds \u2013 if anything. Furthermore, Nvidia's GPU Boost 4.0 algorithm should be able to boost clocks even higher than the standard variant due to power consumption remaining the same between the two models.Presumably, Nvidia has disabled some cores to increase yields from slightly defective GA106 dies manufactured at the factory. This is the only logical explanation we have right now, but it makes a lot of sense.This isn't the first time Nvidia has pulled this maneuver on the GPU market. Over the past few generations, we've seen several GPU models featuring two to four different versions to optimize manufacturing efficiency. The most notable examples of this are the RTX 3080 12GB and GTX 1060 3GB, which featured more or fewer CUDA cores than their vanilla counterparts.Nvidia also released OEM-exclusive models of graphics cards in the past, but it hasn't done so in a very long time. But unlike OEM models of the past, this new 3050 model lacks any OEM branding and shares the same naming scheme as the vanilla RTX 3050 8GB.This could be problematic for customers choosing gaming PCs from OEMs and customers looking at graphics cards on the used market. Without a proper distinction between the two 3050 models, customers won't be able to know which GPU they are buying until they purchase the machine and fire up GPU-Z on the system. Hopefully, this potential issue doesn't become a reality.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Pricing and availability are unknown, and since this neutered 3050 is OEM exclusive, it's doubtful it has an MSRP of any sort. But since Nvidia has released the specs of the new GPU on its main website, it should already be in the hands of Nvidia's many OEM partners. So expect new machines to be updated with the new 3050 at any time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nCUDA\nrtx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (7)\n\n\n\nAaron KlotzSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAaron Klotz is a contributing writer for Tom\u2019s Hardware, covering news related to computer hardware such as CPUs, and graphics cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about gpus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI Afterburner update enables RTX 50 series owners to push their GDDR7 VRAM up to 36 GT/s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD manager reports 45% GPU retail market share in Japan \u2014 Eyes 70% as the next target\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreeware image editor GIMP 3.0 arrives after seven years of incubation\n\n\n\nSee more latest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Comments\n\nComment from the forums\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKing_V\n\n\nOh for crap's sake, Nvidia . . when you do this, GIVE IT A DIFFERENT MODEL NUMBER!\n\nOr at least call it a (whatever model) LE or LT or something.\n\nAlso looking at you AMD, but at least you haven't pulled this crap since the RX 550 and RX 560 variants, unless I've forgotten something.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvalidError\n\n\nThe original RTX3050 was already a 30+% cut down GA106, I find it unlikely there are specimens so badly defective that they need one extra SM cut out to make the grade.\n\nIt would make more sense if this was the cost-optimized RTX3050 based on GA107, likely to be followed by a Ti variant with all 20 GA107 SMs available.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiroro\n\n\nHow hard is it to just add an extra letter or 2 to the name of the product?\nOr if this is just about cost-cutting, then why not make it an RTX 3050 4GB? The 3050 can't play 4k games, so it has no need for the VRAM needed to support 4k \"ultra\" textures.\n4096x4096 textures take 4x the VRAM of 2048x2048 textures, even though the difference is unviewable on a 1920x1080 monitor. Even the situations where 2048x2048 has a resolvable difference to 1024x1024 is limited to when a single texture is covering over half the screen, but how often does that actually happen in games when there's usually dozens, if not hundreds of textured objects on screen at once? New games might be coming out with huge, impractical textures, but what does it matter in FHD gaming when they exceed the resolution of the display? Am I completely off base with how pixels work?\nIf people are unhappy that they can only play a game at medium then, like, just do the TV thing and rename the Texture settings to resolutions or something like \"HD, FHD, QHD, UHD\", etc.\n\nI get that the 8GB selling point can help move a product off the shelf compared to a less expensive/better performing RTX 2060 6GB, but since when did OEMs bother advertising how much VRAM is in their low-end gaming systems?\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvalidError\n\n\nGiroro said:Am I completely off base with how pixels work?4k gaming and 4k textures are two different and only loosely related things. I've done some 4k gaming on a GTX1050, works great in older games like Portal 2, though not quite there for 4k PS2 emulation. I don't remember trying N64 emulation since getting a 4k TV, might be worth a look.\n\nRegardless, most games will readily blow through 4GB of VRAM with anything lowest everything when available, so 4GB definitely isn't viable for anything pitched to actual gamers who want to be able to play stuff at some reasonable approximation of how they are meant to look instead of rock-bottom details to squeeze everything within 4GB.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKing_V\n\n\nInvalidError said:4k gaming and 4k textures are two different and only loosely related things.

Wilson \u2022\nJul 21, 2022 at 10:50am EDT\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3060M Mobility GPU has been repurposed into a desktop-grade graphics card for the PC market. This is one of the many mobility Ampere GPUs that was designed for an entirely different market segment but due to GPU shortages earlier this year, it had been fused within a desktop graphics card and now we have the first tests.\nTested: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060M Mobility GPU In A Desktop Graphics Card?\nReaders may remember during the graphics card shortage when the situation with obtaining components to create graphics cards was difficult, and prices were insanely high due to not enough stock on the shelves. Some Chinese OEMs looked at utilizing laptop GPUs as a replacement for desktop graphics cards. When the GPU shortage hit the hardest, Chinese OEMs came up with the idea to sell laptop GPUs as desktop models. One such graphics card was recently reviewed by the YouTube channel BullsLab Jay, showing the performance of a variant NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060M.\nRelated Story Worldwide GPU Shipments Saw A 4.4% Quarter-Over-Quarter Increase; Data Center GPUs Saw A Bigger GrowthAs stated above, this unique graphics card is a laptop-based GPU in a desktop graphics card. There is only 6 GB of GDDR6 memory available instead of the typical 12 GB we would see on the GeForce RTX 3060. Interestingly, the CUDA core count is upgraded from a desktop variant's core count of 3584 cores to 3840 CUDA cores. The TDP on the mobile-based desktop GPU is 115W, whereas the full desktop variant would demand 170W. During the review, the review sample used by BullLab Jay is locked at 80W. Surprisingly, the card performs like a desktop graphics card and is much better than the 105W laptop series.\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060M laptop graphics chip and the graphics card that uses a laptop GPU for the desktop card share the same name, the GN20-E3.\n\nThe hybrid desktop NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060M graphics card was not built for gaming but crypto mining. The reason is the lack of an LHR limitation but still offering close to the exact memory specifications for Ethereum mining. But now that mining is pretty much useless on these cards, they are entering the used market segment.\n\nThese hybrid NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series cards are a Frankenstein monster of graphics cards, so there are no drivers created by the company manufacturing the GPUs, meaning they require custom drivers. The specific driver, the 512.12 release, is incredibly older. Due to NVIDIA's lack of official support, it is speculated that the cards were manufactured illegally. Confusingly, NVIDIA appears not to show any interest in stopping the sale of any of these cards, which have a reasonably great demand on Chinese retailer websites.\nThe video is interesting because it allows the public to see how these hybrid cards performed. It is too bad that the cards never made it outside China's marketplace, as they could have assisted with the crisis, even just a little. But it's a good thing that GPU shortages are over. There was also the RTX 3070M graphics card which we talked about a few months ago here.\nIn the review, BullLab Jay shows that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060M desktop graphics card is identical to its laptop variant, even with the variation between TDP levels. Clock speeds are higher, between 100 to 300 MHz, and are dependent on the processes happening in the system at the moment. The desktop GPU offers excellent heat dissipation and ideal cooling that dwarfs laptop versions.\nAs for gaming performance, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060M graphics card actually managed to offer better performance than the desktop variant. This is due to the fact that it offers a higher core count.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nBelow are 3DMark scores tabulated from the review:\n\nThese hybrid NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards are not recommended for regular use with a lack of official support and possibly questionable warranty situations. But, it is interesting to see a laptop GPU in a desktop card, reminiscent of DIY projects found on the Internet.\nNews Sources: BullsLab Jay, VideoCardz\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Custom Model Reportedly Suffers From High VRAM Temperatures; Memory Can Hit Over 90\u00b0C\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Might Face More China GPU Export Controls From Trump Admin \u2013 Report\n\nRamish Zafar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS Readies AMD Krackan Point, Raptor Lake Refresh, And Lunar Lake-Based Laptops, Listed At An Australian Retailer\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s AIB Market Share Grows To 90% As Total GPU Shipments Declined By 14.5% In Q3 2024\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n153\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n87\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n75\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Oh yeah? Me too. Unfortunately, on my Chromecast with Google TV, I find myself constantly pressing the up and down volume buttons as I watch something. Sadly, this has become second nature for most of us, and we do it without thinking, but Nvidia has a solution for this.\nIn the Nvidia Shield Experience update 9.1, a new \u2018night listening\u2019 mode will lessen the volume on those loud noises like explosions and such (via HDMI only) while increasing the volume of dialogue and other quiet things dynamically. I feel like this should have been a thing decades ago, but it is what it is.\nXremove ads\n\n\nAdditionally, Shield TV will now automatically switch your television to low-latency \u201cgame mode\u201d while you\u2019re playing a game or doing a video call. Once you\u2019re watching content again, game mode will toggle off. Previously, you would have had to manually switch this on and off.\nOther features come with 9.1 as well (and a ton of bug fixes too!). See below for a full list from the company\u2019s blog post.\nFeatured Videos\n \n\nXremove ads\n\n\nAdds support to automatically enable game mode on supported TVs (ALLM)Adds night listening mode (HDMI audio only)Adds option specify network workgroup when connecting to SHIELD over local networkAdds option to create your own password when connecting to SHIELD over localnetwork[SHIELD Pro 2019] Adds AI upscaling support for 60Hz HDR10 video[SHIELD Remote 2019] Adds option to only wake SHIELD with power or NETFLIX button[Game Controllers] Adds option to only wake SHIELD with logo buttonAdds option to match uncompressed audio with Dolby reference volume levelsAdds option to disable displaying HDR/Dolby Vision contentAdds notification when app uses microphone\nLastly, the YouTube TV app just received 5.1 surround sound for more immersive audio and the Disney+ app just got IMAX enhanced viewing, giving you an expanded aspect ratio, allowing you to view 26% more of the original image on screen. \n\nJoin Chrome Unboxed Plus\nIntroducing Chrome Unboxed Plus \u2013 our revamped membership community.

Become an Insider\n                    and start reading now.\nHave an account? Log in.\n\n\n\n\nEver wonder how much Nvidia pays engineers or developers? We analyzed dozens of salaries.\nNvidia discloses salary data in visa applications it submits to the US Department of Labor.\nMost engineering salaries were between $100,000 and $200,000, with some software developer salaries as low as $90,750.\n\n\nNvidia had a rocky start to 2022. Its stock has dropped nearly 50% since the start of the year, and in February, its $40 billion bid to acquire SoftBank-owned Arm fell through. Still, the company reported in its first-quarter earnings that it increased revenue in both its data center and gaming divisions by nearly 50%.\nAlthough Nvidia does not share how much it pays employees, it is required to disclose salary offers in work-visa applications submitted to the US Department of Labor's Office of Foreign Labor Certification. Insider combed data from the office, which authorizes hiring non-US employees, then publicly releases the data.\u00a0\n\n\nThe data does not include stock grants that can significantly increase total compensation, and only includes positions that Nvidia submitted visa applications for in the first quarter of 2022. That said, companies are required to disclose base salaries for jobs it offers foreign workers, and those salaries have to be the same as what it would offer a US employee, making the data a valuable guide for a variety of Nvidia positions. Insider dug through the dozens of disclosed salaries that represent engineers, managers, and more.\nThe majority of the analyzed salaries, from the first quarter of 2022, represent workers in California and Texas. The highest salary offer was for a distinguished engineer in California, at $320,000, while the lowest was for a Level II system design engineer in Oregon, who was offered $82,888.\nHere's a breakdown of what Nvidia pays many other employees. The broad categories are taken from filings by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification. Roles are listed below only if there are at least three candidates.\n\n\nWhen you are done checking out the data below, take a look at Insider's Big Tech salary database to see how much Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, and other companies pay their workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nResearch scientists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Marco VDM/Getty Images\n                                           \n\nComputer and Information Research ScientistsResearch scientist (4 applicants): $135,845 to $170,893\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEngineers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Monty Rakusen/Getty Images\n                                           \n\nElectronics Engineers, Except ComputerArchitect, electronics (4): $124,176 to $172,245Hardware engineer, electronics (26): $100,214 to $172,245Senior architect (7): $136,962 to $188,000Verification engineer (4): $104,957 to $148,221\nSales EngineersSolutions architect (3): $128,814 to $171,350\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSoftware developers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Ngampol Thongsai/EyeEm/Getty Images\n                                           \n\nSoftware Developers, ApplicationsSoftware engineer (3): $130,894 to $184,080\nSoftware Developers, Systems SoftwareSoftware engineer (37): $90,750 to $224,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Tech\n\n\nSalaries\n\n\nVisa\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n      subscribers.

However, with version 2.0 of AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution having just come out and Apple recently unveiling its MetalFX upscaling algorithm, team green is going to have to work hard to stay on top of the game. Fortunately, it seems to be doing quite well for itself, as the company announced that hundreds of games and apps now support the AI-driven technology. \nIn a recent post on the Nvidia website, DLSS is said to be available for all \"major game engines,\" with the software now supporting 200 titles and applications. A quick look on the PC Gaming Wiki shows the sheer number of games that come with upscaling. While version 1.0 only has a few games on the list, including some well-known titles like Battlefield 5 and Metro Exodus, there are so many popular games that feature DLSS 2.0 and even some that support later versions, such as Call of Duty: Warzone's 2.3.4 support.\nRELATED: AMD FSR 2.0 Upscaling Now Available for Xbox One and Xbox Series Devs\nIn the past, Nvidia has said it wanted to bring DLSS to more games, and this shows that, a year and a half later, this has come to fruition. Of course, it's unlikely to end there. The upcoming Lord of the Rings: Gollum will be launching with DLSS and ray tracing, as will the September launch of Steelrising. Essentially, there's going to be a lot more titles that will likely be utilizing Nvidia's tech. Upscaling is pretty much the standard these days, aiming to improve visuals with less work for a system's hardware. Many games now get updated with it after release, and the list is growing all the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, team green has a lot of competition on its hands. As mentioned earlier, AMD released FSR 2.0 recently, which now supports more than 100 games, including Death Stranding and God of War. There are even mods that allow games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Red Dead Redemption 2 to support it, due in part to FSR being open source.\nIn addition to AMD and Apple, Nvidia will also need to go up against Intel's XeSS which it showed off earlier this year, though team blue seems to be dragging its feet a bit about launching. In any case, there's a lot more choice for gamers when it comes to upscaling, so team green needs to play the long game.\nMORE: Nvidia RTX: Top 10 Games That Utilize Ray Tracing The Best\nSources: Nvidia, PC Gaming Wiki \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming News\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nPC Gaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIncredible Xbox Series X Deal Found at Pawn Shop\n\t\t\n\n\nXbox Series X\n\nA gamer finds an incredible deal at a pawn shop, and takes a chance on the Xbox Series X console, bringing it home for an low price.\n\n\nPosts\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nSarah Fields\n\n\n4 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS5 Pro Confirms Release Date and Massive Price Tag\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nDalton Cooper\n\n\nSep 10, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3:03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS5 Pro is Even More Expensive Outside the US\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nDalton Cooper\n\n\nSep 13, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWin a PlayStation 5 Pro With Game Rant\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nTim Lord\n\n\nNov 6, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCRKD Fortnite Festival Edition NEO S Controller Review\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nCarley Garcia\n\n\n15 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSome PS5 Pro 30th Anniversary Edition Pre-Orders Are Being Canceled\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nMatthew Schomer\n\n\nSep 27, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBattlefield 2042 War Machine Event Adds Fan Favorite Game Mode With a Twist\n\t\t\n\n\nBattlefield 6\n\nEA updates Battlefield 2042 with an all-new limited-time event complete with a new battle pass, specialist skins, modes, and more.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 hour ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tReignbreaker: How to Get Keys and Resolves\n\t\t\n\n\nReignbreaker\n\nTired of dying to enemies in Reignbreaker?

On Amazon Prime Day I ordered a new EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 FTW3 Ultra edition and things did not go as planned.\n\nScammed by Amazon. Bought a new @TEAMEVGA @NVIDIA RTX 3090 (Amazon seller.) It arrived. Box seals broken. Inside was a RTX 3070. :-( pic.twitter.com/ECMyn0eEfP\n\u2014 Patrick J Kennedy (@Patrick1Kennedy) July 21, 2022\n\nOn July 12, 2022, I ordered the GPU. Although NVIDIA sent us our original GeForce RTX 3090 for review, we needed another one for a test platform for several of our other series on STH. The EVGA card was sold by Amazon.com Services LLC and was listed in New condition. This was purchased via the Add to Cart/ Buy Now box, not by looking for used units.\nAmazon EVGA NVIDIA RTX 3090 Invoice Redacted Small\nThe unit shipped on July 13, 2022, and then things started to go awry.\nFirst, the unit was shipped, requiring a signature delivery. I was heading to Zurich, Switzerland that weekend, but according to the estimated arrival date, I was to be around for the shipment. Instead, Amazon batched the card with other items so it instead would arrive after I left for Europe. That meant I had to spend $10 to get UPS to deliver the package at a later date when I could be there to sign for it. When the package arrived, it looked like it had a tough life.\nAmazon EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 That Was A 3070 Shipping Box 1\nIt seems as though this package was open at some point during transit. When it was opened, it appeared that someone had folded the flaps over each other. Then a copious amount of clear plastic tape was used to seal the box. You can see it on the doorstep at delivery in the video, but the opposite side was opened to gain access to products just to preserve this packaging masterpiece.\nAmazon EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 That Was A 3070 Shipping Box 3\nThe contents seem to have arrived, but the GeForce RTX 3090, destined for a test node, had a curious feature. EVGA uses security tape to seal its packaging. On this package, both EVGA seals were already broken.\nAmazon EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 That Was A 3070 Security Seal 2 Broken\nIn addition to the two broken seals, there was a LPN PM sticker. Often Amazon uses the LPN RR stickers for returns put back into stock, so this looked similar. Also, there is a sticker under that LPN sticker with the model information and a \u201cNewItem\u201d printed on the label.\nAmazon EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 That Was A 3070 Security Seal 1 Broken\nHere is another look at the label on the end of the box, this time opened.\nAmazon EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 That Was A 3070 EVGA Box 2 With Return Label\nInside the box was a normal inside box with the foam carrier.\nAmazon EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 That Was A 3070 Foam 1\nRemoving the top foam made us see the ICX3 cooler style that EVGA uses on a number of its cards. If someone processing a return saw this, they would see the card on the front of the box and assume the same card was sitting there.\nAmazon EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 That Was A 3070 In Box\nEven the EVGA badge and the non-model specific EVGA GeForce installation guide was included.\nAmazon EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 That Was A 3070 EVGA Badge And Manual\nEVGA uses branded ESD bags, and this card was using the EVGA bag with an ESD seal still on the bag.\nAmazon EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 That Was A 3070 ESD Seal 1\nThe one view, other than tracing the serial numbers that would give this away was looking at the top of the card that says \u201cRTX 3070\u201d instead of \u201cRTX 3090\u201d. That single 7 versus 9 digit change is the only giveaway one would reasonably see when inspecting this package to tell that this was the wrong card.\nAmazon EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 That Was A 3070 See Model Through Bag 1\nThat \u201c3070\u201d is often hidden by the foam carrier in the box. Being empathetic, it is not too hard to understand how this could happen. Someone that did not know the difference between a RTX 3070 and a RTX 3090 would miss this if they were under time pressure to validate a previous return. When opening the box and seeing the card that looked like the box cover, I originally assumed it was the right card, and I saw the ESD sticker sealing the card. It was only later that I realized this was a 3070.\nAmazon EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 That Was A 3070 See Model Through Bag 3\nMy best guess is that someone purchased an EVGA RTX 3070 and a 3090. They then kept the 3090 and returned the 3090 packaging with the RTX 3070 version inside. Amazon processed the return of an expensive card and the person checking missed the 7 versus 9 on the top of the card, and did not have a way to validate serial numbers. They then saw the ESD bag seal and decided that it could go in new stock instead of a used queue.\nI opened the return with Amazon and spoke to someone on the phone to explain what happened and this card is now on its way back to Amazon. I wanted to get on the phone because I was sending back a RTX 3070 in a 3090 box, and if someone does proper checks, they will see this is not the card that matches the packaging. I was a bit apprehensive about doing this type of return since it is a mismatch.\nAmazon EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 That Was A 3070 EVGA Box 1\nIn the end, assuming the refund is processed, I will be out about a week putting together the system we will use to test the Project TinyMiniMicro nodes and for our STH Mini PC series. I also have the risk of having to do the return and having an issue because there is a mismatched product. Further, I had to stop by the UPS store and drop off the package, and that is a 15+ minute one-way trip. The positive is that pricing on the RTX 3090 has fallen since then, so I probably will end up a bit better off with the return other than all of the lost time.\nThe eye-opening impact is really the hardware security aspect of this story.\nWhy This is an Important Hardware Security Story\nBloomberg\u2019s discredited spy chip article and a follow-up piece that I interviewed their primary source who disagreed with Bloomberg\u2019s reporting, while fake news did something for the industry. It helped highlight the challenges with hardware security and supply chains. This story is a more practical and dangerous story from a hardware security perspective.\nOne of the big challenges with hardware security is that items can be intercepted during shipping. We assume this was just a package that Amazon did not properly fill and that got crushed and re-taped by UPS. Compared to some stories of systems being intercepted during shipment, this is a poor cover-up job. Still, it is not completely uncommon to see Amazon packages take a few bumps along the way.\nAmazon EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 That Was A 3070 Shipping Box 2\nThe bigger concern is that it seems like a unit sold by Amazon.com and not a 3rd party seller was not new. Instead, even with security seals being broken, it was placed back into NewItem stock and sold as \u201cNew\u201d per the invoice above.\nAmazon EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Box With Return Label And Broken Security Seal 1\nTaking a step back for a moment, if the card was actually an EVGA GeForce RTX 3090 and with the ESD bag still sealed, I probably would have used it being in a time crunch to get the new system online. If the entire card can be substituted and go through Amazon\u2019s return logistics process, ending up as \u201cnew\u201d stock, then what if someone had more nefarious intentions? What if someone tampered with the GeForce RTX 3090 and got it accepted back as new stock by Amazon?\nAmazon EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 That Was A 3070 Card Back\nThe downstream buyer might use the compromised RTX 3090 in their system. This is a card where the PCB is not exposed since there are fans, heatsinks, and shrouding covering the entire card. It would be impossible without disassembly to see if the card was tampered with before installation. That compromised RTX 3090 would be plugged into the PCIe slot in a motherboard. PCIe devices physically installed into motherboards have very low-level system access due to their natures. This is perhaps one of the scariest types of attacks since it would allow a huge amount of access to a system.\nThe key here is that by taking a previously sold computer product and reselling it, by Amazon.com as the seller as \u201cnew,\u201d most buyers have the reasonable expectation that the unit went from the manufacturer to a distributor to Amazon or directly to Amazon. Having the potential of muddling returned computer products into this new item pool means that that chain of custody cannot be guaranteed.\nInstead, we had a third party tamper with the GPU Amazon.com Services LLC sold us as new. Then, something happened in shipping leading to the package being accessible en route. This story, given Amazon\u2019s large presence, should make computer hardware security experts very nervous as it has all of the elements to be disastrous for end users.\nFinal Words\nAgain, the chain of events is simple to understand. I am a bit disheartened by the inconvenience of this. I will say that Amazon has been easy to initiate the return on so I have no complaints at this point on the return process (we may have an update if that changes.)\nAmazon EVGA NVIDIA RTX 3090 Invoice Redacted Small\nStill, given Amazon\u2019s market presence and the fact that it is letting highly tampered products into its supply chain and selling them as new, the hardware security aspects of this are mind-boggling. For Amazon, the challenge is that the alternative is that taking returns on these products and automatically not putting them into a used/ refurbished stock can be costly. However, if this practice continues, it becomes hard to trust one of the world\u2019s largest computer component resellers. I doubt AWS would accept this in its hardware supply chain, so there is a bit of a \u201cdo unto others\u201d that I cannot escape feeling here.\nAmazon EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 That Was A 3070 See Model Through Bag 3\nOriginally, I was not going to write up this story, much less do a video. The Twitter post was all I planned on doing. At the same time, I think that our readers need to be aware that something like this can happen. From a hardware security and supply chain perspective, the box was bad, but there is little one can do to show tampered hardware can get through into a reseller\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d stock more than having a product that has been substituted in the package.\nFor the industry and our readers, Amazon\u2019s computer component supply chain being this compromised and passing tampered packages as new and sold by Amazon, not a third party seller, should be a wake-up call. This is as bad, or worse, than what we found in Dude this should NOT be in a Dell Switch or HPE Supercomputer.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSAmazonevgaNVIDIA \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleSamsung and AMD Xilinx Launch 2nd Gen SmartSSDNext articlePoE Made in China PoE Splitter Review Patrick Kennedyhttps://www.servethehome.comPatrick has been running STH since 2009 and covers a wide variety of SME, SMB, and SOHO IT topics.

One package clearly labelled as 16GB on the outside had a 4GB module inside.  The other three were okay.  I can share your nervousness about whether a return with the wrong device inside would be accepted. When the return was accepted I was relieved and just carried on without another thought.\nNow that I think about it, this happened twice over the last couple years.  The other time was with a single-board computer packed in a box sold and marked as the more expensive unit.  Out of two units shipped directly from the manufacturer, one was wrong.  That time the window to return the mispackaged item expired.\nIt never occurred to me that either of these incidents could have been some sort of supply-chain tampering.  \nI wonder how common this sort of thing really is?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCD\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            July 22, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            2:37 pm                                            \n\n\n\nGood to know that some of us aren\u2019t the only ones being scammed here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBob Niland\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            July 22, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            3:13 pm                                            \n\n\n\nIf the ASIN was reported in the article, I can\u2019t find it.\nWhere multiple sellers are offering the same ASIN, there\u2019s really no way for the customer to know who supplied the item pulled from the AMZN warehouse tote \u2026 entirely apart from risk of tampered return re-sale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPete Mitchell\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            July 22, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            4:00 pm                                            \n\n\n\n@Bob Niland\nSo you\u2019re saying that if I buy a new \u201csold by\u201d and \u201cshipped by\u201d Amazon item, it could be pulled from the stock of some third party as long as the ASINs are the same?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Kazansky\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            July 22, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            4:14 pm                                            \n\n\n\nThe moral of this story is, don\u2019t buy anything important from Amazon.

The box was intact but nicely creased on 1 side. The book had a completely broken paper link between the spine and the endpaper that is pasted to the cardboard cover. Perhaps it was damaged in the warehouse or damaged when delivered to my home.\nI found such damage extremely difficult to believe until I reviewed my security camera footage of that delivery. Yes, the Amazon driver had tossed the book onto my front door threshold from 6 feet away. I did not know that \u201csocial distancing\u201d applied to delivering a box.\nAmazon was very smooth in handling the return & replacement as I was an Amazon Prime customer at that time.

That is why i stopped buying new hardware from them 5 years ago.  They once were a trustworthy company they had ethics.

I think I must have cycled through a good portion of the return / sell as new until I actually got a brand new unit.\nAs noted above, even though a price may be good, it is not worth the aggravation and time.

Not from UPS, the postal service or Amazon\u2019s own drivers. I have had times where the seller I tried buying from ended up proving a total flake-out, requiring me to file a claim and get my money back and I\u2019ve had to return one item for refund that had been apparently damaged NOT by the USPS but by someone responsible for the stock at one of the companies I ordered from (in that case a used Sun Microsystems UltraSPARC T1 processor for my chip collection). But so far, I\u2019ve not had any issues with the shipper or postal service with damaged packages, nor have I had things intercepted or arrive in a shoddily put together box that looked like it got riffled through in transit.\nI would posit the following hypothesis, however: I\u2019m betting that the person who got this at the returns department at Amazon didn\u2019t bother actually taking the GPU card out of the box to inspect it and check to see if it was, in fact, the correct card. I\u2019m guessing the original buyer might have mistakenly placed the RTX 3070 into the RTX 3090\u2019s box, by accident, and shipped it back, not knowing the difference or realizing his/her mistake. Once the Amazon.com returns people received the card, they simply opened the box, pulled the foam inner tray out enough to verify that a card was in the box, stuffed it back in and sent the returned \u201cRTX 3090\u201d back to the warehouse to be re-sold. Once at the warehouse, the staff, also not knowing any better and probably under very high duress and very busy, simply tossed the card into the \u201cNew Item\u201d bin without further ado. No verification of the contents, no check of the sealing tape used on the box from the OEM.\nOf course, Patrick is in his right mind to be more than a bit worried, though I don\u2019t advise jumping straight to the \u201cnefarious activity\u201d conclusion. Certainly, that\u2019s now a very real and serious possibility, but I think more likely is the scenario I gave above \u2013 a chance occurrence of multiple mistakes that, in this case, managed to happen all at once and in succession, leading to this particular end result.\nBut absolutely Amazon needs be held to account for not positively checking returned items. They ALL need to be held accountable, be they Amazon, eBay or some other marketplace. And customers need to not be quite so rushed when sending things back. Be a bit more mindful of what you are doing and don\u2019t be shy about alerting others to mistakes. Slow down, stop and think and stuff like this won\u2019t happen. :-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRona Matlow\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            July 23, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            8:53 pm                                            \n\n\n\nI had a similar experience with an EBay video card purchase the seller claimed was new.

If it comes back that UPS didn\u2019t mess with the box, then report it to Amazon. Perhaps that is one thing Patrick should have done before filing claim with Amazon, just for thoroughness\u2019 sake. That\u2019s what I would have done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            July 23, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            11:52 pm                                            \n\n\n\nI buy a huge amount of product from Amazon for work and also have had something similar happen.\nIn my case, I ordered a 4K monitor and had a 1080p monitor delivered instead.\nMy suspicion was that it was an inside job involving coordination between the shipper and a driver.\nMy reasons for this shipping are as follows:\nEvery single Amazon order I make is delivered by an Amazon driver in a grey van. The Amazon distribution centre is only ten minutes from my house.\nThe Amazon box had black Amazon tape over both cracks however on the bottom of the box the tape had been sliced open and clear packing tape was placed on top.\nThe monitor box had also been opened.\nMy suspicion was that someone in the distribution centre saw a monitor order on the list of orders to pick and then placed an order for the similarly sized 1080p monitor. In my area you can get same day delivery even if you order partway through the day so it\u2019s not impossible for the similar monitor to be ordered and get on the same truck.\nThe driver would just need to know which two boxes needed to get switched and he could stop somewhere along his route to do this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCD Stanley\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            July 24, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            1:19 am                                            \n\n\n\nSo was the purchase from Amazon.com or from the Amazon warehouse?

Not only were there no \u201cnefarious intentions\u201d (except presumably that someone stole a 3090), but to describe it as \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cdisastrous\u201d is completely off the rails. So much hyperbole to describe a simple Amazon return. And to compare it to the Megatrands story\u2026 I don\u2019t think the DoD orders their 3090s from Amazon :)\nPatrick, your coverage of industry trends from Ice Lake & Epyc, to Broadcom & VMware, to TinyMiniMicro is always spot on.

It\u2019s much more cost efficient to quickly move the item out and let the end consumer identify bad returns than hiring more returns staff that have to be professionally trained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerry\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            July 24, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            5:13 pm                                            \n\n\n\nThis article should be titled how I got scammed by amazon and how terrible there quality control is \u2026 And how you should probably not trust there sellers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNick\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            July 25, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            1:10 pm                                            \n\n\n\nIf I received a box in that abysmal of a shape, I would have refused delivery and complained to both Amazon and the carrier. I suspect foul play in the transit of the item as have some others. But even if that package was mangled that badly from employee abuse/misconduct, at the very least the card would have been damaged and needed to be returned anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurence\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            July 26, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            11:41 am                                            \n\n\n\nI don\u2019t know why you guys still buy at Amazon.

We USED to have CompUSA, but that went under long, long ago. The only place we have that I know of that could even remotely be called a \u201ccomputer store\u201d is Best Buy. We USED to have small local shops, but I don\u2019t think we have \u2019em any more, though it\u2019s been a long time since I last went out shopping for a PC. We don\u2019t have the luxury of a place like Micro Center in Metairie, we just don\u2019t. Even if we did, it\u2019s all too likely that I\u2019d never be able to buy older used processors for my CPU collection. That kind of thing can only be gotten from either Amazon or eBay. Maybe I am supporting a \u201cslaver company\u201d that\u2019s \u201ccontributing to the decline of small businesses\u201d. It\u2019s a necessary evil for an amateur chip collector on a extremely limited budget.\nI\u2019d like to see YOU come set up a store that deals in used server, mainframe and oddball architecture processors and computer systems and components RIGHT HERE in Metairie, LA and have a full stock or ready access to one at prices per unit of $50 or less for any architecture and any class of system. I\u2019d be more than happy to buy from you.\nYou\u2019re full of crap to say what you just said, whether its worth any amount of gold or not. I don\u2019t lie when I say that southeast Louisiana is a supply chain DESERT as far as technology-related jobs and stores are concerned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnriquo Polazo\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            July 28, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            7:21 am                                            \n\n\n\nNewsflash: Its already too late to stop shopping at Amazon. They won. Bezos built his rocket and went to space and we all paid for it either via shopping there, using AWS or through govt handouts.\nThe computer stores are all gone. Whats the best in the USA? MicroCenter? Whats 2nd? There are no more Frys/CompUSA/TigerDirect. Other online retailers already do the same crap with \u201cmarketplaces\u201d and selling returned items (NewEgg/etc).\nI live in a town with a pop over 1M. There is no national computer chains here. There are some mom & pop computer repair places, but that\u2019s it. These places have been on life support since the Computer Shopper days. All that\u2019s left is retail electronics stores that don\u2019t really specialize in anything people on these forums purchase. \nAlso, this is just false\u2026 \u201cYou\u2019ll have less hassle buying your hardware from your local computer store. The amount you save in not buying from Amazon is already worth it in gold.\u201d\nLess hassle buying locally? The place in the strip mall that fixes computers? They\u2019re really gonna have stock of the exact DIMM I want? Is it not a \u201chassle\u201d to wait for them to order it online themselves, have it shipped in, and still be at any reasonable price compared to amazon/etc? Should I pay more just to keep them open?\nAlso, what are you saving not buying from Amazon? It isn\u2019t money. Maybe its frustration if something goes sideways like the post above, but I think there are mechanisms to fix these scenarios either with Amazon or the purchaser\u2019s card agreements.\nI miss when local computer stores were relevant. I also miss all the chain computer stores that once existed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrederik Gr\u00f8n Schack\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            February 23, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            4:38 am                                            \n\n\n\nOh my, I stopped using Amazon around 10 years ago, when they signed me up for Amazon Prime. And no, I didn\u00b4t forget to untick the \u201cfree\u201d trial for Amazon Prime, because I hadn\u00b4t bought anything from Amazon for a year. Then they returned most of the money and simply point blank refused to return the rest. I got furious, not because of the little money, but the principle and I spent 2 hours with Amazon on the phone, until they finally relented.\nAnother thing Amazon does is to put a price in a listen, then when you click the product it\u00b4s another price.\nIn my book Amazon is a total scam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEAVE A REPLY\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\n\n\nPlease enter your name here\n\n\n\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\n\n\n\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign me up for the STH newsletter! \n\n\u0394 \nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

The images come from YouTube channel (and frequent leaker himself) Moore's Law is Dead, who put up a video discussing his expectations for the final cooler as well as these renders of what he thinks is just an engineering sample design.\n\n\n\n\n\r\nThe cooler design in these renders is based on the GeForce RTX 3090 cooler with modifications inspired by the leaked images from China. Essentially, it's the GeForce RTX 3090's cooler extended to 3.25 slots. Such a thing sounds impractically heavy to us, and would essentially require a stand in any tower case, but it does sound like quite a potent GPU cooler.\n\r\nAlternatively, the leaked images could be completely fake. MLiD discusses that possibility as well as the likelihood of an entirely different cooler being used for the final retail product in his video, which you can view on YouTube.\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, rumors, (nasdaq:nvda), ada lovelace, geforce rtx 4090 ti\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

(Image Credits:Moore's Law is Dead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular diagnostic tool, AIDA64, has now added support for NVIDIA's fastest and next-gen graphics card of 2022, the upcoming GeForce RTX 4090.\nAIDA64 Adds Support For NVIDIA's 2022 Flagship, The GeForce RTX 4090 Graphics Card\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 will be the green team's flagship offering this year, replacing the RTX 3090 which launched almost two years ago. Since the graphics card has most of its device id & info leaked out already, AIDA64 decided to support it within its latest BETA version (6.70.6033) which is available here.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSThe utility states that it has added 'GPU information for NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 (AD102)' but it does not say what the particular information is. It is very likely that initial device parameters have been added. The software is the first to add such support, even before GPU-z. The GeForce RTX 4090 specifically has the 'NVIDIA_DEV.2684' PCI ID. Following are the release notes for the latest version of AIDA64:\n\nSMTP / support for TLS v1.2\nGPU information for AMD Radeon Pro W6600 (Navi 23)\nGPU information for nVIDIA GeForce GTX 1630 (TU117)\nGPU information for nVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 (AD102)\nGPU information for nVIDIA H100 96GB (GH100)\nimproved support for Intel Alder Lake-M/P CPU\nmotherboard specific sensor info for Asus Pro B550M-C Series\nmotherboard specific sensor info for MSI B650, X670, X670E Series\nmotherboard specific sensor info for MSI MS-7D66\nfixed: System Stability Test / average throttling calculation\nfixed: AMD GPU enumeration with multiple GPUs\nfixed: identification of Intel Core i5-9300HF (aka Coffee Lake-H)\nfixed: identification of Intel Core i7-9750HF (aka Coffee Lake-H)\nremoved: Intel PCH Diode temperature measurement on Jginyue X99M-Plus V2\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 'Rumored' Specifications\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX RTX 4090 graphics card is expected to be powered by the top AD102-300 GPU but it is only the 'Ti' variant that will feature the full chip. The Geforce RTX 4090 will utilize a slightly cut-down configuration.\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 will use 128 SMs of the 144 SMs for a total of 16,384 CUDA cores. The GPU will come packed with 96 MB of L2 cache and a total of 384 ROPs which is simply insane. The clock speeds are not confirmed yet but considering that the TSMC 4N process is being used, we are expecting clocks between the 2.0-3.0 GHz range.\nAs for memory specs, the GeForce RTX 4090 is expected to rock 24 GB GDDR6X capacities that will be clocked at 21 Gbps speeds across a 384-bit bus interface. This will provide up to 1 TB/s of bandwidth. This is the same bandwidth as the existing RTX 3090 Ti graphics card and as far as the power consumption is concerned, the TBP is said to be rated at 450W which means that TGP may end up lower than that. The card will be powered by a single 16-pin connector which delivers up to 600W of power. It is likely that we may get 500W+ custom designs as we saw with the RTX 3090 Ti.\nThe graphics card is expected to launch in October 2022 and will be followed by the rest of the Ada Lovelace GPU-powered lineup of graphics cards.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti & RTX 4090 'Preliminary' Specs:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAda Lovelace AD102-350?Ada Lovelace AD102-300?Ampere GA102-350Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess NodeTSMC 4NTSMC 4NSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie Size~600mm2~600mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBDTBD28 Billion28 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores18432161281075210496\n\n\nTMUs / ROPsTBD / 384TBD / 384336 / 112328 / 112\n\n\nTensor / RT CoresTBD / TBDTBD / TBD336 / 84328 / 82\n\n\nBase ClockTBDTBD1560 MHz1400 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock~2800 MHz~2600 MHz1860 MHz1700 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute~103 TFLOPs~90 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPsTBDTBD74 TFLOPs69 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPsTBDTBD320 TOPs285 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity24 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus384-bit384-bit384-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed24.0 Gbps21.0 Gbps21.0 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth1152 GB/s1008 GB/s1008 GB/s936 Gbps\n\n\nTGP600W450W450W350W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$1999 US?$1499 US?$1999 US$1499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)2023?October 2022?29th March 202224th September 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n89\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n81\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n74\nActive Readers\n\n\n\niPhone 17 Air Pricing Details Suggest It Will Occupy The Same Bracket As Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 Plus, And Will Arrive With Better Battery Life, But At The Cost Of Extra Features\n\n\n\n48\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n47\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1475\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Both models retain the same basic specifications such as 2506 CUDA cores, 80 TMUs, & 32 ROPs. Each variant features an 8 GB GDDR6 memory running across a 128-bit wide bus interface at 14 Gbps speeds for 224 GB/s bandwidth.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 OEM graphics card features fewer cores, lower clock speeds & features a standard OEM design versus the DIY variant. (Image Credits: ITHome).\nNow, a new OEM variant of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card has appeared in China (via ITHome) which comes with a cut-down GA106 GPU core. This variant features 2304 Cores & a lower TMU / ROP count. The graphics card also rocks lower clock speeds of 1.51 GHz base (vs 1.55 GHz base) and a 1.76 GHz boost (versus 1.78 GHz boost) clock. The memory specification is kept intact & the card also rocks a single 8-pin connector to supplement its 130-ish watt TGP. Based on the cut-down specs, we can expect around 5-10% lower performance.\nUsers should be cautious of such OEM components with cut-down specifications as they can get lower performance for the product that has the same identical name as the full part. Currently, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 OEM only seems to be selling in Asian markets in OEM PC Builds but the pricing is said to be nearly the same as the DIY version which offers better specifications. The fact that NVIDIA and its OEM partners decided to keep the same naming scheme and not differentiate between the OEM and DIY parts is very misleading to consumers. This can be a tactic to put bad GA106 dies under the so-called 'GeForce RTX 3050'\u00a0 and sell them to clueless buyers to get rid of additional inventory.\nWe advise you to check in with the OEM before purchasing any PC built with NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card. The current price drop may lure customers in purchasing a slower graphics card than what they had hoped for.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series Graphics Card Specifications\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 12 GBNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 6 GB\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA102-350?Ampere GA102-300Ampere GA102-225Ampere GA102-220Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA104-400Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA104Ampere GA104-200\nAmpere GA103-200Ampere GA106-300Ampere GA106Ampere GA106-150Ampere GA107-325\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie Size628.4mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2 (GA104)276mm2276mm2276mm2 (GA106)200mm2 (GA107)\n\n\nTransistors28 Billion28 Billion28 Billion28 Billion28 Billion17.4 Billion17.4 Billion17.4 Billion17.4 Billion (GA104)13.2 Billion13.2 Billion13.2 Billion (GA106)8.7 Billion (GA107)\n\n\nCUDA Cores1075210496102408960870461445888486448643584358425602048\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs336 / 112328 / 112320 / 112280 / 104272 / 96184 / 96184 / 96152 / 80152 / 80112 / 64112 / 6480 / 32TBD\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores336 / 84328 / 82320 / 80280 / 70272 / 68184 / 46184 / 46152 / 38152 / 38112 / 28112 / 2880 / 20TBD\n\n\nBase Clock1560 MHz1400 MHz1365 MHzTBA1440 MHz1575 MHz1500 MHz1410 MHz1410 MHz1320 MHz1320 MHz1552 MHzTBD\n\n\nBoost Clock1860 MHz1700 MHz1665 MHzTBA1710 MHz1770 MHz1730 MHz1665 MHz1665 MHz1780 MHz1780 MHz1777 MHz1470 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute40 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs34 TFLOPsTBA30 TFLOPs22 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs13 TFLOPs13 TFLOPs9.1 TFLOPsTBD\n\n\nRT TFLOPs74 RFLOPs69 TFLOPs67 TFLOPsTBA58 TFLOPs44 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs32 TFLOPs32 TFLOPs25 TFLOPs25 TFLOPs18.2 TFLOPsTBD\n\n\nTensor-TOPsTBA285 TOPs273 TOPsTBA238 TOPs183 TOPs163 TOPs192 TOPs192 TOPs101 TOPs101 TOPs72.8 TOPsTBD\n\n\nMemory Capacity24 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X10 GB GDDR6X8 GB GDDR6X8 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6X8 GB GDDR612 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR66 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus384-bit384-bit384-bit384-bit320-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit192-bit128-bit128-bit96-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed21 Gbps19.5 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps14 Gbps16 Gbps15 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth1008 GB/s936 GB/s912 Gbps912 Gbps760 GB/s608 GB/s448 GB/s608 GB/s448 GB/s384 GB/s240 GB/s224 GB/s168 GB/s\n\n\nTGP450W350W350W350W320W290W220W175W175W170W150W130W (GA106)\n115W (GA107)70W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)TBD$1499 US$1199$999 US?$699 US$599 US$499 US$399 US$399 US$329 USTBD$249 USTBD\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)29th March 2022?24th September 20203rd June 202111th January 202217th September 202010th June, 202129th October 2020October 20222nd December 202025th February 2021October 202227th January 20222024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n165\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n101\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n72\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features;

Said card is GeForce GTX 1630 4GB, designed for smooth gameplay in popular games at an ubiquitous FHD resolution. Let\u2019s cut to the chase, shall we?\nClub386 Table of Doom\u2122\nGPUGTX 1650GTX 1630GTX 1060Launch dateApril 2019June 2022July 2016CodenameTU117TU117GP106ArchitectureTuringTuringPascalInterfacePCIe 3.0 x16PCIe 3.0 x16PCIe 3.0 x16Process (nm)121214Transistors (bn)4.74.74.4Die Size (mm\u00b2)200200200Processors8965121,280ROPs321648RT Cores\u2013\u2013\u2013Tensor Cores\u2013\u2013\u2013Boost Clock (MHz)1,665/1,5901,7851,708Peak GFLOPs2,984/2,8491,8284,372Memory TypeGDDR5/6GDDR6GDDR5Memory Size (GB)446Memory Clock (MT/s)8,000/12,00012,0008,000Memory Width (bits)12864192Memory Bandwidth (GB/s)128/19296192Power Connector (pin)666Board Power (watts)7575120Launch MSRP (USD)149149249\nGeForce GTX 1630 Analysis\nBelonging to the GTX 16-series family first released over three years ago, GTX 1630 is very much a throwback. We know this because Nvidia is using the 12nm TU117 die previously seen on April 2019\u2019s GeForce GTX 1650. That particular card was populated with 896 Cuda cores, 56 texture units, 32 ROPs and connected to either GDDR5 memory running at 8GT/s, or a year later, GDDR6 operating at 12GT/s. Both shared a 128-bus from memory to card. Mainstream cards for the mainstream market.\nThough using the same 4.7bn transistor die occupying 200mm\u00b2 die space, GTX 1630 is weaker in all respects. The TU117-150 silicon drops core count to 512 \u2013 representing a 43 per cent reduction from GTX 1650, and texture units and ROPs fall to 32 and 16, respectively. The performance hammer also comes down on memory, where GTX 1630 uses a 64-bit bus allied to GDDR6 running at 12GT/s. All told, there\u2019s only 96GB/s on tap.\nThese manifest changes translate to a GPU that\u2019s primed to operate in the FHD firmament only, likely with medium-quality settings, and isn\u2019t too far removed from performance obtained by the latest baked-in IGPs. Nvidia sees this as an entry-level card for anyone wanting to upgrade from basic IGPs typically found in Intel chips, of which there are millions in the field.\nBeing a GTX model it misses out on specific RT and Tensor cores present in the newer, more powerful RTX range. That\u2019s a sensible move on Nvidia\u2019s part as the intrinsic firepower of this GPU is not enough to do those two technologies justice.\nAppreciating the more potent GTX 1650 launched three years ago armed with a \u00a3149 fee, we\u2019re surprised to see GTX 1630 pitched at the same level. Commentary suggests performance is more in line with a \u00a399 price tag, especially in these days of plentiful stock and limited price gouging. Benchmarks will reveal all.\nPalit GeForce GTX 1630 4GB Dual\nYou\u2019d think Palit would take an existing heatsink-and-fan design \u2013 say the GTX 1650 Dual \u2013 and repurpose it in its entirety  for GTX 1630. That doesn\u2019t happen as the two cards share the same suffix but not the same cooler.\n\n\nYou see, GTX 1630 Dual\u2019s cooler measures a Mini-ITX-accommodating 170mm long, 112mm tall and 40mm thick, whereas GTX 1650 chimes in at 170mm x 99mm x 40mm, even though both GPUs share a 75W TGP. What\u2019s more, and somewhat strangely, Palit decides to add a 6-pin power connector on this lower-power model, which is conspicuous by its absence on GTX 1650.\nAnother change rests with GTX 1630 implementing a zero-fan idle mode, and our observations highlight a 55\u00b0C switch-on temperature. The simple metal heatsink, meanwhile, does away with heatpipes, relying instead on the cooling capabilities of a single finned block \u2013 intelligently also cooling VRMs \u2013 residing underneath two fans.\n\nPalit clocks Dual at an Nvidia-matching 1,785MHz boost and also keeps 4GB of GDDR6 memory chugging along at 12GT/s. The card actually holds 1,860MHz across our titles. A Dual OC model is otherwise identical save for an 1,815MHz boost speed. Keeping costs in check, there is neither RGB nor extraneous extras such as a metal backplate.\nDual DisplayPort 1.4a and a single HDMI 2.0b drive up to three displays simultaneously, and that\u2019s totally okay for a card of this ilk.\nPerformance\n\nOur 5950X Test PCs\nClub386 carefully chooses each component in a test bench to best suit the review at hand. When you view our benchmarks, you\u2019re not just getting an opinion, but the results of rigorous testing carried out using hardware we trust.\nShop Club386 test platform components:\nCPU:\u00a0AMD Ryzen 9 5950XMotherboard:\u00a0Asus ROG X570 Crosshair VIII FormulaCooler:\u00a0Corsair Hydro Series H150i Pro RGBMemory:\u00a032GB G.Skill Trident Z Neo DDR4Storage:\u00a02TB Corsair MP600 SSDPSU:\u00a0be quiet!

Both cards ply the \u00a3150 bracket and make a case for being first upgrades from integrated graphics.\n\nNot a great start. We know that an AMD Ryzen 7 5700G \u2013 featuring integrated Vega-class graphics and soon to be superseded by Ryzen chips housing RDNA 2 graphics smarts \u2013 returns a score of 1,593. It\u2019s worrying for Nvidia that rival RX 6400 is able to produce 73 per cent higher numbers, while a card we don\u2019t look upon too favourably, Radeon RX 6500 XT, available for around the same price as this pair, cranks out 5,548 marks.\n\nWe\u2019ve had to lower settings to medium for the two cards to produce meaningful and consistent framerates, thus rendering results incomparable with previous testing.\nNevertheless, at FHD, AMD has a 36 per cent lead, which is significant considering the average and minimum framerates. We\u2019d certainly add framerate-boosting technology from either camp to help matters along.\n\nAre we being unfair by testing against triple-A titles that use advanced rendering engines? We\u2019d argue no because of the \u00a3150 fee, but nevertheless, a run of CS: GO with very high-quality settings returns expectedly high framerates. The yawning chasm between GTX 1630 and RX 6400 is hard to ignore.\n\nHigh-quality settings are actually too tough for either card. We run them to illustrate the point that GTX 1630 and RX 6400 need to be matched up to the game; GeForce Experience comes into its own here.\n\nA great illustration of what happens when you take a popular game with a shallow graphics engine load and subject it to entry-level cards. AMD streaks ahead by offering 67 per cent more performance.\n\nForza Horizon 5 is coded wonderfully well. Looking good when set to high-quality settings and running reasonably smooth on both cards by never dipping below 30FPS, we wish all games were written this efficiently.\n\nMatching games to cards, Gears Tactics can be run with ultra-quality settings. The same story ensues, that is, AMD beating up on Nvidia in this segment.\n\nHaving to tame only 75W is easy for the improved Dual cooler. As expected, it\u2019s a quiet GPU.\n\nAnything below 70\u00b0C is considered good, and both cards ace the test.\n\nBear in mind these numbers are evaluated as a complete system. Nothing much to choose between them.\nOverclocking\nWe raised core frequency to 2,000MHz and memory to an effective 13.4GT/s. Taken as an average over our games, framerate benefit is 9.5 per cent. Handy, of course, but as a proof point, Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla\u2019s performance increases from 33FPS to only 36FPS.\n\nConclusion\nIt\u2019s curious why Nvidia would want to resurrect a three-year-old mainstream GPU and then castrate it further by lopping off cores and memory bus width. GeForce GTX 1630 is the culmination of this vision, and truth be told, it makes little sense, particularly at the \u00a3150 price point.\nComfortably outdistanced by the anaemic Radeon RX 6400, sometimes to the tune of 70 per cent, Nvidia\u2019s latest card is a relatively small step up from desktop integrated graphics and may struggle to match the latest IGPs on mobile.\n\n\nAppreciating these misgivings, Nvidia ought to enable partners to build cards costing less than \u00a3100, thereby putting value to the fore. That hasn\u2019t happened, putting AIBs in an awfully tight spot.\nPalit\u2019s Dual interpretation is fine when considered in isolation; the cooler does a good job, dimensions are petite enough, but we question the need for an auxiliary power connector.\nVerdict: An overpriced card that ought to be confined to 2019, GTX 1630 leaves a lot to be desired.\n\n\nTarinder SandhuFounder and publisher at Club386, nobody has more experience ripping the guts out of PCs.

Through GeForce Experience, you can keep your GPU drivers up to date, which optimizes your settings for a finely-tuned gaming experience. You can also capture screenshots, videos, and even live stream. \nHowever, what happens if you choose to enable GeForce Experience's experimental features? \n                        What Is the Purpose of GeForce Experience?\n               \nBefore considering the experimental features, you should know what GeForce Experience does for you. Luckily, we've already covered the features offered by GeForce Experience in detail, as well as how it stacks up against the NVIDIA Control Panel.\nIn short, aside from the aforementioned media tools, GeForce Experience is built around keeping your GPU drivers up-to-date. This includes the ability to quickly optimize installed games and apps for a better experience. In this way, it serves as a one-stop-shop for tweaking your GPU and the graphics settings of most games in your library.\nYou should note that GeForce Experience is different from the excellent GeForce Now, which you should try out. \n                        What Do Experimental Features Add to GeForce Experience?\n               \nKnowing the key features of GeForce Experience is an important part of understanding what the experimental features do. The experimental features program is essentially a beta version of the GeForce Experience.\nThis means that opting into the program gives you early access to Game Ready drivers and optimization settings for the latest games. It also lets you test tools, a good example being the Ansel camera tool, or post-processing filters for videos, before they are available to the public.\nThese features can be fun for content creators, adventurous gamers, and curious tech enthusiasts. Ultimately, you can do the gaming and creator communities a service as well\u2014by providing useful feedback that NVIDIA will use to improve these features before public release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you choose to enable these features, you just need to open GeForce Experience and go to the settings. In General, you'll see a checkbox labeled enable experimental features. Clicking the box will trigger a scan for available updates. If there are any beta updates available, GeForce Experience will begin installing the update. \n                        The Downsides of GeForce Experience's Experimental Features\n               \nYou should keep in mind that experimental does indeed mean that some features could be broken or buggy. While these bugs are unlikely to do any real harm to your PC, they could be the worst thing that an optimization tool can be: inconvenient.\nSome features may simply not function correctly and GeForce Experience's overlay could suffer from bugs as well. This could mean a slow or unresponsive overlay. Experimental tools could include bugs ranging from screenshots not appearing in their designated folder, duplicated hotkeys, or the tools simply not working.\nAgain, while there are sure to be a variety of bugs, it's unlikely that any of these will cause long-term harm to your PC. NVIDIA would never roll out a beta feature that is so broken as to cause lasting damage to your system. \n                        You Shouldn't Enable Experimental Features for GeForce Experience\n               \nUltimately, you should only enable these features if you're extremely interested in NVIDIA's cutting-edge features, and can't wait for the public rollout. For most users, early access to these tools does little to improve your experience or put you ahead of the curve.\nIn the end, you'll receive the very tools being tested by beta users\u2014only, they'll have been released with the assurance of guaranteed compatibility. \n                        GeForce Experience's Experimental Features Are Always Available\n               \nThe good thing about GeForce Experience's experimental features is that they can easily be enabled and disabled at your leisure. Should you still be interested in testing them out, you can enable the features for a test run\u2014and roll back to a stable update if they are not to your liking.\nHowever, we still recommend that you stick with public updates unless you want to see what NVIDIA is doing to give its users greater creative tools before everyone else. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nGaming Tips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support MakeUseOf.

Its paper \"PrefixRL: Optimization of Parallel Prefix Circuits using Deep Reinforcement Learning\" shows that AI can learn to design these circuits from scratch. The company notes that the latest NVIDIA Hopper GPU architecture has nearly 13,000 instances of AI-designed circuits.NVIDIA aims to find a solution that \"effectively trades off\" circuit area and delay to create the minimum area circuit at every delay. PrefixRL focuses on arithmetic circuits called parallel prefix circuits. The AI agent learns to design prefix graphs but optimizes for the properties of the final circuit generated from the graph.The researchers trained an agent to optimize the area and delay properties of arithmetic circuits. For prefix circuits, they designed an environment where the reinforcement learning agent can add or remove a node from the prefix graph; at each step, the agent receives the improvement in the corresponding circuit area and delay as rewards.PrefixRL's physical simulation required 256 CPUs for each GPU, and training the 64b case took over 32,000 GPU hours, so NVIDIA developed Raptor, an in-house distributed reinforcement learning platform that uses NVIDIA hardware for this kind of industrial reinforcement learning and enhances scalability and training speed.The results show that the best PrefixRL adder achieved a 25% lower area than the electronic design automation tool adder at the same delay. NVIDIA hopes the method \"can be a blueprint for applying AI to real-world circuit design problems: constructing action spaces, state representations, RL agent models, optimizing for multiple competing objectives, and overcoming slow reward computation processes such as physical synthesis.\"Find out more here and don't forget to join\u00a0our new Reddit page,\u00a0our new Telegram channel, follow us on\u00a0Instagram\u00a0and\u00a0Twitter, where we are sharing breakdowns, the latest news, awesome artworks, and more.Join discussionComments 0You might also likeSubscribeStart receiving our weekly newsletterSubscribe@LevelEighty@80Level@80lv@eighty_levelRound TableAbout & Contact usPrivacy PolicyRepublishing policyTerms of useDisclaimer\u00a9 2025.

These include the oft-rumored RTX 4090 and RTX 4090 Ti models.According to the filings that were reported by Digital Trends not only are the Nvidia Lovelace RTX 40-series listed in many variations but there are also more listings for the 30-series, particularly the RTX 30 Super series. Meanwhile, the AMD RX 7000 variations are also listed on their own page.The EEC is a trademark registry that often reliably reveals product ldetails, but with that said there are still no guarantees these models will all release in the market. At the very least, we know that these trademarks indicate the manufacturers are either developing these products or hedging their bets and securing the trademarks in case they want to release one at a later date.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nBring it on Nvidia - AMD confirms new Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs will launch in early March, rivaling Team Green's rumored RTX 5060 Ti and 5060 launch\n\n\n\n\nNvidia and AMD are set for a showdown in March, if this rumor holds any truth - RTX 5060 Ti and 5060 reportedly launching next month\n\n\n\nThe registration is from manufacturer Afox, which is a Foxconn subsidiary based in Taiwan.Analysis: What does this mean for Team Red?\u00a0These AMD and Nvidia graphics cards debuting on the EEC usually indicate a rapidly approaching release date, which corresponds to the rumored October release date for the NTX 4090.Furthermore, the fact that both the AMD and Nvidia graphics cards were registered at the same time most likely means that they\u2019ll be launching at around the same time in October too. This would be excellent news for buyers since the market would be especially competitive and could drive down prices.Considering that for its last graphics cards launch, AMD trailed behind Nvidia by launching months later might have contributed to its grabbing a far smaller chunk of the market share this generation. So it\u2019s honestly a given that this time around the tech giant would want to avoid a late launch at all costs.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\nAMD\n\n\nAllisa JamesSocial Links NavigationComputing Staff WriterNamed by the CTA as a CES 2023 Media Trailblazer, Allisa is a Computing Staff Writer who covers breaking news and rumors in the computing industry, as well as reviews, hands-on previews, featured articles, and the latest deals and trends.

This feature helps monitor the performance, take screenshots, perform instant replays, and do much more. However, the feature can sometimes get glitchy and become unresponsive. \nSo, if the Nvidia GeForce overlay is not working on Windows PC, consider trying the below solutions. \n                        Why Does the Nvidia Overlay Not Work on Windows PC?\n               \nBy default, you can open Nvidia Overlay by pressing its Alt + Z hotkey. If pressing this hotkey doesn't work, there's most likely something wrong with the app.\nBelow are some of the common reasons that can be responsible for this problem: \n\n                                        The Nvidia overlay may not appear if you are using an old or corrupt graphics driver.\n                        \n\n                                        Third-party applications can interfere with the overlay and prevent it from popping up.\n                        \n\n                                        The problem can also result from an ongoing issue with your Visual C++ Redistributable package.\n                        \n\nNow let's check out all the effective solutions you can try in this situation. \n                        1. Enable the Nvidia GeForce Overlay\n               \nBefore we do any troubleshooting, double-check that you haven't mistakenly disabled the overlay: \n\n                                        Open GeForce Experience.\n                        \n\n                                        Click on the Gear icon at the top bar.\n                        \n\n                                        Ensure that the toggle next to In-Game Overlay is enabled.\n                                            \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it's disabled, re-enable it then try opening the overlay again. \n                        2. Update the Nvidia Graphics Driver\n               \nUsing an outdated or corrupt Nvidia graphics driver can result in all kinds of problems, including issues with the overlay.Try downloading the latest update to solve the problem.\nHere's how to update the Nvidia graphics driver: \n\n                                        Press Win + X and choose Device Manager from the list.\n                        \n\n                                        Double-click on Display adapters.\n                        \n\n                                        Right-click on the Nvidia driver and choose Update driver from the context menu.\n                                            \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        Click on Search automatically for drivers.\n                        \n\nWindows will now look for and download the best available driver update for the system. Once the upgrade process is complete, reboot the device and check if you still face the problem at hand. \n                        3. Enable the GeForce Experience Experimental Features\n               \nWhen you enable experimental features in GeForce Experience, it downloads and installs an update to show you all the new things. And sometimes, this new update contains the fix for whatever is causing your overlay issues.\nHere's how to get the experimental features: \n\n                                        Open GeForce Experience > Gear icon.\n                        \n\n                                        Checkmark Enable experimental features.\n                                            \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        A small file will be downloaded via GeForce Experience.\n                        \n\nThat's it. Check if you still face the problem. \n                        4. Perform a Clean Boot\n               \nDifferent third-party applications can interfere with GeForce Experience and cause issues with the overlay. As a solution, boot the system without such applications and check if it resolves the problem. You can do so by performing a clean boot.\nThe system starts with a minimal set of drivers and applications in the clean boot state. Here's how to perform a clean boot on Windows 11. \n\n                                        Open the Run dialogue box using Win + R.\n                        \n\n                                        Type msconfig and press Enter.\n                        \n\n                                        Switch to the Services tab.\n                        \n\n                                        Checkmark Hide all Microsoft services > Disable all.\n                                            \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe system will start in a clean boot state on the next boot.\nOnce you're in a clean boot state, double-check to see if the problem goes away. If it does, try slowly re-enabling services until the issue re-appears. Whichever service you just enabled is the culprit, and you should either re-install it or download any pending updates for it if it's important. \n                        5. Repair the Visual C++ Redistributable Package\n               \nThe Visual C++ Redistributable Package is a DLL file that helps run applications built using Microsoft Visual Studio. If there's any corruption in the installed package, it can cause issues such as with the Nvidia overlay.\nYou will have to repair the redistributable package to solve the problem. Here's how to do it. \n\n                                        Open Control Panel using one of the many ways to open the Control Panel.\n                        \n\n                                        Go to Programs > Uninstall a program.\n                        \n\n                                        Right-click on the installed Visual C++ Redistributable Package and chose Change from the context menu.\n                                            \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        Click on the Repair option.\n                        \n\nNext, follow the onscreen instruction to complete the repair process. \n                        6. Install the Media Feature Pack\n               \nSometimes, the Nvidia overlay won't work because the media feature pack isn't installed.

Turn Off Media Keys and Hardware Acceleration in the Spotify App\n               \nWeirdly enough, Spotify can sometimes be the culprit behind Nvidia overlay's issues. But in truth, it's not too far-fetched; Spotify comes with an overlay feature that can interfere with GeForce Experience's own.\nSo, to fix the issue, consider disabling the Spotify overlay: \n\n                                        Open the Spotify app.\n                        \n\n                                        Press Ctrl + P to open Preferences.\n\n\n                                        In the Display section, disable the toggle next to Show desktop overlay when using media keys.\n                                            \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the hardware acceleration feature of Spotify can also be responsible for the problem. So, consider disabling it as well. Here's how. \n\n                                        Come to the Preferences window.\n                        \n\n                                        In the Compatibility section, disable the toggle next to Enable hardware acceleration.\n                                            \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReboot the system and check for the issue. \n                        8. Update Windows\n               \nIf GeForce Experience overlay is still not working, consider updating the Windows OS. You can download the latest Windows update by following the below steps. \n\n                                        Open Settings.\n\n\n                                        Click on Windows Update on the left panel.\n                        \n\n                                        Choose Check for updates.\n                        \n\nWindows will now look for and download any available update. \n                        9. Reinstall GeForce Experience\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n If you are still facing the problem, most probably, it is being caused due to an issue with the installation files. In this situation, consider reinstalling GeForce Experience.\nTo do so, first, uninstall the application using the control panel. After that, visit the GeForce Experience official website and download the application. \n                        Optimize Games Using GeForce Experience\n               \nNvidia GeForce Experience is a GeForce GTX graphics card companion application that comes with a huge number of features to optimize your gaming experience.

In its current form, the CHIPS Act is a slimmed-down version of the bill introduced last year that has since stalled in Congress (though the name, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act, is definitely still a mouthful). This new iteration of the CHIPS Act looks like it may pass by the end of the month.\u00a0The finalized bill details aren't public (via Reuters). Still, it's been reported that the bill provides over $50 billion in subsidies for US semiconductor companies and a 25% tax credit for building chip plants on US soil. The credit itself is estimated could be worth up to $24 billion.\u00a0The focus of the CHIPS Act is encouraging domestic chip manufacturing, which would help relieve supply chain issues and rely less on supply from China and other foreign chip manufacturing. The chip shortages have affected the computer, automotive, communications, and high-tech weapons industries.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump wants to kill the $52 billion CHIPS Act: 'a horrible, horrible thing'\n\n\n\n\n'The only way to beat China is to stay ahead of them' says US commerce secretary as she backs CHIPS investments handed out to Intel, TSMC over sanctions\n\n\n\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger took to Twitter to thank the United States Senate for advancing the CHIPS Act and said this was \"a great step to protecting our national and economic security.\" Intel recently started the early stages of construction for the massive $20 billion chip factory in Ohio. \n\nIntel stands to gain billions in subsidies to build more production facilities if the bill passes, along with chipmakers like Texas Instruments and Micron. These companies can also take advantage of the FABS Act to help pay for the manufacturing equipment for those facilities. Intel has stated it could spend up to $100 billion on constructing at least eight chip fabrication plants, which seems contingent on the success of the CHIPS Act. \n\nCompanies like AMD, Qualcomm, and Nvidia, which design chips but don't manufacture them (they use partners), technically don't qualify for these subsidies, have raised concerns that the CHIPS Act is only really going to benefit a handful of companies. \n\nSince then, Intel and other chipmakers have pressured US lawmakers to pass the CHIPS Act sooner rather than later to avoid fabrication delays and create jobs.The bill is likely to pass both the Senate and House of Representatives by next week with bipartisan support. However, lawmakers are working against the clock to get the CHIPS Act up for a vote: after July 31, Congress goes away for a month during the August recess.\u00a0Thanks @chuckschumer, @SenatorCantwell and @JohnCornyn for your leadership in advancing CHIPS Act funding through this evening\u2019s vote.
