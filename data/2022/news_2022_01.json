Nvidia also has a rich sales multiple of 31. So investors looking to get into this hot tech stock will have to pay a heavy premium to buy into its terrific top- and bottom-line growth.\n\nNVDA data by YCharts\nWouldn't it be great if investors could get their hands on a company that's expected to grow at a faster pace than Nvidia and is trading at a cheaper valuation? Marvell Technology (MRVL -2.78%) stock is one such candidate -- it is not only cheaper than Nvidia, but it has the potential to outperform its more illustrious peer in the long run. Here's why.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarvell Technology is serving several fast-growing markets\nNvidia's dominance of the GPU (graphics processing unit) space and the application of graphics cards in computers, data centers, and cars, among other use cases, have been the driving forces behind the company's rapid growth. Marvell Technology, similarly, supplies its chips to several fast-growing markets such\u00a0as data centers, automotive/industrial, telecom, enterprise networking, and consumer.\nMarvell's chips play a mission-critical role in these end markets. For instance, the company allows data center operators to increase bandwidth, reduce operating and capital costs, deploy high-performance computing applications, and take advantage of networked storage to increase cost and performance efficiencies.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNot surprisingly, the company's data center chips are flying off the shelves, as evident from Marvell's fiscal 2022 third-quarter results, which were released on Dec. 2, 2021. Marvell's data center revenue jumped 109% year over year to $500 million in Q3, though it is worth noting that the segment's revenue growth was aided by the acquisition\u00a0of Innovium. Marvell's Q3 data center revenue included 25 days\u00a0of revenue from Innovium, but the company also pointed out that the segment also reported impressive growth on a stand-alone basis.\nMarvell sees its data center business getting bigger in the future, as the company \"has been winning a large number of incremental cloud-optimized silicon designs, and these are now in development.\" Marvell also has a $500 million revenue opportunity within the data center storage business for its storage accelerators. The company has already scored its first design win in this space, and its manufacturing partner has already announced the availability of products using its storage accelerators.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, Marvell sees stronger adoption of its storage accelerators, and this bodes well for its data center business, which supplied\u00a041% of its revenue last quarter. Similarly, the carrier infrastructure business is on fire for Marvell thanks to the deployment of 5G networks.\nRevenue from the carrier infrastructure business, which produced 18% of total revenue, increased 28% year over year in the third quarter to $215 million. This was ahead of what Marvell was expecting on account of 5G deployments. What's more, Marvell sees its carrier infrastructure business accelerating 40% year over year in the current quarter, with additional gains in the cards going forward on account of new design wins and content gains.\nComing to the enterprise networking business, which generated 20% of Marvell's top line last quarter, the company is benefiting from the growing adoption of ethernet switches. The segment's revenue increased 56% year over year to $247 million, and most of that growth was organic. Marvell sees this segment accelerating 60% year over year this quarter thanks to market share gains and recovery in enterprise spending.\nIn all, Marvell sees\u00a0its end-market opportunity expanding to $30 billion in 2024 from $20 billion last year. What's more, the company is looking at annual revenue growth of 15% to 20% over the long run, driven primarily by its growth in the 5G, cloud, and automotive markets.\n\n\n\n\n\nA better bet than Nvidia?\nWhile Marvell is promising impressive long-term revenue growth, Wall Street is also anticipating rapid earnings growth. According to consensus estimates, Marvell's earnings could increase at an annual pace of 42% for the next five years. For perspective, Marvell is on track\u00a0to finish fiscal 2022 with earnings of $1.55 per share, which would be a 68% increase over last year.\nAs such, it wouldn't be surprising to see Marvell's earnings grow at such a high rate in the coming years, especially considering the opportunities it is sitting on. If Marvell's earnings grow at the rate that Wall Street is forecasting, the company could generate annual earnings of nearly $8.95 per share at the end of the five-year forecast period.\nMarvell has a forward earnings multiple of 38.6. Assuming a similar earnings multiple at the end of five years, its stock price could jump to $345 given the projected earnings at the end of the forecast period. That would translate into 295% gains from Marvell's closing stock price on Dec. 31.\u00a0\nMoreover, Marvell is way cheaper than Nvidia, as the forward earnings multiple indicates. Additionally, it trades at 17 times sales, which is a significant discount to Nvidia's sales multiple. Throw in the fact that Wall Street expects Marvell's earnings to grow at a faster pace over the next five years compared to Nvidia's projected annual earnings growth of 39%, and investors have solid reasons to buy Marvell Technology stock -- it offers better growth prospects at a substantially lower valuation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has apparently found it impossible to surmount an ever-increasing pile of obstacles that now litter the path toward its acquisition of Arm Holdings.\nAs per the news that is just trickling in, NVIDIA is reportedly abandoning its much-hyped Arm takeover plans:\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n*NVIDIA IS SAID TO QUIETLY PREPARE TO ABANDON TAKEOVER OF ARM$NVDA\n\u2014 *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 25, 2022\n\n\n$NVDA Reportedly preparing to abandon takeover of Arm as it sees  little to no progress in winning  regulatory approval - press (NVIDIA Corporation)\n**Reminder: In case of no deal,  Nvidia would not be refunded $1.25B.(More at https://t.co/AW8Jfxxfgf)\n\u2014 TradeTheNews.com (@Trade_The_News) January 25, 2022\n\nAs a refresher, Arm Holdings is currently owned by Japan's SoftBank Group. The UK-based firm designs silicon chips and licenses instruction sets that govern how chips communicate. Moreover, ARM's intellectual property \u2013 including the company's Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) \u2013 is utilized by the likes of Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, and Huawei for their smartphone chips, thereby corresponding to a market coverage of around 90 percent.\nIf NVIDIA abandons its takeover of Arm Holdings at this stage, SoftBank will win the right to retain $1.25 billion as a breakup fee. NVIDIA has already paid this amount to SoftBank as a down payment on the deal.\nAs we've covered previously, NVIDIA's acquisition of Arm Holdings had to be completed by March 2022. However, the deal has faced increased scrutiny from regulators in recent times. Back in August, UK's CMA had flagged the deal for stifling \"innovation across a number of markets\". While conceding that NVIDIA had offered a behavioral remedy to counter competition concerns, the CMA concluded that an in-depth phase 2 investigation was now warranted. Similarly, the EU's anti-trust authority is also probing the deal, with a ruling expected in the next few months. Meanwhile, NVIDIA is also facing hurdles in China, where Huawei Technologies Ltd. has reportedly raised concerns that its access to Arm's IP might be hampered by the deal.\nMore recently, the US FTC delivered a major blow to NVIDIA's acquisition plans when it sued to block the $40 billion deal in December 2021. FTC's Bureau of Competition Director, Holly Vedova, had said in a statement:\n\"Tomorrow's technologies depend on preserving today's competitive, cutting-edge chip markets. This proposed deal would distort Arm's incentives in chip markets and allow the combined firm to unfairly undermine Nvidia's rivals.\"\nOf course, with the NVIDIA deal rendered a dead-end now for all practical purposes, SoftBank is likely to opt for an IPO of Arm Holdings as a way of generating a return on its 2016 buyout of the firm.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n113\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n101\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n91\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n48\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n39\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1144\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorJan 26, 2022, 09:00am ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.Is Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA)new GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card the savior of budget PC gaming or is it yet another over-priced product thanks to the microchip shortage? Today we can at least see how fast it is and as you're reading this, retail pricing should be filtering through so we can make that call.\nNvidia's RTX 3050 is the cheapest RTX 3000-series card launched to dateAntony Leather\n\nIt's an important release for Nvidia too as it dominates the low-end PC gaming market with the GTX 1060, GTX 1650, GTX 1060 Ti and RTX 2060 taking the top four slots in the latest Steam Hardware survey.\n\nToday I'll be taking a look at a bunch of low-end cards both new and some likely requiring a dig through second hand sellers, but in these times it's all about getting the best you can for as little as possible, whether it's new or used, although there are maybe signs of hope as GPU prices do seem to be falling a little.\n\n\nAbove we can see the differences between the line-up of other RTX 3000-series GPUs. The RTX 3050 is still reasonably powerful compared to the next step up - the RTX 3060 - which retails for $329 versus the RTX 3050\u2019s $249, although good luck finding the former at much less than double that price tag.\n\nThe Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3050 Eagle 8GAntony Leather\n\nIt's still a big drop at this end of the spectrum, though, which does tally with the lower specification. It has a 128-bit memory interface versus 192-bit for the RTX 3060, the latter has 12GB GDDR6 memory and 25RT cores for ray tracing versus 8GB and 20 RT cores. As a result, the RTX 3050 is likely to be a solid 1,920 x 1,080 gaming card, but with DLSS, will likely offer playable frame rates in plenty of games at higher resolutions too.\n\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\nTest system and benchmarksTest system hardwareAntony Leather\nMy hardware includes a water-cooled\u00a0BarrowCH Rhopilema\u00a0water-cooled test bench,\u00a016GB Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 3,466MHz memory,\u00a0Intel Core i9-11900K, an Intel 760p M.2 SSD, Corsair RM850i PSU and\u00a0MSI MEG Z590 Ace motherboard. I've carried out all tests with resizable BAR/Smart Access Memory (SAM) support enabled where possible.\nAbove we can see Far Cry 6 with and without ray tracing enabled and AMD has made big gains since I last tested its 6600-series cards last year. The RTX 3050 sits between the GTX 1660 and RTX 3060 with DXR disabled and with the GTX 1660 and RX 5500 XT not supporting DXR in this game, the DXR results have the RTX 3050 sitting below the RX 6600, which currently sits at around $500.\nFlight simulator has actually become a tag trickier to run smoothly since I last tested it with most cards dropping a few frames. The RTX 3050 once again sits between the GTX 1660 and RX 6600, with AMD continuing to have a strong showing in this game, but all eyes will be on the final retail price of the RTX 3050 since the RX 6600 currently costs around $500 - double the Nvidia card's MSRP.\nDirt 5 with ray tracing once again means the GTX 1660 and RX 5500 XT drop out the race as neither offered the option to support ray racing. It was a sizable drop here from the RTX 3060 to the RTX 3050, though, falling from a 99th percentile low of 63fps to 45fps.\nAbove we have Watch Dogs: Legion with ray tracing enabled and disabled and here we can see the benefit of DLSS with the RTX 3050, boosting the 99th percentile low frame rate from a stuttery 22fps to a far smoother 27fps with ray tracing enabled and actually matching the average frame rate of the RTX 3060. With ray tracing disabled it was a similar story, with the minimum 99th percentile rising from 39fps to 49fps and matching the RX 6600. The RTX 3050 was also significantly faster than both the GTX 1660 and RX 5500 XT in this game too.\nA pretty easy game to run at higher frame rates, Wolfenstein: Youngblood again outperforms both the RX 5500 XT and GTX 1660 by some massive margins and isn't a million miles from the RX 6600 too, leapfrogging it convincingly once DLSS is enabled where it nearly matches the far more expensive RTX 3060 too.\nWith a system power draw around 50W less than the RX 6600 and nearly 100W less than the RTX 3060, the RTX 3050 will certainly not require a PSU upgrade, especially as it draws similar power to the GTX 1660 and RX 5500 xT.\nConclusions\nUnfortunately I didn't have an AMD RX 6500 XT to hand for these tests but given the general panning that card has had, I don't think it would be a viable alternative to the RTX 3050 anyway. Here, you have a card that should run just as well on an older system as it will on a new PCI-E 4.0 machine - unlike AMDs RX 6500 XT - give or take a few frames and everything else being equal.Nvidia's RTX 3050 and the Ssupd Meshlicious PC caseAntony Leather\nDLSS also adds a further boost and if anything I'd argue that at the low-end, gamers are maybe even more likely to use it to squeeze every last frame out of their hardware. The issue, as always over the last few years will be price. The RX 6600 is faster without the Nvidia card getting a DLSS boost, but with prices sitting at around $500 for the AMD card, the RTX 3050 needs to sit at $400 or below when it's on the shelves - ideally less.\nIf it does, and it's available, then the RTX 3050 could be a lifeline to PC gamers who have been putting off an upgrade from their aging GTX 1060s and GTX 1660s and with GPU prices taking a bit of a dip in recent days, GPU upgrades could actually be affordable in the near future too.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

They\u2019re building interconnected 3D virtual worlds for commerce, entertainment, creativity and industry.\nThese boundless worlds will be populated with shops, homes, people, robots, factories, museums \u2014 a staggering amount of 3D content. This content is challenging to produce, typically requiring multiple, often incompatible tools.\nOmniverse connects these independent 3D design worlds into a shared virtual scene.\n\nThe culmination of over 20 years of NVIDIA\u2019s groundbreaking work, Omniverse brings graphics, AI, simulation and scalable compute into a single platform to enhance existing 3D workflows.\nWith Omniverse, free for individual users, GeForce RTX Studio creators can connect their favorite 3D design tools to a single scene and simultaneously create and edit between the apps.\nDownload it at nvidia.com/omniverse.\nOmniverse Enterprise, the paid subscription for professional teams, was made available at GTC in November and is sold by NVIDIA\u2019s global partner network. Today\u2019s announcement brings Omniverse capabilities into the hands of individual creators.\nNew Omniverse Features\u00a0\nNew features within Omniverse include:\u00a0\n\nOmniverse Nucleus Cloud enables \u201cone-click-to-collaborate\u201d simple sharing of large Omniverse 3D scenes, meaning artists can collaborate from across the room or the globe without transferring massive datasets. Changes made by the artist are reflected back to the client \u2014 like working on a cloud-shared document \u2014 but for a 3D scene.\nNew support for the Omniverse ecosystem provided by leading 3D marketplaces and digital asset libraries gives creators an even easier way to build their scenes. TurboSquid by Shutterstock, CGTrader, Sketchfab and Twinbru have released thousands of Omniverse-ready assets for creators, all based on Universal Scene Description (USD) format, and are found directly in the Omniverse Launcher. Reallusion\u2019s ActorCore, Daz3D and e-on software\u2019s PlantCatalog will soon release their own Omniverse-ready assets.\nOmniverse Machinima for RTX creators who love to game \u2014 now featuring new, free characters, objects and environments from leading game titles like Mechwarrior 5 and Shadow Warrior 3, plus Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord and Squad assets in the Machinima library. Creators can remix and recreate their own game cinematics with these assets by dragging and dropping them into their scenes.\nOmniverse Audio2Face, a revolutionary AI-enabled app that instantly animates a 3D face with just an audio track, now offers blendshape support and direct export to Epic\u2019s MetaHuman Creator app. This leaves the tedious, manual blend-shaping process to AI, so artists and creators can spend more time on their creative workflows.\n\nOmniverse Ecosystem Expands\nThe NVIDIA Omniverse ecosystem expands with new Omniverse Connectors, extensions and asset libraries \u2014 built by many partners.\nToday, there are 14 connectors to applications like Autodesk 3ds Max, Autodesk Maya and Epic Games\u2019 Unreal Engine \u2014 with many more in the pipeline, including an Adobe Substance 3D Material Extension coming soon.\nThe latest Omniverse Connectors, extensions, and asset libraries include:\n\ne-on software\u2019s VUE, an all-in-one application that allows users to create digital 3D nature, from skies and volumetric clouds to terrains, large-scale ecosystems, wind-swept vegetation populations, open water bodies, roads and rocks \u2014 all based on nature\u2019s rules \u2013 and includes a native Omniverse live link connector that will sync all scene modifications directly to Omniverse stages.\ne-on software\u2019s PlantFactory, a vegetation application that allows modeling of foliage as small as twigs or as big as giant redwood trees from scratch. It also models animation like wind and permits asset export in a wide variety of formats, including a direct link from PlantFactory to Omniverse.\ne-on software\u2019s PlantCatalog, which provides a collection of over 120 ready-made procedural vegetation assets.\nTwinbru, a \u201cdigital twin of physical fabric\u201d provider that supplies interior and exterior furnishing fabrics for drapery, sheers, curtains and upholstery applications, offering 21,000 different fabrics and 11,000 digitized fabric twins \u2014 all high quality and physically accurate \u2014 now integrated into Omniverse to help streamline manufacturing and architectural designs.\n\nWatch the NVIDIA special address on demand for a recap of all of the company\u2019s announcements at CES.\nCreators can download NVIDIA Omniverse for free, submit their work to the NVIDIA Omniverse gallery, and find resources through our forums, Medium, Twitter, YouTube, Twitch, Instagram and Discord server.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | Art | CES 2022 | NVIDIA RTX | NVIDIA Studio | Omniverse | Omniverse Enterprise | Rendering | Simulation and Design | Universal Scene Description \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It sports 16GB of the fastest ever GDDR6 memory in a laptop and delivers higher performance than the desktop TITAN RTX, with prices starting at $2,499.\nMore will light up with the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti laptop GPU, the newest member of our fastest-growing class of GPUs. It can drive displays at 100 frames/second with 1,440-pixel resolution, at prices starting at $1,499.\n\nLaptops with the new GPUs will be available starting Feb. 1. They bring a fourth generation of Max-Q Technologies, a systems design approach that enables the thinnest, lightest, quietest gaming laptops.\nThe latest Max-Q applies AI to optimally balance GPU/CPU power use, battery discharge, image quality and frame rates. Laptops running it can provide up to 70 percent more battery life while delivering more performance.\nMainstream and Monster GPUs\nFisher also announced the GeForce RTX 3050, which brings ray tracing and accelerated AI to mainstream desktops.\nThe GPU lets mass market PCs run the latest games at 60 frames per second, thanks to graphics and AI cores in its NVIDIA Ampere architecture.\nThe RTX 3050 sports 8GB of GDDR6 memory. The card will be available from partners worldwide on Jan. 27 starting at $249.\n\u201cRTX is the new standard, and the GeForce RTX 3050 makes it more accessible than ever,\u201d said Fisher, showing a \u201cmonster\u201d RTX 3090 Ti (pictured below) also in the wings.\n\nThe RTX 3090 Ti will pack 24GB of GDDR6X running at 21 Gbit/s, the fastest memory ever. The GPU will crank out 40 teraflops for shaders, 78 teraflops for ray tracing and a whopping 320 teraflops of AI muscle. More details will be coming later this month.\nNew Initiatives with AT&T, Samsung\nGiving high-performance mobile gaming new wings, AT&T and NVIDIA are working together to provide customers an optimized experience. And AT&T customers are getting a special offer to enjoy NVIDIA GeForce NOW on 5G.\n\u201cStarting today, AT&T customers with a 5G device on a qualifying plan, can get a six-month GeForce NOW Priority Membership at no charge,\u201d said Fisher.\n\nFor its part, Samsung will offer NVIDIA\u2019s cloud gaming service on its smart TVs through the Samsung Gaming Hub around midyear.\nIt\u2019s the latest move to bring GeForce NOW to the living room. In November, LG showed a beta version of the service on its 2021 WebOS smart TVs.\nAs for games, GeForce NOW continues to expand support for the Electronic Arts catalog, adding Battlefield 4 and Battlefield 5 to GeForce NOW\u2019s online library of more than 1,100 PC games played by 15 million subscribers.\nHeart-Pounding RTX and Reflex Games\nSpeaking of new games, NVIDIA announced 10 new RTX games.\nFisher showed clips from four upcoming titles that this year will support RTX, DLSS \u2014 NVIDIA\u2019s AI-powered graphics enhancing technology \u2014 or both.\nEscape From Tarkov and Rainbow Six Extraction are adding DLSS, while The Day Before and Dying Light 2 Stay Human are adding both DLSS and ray tracing.\nIn addition, seven new titles support NVIDIA Reflex for low-latency gameplay. They include Sony\u2019s God of War, Rainbow Six Extraction and iRacing, taking Reflex into the world\u2019s premier online racing simulator.\nAnd we\u2019re raising the bar in esports. A new class of 27-inch esports displays with 1440-pixel resolution and G-SYNC at up to 360 Hz refresh rates will be available soon from AOC, ASUS, MSI and ViewSonic.\nBuilding 3D Virtual Worlds\nFor the 45 million professionals who create games, movies and more, Fisher described tools transforming their workflows.\n\u201cWe are at the dawn of the next digital frontier. Interconnected 3D virtual worlds \u2026 with shops, homes, people, robots, factories, museums \u2026 will be built by an expanding number of creators, collaborating across the globe,\u201d he said.\nNVIDIA Omniverse, the powerful platform for artists to collaborate and accelerate 3D work, remains free and is now generally available for GeForce and NVIDIA RTX Studio creators.\n\nOmniverse uses Pixar\u2019s open-standard Universal Scene Description (USD) to connect tools from more than 40 software development partners into a single 3D design platform. That lets creators across the globe collaborate in Omniverse on shared 3D workflows.\n\u201cThis is the future of 3D content creation and how virtual worlds will be built,\u201d Fisher said.\n\nHe detailed new capabilities in Omniverse, including:\n\nOmniverse Nucleus Cloud, a one-click-to-collaborate 3D scene sharing feature, now in early access\nUpdates to Omniverse Audio2Face, an AI-enabled app that animates a 3D face based on an audio track, including direct export to Epic\u2019s MetaHuman for creating realistic characters\nNew assets from Mechwarrior 5 and Shadow Warrior 3 added to the Omniverse Machinima library\nAnd a wealth of free digital assets now available in the Omniverse launcher from leading 3D marketplaces.\n\nIn addition, we\u2019ve upgraded NVIDIA Canvas, our Studio app that converts brushstrokes into photorealistic images. Available free to download here, it now supports 4x the resolution and new materials like flowers and bushes thanks to the efforts of NVIDIA researchers who developed GauGAN2.\nIt\u2019s part of NVIDIA Studio\u2019s broad and deep software stack, which accelerates more than 200 of the industry\u2019s top creative applications.\n\nAll that software is available in systems as svelte as the Razer Blade 14, a new ultraportable with an RTX 3080 Ti.\n\u201cI feel like I can go anywhere with it and still am able to produce the quality artwork that I could do at home,\u201d said a 3D artist who took it on a test drive and shared his experience in the special address.\nTaking AI to the Street\nIn autonomous cars and trucks \u2014 another hot topic at CES \u2014 NVIDIA announced more companies adopting its open DRIVE Hyperion platform that includes a high-performance computer and sensor architecture meeting the safety requirements of fully autonomous vehicles.\nThe latest generation DRIVE Hyperion 8 is designed with redundant NVIDIA DRIVE Orin systems-on-a-chip, 12 state-of-the-art surround cameras, nine radar, 12 ultrasonics, one front-facing lidar and three interior-sensing cameras. It\u2019s architected to be functionally safe, so that if one computer or sensor fails, there is a back up available to ensure that the AV can drive its passengers to a safe place.\nElectric vehicle makers such as Volvo-backed Polestar and EV companies in China, including NIO, Xpeng, Li Auto, R Auto and IM Motors have all adopted DRIVE Hyperion.\n\u201cThese new electric cars will get better and better over time with each over-the-air update,\u201d said Ali Kani, vice president and general manager of NVIDIA\u2019s automotive business.\n\u201cSuch companies can benefit from new business models that are software driven,\u201d he added.\n\nRobotaxi services like Cruise, Zoox and DiDi and trucking services like Volvo, Navistar and Plus are also embracing DRIVE Hyperion.\nAutonomous trucking company TuSimple announced at CES\u00a0that it will build its new platform on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin. It\u2019s working with leading delivery companies such as UPS, Navistar and Penske, and its technology has already improved arrival times for long-haul routes of the U.S. Postal Service.\nSuch vehicles will help fill an estimated shortage of more than 140,000 drivers by 2027 in the U.S. alone.\n\nIn addition, five leading automotive suppliers \u2014 Desay, Flex, Quanta, Valeo and ZF \u2014 now support DRIVE Hyperion.\nKani ended the session with a demo of NVIDIA DRIVE Concierge.\nAn always-on, digital assistant for drivers, it\u2019s one example of helpful agents created with NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar using the company\u2019s speech AI, computer vision, natural language understanding, recommendation engines and simulation technologies.\nDRIVE Concierge is the latest addition to NVIDIA\u2019s rich real-time, AI-based software stack for autonomous vehicles. The end-to-end solution also includes code to train AI models in the cloud and run complex simulations in data centers to safely test and validate an entire AV system.\n\u201cFrom AI in the car to AI in the cloud, NVIDIA is paving the way to safer and more efficient transportation,\u201d said Kani.\nFor more news, check out our CES page and watch the full special address below.\n\n\n\nCategories: Driving | GamingTags: 3D | 5G | Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Gaming | Creators | Esports | Events | G-SYNC | GeForce | GeForce NOW | GPU | Machine Learning | Media and Entertainment | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | NVIDIA DRIVE | NVIDIA RTX | NVIDIA Studio | Omniverse | Ray Tracing | Simulation and Design | Transportation | Universal Scene Description \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It was developed by bioinformatics platform DNAnexus, which lets scientists use Clara Parabricks running on NVIDIA GPUs in the AWS cloud.\n\u201cAs demonstrated by Regeneron, GPU acceleration with Clara Parabricks achieves the throughputs, speed and reproducibility needed when processing genomic datasets at scale,\u201d said Dr. Mark Effingham, deputy CEO of UK Biobank. \u201cThere are a number of research groups in the U.K. who were pushing for these accelerated tools to be available in our platform for use with our extensive dataset.\u201d\nRegeneron Exome Research Accelerated by Clara Parabricks\nRegeneron\u2019s researchers used the DeepVariant Germline Pipeline from NVIDIA Clara Parabricks to run their analysis with a model specific to the genetic center\u2019s workflow.\nIts researchers identified 12 million coding variants and hundreds of genes associated with health-related traits \u2014 certain genes were associated with increased risk for liver disease and eye disease, and others were linked to lower risk of diabetes and asthma.\nThe unique set of tools the researchers used for high-quality variant detection is available to UK Biobank registered users through the Research Analysis Platform. This capability will allow scientists to harmonize their own exome data with sequenced exome data from UK Biobank by running the same bioinformatics pipeline used to generate the initial reference dataset.\nCloud-Based Platform Improves Equity of Access\nResearchers deciphering the genetic codes of humans \u2014 and of the viruses and bacteria that infect humans \u2014 can often be limited by the computational resources available to them.\nUK Biobank is democratizing access by making its dataset open to scientists around the world, with a focus on further extending use by early-career researchers and those in low- and middle-income countries. Instead of researchers needing to download this huge dataset to use on their own compute resources, they can instead tap into UK Biobank\u2019s cloud platform through a web browser.\n\u201cWe were being contacted by researchers and clinicians who wanted to access UK Biobank data, but were struggling with access to the basic compute needed to work with even relatively small-scale data,\u201d said Effingham. \u201cThe cloud-based platform provides access to the world-class technology needed for large-scale exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing analysis.\u201d\nResearchers using the platform pay only for the computational cost of their analyses and for storage of new data they generate from the biobank\u2019s petabyte-scale dataset, Effingham said.\nUsing Clara Parabricks on DNAnexus helps reduce both the time and cost of this genomic analysis, delivering a whole exome analysis that would take nearly an hour of computation on a 32-vCPU machine in less than five minutes \u2014 while also reducing cost by approximately 40 percent.\nExome Sequencing Provides Insights for Precision Medicine\nFor researchers studying links between genetics and disease, exome sequencing is a critical tool \u2014 and the UK Biobank dataset includes nearly half a million participant exomes to work with.\nThe exome is approximately 1.5 percent of the human genome, and consists of all the known genes and their regulatory elements. By studying genetic variation in exomes across a large, diverse population, scientists can better understand the population\u2019s structure, helping researchers address evolutionary questions and describe how the genome works.\nWith a dataset as large as UK Biobank\u2019s, it is also possible to identify the specific genetic variants associated with inherited diseases, including cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative conditions and some kinds of cancer.\nExome sequencing can even shed light on potential genetic drivers that might increase or decrease an individual\u2019s risk of severe disease from COVID-19 infection, Effingham said. As the pandemic continues, UK Biobank is adding COVID case data, vaccination status, imaging data and patient outcomes for thousands of participants to its database.\nGet started with NVIDIA Clara Parabricks on the DNAnexus-developed UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform.

Learn More.\nWhether you are talking about autonomous cars, drones, robots, or static advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems and supercomputers, NVIDIA is usually the one constant across those AI segments. \nEven IBM, which is arguably the pioneer for AI development, works with NVIDIA for their advanced solutions.\nNVIDIA wasn\u2019t the first to see the opportunity for autonomous cars. But it pivoted so aggressively toward the opportunity, it\u2019s considered a pioneer of the technology \u2014 because it was one of, if not the first, to see the potential for it in drones, robots, and other AI applications.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat makes NVIDIA different is that its founder, president, and CEO, Jensen Huang, hasn\u2019t yet become distracted by his own compensation. Instead, Huang is a founder who remains wedded to his company\u2019s success and is willing to make big bets with the resulting big risks. And he seems to \u201cfund to the requirement\u201d of an initiative more often than his peers.\u00a0\u00a0\nLet\u2019s talk about why NVIDIA is so successful with AI.\nSee more: The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Market\nCEOs: Founders vs. External Hires\u00a0\nFor several reasons, company founders generally lose interest once their companies move from their startup phase and mature into a more stable company. This is for several reasons: they become massively wealthy; wealth gives them freedom to do other things they\u2019d rather do; the fun of the startup is replaced by the headaches of a public company, like fights with \u201cactivist\u201d investors; and their knowledge ages out, and they don\u2019t have the time or interest to retrain.\u00a0\u00a0\nFounders have unique protections afforded them by their status and the loyalty of a staff they had a major hand in hiring. They understand their company better than others because they built it. They often maintain some part of their startup mentality, allowing them to take risks. And those \u201cactivist\u201d investors are often overmatched by a founder in terms of influence. \nHired CEOs, particularly those who come from outside the company, don\u2019t enjoy the knowledge, loyalty, or drive that a founder does and can be more easily distracted by the perks of the job. More importantly, they are less willing to risk those perks by taking risks. Far too many hired CEOs don\u2019t even understand the market they\u2019ve been hired into. Apparently, company boards seem to think that CEO is a generic skill set.\u00a0\u00a0\nJensen Huang personifies a trifecta in that he has remained focused on the business, current with the technology, and he has the inherent loyalty of his people, which allows NVIDIA to outperform its peers consistently.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSee more: NVIDIA and the Move to a Virtual AI Future\nAnticipation and risk taking at the Top\nAutonomous robots were highlighted years ago at a Dell event as being one of the next big things in technology, but NVIDIA ran with that opportunity while Dell did not. This is the nature of risk taking, being able to not only anticipate a future opportunity but going all-in on it, so the success of the effort is more likely.\u00a0\u00a0\nOne of the recurring problems with CEOs is that they will approach a new opportunity tentatively to minimize risk, or they will fund to their expectations rather than fund to the requirements of a project.\u00a0\nWhen Jensen Huang decides on a direction, he appears to fully support it. And while he isn\u2019t always successful, he is far more successful than he would be if he regularly underfunded these efforts. The result is that we know him for his successes, while other CEOs are often defined by their failures. Huang is both willing to take necessary risks and isn\u2019t tentative in execution.\u00a0\u00a0\nWith both the iPod and iPhone, Steve Jobs acted similarly. This approach was so unusual that his competitors were convinced he would fail. The difference was that Jobs, like Huang, was willing to fund success, and failure simply wasn\u2019t an option, while their peers often either don\u2019t take the risk to begin with or seem to anticipate failure and work to assure the resulting blame doesn\u2019t fall on their desk.\u00a0\u00a0\nReaching Potential\nIn short, NVIDIA, as successful as it is, could still be just a fraction of what it will eventually become. \nBut that coming success will remain grounded in successful risk taking, funding to success, and both technical and operational competence by its leadership.\u00a0\u00a0\nSee more: Top Performing Artificial Intelligence (AI) Companies\n\n\nPrevious articleNVIDIA Addresses Supply Chain Issues With AI Autonomous Robot and Vehicle SolutionsNext articleRed Hat Integrates IT Automation for Hybrid Cloud With Microsoft Azure\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Subscribe to Data Insider                \n\n                    Learn the latest news and best practices about data science, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, data security, and more.                \n\n\n\n\n                        Email Address\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.                        \n\n\n\n                    Subscribe                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar articles\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nApplications\n8 Best Data Analytics Tools: Gain Data-Driven Advantage In 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nApplications\nCommon Data Visualization Examples: Transform Numbers into Narratives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBig Data\nWhat is Data Management?

Hell of an opening sentence to a new GPU review, I know, but that is the world we inhabit in 2022. Supply is constrained and demand is as sky-high as the prices of said GPUs. So, it was with a faint taste of something akin to hope on my lips I approached the launch of new mainstream graphics cards from both AMD and Nvidia.If you've peeped the lowest score I think I've given anything in my time since coming back to PC Gamer then you'll know how the AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT turned out. Now it's Nvidia's turn to either save the day or disappoint us all with the GeForce RTX 3050. I mean, there can't be any middle ground, can there? Somewhat inevitably, that's going to depend very much on your point of view.Still, I'm feeling a little better about the budget-conscious end of the PC gaming market since enjoying the fruits of Intel's Core i5 12400 labours, and its seemingly accidental overclocking bounty. A $200 chip that can comfortably nail 5.2GHz, with an affordable motherboard platform to boot? Well, that has the potential to be the perfect base for your next gaming rig. All we need is an affordable GPU to go with it.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5070 Ti review (MSI Ventus 3X)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5070 Founders Edition review\n\n\n\nThis is where Nvidia steps in with the nominally $250 RTX 3050, promising to blow the RX 6500 XT out of the water for just $50 more. As it turns out MSRPs evaporate as soon as the first wave of GPUs sell out\u2014generally in the first ten minutes\u2014so we have the $280 Gigabyte RTX 3050 Eagle here, which is actually marginally cheaper than the $300 Gigabyte RX 6500 XT we reviewed as our first taste of AMD's budget GPU.And it does indeed blow the RX 6500 XT out of the water. But we are still essentially talking about a new Nvidia graphics card with GTX 1660 Ti gaming performance, though one with the added veneer of ray tracing hardware and DLSS support.\u00a0Nvidia RTX 3050 specs(Image credit: Future)What are the RTX 3050 specs?The comparisons both AMD and Nvidia have made with their new cards generally hides where they actually sit in terms of relative performance. Both have spent an irrelevant amount of time putting their new cards up against the GTX 1650, with AMD also pitting the RX 6500 XT against the RX 570, and Nvidia the RTX 3050 against the GTX 1050.None of these comparisons make sense. The AMD card's poor performance is more ably highlighted by a comparison with the RX 5500 XT and RX 480\u2014similarly specced and priced cards from generations back\u2014and it is more meaningful to compare the RTX 3050 with the $279 GTX 1660 Ti than the $149 GTX 1650 or GTX 1050.Swipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 RTX 3050RTX 2060GTX 1660 TiGPUGA106TU106TU116Transistors12 billion10.8 billion6.6 billionDie size276mm2445mm2284mm2Streaming multiprocessors (SMs)203024CUDA cores256019201526Tensor Cores80240NART Cores2030NAROPs484848Base clock speed1,552MHz1,365MHz1,500MHzBoost clock speed1,777MHz1,680MHz1,770MHzMemory8GB GDDR66GB GDDR66GB GDDR6Memory bus128-bit192-bit192-bitMemory bandwidth224GB/s336GB/s288GB/sTGP130W160W120WReference price$249$349 (then $299)$279The GA106 GPU Nvidia reportedly has at the heart of the RTX 3050 is a smaller version than that used in the RTX 3060 which makes it roughly the same size as the chip used in the old GTX 1660 Ti. It does though have almost double the number of transistors at its heart and, thanks to the excellent Ampere architecture it comes with over one thousand more shaders inside it.\u00a0It is also notable that AMD's latest GPU, the Navi 24 silicon inside the RX 6500 XT is a 107mm2 chip, while the GA106 is something in the region of 276mm2. That's something which will likely come into play when it comes to manufacturing and the numbers of GPUs that each company can produce to fulfil the demand for their cards.Those 2,560 CUDA cores in the RTX 3050 are split between 20 SMs which also then delivers 20 RT cores and 80 Tensor cores. It's those last two specs that separate the RTX 3050 from its GTX 1660 Ti brethren and ought to make it a far more tempting choice for the mainstream gamer. The RT cores are what allow for ray tracing and the Tensor Cores then allow you to enable DLSS to make ray tracing actually playable at a decent frame rate, all thanks to the magic of AI-powered super sampling.The RTX 3050 has a similar total graphics power (TGP) compared with the GTX 1660 Ti, too, with 130W vs. 120W for the older card. Along with that extra 10W, you also get another 2GB of GDDR6 memory for a total of 8GB. Though that runs on a thinner 128-bit aggregated memory bus compared with the GTX 1660 Ti's 192-bit bus, which is why you end up with less memory bandwidth as a result.Nvidia RTX 3050 performance(Image credit: Future)How does the RTX 3050 perform?Our standard game benchmarks are always carried out without any form of resolution output modifiers to get an idea of the raw performance of any new GPU. As such we don't traditionally test with DLSS or FidelityFX Super Resolution enabled. Though, as more and more games are shipping with the technology, and a wider breadth of hardware supports it, it always has to be a consideration when we talk about the overall package of a new release.So, while the benchmarks highlight where the RTX 3050 is more or less akin to the GTX 1660 Ti in terms of its straight gaming performance, there is the promise of DLSS working those Tensor Cores to actually make the card a pretty capable 1440p gaming GPU where the technology is enabled.The same was true of the RX 6500 XT, with FidelityFX Super Resolution, too. But its severely restricted frame buffer means game performance is still pretty weak even with FSR enabled. It's also not as effective a solution as Nvidia's hardware-based DLSS tech.\u00a01080p gaming performanceImage 1 of 81440p gaming performanceImage 1 of 8New vs. OldImage 1 of 7Upscaling performanceImage 1 of 2(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)System performanceImage 1 of 3Nvidia RTX 3050 analysis(Image credit: Future)How does the RTX 3050 stack up?The GeForce RTX 3050 is a funny one. You could say Nvidia has pulled a similar move to AMD in creating a new graphics card with the same performance as that of a previous generation for effectively the same amount of money. We rightly castigated AMD for essentially giving us a worse version of the RX 480 nearly six years later, but you could say Nvidia has done only marginally better by just stepping one generation back to slightly better than GTX 1660 Ti performance.Though that is a little unfair because the Ampere architecture at the heart of the RTX 3050 is fundamentally better than that of the Turing GPU at the heart of the GTX 1660 Ti. Again, the same can be said of the RDNA 2 tech beating beneath the RX 6500 XT's oversized coolers, when compared to the Graphics Core Next (GCN) of the RX 480.This is where AMD's preference for openness and an aversion for fixed-function hardware does kind of backfire. While FSR is supported on a range of older AMD graphics cards, DLSS is restricted to those with the RTX prefix and the necessary GPU hardware. And that gives the RTX 3050 a definite edge over its Turing forebears and means that, while it is essentially the same price and very close in performance, the extra feature set makes it just about a worthy successor.\u00a0By a 2022 reckoning anyways. Which is always skewed away from the previous norms of the GPU world. Though if you're currently running a GTX 1660 Ti, I'd still say it's probably not worth the upgrade.I am a huge fan of DLSS, however, and it does mean that the RTX 3050 isn't just a good 1080p gaming GPU, it's actually capable of running happily on a 1440p display too. Though DLSS isn't in every game and Nvidia's new game-agnostic Nvidia Image Scaling (roughly analogous to FSR) is available to its older GPUs, too.But you do also get a little 1080p ray tracing support with the new RTX 3050. Again, that's thanks to DLSS now offering support for 1080p as a native resolution and rendering below that native res. There's less detail available, so it's tougher to get a great image, but DLSS still does an impressive job at allowing games such as Control and Wolfenstein Youngblood to offer playable ray tracing on a sub-$300 GPU.The tough thing is our traditional expectations, though. We always want more from successive generations, and that means we want more performance, not just access to more features from our GPUs. At a minimum, I would have wanted RTX 2060 levels of raw gaming performance, especially as that was a $299 card at the start of 2020 and we're looking at $280 cards right here with the RTX 3050.Then there's the thorny issue of stock, and how much Nvidia is able to get to its partners to make graphics cards and for them to get them into the channel for us to buy. We've been told that there is healthy stock available at launch and that there will definitely be reference-priced units there, too. But we're always told that, and stock always vanishes.It will this time, too, and the $250 reference-price units will last as long as the initial stock does, then I would bet we never see another MSRP card available again. That's part of the problem with Nvidia not creating reference-priced Founders Edition cards at this level of the GPU stack\u2014there's no competition for manufacturers wanting to pump out higher-priced options, and so that's all we'll see in retail after tomorrow's launch.Where I wanted at least RTX 2060 performance, I've got GTX 1660 Ti frame rates with a little RTX frosting on topThe hope is that, like the RX 6500 XT, there will continue to be RTX 3050 cards available weeks after launch and, even if they're not at MSRP, aren't topping the $300 mark. Please.Whether that happens remains to be seen. AMD has cut the RX 6500 XT GPU to shreds, so it's less than half the size of the GA106 GPU in the RTX 3050, which means it can theoretically manufacture far more in the same amount of time because it gets more chips out of the same size silicon wafer. Maybe that's why there are more Radeon cards available a week on from launch, maybe AMD's gamble has paid off.\u00a0We've got to hope that Nvidia is still able to keep the chips flowing from Samsung's 8nm fabs so the RTX 3050 remains in stock at a reasonable price. Because, while it's maybe not the stellar budget GPU we were hoping for, it's still an effective sub-$300 graphics card capable of utilising the best GPU tech of a generation and delivering a gaming upgrade for those on lower-spec silicon than a GTX 1660 Ti.Nvidia RTX 3050 verdict(Image credit: Future)Should you buy an RTX 3050?AMD and Nvidia have taken different approaches to the conundrum of creating a high-volume budget GPU in a chip shortage. AMD slashed the size of its silicon, betting on high clock speeds to give it just enough performance to offer some mainstream 1080p gaming chops, while its teeny tiny GPU meant it could manufacture more GPUs than the competition and effectively become the only option at this price.Nvidia has gone for a more performance-first tactic. Where the RTX 3050 and RX 6500 XT are effectively sitting in the same price bracket, you'd absolutely rather have the Nvidia card for the money. At worst it's 20% faster than the Radeon GPU, and can actually deliver 1440p gaming in places where the 4GB frame buffer of the RX 6500 XT won't allow it to tread foot. Throw the magic of DLSS into the mix\u2014still a more effective solution than FSR\u2014and the RTX 3050 looks like a certain winner in this head-to-head.But, where I wanted at least RTX 2060 performance, I've got GTX 1660 Ti frame rates with a little RTX frosting on top. Sure, that's tasty where it sticks, but is another example of a card designed and priced within the limits of a pandemic and a GPU shortage, rather than showing off Nvidia's silicon wizardry to its fullest.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050: Price Comparison483 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 \u00a3223.79View \u00a3238.15View \u00a3239.70View \u00a3254.40View \u00a3264.89ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \n\n\n\nThe Verdict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n77\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead our review policy \n\n\nGeForce RTX 3050\n\nWe're essentially looking at Nvidia taking away the 'GTX' prefix and giving us an RTX 1660 Ti.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Editor\u2019s note: This is one in a series of Meet the Omnivore posts, featuring individual creators and developers who use the NVIDIA Omniverse 3D simulation and collaboration platform to boost their artistic or engineering processes.\nBenny Dee\nBenjamin Sokomba Dazhi, aka Benny Dee, has learned the ins and outs of the entertainment industry from many angles \u2014 first as a rapper, then as a music video director and now as a full-time animator.\nAfter eight years of self-teaching, Dazhi has mastered the art of animation \u2014 landing roles as head animator for the film The Legend of Oronpoto, and as creator and director of the Cartoon Network Africa Dance Challenge, a series of dance-along animations that teaches children African-inspired choreography.\n\nBased in north-central Nigeria, Dazhi is building a team for his indie animation studio, JUST ART, which creates animation films focused on action, sci-fi, horror and humor.\nDazhi uses NVIDIA Omniverse \u2014 a physically accurate 3D design collaboration platform available with RTX-powered GPUs and part of the NVIDIA Studio suite of tools for creators \u2014 with Reallusion\u2019s iClone and Character Creator to supercharge his artistic workflow.\nHe uses Omniverse Connectors for Reallusion apps for character and prop creation and animation, set dressing and cinematics.\nMusic, Movies and Masterful Rendering\nFrom animated music videos to clips for action films, Dazhi has a multitude of projects \u2014 and accompanying deadlines.\n\n\u201cThe main challenges I faced when trying to meet deadlines were long render times and difficulties with software compatibility, but using an Omniverse Connector for Reallusion\u2019s iClone app has been game-changing for my workflow,\u201d he said.\nUsing Omniverse, Dazhi accomplishes lighting and materials setup, rendering, simulation and post-production processes.\nWith these tools, it took Dazhi just four minutes to render this clip of a flying car \u2014 a task, he said, that would have otherwise taken hours.\n\u201cThe rendering speed and photorealistic output quality of Omniverse is a breakthrough \u2014 and Omniverse apps like Create and Machinima are very user-friendly,\u201d he said.\nSuch 3D graphics tools are especially important for the development of indie artists, Dazhi added.\n\u201cIn Nigeria, there are very few animation studios, but we are beginning to grow in number thanks to easy-to-use tools like Reallusion\u2019s iClone, which is the main animation software I use,\u201d he said.\nDazhi plans to soon expand his studio, working with other indie artists via Omniverse\u2019s real-time collaboration feature. Through his films, he hopes to show viewers \u201cthat it\u2019s more than possible to make high-end content as an indie artist or small company.\u201d\nSee Dazhi\u2019s work in the NVIDIA Omniverse Gallery, and hear more about his creative workflow in his community spotlight livestream:\n\nCreators can download NVIDIA Omniverse for free and get started with step-by-step tutorials on the Omniverse YouTube channel.

Just as the name says on the tin, this latest GeForce card is more or less a version of the existing RTX 3080 with 12GB of memory, and the additional capacity and memory bandwidth benefits that come from that. This latest video card launch is relatively subdued launch for the company, and NVIDIA is not making much fanfare for the new card \u2013 nor are they announcing a price for it.\nThe third member of the RTX 3080 family comes as the cryptocurrency-driven GPU shortage has officially entered its second year. NVIDIA and its partners are selling every card they can make, and as a result traditional product stack logic has gone flying out the window at 360 fps. Instead, NVIDIA (and AMD) are left optimizing their product stacks to best match that insatiable demand, along with getting every useable chip in a card and on the market. And even with NVIDIA having switched its non-3090 cards to Ethereum hashrate nerfed LHR versions over half a year ago, there\u2019s no immediate sign that the heavy demand for video cards will wind down any time soon.\nConsequently, NVIDIA isn\u2019t saying much about the new RTX 3080 SKU, primarily because they don\u2019t need to. Which to be sure isn\u2019t a criticism of NVIDIA, but it is a sign of the times. Officially the card exists for high-end gaming, but NVIDIA isn\u2019t bothering to put together any kind of promotional campaign outlining the benefits of the card, or why they thought it necessary to introduce a 12GB SKU now, etc. Even the announcement of the card itself was buried in an announcement about DLSS support for a port of a Playstation 4 game (God of War). Simply put, the GeForce RTX 3080 12GB now exists, and for right now that\u2019s enough for NVIDIA.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nRTX 3080 Ti\nRTX 3080 12GB\nRTX 3080 10GB\nRTX 3070 Ti\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n10240\n8960\n8704\n5888\n\n\nROPs\n112\n96\n96\n96\n\n\nBase Clock\n1.37GHz\n1.26GHz\n1.44GHz\n1.58GHz\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1.67GHz\n1.71GHz\n1.71GHz\n1.77GHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n19Gbps GDDR6X\n19Gbps GDDR6X\n19Gbps GDDR6X\n19Gbps GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n384-bit\n384-bit\n320-bit\n256-bit\n\n\nVRAM\n12GB\n12GB\n10GB\n8GB\n\n\nSingle Precision Perf.\n34.1 TFLOPS\n30.6 TFLOPS\n29.8 TFLOPS\n21.7 TFLOPS\n\n\nTensor Perf.

The high point is of course the memory capacity, but there are actually a few different things going on here.\nOn the GPU front, NVIDIA is actually using a slightly better version of their venerable GA102 GPU, which now is used across 5 different desktop video cards. The version of the GA102 used here has a slight increase in the number of SMs enabled versus the OG RTX 3080, with 70 SMs as opposed to 68 on the original card. Clockspeeds have also changed a bit; while the official boost clock rating is still 1.71GHz, the base clockspeed for the new SKU is 1.26GBz, 180MHz below the more basic 3080. Ultimately this seems to be a function of TDP, as the additional memory and additional transistors being lit up on the GPU will increase the power needs of the card, especially in a maximum-load scenario.\nAs for the memory, the increase to 12GB of GDDR6X comes with a matching increase in the width of the memory bus. The RTX 3080 12GB sees GA102\u2019s full 384-bit memory bus enabled, reflecting the addition of 2 more GDDR6X memory chips (64-bits) to the memory bus, bringing the total to 12 chips/384-bits. According to NVIDIA\u2019s specifications, they\u2019re using the same 19Gbps GDDR6X chips here as on the classic RTX 3080, so memory clockspeeds have neither been dialed up or dialed down. So the expansion of the memory bus brings with it both an additional 2GB of VRAM \u2013 which will come in handy at 4K \u2013 as well as a 20% increase in memory bandwidth. Compared to the 10GB RTX 3080 and its 760GB/second of memory bandwidth, the 12GB RTX 3080 offers 912GB/second of bandwidth.\nBut to pay the bill for all of this, so-to-speak, the TDP of the newer 12GB SKU is also higher than the 10GB cards. Here NVIDIA\u2019s official/minimum TDP has gone from 320W to 350W, a 9% increase. And as we noted before, even with this TDP increase, the minimum/base clockspeed still needed to be turned down a bit. This gives the RTX 3080 12GB the same official TDP ratings as both the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3090, and if these values are accurate, then it implies that the new card will have the lowest energy efficiency out of all of them.\nSpeaking of the RTX 3080 Ti, the configuration of the new card immediately raises the question of what to expect in terms of performance versus NVIDIA\u2019s best 3080 card \u2013 itself essentially a slightly cheaper RTX 3090. The RTX 3080 Ti was about 10% faster than the original RTX 3080, and while benchmarks will be needed to draw exact figures, I expect the RTX 3080 12GB to essentially split the difference. That would put it around 5% faster than the OG card, and the RTX 3080 Ti about 5% faster than that. But along with underscoring the fact that this is an estimate, it should be noted that the difference will vary from game to game, and that games that are especially bandwidth sensitive have the most to gain, particularly at 4K.\nUnfortunately, pricing won\u2019t offer much of a guide here. Seeing as how NVIDIA isn\u2019t even selling an Founder\u2019s Edition of the card, they\u2019re not providing an official MSRP \u2013 and it\u2019s not as if the irrational market would follow it anyhow. The best guidance we have right now is looking at what NVIDIA\u2019s board partners are charging/trying to charge for their cards. And in that case, the cheapest RTX 3080 12GB being listed this morning is an EVGA model at $1249. That\u2019s $50 over the RTX 3080 Ti MSRP and $40 over their own cheapest RTX 3080 Ti, but also generally a couple of hundred below the rest of their RTX 3080 Ti lineup.\nAt best, it\u2019s fair to say that the RTX 3080 12GB is unlikely to be priced much differently than the RTX 3080 Ti. Which shouldn\u2019t be too surprising since so much of the current crypto ecosystem is based around memory bandwidth, and the two cards are identical in that respect. Though even in a gaming context, the RTX 3080 12GB is very likely to be within a few percent of the RTX 3080 Ti. Put another way, don\u2019t expect to pay less than $1200 for the RTX 3080 12GB, even if you can get it at manufacturer (as opposed to market) prices. Otherwise the more positive news, at least, is that even following the launch of the new card, according to NVIDIA the RTX 3080 classic isn't going away; so it will still be produced for the consumer market.\nWrapping things up, expect to see cards in the coming days and weeks from the usual suspects, including EVGA, Zotac, ASUS, Gigabyte, and MSI. NVIDIA is not announcing a hard availability date, so given the ongoing GPU shortage, we expect to see cards slowly filter into the market, and then leave it almost immediately.

But every now and then you have to give into the absurdity of the current situation.\n\n\n\nFreckledTrout - Wednesday, January 12, 2022 - link\nLOL You have a point.  \n\n\n\nat_clucks - Wednesday, January 12, 2022 - link\nGPU MSRP these days is the least useful number one could post or rely on for anything. It's the homeopathy of pricing, where you dilute it's meaning until none of the original is left but somehow it's supposed to convey a message.Also... that 350W TDP :(.\n\n\n\nSamus - Friday, January 14, 2022 - link\nI'm still struggling with my GTX970 (even in Battlefield 2042!) because I just can't justify spending $500+ on a videocard (like the 1660) that isn't even that much faster or worse, $1000+ on a videocard that's actually a compelling upgrade.It's ridiculous this has been the case for nearly two years.\n\n\n\nIcehawk - Saturday, January 15, 2022 - link\nI had a 970 as well, after 13mos on waitlist got an evga 3080 for $929 - eesh!  On the upside I got $180 on ebay for the 6yr old $329 970.  Figured with the market so bad and how long the last card went I might as well spend the money.\n\n\n\nSilver5urfer - Tuesday, January 11, 2022 - link\nHorrible move by Ngreedia, not surprising but expected when they started the BS of 3090 Ti.Nvidia hates the $700 price of the GA102 chip flagship, cheap and best card for the money to play all titles until today at 1080P with great FPS and supports Windows 7 too.Now this 2GB pathetic VRAM does nothing but alleviate some Ubitrash optimization at best. And 4K will still suffer as the card sees it's age. Then the whole TDP is increased, more fan speed for that chassis however it's just 9% not very high so it will handle unlike that POS 3080Ti which uses 3080 chassis for 3090 class of silicon.Now the mining BS, this is probably LHR ? Still the mining can be bypassed anyways. So not a big deal, however the big deal is the price gouging and stage setup for Ampere successor Lovelace. Now the price is $1000-$1200 for this card due to AIB mark up. The 3090Ti was a showcase on how they castrated the 3090 for greed and now using the better Micron chips for better cooling too and the price ? no one knows yet, maybe $1700 MSRP. Ebay and others $5000 probably since 3090 FE is $3000+Next wave of products this year paired with the 6% inflation would cause huge problems with DIY space. DDR5 memory price increase, PCIe5.0 price increase, new GPUs with high TDP and power more price increase, new PSUs for flagship due to rumored 500-600W TDP with new connector with sense pins. More and more trash AAA games with political baggage and censorship.It's really awful state tbh. Only silver lining is the best GPUs are out already if anyone can manage to get hands on and use their PC as long as possible.\n\n\n\nGolgatha777 - Tuesday, January 11, 2022 - link\nSeems like an opportunity to increase the average selling price by 30-40% during a component shortage, get rid of a value part in the product stack (because why would you put your limited supply of memory on a cheaper board), and all the while provide no tangible benefit to the consumer. \n\n\n\nCygni - Tuesday, January 11, 2022 - link\nThis is a luxury toy in insanely high demand, not insulin or grain. If you don't like it, don't buy it. AMD will be happy to sell you a 6500 for 299 euro instead.\n\n\n\nballsystemlord - Tuesday, January 11, 2022 - link\nWhat if I don't buy so that demand goes down and then we get our cost effective GPUs of old back?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Nvidia popularized it in 1999 by marketing the GeForce 256 add-in board (AIB) as\u00a0the world\u2019s first fully integrated graphics processing unit. It offered integrated transform, lighting, triangle setup/clipping, and rendering engines in a single-chip processor.Very-large-scale integrated circuits, or VLSI, started taking hold of the semiconductor industry in the early 1990s. As the number of transistors engineers could cram on a single chip increased almost exponentially, the number of functions in the CPU and the graphics processor increased. One of the biggest strains on the CPU was graphics transformation compute elements into graphics processors. Architects from various graphics chip companies decided transform-and-lighting (T&L) was a function that should be in the graphics processor. The operation was known at the time as transform and lighting (T&L). A T&L engine is a vertex shader and a geometry translator.\u00a0In 1997, 3Dlabs developed its Glint Gamma processor, the first programmable transform and lighting engine as part of its Glint workstation graphics chips, and it introduced the term GPU\u2014geometry processor unit. The GPU was a separate chip named Delta (also known as the DMX). 3Dlabs\u2019 GMX was a co-processor to the Glint rasterizer.\u00a0Then, in October 1999, Nvidia introduced the NV10 GPU with an integrated T&L engine for a new consumer graphics card. ATI quickly followed with their Radeon graphics chip and called it a visual processing unit\u2014VPU. But Nvidia came out ahead in the terminology wars and has since been associated with the GPU and credited with inventing it.\u00a0Based on TSMC\u2019s 220-nm process, the 120 MHz NV10 had 17 million transistors in a 139 mm\u00b2 die and used DirectX 7.0. The\u00a0GeForce\u00a0256 AIB employed the NV10 with SDR memory.Before Nvidia started offering Nvidia-branded AIBs, the company depended on partners to build and sell the boards. However, Nvidia offered reference designs to its OEM partners.The first AIB to use the 64 MB SDR was ELSA\u2019s ERAZOR X which used its own design to create a NLX form factor board.Figure 1: Elsa NV10-baed Erazor X AIB.The GPU had a large 128-bit memory interface, and it could use DDR or SGRAM memory, a choice made by OEM board partners and usually done as a price-performance trade-off. The AIB shown in the above image has four 8 MB SGRAM chips. Since it was a 1999 AIB, it used the AGP 4X interface with sustained DMA, and supported the Direct3D 7.0 API and OpenGL 1.2.1 with transform & lighting.Figure 2: Nvidia GeForce 256 (NV10).The chip had many advanced features, including four independent pipelined engines that ran at 120 MHz. That allowed the GPU to produce a 480 Mpix/sec fill rate. The video output was VGA. The chip also came with hardware alpha-blending and was HDTV compliant.In addition to advanced graphical features, the chip also had a powerful video processing capability. It had a TV out capability and integrated NTSC/PAL encoders. It supported S-VHS and Composite video-input, and stereo 3D.Integrating transform and lighting capability into the GPU was a significant differentiator for the GeForce 256. Before the stand-alone T&L processor from 3Dlabs, previous 3D accelerators used the CPU to run these functions. Incorporating the T&L capability reduced costs for consumer AIBs while at the same time improving performance. Prior to the GF256, only professional AIBs designed for CAD had a T&L co-processor engine. It also expanded Nvidia\u2019s market by allowing the company to professional graphics market. Nvidia marketed those AIBs as Quadro. The Quadro AIB used the same NV10 as the GeForce AIBs and used certified drivers for various professional graphics applications.This article is part of the\u00a0Electronics History\u00a0series:\u00a0The Graphics Chip Chronicles.

All references to the name have been updated in this blog.\nManufacturing and fulfillment centers are profoundly complex. Whenever new earbuds or socks land at your doorstep in hours or a vehicle rolls off an assembly line, a maze of magic happens with AI-driven logistics.\nMassive facilities like these are constantly in flux. Robots travel miles of aisles to roll up millions of products to assist teams of moving people. Obstacles are ever present.\nToday we\u2019re introducing the Isaac platform for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to\u00a0 optimize operational efficiency and accelerate deployment of AMRs. Isaac for AMR extends NVIDIA Isaac capabilities for building and deploying robotics applications, bringing mapping, site analytics and fleet optimization onto NVIDIA-Certified Systems.\n\nIndustrial facilities of this type can be as big as city blocks or stadiums. They are constantly reconfigured or scaled up to meet product demands of the moment. Path planning and rerouting for autonomous robots need to move in lockstep.\nAt industrial scale, even small routing optimizations can save billions of dollars in the $9 trillion logistics industry.\nAutonomous mobile robot deployments are estimated to reach 53,000 sites by 2025, up from 9,000 in 2020, according to Interact Analysis. Meanwhile, supply chains strain to keep up with increasing e-commerce amid worker shortages and COVID-19 restrictions.\nOne hurdle is the ability to rapidly and autonomously develop high-accuracy robot maps. They need to be continuously updated as operations scale or fluctuate. And increasing situational awareness of changing environments for mobile robots and continuously reoptimizing the routes \u2014\u00a0 all while developing new skill sets through simulation \u2014 is paramount to operational efficiency.\nIsaac for AMR is the result of years of research and product development at NVIDIA. The framework is available on the NVIDIA NGC software hub and within the NVIDIA Omniverse platform, tapping into Metropolis and cuOpt at first, and soon DeepMap and more NVIDIA technologies.\nScaling Operations With Isaac for AMR\nThe AI and computing challenges of autonomous mobile robots for manufacturing and fulfillment aren\u2019t all that different from those of autonomous vehicles.\nObstacles and people must be avoided. Destinations need to be reached. Thousands of sensors driven by GPU-accelerated algorithms help fleets of autonomous robots solve the traveling salesman problem \u2014 finding the shortest path between multiple destinations \u2014\u00a0 among ever-changing industrial workflows in real time.\nThe Isaac for AMR platform uses NVIDIA Omniverse for creating digital twins of the facility where AMRs will be deployed. NVIDIA Isaac Sim (built on Omniverse) simulates the behavior of robot fleets, people and other machines in the digital twins with high-fidelity physics and perception. It also enables synthetic data generation for training of AI models.\nIsaac for AMR consists of GPU-accelerated AI technologies and SDKs including DeepMap, cuOpt and Metropolis. These technologies are securely orchestrated and cloud delivered with NVIDIA Fleet Command.\nDeepMap Delivers Mapping Advances\nNVIDIA\u2019s recent acquisition of DeepMap brings advances in mapping for autonomous vehicles to the AMR industry as well.\nAMR deployments can access the DeepMap platform\u2019s cloud-based SDK to help accelerate robot mapping of large facilities from weeks to days, while achieving centimeter-level accuracy.\nThe DeepMap Update Client enables robot maps to be updated as frequently as necessary, in real time. And the DeepMap SDK delivers layers of intelligence to maps by adding semantic understanding \u2014 so robots can identify the objects pixels represent and know if they can move one way or not. It\u2019s also capable of addressing both indoor and outdoor map building.\nAs part of Isaac for AMR, NVIDIA DeepMap integrates with other components, such as Metropolis, cuOpt, Isaac Sim via Omniverse and more.\nNVIDIA Metropolis Adds Real-Time Situational Awareness\nMapping doesn\u2019t account for everything in these environments. And the advanced sensors onboard AMRs aren\u2019t always sufficient to ensure safe and efficient operation.\nThe NVIDIA Metropolis video analytics platform meets the need for higher level real-time \u201coutside-in\u201d perception by providing access to cameras and sensors deployed all over the factory or warehouse floor.\nWith Metropolis, AMRs have access to additional layers of situational awareness on the factory floor, enabling them to avoid high-congestion areas, eliminating blind spots and enhanced visibility of both people and other AMRs. In addition, Metropolis\u2019s pre-trained models provide a head start in customizing for site-specific needs.\ncuOpt Libraries Transform Logistics\u00a0\nNVIDIA cuOpt AI software libraries can be used to optimize vehicle route planning and logistics in real time, which can be applied to fleets of AMRs.\nMany factors need to be considered in deciding the optimal AMR fleet size to be deployed for large, complex environments. Robot speeds, battery life, transport size and weight, and facilities layout all factor in.\nCompanies can simulate (using Isaac Sim) multiple AMR interactions with NVIDIA cuOpt. These can happen quickly and accurately in digital twins of environments such as warehouses. And they can be implemented before deploying robots in production as situations change, saving time and money.\nAnd, once deployed, routes have to be continuously re-optimized to deliver the most operational efficiency. NVIDIA cuOpt provides for dynamic reoptimization of routes to a fleet of heterogeneous AMRs based on a number of constraints.\n\nDeploying AMRs Into Production\nAvailable on NVIDIA-Certified Systems, the Isaac AMR platform enhances the development of AI-driven logistics by providing a complete path to build industrial and human-robot simulations as well as route optimizations.\nIsaac for AMR is built to be enterprise class and cloud ready. The NVIDIA technologies presented as part of Isaac for AMR can be securely deployed and managed on servers with NVIDIA Fleet Command.\n\u00a0\n\nCheck out the latest developments on Omniverse, Metropolis, DeepMap and cuOpt.\nLearn more about the Isaac Robotics Platform\u00a0and use the contact us form on the portal if you have any questions.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: GPU | Isaac | Metropolis | Omniverse \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The machines, built on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano module, can also detect egg characteristics such as size and fertility status.\nThe devices then automatically sort the eggs based on these characteristics, allowing Jensorter\u2019s customers in Alaska, the Pacific Northwest and Russia to quickly separate viable eggs from unhealthy ones \u2014 and protect them accordingly.\nJensorter is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program that nurtures cutting-edge startups revolutionizing industries with advancements in AI, data science, high performance computing and more.\nPicking Out the Good Eggs\nAccording to Curt Edmondson, patent counsel and CTO of Jensorter, many fisheries aim to quickly dispose of unhealthy eggs to lower the risk of infecting healthy ones.\nUsing AI, Jensorter machines look at characteristics like color to discern an egg\u2019s health status and determine whether it\u2019s fertilized \u2014 at a speed of about 30 milliseconds per egg.\n\u201cOur fish egg sorters are achieving a much higher accuracy with the addition of AI powered by NVIDIA Jetson, which is allowing us to create advanced capabilities,\u201d Edmondson said.\nThe startup offers several machines, each tailored to varying volumes of eggs to be sorted. The Model JH device, optimal for egg volumes of three to 10 million, can sort nearly 200,000 eggs per hour, eliminating the slow and laborious process of hand-picking.\n\u201cUsing AI to capture and process images of eggs in real time could have great value over the long term,\u201d Edmondson said. \u201cIf hatcheries come together and centralize their images in a database, we could identify patterns of egg characteristics that lead to healthy eggs.\u201d\nThis could help propagate salmon and trout, species that play important roles in their ecosystems and are common food sources for humans, and which are on the decline in many areas, he added.\nThe Oregon Hatchery Research Center recently used Jensorter devices to conduct an alpha test examining whether smaller eggs lead to healthier fish. In the spring, the center will use the machines to proceed with beta testing in hatcheries, before publishing study results.\nJensorter also plans to create next-generation sorters that are faster still and can detect, count and separate eggs based on their sex, number of zygotes and other metrics that would be useful to fisheries.\nWatch a tutorial on how Jensorter equipment works and learn more about NVIDIA Inception.\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | Inception | Jetson \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia researchers have published an article detailing the various ways the company is exploring how Multi Chip Module (MCM) designs can be deployed for future products. As computing becomes more and more heterogeneous, Nvidia seems to be looking for a way to add flexibility to its semiconductor designs. This could be achieved by \"mix and matching\" different hardware blocks according to the intended workloads, and that's exactly where MCM comes in.\n\nThe first factual information on AMD's research into MCM came to light in 2017, when the company demonstrated how an MCM design with four chiplets could outperform the biggest monolithic GPU that could be built at the time by a whopping 45.5%. Cutting up a large die into several smaller ones helps improve yields (smaller dies have fewer chances of having critical manufacturing defects), and also allows for more computing resources to be chained together than a single, monolithic die ever could. Of course, being smaller, these chips should also present better thermals and power efficiency than their larger brethren.\n\nNvidia's doubling-down on MCM GPUs is called the Composable On Package GPU, or COPA. This latest research piece is more concerned with how Nvidia will handle the increasing differentiation between HPC and AI workloads, which have been drifting apart for a while now. Clearly, Nvidia is concerned that its single-product approach (read: the GA100 accelerator and its predecessors) will start losing ground towards the increasing workload specialization in those areas.A diagram comparing a monolithic GPU, which crams all the execution units and caches for a true general purpose GPU. COPA allows for the mix and match of different hardware blocks, building upon certain workload requirements in detriment of others, and a higher number of more specialized (and more performant) chip designs. (Image credit: Nvidia)To that effect, Nvidia has been simulating how different MCM designs and configurations could allow it to mix and match the required hardware blocks for each workload. The paper shows how a 25% memory bandwidth reduction actually only slows down HPC workloads by an average of 4%. Cutting the available bandwidth by a further 25% added another 10% performance penalty. So with 50% less memory bandwidth (and removing the hardware that enables it), Nvidia can claw back chip space for other, more appropriate hardware blocks that would deliver more performance than has been lost for the appropriate workload.\n\nNot all hardware blocks are made equal, however. Certain hardware blocks can't currently be separated without incurring extreme performance penalties. COPA is Nvidia's attempt to simulate the effects of multiple chiplet design decisions, and how they relate to performance.\n\nThe company's approach prioritizes the high-margin HPC and AI markets first, which makes sense, especially considering how multiple companies have been encroaching on that space with their own custom solutions (for example, Cerebras with its Wafer Scale Engine and Lightelligence with its photonics-based PACE). However, this same workload-semiconductor philosophy can be applied across Nvidia's GPU-based product stack, including consumer GeForce.\n\nMCM for GeForce does present more difficulties, of course. Scaling workloads that are already designed to be split up across potentially thousands of nodes in a supercomputer is inherently different from scaling real-time gaming workloads. In fact, Nvidia has basically pulled the plug on SLI (scalable link interface) multi-GPU gaming solutions. MCM will need higher interlinks between the various GPU blocks if it's to be usable for gaming without the need for duplicated resources and alternate frame rendering.\n\nAMD has already shown us what MCM can do for cost, power, and performance in the CPU space with its Zen architecture and subsequent iterations. MCM in GPUs is arguably a more difficult achievement, but technology will get us there. When it does, Nvidia will be composing GPUs out of multiple IP hardware blocks, employing a modular approach to chip design, and will likely have a much more specialized product portfolio according to the computing needs of the time.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (4)\n\n\n\nFrancisco PiresSocial Links NavigationFreelance News WriterFrancisco Pires is a freelance news writer for Tom's Hardware with a soft side for quantum computing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about gpus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI Afterburner update enables RTX 50 series owners to push their GDDR7 VRAM up to 36 GT/s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD manager reports 45% GPU retail market share in Japan \u2014 Eyes 70% as the next target\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm debuts new Snapdragon G handheld gaming PC chips to compete with Intel and AMD\n\n\n\nSee more latest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Comments\n\nComment from the forums\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVforV\n\n\nYeah, they need to \"explore\" harder because AMD already shipped their server MCM GPUs and soon\u2122, later this year Radeon will have RDNA3 gaming GPUs with MCM and still nvidia will be on monolithic design.

The card is ultimate in every sense, graphics performance, power, pricing. It is just designed for the ultimate enthusiast gamers out there and considering what NVIDIA has teased about this card, it's sure going to be one of a kind beast!\n\nNVIDIA designed the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti not just for the ultimate gamer but also professional content creators too who also want to have the best graphics performance at hand to power the next-generation of AAA gaming titles with superb visuals and insane fluidity. It's not just the FPS that matters these days, it's visuals, and a smoother frame rate too and this is exactly what the GeForce RTX 30 series is made to excel at.\nContent Creators Dream GPU\nThe GeForce RTX 3090 Ti is an artists\u2019 dream and tailored for advanced creators, allowing them to edit insanely large models, work on production-quality video, or edit in multiple apps at the same time. Rendering in applications such as Blender, Maya or Cinema4D not only requires a more powerful GPU, they require more GPU memory. The RTX 3090 Ti delivers between 42%-102% more performance than the RTX 2080 Ti and TITAN RTX in these rendering apps. And because the RTX 3090 Ti features a massive 24 GB of memory, it can handle datasets that are twice as large as those that fit into the memory footprint of the original RTX 3080 Ti.\nVideo editors will see huge advantages as well. For example, working with 8K RAW projects in DaVinci Resolve featuring REDCODE, Raw (R3D) files uses most of the 10GB of memory available on the original GeForce RTX 3080 Ti. Adding a GPU memory-intensive effect such as Temporal Noise reduction, or SpeedWarp retiming can easily exceed the memory available on the RTX 3080 Ti, resulting in out-of-memory errors within the application. Performing the same memory-intensive operations with the RTX 3090 Ti allows editing to continue normally without having to reduce the project complexity.\nMarvels of NVIDIA Ampere Architecture - 2nd Generation RTX\nEnabling the blistering performance of the new RTX 30 Series GPUs and the NVIDIA Ampere architecture are cutting-edge technologies and over two decades of graphics R&D, including:\n\nNew streaming multiprocessors:\u00a0The building block for the world\u2019s fastest, most efficient GPU, delivering 2x the FP32 throughput of the previous generation, and 40 Shader-TFLOPS of processing power.\nSecond-gen RT Cores:\u00a0New dedicated RT Cores deliver 2x the throughput of the previous generation, plus concurrent ray tracing and shading and compute, with 78 RT-TFLOPS of processing power.\nThird-gen Tensor Cores:\u00a0New dedicated Tensor Cores, with up to 2x the throughput of the previous generation, making it faster and more efficient to run AI-powered technologies, like\u00a0NVIDIA DLSS, and 320 Tensor-TFLOPS of processing power.\nNVIDIA RTX IO:\u00a0Enables rapid GPU-based loading and game asset decompression, accelerating input/output performance by up to 100x compared with hard drives and traditional storage APIs. In conjunction with Microsoft\u2019s new DirectStorage for Windows API,\u00a0RTX IO\u00a0offloads dozens of CPU cores\u2019 worth of work to the RTX GPU, improving frame rates and enabling near-instantaneous game loading.\nWorld\u2019s fastest graphics memory:\u00a0NVIDIA has worked with Micron to create the world\u2019s fastest discrete graphics memory for the RTX 30 Series, GDDR6X. It provides data speeds of 1TB/s system memory bandwidth for graphics card applications, maximizing game and app performance.\nNext-gen process technology:\u00a0New 8N NVIDIA custom process from Samsung, which allows for higher transistor density and more efficiency.\n\nIf the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti isn't your thing and way out of your budget plans, there's also the entry-level GeForce RTX 3050 that NVIDIA will be offering at a starting MSRP of $249 US and a design focused on gamers first!\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti 24 GB Graphics Card Specifications\nAt the heart of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics card lies the GA102 GPU. The GA102 is the flagship gaming GPU and also the fastest gaming GPU that NVIDIA has produced. The GPU is based on Samsung's 8nm custom process node designed specifically for NVIDIA and features a total of 28 Billion transistors. It measures 628mm2 which makes it the 2nd biggest gaming GPU ever produced right below the Turing TU102 GPU which powered the RTX 2080 Ti and Titan RTX.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe new shader core on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture is 2.7x faster, the new RT cores are 1.7x faster while the new Tensor cores are up to 2.7x faster than the previous generation Turing GPUs. The 2nd Generation RT core delivers dedicated hardware-accelerated ray-tracing performance & features twice the ray/triangles intersection with concurrent RT graphics and compute operations.\nFor the GeForce RTX 3090, NVIDIA has enabled a total of 84 SM units on its flagship which results in a total of 10,752 CUDA cores (vs 82 SM / 10496 cores on RTX 3090 Non-Ti). In addition to the CUDA cores, NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti also comes packed with next-generation RT (Ray-Tracing) cores, Tensor cores, and brand new SM or streaming multi-processor units. The GPU runs at a base clock speed of 1560 MHz and a boost clock speed of 1860 MHz. The card has a TDP of 450W (a 100 Watt increase over the RTX 3090).\n\nIn terms of memory, the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti comes packed with 24 GB of memory and that too the next-generation GDDR6X design. With Micron's latest and greatest graphics memory dies, the RTX 3090 Ti can deliver GDDR6X memory speeds of 21 Gbps. That along with a bus interface of 384-bit will deliver a cumulative bandwidth of 1008 Gbps.\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics card is also going to be the first PCIe Gen 5.0 compliant graphics card, rocking a single 16-pin power connector that can supply up to 600 Watts of power to the card. The new connector is rated for 600W power delivery is PCIe Gen 5.0 compatible & not designed for legacy PCIe Gen 2 or Gen 3 cards. All cards with a PCIe Gen 5 interface will come with a 3x 8-pin to 1x 16-pin connector adapter within the package. The Founders Edition is also going to utilize what seems to be an updated revision of the PG136 PCB board known as PG136C.\n\nAmphenol ICC introduces the Gen 5, Minitek Pwr PCIe connector system. This new introduction CEM 5.0 PCI Express 12VHPWR auxiliary hybrid connector and cable assembly support the 600W GPU cards. The 12VHPWR connector is not designed to mate with legacy PCI Express 2x3 and 2x4 12V Auxiliary Power connectors. The 12VHPWR connector power pins have a 3.00mm pitch, while the contacts in a legacy 2x3 and 2x4 connector lie on a larger 4.20mm pitch. New PCIe Connector System (CEM5) is designed for power applications with current rating upto 9.5A/pin (12 pins energized) and the 4 signal pins supporting signal transmission.\n\nRated current up to 9.5A per contact with all 12 power contacts and 4 Signal contacts\nFully isolated terminals\nPositive locking on housing with low thumb latch operation\nLow level contact resistance: 6m\u2126 max.\n\n\n\nAs for its feature set, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti 24 GB graphics card rocks all the modern NV feature set such as the latest NVENC Encoder and NVCDEC Decoder, support for the latest APIs, 2nd Generation ray-tracing cores, 3rd Gen Tensor cores. It packs all the modern RTX features such as DLSS, Reflex, Broadcast, Resizable-BAR, Freestyle, Ansel, Highlights, Shadowplay, and G-SYNC support too.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series Graphics Card Specifications\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 12 GBNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 6 GB\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA102-350?Ampere GA102-300Ampere GA102-225Ampere GA102-220Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA104-400Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA104Ampere GA104-200\nAmpere GA103-200Ampere GA106-300Ampere GA106Ampere GA106-150Ampere GA107-325\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie Size628.4mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2 (GA104)276mm2276mm2276mm2 (GA106)200mm2 (GA107)\n\n\nTransistors28 Billion28 Billion28 Billion28 Billion28 Billion17.4 Billion17.4 Billion17.4 Billion17.4 Billion (GA104)13.2 Billion13.2 Billion13.2 Billion (GA106)8.7 Billion (GA107)\n\n\nCUDA Cores1075210496102408960870461445888486448643584358425602048\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs336 / 112328 / 112320 / 112280 / 104272 / 96184 / 96184 / 96152 / 80152 / 80112 / 64112 / 6480 / 32TBD\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores336 / 84328 / 82320 / 80280 / 70272 / 68184 / 46184 / 46152 / 38152 / 38112 / 28112 / 2880 / 20TBD\n\n\nBase Clock1560 MHz1400 MHz1365 MHzTBA1440 MHz1575 MHz1500 MHz1410 MHz1410 MHz1320 MHz1320 MHz1552 MHzTBD\n\n\nBoost Clock1860 MHz1700 MHz1665 MHzTBA1710 MHz1770 MHz1730 MHz1665 MHz1665 MHz1780 MHz1780 MHz1777 MHz1470 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute40 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs34 TFLOPsTBA30 TFLOPs22 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs13 TFLOPs13 TFLOPs9.1 TFLOPsTBD\n\n\nRT TFLOPs74 RFLOPs69 TFLOPs67 TFLOPsTBA58 TFLOPs44 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs32 TFLOPs32 TFLOPs25 TFLOPs25 TFLOPs18.2 TFLOPsTBD\n\n\nTensor-TOPsTBA285 TOPs273 TOPsTBA238 TOPs183 TOPs163 TOPs192 TOPs192 TOPs101 TOPs101 TOPs72.8 TOPsTBD\n\n\nMemory Capacity24 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X10 GB GDDR6X8 GB GDDR6X8 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6X8 GB GDDR612 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR66 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus384-bit384-bit384-bit384-bit320-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit192-bit128-bit128-bit96-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed21 Gbps19.5 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps14 Gbps16 Gbps15 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth1008 GB/s936 GB/s912 Gbps912 Gbps760 GB/s608 GB/s448 GB/s608 GB/s448 GB/s384 GB/s240 GB/s224 GB/s168 GB/s\n\n\nTGP450W350W350W350W320W290W220W175W175W170W150W130W (GA106)\n115W (GA107)70W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)TBD$1499 US$1199$999 US?$699 US$599 US$499 US$399 US$399 US$329 USTBD$249 USTBD\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)29th March 2022?24th September 20203rd June 202111th January 202217th September 202010th June, 202129th October 2020October 20222nd December 202025th February 2021October 202227th January 20222024\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti 24 GB Graphics Card Performance\nAs for the performance of this monster GPU, NVIDIA has only shared the FLOPs and no actual gaming numbers. During their CES 2022 presentation, the card was stated to offer 40 TFLOPs (FP32), 78 TFLOPs (RT), and 320 TFLOPs (Tensor) horsepower. Compared to the RTX 3090 Non-Ti graphics card, that's an 11% increase in shader, 13% increase in RT, and 12% increase in tensor TFLOPs.\nJust for comparisons sake:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti: 40 TFLOPs (FP32) / 78 TFLOPs (RT) / 320 TFLOPs (Tensor)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090: 36 TFLOPs (FP32) / 69 TFLOPs (RT) / 285 TFLOPs (Tensor)\n\n\nIf we take the RTX 3080 & RTX 3080 Ti numbers, we see a similar TFLOPs increase, ranging from 13-15% but the actual gaming performance difference is around 7-10%. So for the RTX 3090 Ti, we can expect a similar 5-10% performance gain over the RTX 3090 Non-Ti. This would mean that a range of games that were just shy below the 60 FPS mark in 4K can now be played at native resolution & if you want to leverage higher visual fidelity through ray-tracing, the RTX 3090 Ti can definitely be able to allow that. For those who want the best of both worlds, well DLSS Quality and Raytracing go really well together on NVIDIA's RTX graphics cards.\nGaming at 8K\nOf course, there are folks who hanker to the game at the highest resolution with everything enabled. They crave the most immersive experience no matter the price, have the bragging rights to prove it, and are the early adopters of next-generation 8K displays. The GeForce RTX 3090 Ti lets you to play, capture, and watch your games in brilliant 8K HDR with DLSS Ultra Performance mode for 8K gaming, HDMI 2.1 for single-cable connectivity to 8K TVs, GeForce Experience support for 8K HDR game capture, and AV1 decode for efficient playback of 8K HDR streamed video.\nToday's most graphically intense games don't take full advantage of the horsepower the RTX 3090 Ti offers. And that's fine. The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti was built for those who want top-of-the-line gaming performance without the added benefits (and cost) of the RTX 3090 Ti. With respect to gaming performance only, the RTX 3090 Ti is on average 64% faster than the RTX 2080 Ti, 52% faster than the TITAN RTX, and 9% faster than the previous RTX 3090, respectively.\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 and AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT already trade blows with one another though NVIDIA has the advantage of DLSS/RT at their disposal and the 3090 Ti can put them back at the top of the game. Again, we aren't expecting the RTX 3090 Ti to offer huge gains over the existing RTX 3090 and most RTX 3090 owners would just stick with what they have but those who want to take things to take things to the next level, the RTX 3090 Ti is just that card!\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti 24 GB Graphics Card Price & Availability\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics card will hit retail for a starting price of $1999 US. Custom models will vary in price but one thing is for sure this card has the highest price of any single-GPU product ever. Currently, GPU prices are on their path to hitting MSRP levels by May and are currently at 25% above MSRP so we can expect pricing close to $2500-$3000 US for the custom variants over at retailers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nFollowing are some of the retail links that you could visit to find the graphics card on launch day:\n\nBuy The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti 24 GB Graphics Card @ Amazon\nBuy The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti 24 GB Graphics Card @ Newegg\nBuy The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti 24 GB Graphics Card @ BestBuy\nBuy The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti 24 GB Graphics Card @ MicroCenter\nBuy The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti 24 GB Graphics Card @ NVIDIA Shop\n\nThe graphics card is available in several custom models at launch from all major NVIDIA AIB partners.\u00a0You can check them out at the product pages for each respective manufacturer that are provided below:\n\nMSI GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Series\nASUS GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Series\nGigabyte GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Series\nZOTAC GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Series\nGALAX GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Series\nPNY GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Series\nPalit GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Series\nInno3D GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Series\nEVGA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Series\nColorful GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Series\nGainward GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Series\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAre you looking forward to NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti 24 GB graphics card?\n\n\n Yes, I want the best of the best!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n No, I'm done with GPU launches\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Maybe, will wait and see if its worth the extra $$$\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n141\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n75\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n69\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n48\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n41\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s upcoming GeForce RTX 40 series cards are likely to be the company\u2019s most powerful GPUs yet. Given that these GPUs reportedly deliver double the performance of the RTX 30 series, we expect them to be power-hungry cards. Recent leaks reveal this to be the case, as the highest-end RTX 40 series card may require a massive 1,200-watt power supply unit.As NotebookCheck reports, known leaker \u201charukaze5719\u201d was on Twitter commenting about Nvidia\u2019s Lovelace boards (Lovelace being the codename we believe Nvidia to be using for its 40 series cards) and Intel\u2019s Raptor Lake CPUs. The user said: \u201cExpecting i9-13900K + RTX 4090 Ti recommend PSU at least 1,000 W GOLD.\u201dExpecting i9 13900K + RTX 4090 Ti recommand PSU at least 1000W GOLDJanuary 16, 2022Known leaker \u201cGreymon55\u201d soon joined the conversation and said that 1,000W \u201cis not enough.\u201d\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5090 reportedly leaked right before CES 2025 debut with killer specs\n\n\n\n\nI wasn\u2019t planning on building a new gaming PC but the RTX 5080 just changed my mind\n\n\n\nExpecting i9 13900K + RTX 4090 Ti recommand PSU at least 1000W GOLDJanuary 16, 2022Greymon55 is a regular leaker who has previously posted details of what they claim we should expect from Nvidia Lovelace. The user has stated that Lovelace boards would offer \u201cdouble performance\u201d over the RTX 3090, and that lines up with rumors we've heard that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series has some killer specs, including up to 18,432 CUDA cores (the RTX 3090 has 10,496). A card like that would need some serious juice, and Greymon believes it will be 600W for either the GeForce RTX 4090 or RTX 4090 Ti -- though they noted that such an estimate was for a reference card from Nvidia, not a custom card from a third-party manufacturer like Asus.Another leak reported by Digital Trends lends credence to the supposed 1,200W PSU needed for the RTX 40 series. The leak in question indicates that the upcoming Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti has a TDP (thermal design power, often used as a measurement of power demand) of 480W, which would require a minimum of 1,000 PSU.If the RTX 40 series cards do indeed deliver double the performance of their predecessors then it\u2019s not so surprising that the top-end card will consume a lot of power. If you want an RTX 4090 or RTX 4090 Ti, you\u2019ll need to be sure you have a power supply that can handle them.As I opined in a recent editorial, I can\u2019t get excited about Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series cards. After all, it\u2019s all but impossible to buy the current RTX 30 series thanks to the ongoing chip shortage (not to mention scalpers). Reports say the semiconductor shortage could last through 2023. This means the RTX 40 series cards will no doubt be as difficult to procure as their RTX 30 predecessors.Sign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.For more information on the Geforce RTX 40 series, be sure to check out our hub featuring the most up-to-date rumors on Nvidia\u2019s upcoming GPUs.Today's best RTX 3080 deals $699.99View $1,249View No price informationCheck WalmartShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nnvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (1)\n\n\n\nTony PolancoSocial Links NavigationSenior Computing WriterTony is a computing writer at Tom\u2019s Guide covering laptops, tablets, Windows, and iOS.

RTX vWS enables artists to create real-time cinematic quality renderings of photorealistic environments with physically accurate shadows, reflections and refractions.\nIt also brings the power of AI to visual computing, so users can automate repetitive tasks, enable all-new creative assistants and optimize compute-intensive processes. Taking advantage of RTX-accelerated applications can help cloud users boost creativity and productivity from any location.\nNVIDIA tested the latest G5 instances with A10G GPUs and compared the performance to the G4dn instances, which use NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs.\nThe results show that the NVIDIA-powered G5 instances provide up to:\n\n3.2x faster professional graphics performance\n3.7x better rendering performance\n2.7x faster performance for video editing workloads\n3.7x faster gaming performance\n\nEnhanced Performance for Professional Graphics\nFor workstation application benchmarking, NVIDIA used the industry-standard SPECviewperf 2020 workstation graphics benchmark, which measures the 3D graphics performance of systems running under the OpenGL and DirectX application programming interfaces. The benchmark\u2019s workloads, called viewsets, represent graphics content and behavior from actual applications.\nG4dn instances provided superior graphics performance, but G5 instances bring that performance to the next level, with up to 3x better performance than the previous generation.\nSPECviewperf 2020 benchmark performance comparison of NVIDIA A10G vs. NVIDIA T4 GPUs.\nAccelerated Rendering\nPowered by NVIDIA A10G GPUs, G5 instances are ideal for rendering, providing up to 3.7x faster rendering performance than G4dn instances that use the T4.\nBlender Cycles benchmark performance comparison of NVIDIA A10G vs. NVIDIA T4 GPUs.\nAdditionally, the broad ecosystem of supported renderers with NVIDIA RTX vWS enables users to have a more seamless experience, with accurate shadow detail and lighting, reduced noise and increased photorealistic accuracy.\n\nDesigners and artists can choose the rendering software best-suited for their task, taking into account their personal preference and familiarity with it.\nAs you can see in the chart above, NVIDIA RTX is supported by the industry\u2019s top rendering applications, giving users the ability to use GPU-accelerated rendering in the package of their choice.\nFaster Video Editing\nVideo editing applications such as DaVinci Resolve can use multiple GPUs to accelerate effects processing and advanced grading effects. A good test for GPU performance can be accomplished by testing advanced effects and features, as well as measuring the encoding performance, which is not limited by the project frame rate.\nTo measure video editing capabilities of the GPU in Resolve, NVIDIA tested five video timelines using advanced effects. When working on advanced video sequences featuring GPU-accelerated effects, the G5 instance shows up to 2.7x faster performance versus the G4dn instances on T4.\nDaVinci Resolve video editing benchmark performance comparison of NVIDIA A10G vs. NVIDIA T4 GPUs.\nImproved Gaming Performance\nNVIDIA Gaming PC on AWS supports NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), an advanced AI-based rendering method that uses Tensor Cores on the NVIDIA A10G GPUs to render images at a lower resolution, and a deep learning neural network to scale up the content to the display resolution without losing detail.\nUsing NVIDIA DLSS, professionals can produce image quality that\u2019s comparable to native resolution \u2014 and sometimes even better \u2014 while only rendering a fraction of the pixels. This allows gamers to achieve faster, more interactive frame rates without affecting visual quality. They can also use more demanding visual quality settings, including ray tracing, while maintaining acceptable frame rates.\nRelative gaming performance comparing AWS G4dn with NVIDIA T4 GPUs vs. AWS G5 with NVIDIA A10G GPUs vs. AWS G5 with A10G GPUs (4K) with DLSS and RTX On. DLSS support on \u201cMetro Exodus\u201d is coming soon.\nOnly NVIDIA-accelerated instances can take advantage of technologies such as hardware-accelerated real-time ray tracing and DLSS, supported by many apps and games.\nAbsolute gaming performance (FPS) comparing AWS G4dn with NVIDIA T4 GPUs vs. AWS G5 with NVIDIA A10G GPUs vs. AWS G5 with A10G GPUs (4K) with DLSS and RTX On. DLSS is not supported on \u201cFIFA 21\u201d.\nThe new AWS EC2 G5 instances, available now, give designers, artists and technical professionals the power of NVIDIA RTX \u2014 with rich graphics enhancements and innovations only available from NVIDIA.\nFeatured blog image courtesy of Blender.\n\n\nCategories: Graphics Virtualization | Pro GraphicsTags: Rendering | Virtualization \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia announced an upcoming Game Ready Driver that will include several new graphic enhancements, alongside an AI-powered Dynamic Super Resolution (DSR) feature. Deep Learning Dynamic Super Resolution (DLDSR) is an artificial intelligence-enhanced version of the DSR option found in the Nvidia Control Panel. DLDSR \u201crenders a game at higher, more detailed resolution before intelligently shrinking the result back down to the resolution of your monitor,\u201d Nvidia said on its website.\n\nAccording to Nvidia, DLDSR\u2019s downsampling method and artificial intelligence allow for fewer inputs and improved image quality, respectively, over normal DSR. As such, the image quality of DLDSR 2.25X will be comparable to DSR 4X, but with improved performance. DLDSR will utilize Nvidia's Tensor Cores found on RTX graphics cards and is set to work for \u201cmost\u201d games. (Based on our experience with DSR, anything that automatically renders at your desktop resolution likely won't work properly.)(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia also announced its joint effort with Pascal Gilcher, author of the ReShade Ray Tracing Filter, along with other members of the modding community to produce three new Freestyle filters for its GeForce Experience tool:\n\n\"SSRTGI (Screen Space Ray Traced Global Illumination), commonly known as the \u201cRay Tracing ReShade Filter\u201d enhances lighting and shadows of your favorite titles to create a greater sense of depth and realism. SSAO (Screen Space Ambient Occlusion) emphasizes the appearance of shadows near the intersections of 3D objects, especially within dimly lit/indoor environments. Dynamic DOF (Depth of Field) applies bokeh-style blur based on the proximity of objects within the scene giving your game a more cinematic suspenseful feel.\"\n\nNvidia says utilizing Gilcher\u2019s newly modified SSRTGI filter alongside DLDSR can produce a \u201cremaster experience\u201d of classic games like Prey.The image at the top shows Prey running at native 1080p and 145fps next to images of it running in DSR 4K>1080p at 108fps and DLDSR 2.25X 1620p>1080p at 143fps. The announcement of DLDSR comes following the tease of AMD\u2019s Raedon Super Resolution upscaling tech a few weeks ago.\n\nBoth DLDSR and the new Freestyle filters are slated to arrive in the upcoming Game Ready Driver that will be available on January 14.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nScience\nGeForce\nray tracing\nGaming\nDrivers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (0)\n\n\n\nIsaac RouseSocial Links NavigationStaff WriterIsaac Rouse is a staff writer at Tom's Hardware.

It includes software to clean data and prepare it for training, perform the training of neural networks, convert the model to a more efficient form for inference, and deploy it to an inference server.\nIn addition, the Nvidia AI software suite includes GPU, DPU (data processing unit), and accelerated network support for Kubernetes (the cloud-native deployment layer on the diagram below), and optimized support for shared devices on VMware vSphere with Tanzu. Tanzu Basic lets you run and manage Kubernetes in vSphere. (VMware Tanzu Labs is the new name for Pivotal Labs.)\nNvidia LaunchPad is a trial program that gives AI and data science teams short-term access to the complete Nvidia AI stack running on private compute infrastructure. Nvidia LaunchPad offers curated labs for Nvidia AI Enterprise, with access to Nvidia experts and training modules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia AI Enterprise is an attempt to take AI model training and deployment out of the realm of academic research and of the biggest tech companies, which already have PhD-level data scientists and data centers full of GPUs, and into the realm of ordinary enterprises that need to apply AI for operations, product development, marketing, HR, and other areas. LaunchPad is a free way for those companies to let their IT administrators and AI practitioners gain hands-on experience with the Nvidia AI Enterprise stack on supported hardware.\n\n\n\nThe most common alternative to Nvidia AI Enterprise and LaunchPad is to use the GPUs (and other model training accelerators, such as TPUs and FPGAs) and AI software available from the hyperscale cloud providers, combined with the courses, models, and labs supplied by the cloud vendors and the AI framework open source communities.\n Nvidia\n\nThe Nvidia AI Enterprise stack, ranging from acceleration hardware at the bottom to data science tools and frameworks at the top.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s in Nvidia AI Enterprise\nNvidia AI Enterprise provides an integrated infrastructure layer for the development and deployment of AI solutions. It includes pre-trained models, GPU-aware software for data prep (RAPIDS), GPU-aware deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, software to convert models to a more efficient form for inference (TensorRT), and a scalable inference server (Triton).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA library of pre-trained models is available through Nvidia\u2019s NGC catalog for use with the Nvidia AI Enterprise software suite; these models can be fine-tuned on your datasets using Nvidia AI Enterprise TensorFlow Containers, for example. The deep learning frameworks supplied, while based on their open source versions, have been optimized for Nvidia GPUs.\n Nvidia\n\nNvidia AI software stack flow diagram. The hardware notes at the bottom left are for training; the notes at the bottom right are for inference.\n\n\nNvidia AI Enterprise and LaunchPad hardware\nNvidia has been making a lot of noise about DGX systems, which have four to 16 A100 GPUs in various form factors, ranging from a tower workgroup appliance to rack-based systems designed for use in data centers. While the company is still committed to DGX for large installations, for the purposes of Nvidia AI Enterprise trials under the LaunchPad programs, the company has assembled smaller 1U to 2U rack-mounted systems with commodity servers based on dual Intel Xeon Gold 6354 CPUs, single Nvidia T4 or A30 GPUs, and Nvidia DPUs (data processing units). Nine Equinix Metal regions worldwide each have 20 such rack-mounted servers for use by Nvidia customers who qualify for LaunchPad trials.\nNvidia recommends the same systems for enterprise deployments of Nvidia AI Enterprise. These systems are available for rent or lease in addition to purchase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Nvidia\n\nServer hardware to support LaunchPad and Nvidia AI Enterprise. While the LaunchPad servers are all Dell R750s, that was a matter of availability rather than preference. All of the companies listed on the right manufacture servers supported by Nvidia for Nvidia AI Enterprise.\n\n\nTest driving Nvidia AI Enterprise\nNvidia offers three different trial programs to help customers get started with Nvidia AI Enterprise. For AI practitioners who just want to get their feet wet, there\u2019s a test drive demo that includes predicting New York City taxi fares and trying BERT question answering in TensorFlow. The test drive requires about an hour of hands-on work, and offers 48 hours of access.\nLaunchPad is slightly more extensive. It offers hands-on labs for AI practitioners and IT staff, requiring about eight hours of hands-on work, with access to the systems for two weeks, with an optional extension to four weeks.\nThe third trial program is a 90-day on-premises evaluation, sufficient to perform a POC (proof of concept). The customer needs to supply (or rent) an Nvidia-certified system with VMware vSphere 7 u2 (or later), and Nvidia provides free evaluation licenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Nvidia\n\nThere are three ways to trial Nvidia AI Enterprise: a one-hour test drive demo with 48-hour access; the Nvidia LaunchPad\u2019s eight-hour labs with two weeks of access; and a 90-day evaluation license for use on-prem.\n\n\nNvidia LaunchPad demo for IT administrators\nAs I\u2019m more interested in data science than I am in IT administration, I merely watched a demo of the hands-on administration lab, although I had access to it later. The first screenshot below shows the beginning of the lab instructions; the second shows a page from the VMware vSphere client web interface. According to Nvidia, most of the IT admins they train are already familiar with vSphere and Windows, but are less familiar with Ubuntu Linux.\n IDG\n\nThis screen presents the instructions for creating an Nvidia AI Enterprise virtual machine using VMware vSphere. It is part of the IT admin training.\n\n\n IDG\n\nThis screen shows the hardware overview for the Nvidia AI Enterprise virtual machine created for tutorial purposes in VMware vSphere.\n\n\nLaunchpad lab for AI practitioners\nI spent most of a day going through the LaunchPad lab for AI practitioners, delivered primarily as a Jupyter Notebook. The folks at Nvidia told me it was a 400-level tutorial; it certainly would have been if I had to write the code myself. As it was, all the code was already written, there was a trained base BERT model to fine-tune, and all the training and test data for fine-tuning was supplied from SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset).\nThe A30 GPU in the server supplied for the LaunchPad got a workout when I got to the fine-tuning step, which took 97 minutes. Without the GPU, it would have taken much longer. To train the BERT model from scratch on, say, the contents of Wikipedia, is a major undertaking requiring many GPUs and a long time (probably weeks).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n IDG\n\nThe upper section of this page sends the user to a Jupyter Notebook that fine-tunes a BERT model for customer service. The lower section explains how to export the trained model to the inference server. By the way, if you forget to shut down the kernel after the fine-tuning step, the export step will fail with mysterious error tracebacks. Don\u2019t ask me how I know that.\n\n\n IDG\n\nThis is the beginning of the Jupyter Notebook that implements the first step of the AI Practitioner course. It uses a pre-trained BERT TensorFlow model, downloaded in step 3, and then fine-tunes it for a smaller, focused dataset, downloaded in step 2.\n\n\n IDG\n\nThis step uses TensorFlow to convert example sentences to tokenized form. It takes a few minutes to run on the CPUs.\n\n\n IDG\n\nThe fine-tuning step should take about 90 minutes using the A30 GPU. Here we are just beginning the training at the estimator.train(\u2026) call.\n\n\n IDG\n\nThe fine-tuning training step is finally done, in 5838 seconds (97 minutes) total. About four minutes was used for start-up overhead.\n\n\n IDG\n\nThe Jupyter Notebook continues with an inference test and an evaluation step, both using the fine-tuned TensorFlow BERT model. After this step we shut down the Jupyter Notebook and start the Triton inference server in the VM, then test the Triton server from a Jupyter console.\n\n\nOverall, Nvidia AI Enterprise is a very good hardware/software package for tackling AI problems, and LaunchPad is a convenient way to become familiar with Nvidia AI Enterprise. I was struck by how well the deep learning software takes advantage of the latest innovations in Nvidia Ampere architecture GPUs, such as mixed precision arithmetic and tensor cores. I noticed how much better the experience was trying the Nvidia AI Enterprise hands-on labs on Nvidia\u2019s server instance than other experiences I\u2019ve had running TensorFlow and PyTorch samples on my own hardware and on cloud VMs and AI services.\nAll of the major public clouds offer access to Nvidia GPUs, as well as to TPUs (Google), FPGAs (Azure), and customized accelerators such as Habana Gaudi chips for training (on AWS EC2 DL1 instances) and AWS Inferentia chips for inference (on Amazon EC2 Inf1 instances). You can even access TPUs and GPUs for free in Google Colab. The cloud providers also have versions of TensorFlow, PyTorch, and other frameworks that are optimized for their clouds.\nAssuming that you are able to access Nvidia LaunchPad for Nvidia AI Enterprise and test it successfully, your next step if you want to proceed should most likely be to set up a proof of concept for an AI application that has a high value to your company, with management buy-in and support. You could rent a small Nvidia-certified server with an Ampere-class GPU and take advantage of Nvidia\u2019s free 90-day evaluation license for Nvidia AI Enterprise to accomplish the POC with minimum cost and risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRelated content\n\n \n\n\nFeature\n\n10 machine learning mistakes and how to avoid them\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Bob Violino \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFeb 24, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n10 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCareers\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMachine Learning\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSoftware Development\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\nKey strategies for MLops success in 2025\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Yuval Fernbach \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFeb 18, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n8 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDevSecOps\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDevops\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGenerative AI\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\nLarge language models: The foundations of generative AI\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Martin Heller \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFeb 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n15 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArtificial Intelligence\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGenerative AI\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMachine Learning\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nReady or not, here it comes: GenAI in 2025\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Josh Fruhlinger \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJan 24, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n3 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArtificial Intelligence\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGenerative AI\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMachine Learning\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Sections\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tResources\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVideos\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotlight: Managing modern risks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                        by                                                             \n                                                                Martin Heller                                                            \n\n\nContributing Writer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Martin Heller on X\n \n\n\n\nMartin Heller is a contributing editor and reviewer for InfoWorld.

That doesn\u2019t seem all that long ago but now it\u2019s a full-blown enterprise high-performance computing and AI company that happens to sell videogame cards \u2013 if you can actually find them.\nIts latest move is the acquisition of Bright Computing, a maker of Bright Cluster Manager software that controls the configuration of clustered HPC systems, including Nvidia\u2019s own DGX servers and HGX systems made by OEMs and ODMs, plus clusters from other manufacturers. The clusters of servers are linked by high-speed networks into a single unit.\nIf the deal goes through, Bright Cluster Manager will become a part of Nvidia\u2019s Enterprise Products Group. Nvidia has no intention of keeping Bright Cluster Manager for itself, and by being a part of the Nvidia channel, it gives Bright an opportunity to expand and grow its market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBright Computing is a small, privately held firm so details were sparse. Its customer list includes Boeing, NASA, Johns Hopkins University, and Siemens and it serves industries like health care, financial services, and manufacturing.\n\n\n\nFor Nvidia\u2019s part, it gets an in-house tool to help customers better manage their Nvidia hardware, rather than buy it separately. That\u2019s why it brought the company in-house.\n\u201cNvidia will combine Bright Cluster Manager with our system software capabilities to make HPC data centers easier to buy, build, and operate, creating a much larger future for HPC,\u201d said Charlie Boyle, vice president and general manager of Nvidia DGX systems in a statement. \u201cThis will help NVIDIA democratize HPC and accelerated enterprise computing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBright\u2019s software can run in the data center, at the edge, and across multiple public or hybrid clouds. It automates administration for clusters running x86 and Arm as well as Nvidia GPUs. The most recent versions of the software, Bright Cluster Manager 9.1, came out a little more than a year ago, and added support for the entire VMware stack, including the Tanzu Kubernetes container platform.\nBright Cluster Manager 9.1 also added support for Ansible playbooks and integration with OpenShift, so organizations can manage their OpenShift infrastructure from edge to cloud with all of the features Bright offers.\nBright Cluster Manager 9.1 also can automatically increase or decrease the number of nodes available to an HPC workload manager or to Kubernetes in a cluster, regardless of whether those nodes are physical, virtual, on-premises, in the public cloud or at the edge. The allocation of nodes can be determined by demand and by policy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRelated content\n\n \n\n\nNews\n\nTop network and data center events 2025\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Denise Dubie \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n4 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCloud Computing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Center\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetwork Security\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\nEnterprises reevaluate virtualization strategies amid Broadcom uncertainty\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Neal Weinberg \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n11 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetwork Management Software\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetworking Devices\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\n5 alternatives to VMware vSphere virtualization platform\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Neal Weinberg \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n4 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetworking Devices\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tServer Virtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nVergeIO enhances VergeFabric network virtualization offering\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Sean Michael Kerner \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 13, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n5 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Center\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSDN\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Sections\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPODCASTS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVIDEOS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRESOURCES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEVENTS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotlight: Managing modern risks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom our editors straight to your inbox\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tGet started by entering your email address below.\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email address\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                        by                                                             \n                                                                Andy Patrizio                                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Andy Patrizio on X\n\n\nFollow Andy Patrizio on LinkedIn\n \n\n\n\nAndy Patrizio is a freelance journalist based in southern California who has covered the computer industry for 20 years and has built every x86 PC he\u2019s ever owned, laptops not included.\nThe opinions expressed in this blog are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of ITworld, Network World, its parent, subsidiary or affiliated companies.\n\n\n\n\nMore from this author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnewsIntel taps semiconductor veteran Lip-Bu Tan as new CEO Mar 12, 2025 4 minsnewsAltera targets low-latency AI edge applications with new FPGA products Mar 11, 2025 3 minsnewsLenovo introduces compact, liquid-cooled AI edge server Mar 07, 2025 3 minsfeatureSeven important trends in the server sphere Mar 06, 2025 4 minsfeatureData center vacancies hit historic lows despite record construction Mar 06, 2025 4 minsnewsAI driving a 165% rise in data center power demand by 2030 Mar 05, 2025 3 minsnewsTariffs for now won\u2019t impact IT organizations Mar 04, 2025 3 minsnewsLenovo renews ThinkSystem lineup for AI workloads and more Feb 26, 2025 2 mins \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me morePopularArticlesPodcastsVideos\n\n\nopinion  Jio teams with AMD, Cisco and Nokia to build AI-enabled telecom platform  By Zeus Kerravala\nMar 18, 20254 mins\nNetworkingTelecommunications\n\n\n\n\nnews  2025 network outage report and internet health check By Ann Bednarz\nMar 18, 202528 mins\nInternet Service ProvidersNetwork Management SoftwareNetworking\n\n\n\n\nnews  Cloudflare unveils network-powered posture management By Sean Michael Kerner\nMar 18, 20255 mins\nCloud ComputingNetwork Security\n\n\n\n\npodcast  Has the hype around \u2018Internet of Things\u2019 paid off?

The company is known for popularising the term Graphic Processing Unit and claims to be its inventor with the GeForce 256, launched in 1999.Since then, the company has continued to design GPUs for both the gaming and professional markets, with GeForce continuing as its primary GPU line. It has also developed system-on-a-chip-units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive markets. Nvidia's GeForce's only direct competitor in the GPU market is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Radeon.Today, Nvidia has more than 60 offices worldwide with over 13,700 employees. The company describes itself as \"a learning machine that constantly evolves by adapting to new opportunities that are hard to solve, that only it can tackle, and that matter to the world.\"Nvidia fighting climate change and natural disastersSince 2014, Nvidia has reduced its emissions by 15% per employee and set a goal to have 65% of its global electricity use come from renewable sources by the end of 2025.In November last year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced that the company would use several of its products to help predict and mitigate environmental disasters by simulating the effects of climate change. It will achieve this by creating a digital version of the planet Earth.The digital Earth will come in the form of a new supercomputer named E2 (Earth 2) and will be developed inside the company's Omniverse. According to Huang, Nvidia's Earth's digital twin, which is designed to model the planet's climate, will be able to accurately predict regional impacts of climate change up to 30 years into the future.Nvidia has also partnered with the Lockheed Martin AI Centre to further help mitigate the consequences of climate change, such as flooding, droughts, and wildfires. Together, they will launch an AI-powered initiative that will also use machine learning to enhance the accuracy and decrease the response time of wildfire predictions, enabling operators to limit the spread of fires more quickly.\u2022 Join global business leaders and sustainability experts taking meaningful action at\u00a0Sustainability\u00a0LIVE, held at Tobacco Dock, London, 23-24 February 2022.

This requires high-performance computing power to run complex derivatives models \u2014 which find fair prices for financial contracts \u2014 as close to real time as possible.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to trade today on yesterday\u2019s data. You want to have up-to-the-moment portfolio values under many possible scenarios,\u201d said Ryan Ferguson, CEO of Riskfuel, a Toronto-based startup that has built an AI-based accelerator technology for valuation and risk workloads.\nFerguson used to run securitization and credit derivatives for Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets. He noticed this industry-wide challenge and shifted his career to help address it, founding Riskfuel in 2019.\nThe company trains and develops its AI models using NVIDIA DGX systems, NVIDIA GPUs and the NVIDIA CUDA parallel computing platform.\nRiskfuel is also a member of NVIDIA Inception, which is a free program for cutting-edge startups. The program provides access to training credits from the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, technology assistance, awareness support and opportunities to connect with investors. As a community member,\nSpeeding Up Sluggish Models\nRiskfuel\u2019s first customer happened to be Ferguson\u2019s old employer, Scotiabank. When that work garnered the bank an industry award, the market noticed.\nThe company then partnered with Bank of Montreal (BMO), which was looking to improve the performance of its CPU-based structured notes models.\nBMO employed industry-standard Monte Carlo simulations to process pricing requests, each of which could take several minutes to run on a single CPU core. But that\u2019s too sluggish for the massive quantity of simulations required and the number of deals being run through many risk scenarios every day.\nA pilot project showed that versions of BMO models accelerated by Riskfuel and deployed on NVIDIA DGX systems dramatically improved performance. Ultimately, it lets the bank expand its client base, drive higher trade flows, generate new risk insights and lead to better product design and selection.\nAccording to Lucas Caliri, managing director and head of Cross Asset Solutions at BMO, \u201cThe partnership with Riskfuel and NVIDIA is enabling us to assist our clients to handle more complex hedging strategies and \u2014 with accelerated pricing and analysis \u2014 make faster, smarter investment decisions.\u201d\nBuilding a GPU-Powered \u2018Rocket\u2019\nRiskfuel built its model by training it on 650 million data points, using NVIDIA DGX A100, which Ferguson calls an \u201cAI workhorse.\u201d\nThe startup works with banks\u2019 code by using their CPU models to create training datasets for neural nets, which run on GPUs using PyTorch, TensorFlow or any other AI library. Then, it delivers its product as packaged neural nets, allowing customers to choose whether to run inference on NVIDIA A100, A30 or other NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs.\nOnce the Riskfuel model is in, banks notice a huge speedup, while maintaining the same API for model access.\n\u201cWe take their car into the garage, rip the engine out and put a rocket in,\u201d said Ferguson. \u201cIt looks like the same car, but on the inside, it produces the results way faster.\u201d\nRiskfuel\u2019s model sacrifices nothing in the way of accuracy \u2014 even with all that speed \u2014 no matter how far a bank might push it. Ferguson said that banks no longer have to trade speed for accuracy, or vice versa.\n\u201cHistorically, there\u2019s basically been a toggle that says faster or more accurate,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cWith Riskfuel, you can get fast and accurate.\u201d\nJust the Beginning\nLooking forward, Riskfuel hopes to provide solutions for more areas in which banks can\u2019t process scenarios fast enough. For example, previously, banks had to choose which risk scenarios to run, but that limitation is being removed.\n\u201cNow that their derivatives portfolio models can run in seconds, banks need real-time data and faster risk scenario generation,\u201d said Ivan Sergienko, chief product officer at Riskfuel. \u201cThese are potential growth areas for us.\u201d\nLearn more about NVIDIA offerings for the financial services industry.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Financial Services | Inception | NVIDIA DGX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Accordingly, fraud detection involving payments and transactions was the top AI use case across all respondents at 31 percent, followed by conversational AI at 28 percent and algorithmic trading at 27 percent.\nThere was a dramatic increase in the percentage of financial institutions investing in AI use cases year-over-year. AI for underwriting increased fourfold, from 3 percent penetration in 2021 to 12 percent this year. Conversational AI jumped from 8 to 28 percent year-over-year, a 3.5x rise.\nMeanwhile, AI-enabled applications for fraud detection, know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) all experienced growth of at least 300 percent in the latest survey. Nine of 13 use cases are now utilized by over 15 percent of financial services firms, whereas none of the use cases exceeded that penetration mark in last year\u2019s report.\nFuture investment plans remain steady for top AI cases, with enterprise investment priorities for the next six to 12 months marked in green.\nTop Current AI Use Cases in Financial Services (Ranked by Industry Sector)\nGreen highlighted text signifies top AI use cases for investment in next six to 12 months.\nOvercoming AI Challenges\nFinancial services professionals highlighted the main benefits of AI in yielding more accurate models, creating a competitive advantage and improving customer experience. Overall, 47 percent said that AI enables more accurate models for applications such as fraud detection, risk calculation and product recommendations.\nHowever, there are challenges in achieving a company\u2019s AI goals. Only 16 percent of survey respondents agreed that their company is spending the right amount of money on AI, and 37 percent believed \u201clack of budget\u201d is the primary challenge in achieving their AI goals. Additional obstacles included too few data scientists, lack of data, and explainability, with a third of respondents listing each option.\nFinancial institutions such as Munich Re, Scotiabank and Wells Fargo have developed explainable AI models to explain lending decisions and construct diversified portfolios.\nBiggest Challenges in Achieving Your Company\u2019s AI Goals (by Role)\nCybersecurity, data sovereignty, data gravity and the option to deploy on-prem, in the cloud or using hybrid cloud are areas of focus for financial services companies as they consider where to host their AI infrastructure. These preferences are extrapolated from responses to where companies are running most of their AI projects, with over three-quarters of the market operating on either on-prem or hybrid instances.\nWhere Financial Services Companies Run Their AI Workloads\nExecutives Believe AI Is Key to Business Success\nOver half of C-suite respondents agreed that AI is important to their company\u2019s future success. The top total responses to the question \u201cHow does your company plan to invest in AI technologies in the future?\u201d were:\n\nHiring more AI experts (43 percent)\nIdentifying additional AI use cases (36 percent)\nEngaging third-party partners to accelerate AI adoption (36 percent)\nSpending more on infrastructure (36 percent)\nProviding AI training to staff (32 percent)\n\nHowever, only 23 percent overall of those surveyed believed their company has the capability and knowledge to move an AI project from research to production. This indicates the need for an end-to-end platform to develop, deploy and manage AI in enterprise applications.\nRead the full \u201cState of AI in Financial Services 2022\u201d report to learn more.\nExplore NVIDIA\u2019s AI solutions and enterprise-level AI platforms driving the future of financial services.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Conversational AI | Cybersecurity | Financial Services \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Meaning, for the first time, you can play ray-traced games on a 50-class GPU at over 60 FPS. RTX-powered ray tracing and DLSS are the new standard in gaming (there are already over 200 RTX-enhanced games and apps), and the GeForce RTX 3050 makes them accessible to millions of gamers.\nVenerable previous-gen 50-class cards are fast falling behind in popular rasterized titles, they lack the performance for competitive gaming in the most popular shooters, they\u2019re unable to offer their users transformative ray-traced effects that take image quality to the next level, and they can\u2019t benefit from the miraculous performance boosts offered by NVIDIA DLSS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, with the GeForce RTX 3050, you also get the many other benefits and features of our platform. That includes NVIDIA Reflex to minimize your system latency in games, the NVIDIA Broadcast app for AI-powered voice and video, NVIDIA Encoder for great streaming, NVIDIA Studio to accelerate and enhance creative applications, our reliable Game Ready Drivers and Studio Drivers, and much more.\nWith all this technology, you can stream your ray-traced gameplay at over 60 FPS, with improved audio courtesy of NVIDIA Broadcast, and if you need to work, you can complete it far faster thanks to industry-leading app GPU acceleration, AI, deep learning, and ray tracing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3050 Reviews:\nAhead of the new GeForce RTX 3050\u2019s release, tech sites and YouTubers have taken the card for a spin, putting it through its paces in gaming benchmarks and every other test you can think of. Here\u2019s some of what they had to say:\n\n\u201cNvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3050 delivers great 1080p gaming performance with modern features, including capable ray tracing chops and DLSS.\u201d - PC World\n\u201cI would call the RTX 3050 the new 1080p60 king\u2026\u201d - Venture Beat\n\u201cThis launch from NVIDIA, however, ticks all of the right boxes. As the \u201cGeForce RTX 3050\u201d series branding implies, the RTX 3050 should be a generational leap over the previous-gen GTX 1650 it supplants in NVIDIA\u2019s GPU line-up. And NVIDIA hit that target \u2013 the GeForce RTX 3050 is a huge upgrade over older xx50-series cards that not only offers much better performance, but additional feature support as well.\u201d - Hot Hardware\n\u201cOur testing shows the RTX 3050 to be the new standing performance leader in its class.\u201d - PC Mag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3050 Out Now\nIf you\u2019re still playing without ray tracing and DLSS, step up to RTX with the new GeForce RTX 3050, available now from top add-in card providers such as ASUS, Colorful, EVGA, Gainward, Galax, Gigabyte, INNO3D, MSI, Palit, PNY and Zotac, as well as in gaming systems from major manufacturers and leading system builders worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about the many benefits of GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards on our site\u2019s nav, and stay tuned to our news page to discover which games and apps are adding support for RTX technologies next.

Today\u2019s announcements further establish GeForce as the ultimate platform for gamers and creators,\u201d said Jeff Fisher, senior vice president of consumer products at NVIDIA. \u201cAnd GeForce NOW continues to grow as our platform for reaching billions of gamers.\u201d\nGeForce RTX Powering 160+ New Laptops\r\nThe world\u2019s top manufacturers are bringing to market more than 160 gaming and Studio laptops based on the revolutionary NVIDIA Ampere architecture, with second-generation RT Cores for ray tracing and third-generation Tensor Cores for DLSS and AI, creating the thinnest, lightest and most powerful laptops ever.\nBased on the latest generation of CPUs, these laptops offer a wide range of form factors, such as dual screens, easels, convertibles, and 14-inch screens, many sporting G-SYNC\u00ae and 1440p displays.\nRTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti Deliver New Levels of Performance\r\nNVIDIA\u2019s launch of the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti laptop GPU brings the flagship 80 Ti class of GPUs to laptops for the first time. Featuring 16GB of the fastest GDDR6 memory ever shipped in a laptop, the RTX 3080 Ti delivers higher performance than the desktop NVIDIA TITAN RTX\u2122. RTX 3080 Ti laptops start at $2,499.\nThe new GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is up to 70 percent faster than RTX 2070 SUPER laptops and can deliver 100 frames per second at 1440p resolution. RTX 3070 Ti laptops start at $1,499.\nLaptops powered by both of these new GPUs will be available starting on Feb. 1.\nNVIDIA also introduced the fourth generation of Max-Q technologies, which have revolutionized laptop performance since their introduction four years ago. These features include CPU Optimizer, Rapid Core Scaling and Battery Boost 2.0, which further enhance efficiency, performance and battery life.\nNew NVIDIA Studio Laptops and Apps\r\nNVIDIA is further expanding its Studio platform of hardware, software and exclusive applications that helps creators get from concept to completion faster.\nThis includes a major update to NVIDIA Canvas, a painting application that uses AI to generate landscape images from simple brush strokes. Built from NVIDIA\u2019s GauGAN2\u00ae research, the app produces images that are 4x higher resolution than in the past, with five additional elements like flowers and bushes. The new Canvas app is free to download.\nThe Studio platform also includes a wide range of NVIDIA Studio laptops, with designs from ASUS, MSI and Razer powered by the new GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and 3070 Ti laptop GPUs. With the latest RTX GPUs, these laptops are on average 7x faster for 3D rendering than the latest MacBook Pro 16.(1) They support more than 200 creative applications, as well as RTX-accelerated ray tracing, AI and NVIDIA\u2019s high-performance video processor, making them the perfect tool for any creator workflow.\nNVIDIA Omniverse Launches For Creators\r\nFurther enriching the NVIDIA Studio ecosystem, NVIDIA Omniverse is now available at no cost to millions of individual creators with GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX GPUs. NVIDIA\u2019s real-time 3D design collaboration and virtual world simulation platform empowers artists, designers and creators to connect and collaborate in leading design applications from their RTX-powered laptop or workstation.\nA new platform feature, Omniverse Nucleus Cloud, is enabling simple \u201cone-click-to-collaborate\u201d sharing of large Omniverse 3D scenes.

The award is based on anonymous employee feedback covering thousands of companies.\nOther companies ranked highly by current and former employees include tech companies Google and Salesforce, and fitness wear retailer Lululemon. NVIDIA ranked second on the list last year.\nHalf of the top ten large US company winners are tech firms and 40 percent of the entire list of top 100 employers are tech companies.\n\u201cThe world of work is rapidly evolving, fueled by the pandemic and now millions of workers re-evaluating their expectations from employers,\u201d Glassdoor CEO Christian Sutherland-Wong said. \u201cThis year\u2019s Best Places to Work winners are leading the way by listening and responding to employee feedback and reimagining the employee experience to truly put their people first.\u201d\nNVIDIA employees consistently give the company high marks on Glassdoor\u2019s survey.\n95 percent would recommend NVIDIA to a friend. The same proportion say the company has a positive business outlook. And 98 percent approve of the CEO, Jensen Huang.\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s a place where folks who love working hard and enjoy tough challenges will feel at home,\u201d one anonymous employee wrote on the site, which gets 67 million views each month.\n\u201cLeaders walk the talk with culture and values,\u201d another wrote. \u201cEveryone is genuinely helpful to train and ramp new employees, decision making is fast, title and hierarchy is never in the way of doing what is right.\u201d\n\u201cThe best workplace I have witnessed to date,\u201d another noted.\nThe reviews from current and former employees capture an authentic look at companies.\nWhen sharing a company review on Glassdoor, employees are encouraged to rate their satisfaction with the company overall and key workplace factors such as career opportunities, compensation and benefits, culture and values, diversity and inclusion, senior management, and work-life balance.\nIn addition, employees are asked to describe the best reasons to work at their companies and any downsides.\nGlassdoor\u2019s Best Places to Work were determined using company reviews from U.S.-based employees from Oct. 20, 2020, to Oct. 18, 2021.\nWant to leave a review of your own?

Members will be admitted to the beta in batches over the coming weeks.\n\u2018Fortnite\u2019 Streaming Gameplay Comes to Mobile Through iOS Safari and Android With Touch Inputs\nAlongside the amazing team at Epic Games, we\u2019ve been working to enable a touch-friendly version of Fortnite for mobile delivered through the cloud. While PC games in the GeForce NOW library are best experienced on mobile with a gamepad, the introduction of touch controls built by the GeForce NOW team offers more options for players, starting with Fortnite.\nBeginning today, GeForce NOW members can sign up for a chance to join the Fortnite limited-time closed beta for mobile devices. Not an existing member? No worries. Register for a GeForce NOW membership and sign up to become eligible for the closed beta once the experience starts rolling out next week. Upgrade to a Priority or RTX 3080 membership to receive priority access to gaming servers. A paid GeForce NOW membership is not required to participate.\nYou could say the world is a little upside down in Fortnite Chapter 3.\nFor tips on gameplay mechanics or a refresher on playing Fortnite with touch controls, check out Fortnite\u2019s Getting Started page.\nMore Touch Games\nAnd we\u2019re just getting started. Cloud-to-mobile gaming is a great opportunity for publishers to get their games into more gamers\u2019 hands with touch-friendly versions of their games. PC games or game engines, like Unreal Engine 4, which support Windows touch events can easily enable mobile touch support on GeForce NOW.\nWe\u2019re working with additional publishers to add more touch-enabled games to GeForce NOW.

NVIDIA Omniverse eases this process.\n\u201cWith Omniverse, I don\u2019t have to wait a full week to render a 30-second animation,\u201d Solina said. \u201cThe rendering speed in Omniverse is superb and saves me a lot of time, which is important when balancing my filmmaking, non-creative work and family.\u201d\nSolina uses an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU, as well as Omniverse apps like Audio2Face, Create and Machinima to create his films virtually.\n\nHe also uses Omniverse Connectors for 3D applications like Blender and Autodesk Maya, as well as Reallusion\u2019s iClone and Character Creator, with which he edits motion-capture data.\nAs a solo filmmaker, Solina said his main challenge is finding virtual assets \u2014 like characters and environments \u2014 that are photorealistic enough to use for movies.\n\u201cMy process can definitely be a bit backwards, since the ideal method would be to write a script and then find the assets to make the story come alive,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when I\u2019m limited in my resources, I have to think of a storyline that fits a character or an environment I find.\u201d\nNew support for the Omniverse ecosystem provided by 3D marketplaces and digital asset libraries helps solve this challenge \u2014 with thousands of Omniverse-ready assets for creators, all based on Universal Scene Description format.\nLooking forward, Solina plans to create a short film entirely inside Omniverse.\nTo hear more about Solina\u2019s workflow, check out his community spotlight livestream:\n\nExplore the NVIDIA Omniverse Instagram, gallery, forums and Medium channel.

Yet in homes and businesses around the world, it\u2019s quickly become the topic du jour: empty shelves; record price increases; clogged ports and sick truckers leading to disruptions near and far.\nThe business of organizing resources to supply a product or service to its final user feels like it\u2019s never been more challenged by so many variables. Shortages of raw materials, everything from resin and aluminum to paint and semiconductors, are nearing historic levels. Products that do get manufactured sit on cargo ships or in warehouses due to shortages of containers and workers and truck drivers that help deliver them to their final destinations. And consumer pocketbooks and paychecks are getting squeezed by rising prices.\nThe $9 trillion logistics industry is responding by investing in automation and using AI and big data to gain more insights throughout the supply chain. Big money is being poured into supply-chain technology startups, which raised $24.3 billion in venture funding in the first three quarters of 2021, 58 percent more than the full-year total for 2020, according to analytics firm PitchBook Data Inc.\n\nInvesting in AI\nBehind these investments, businesses see technology and accelerated computing as key to finding firmer ground. At Manifest 2022, a logistics and supply chain conference taking place in Las Vegas, the industry is discussing how to refine supply chains and create cost efficiencies using AI and machine learning. Among their goals: address labor shortages, improve throughput in distribution centers, and route deliveries more efficiently.\nTake a box of cereal. Getting it from the warehouse to a home has never been more expensive. Employee turnover rates of 30 percent to 46 percent in warehouses and distribution centers are just part of the problem.\nTo mitigate the challenge, Dematic, a global materials-handling company, is evaluating software from companies like Kinetic Vision, which has developed computer vision applications on the NVIDIA AI platform that add intelligence to automated warehouse systems.\nCompanies like Kinetic Vision and SF Technology use video data from cameras to optimize every step of the package lifecycle, accelerating throughput by up to 20 percent and reducing conveyor downtime, which can cost retailers $3,000 to $5,000 a minute.\nAutonomous robot companies such as Gideon, 6 River Systems and Symbotic also use the NVIDIA AI platform to improve distribution center throughput with their autonomous guided vehicles that transport material efficiently within the warehouse or distribution centers.\nAnd with NVIDIA Fleet Command, which securely deploys, manages and scales AI applications via the cloud across distributed edge infrastructure, these solutions can be remotely deployed and managed securely and at scale across hundreds of distribution centers.\nDigital Twins and Simulation\nImproving layouts of stores and distribution centers also has become key to achieving cost efficiencies. NVIDIA Omniverse, a virtual world simulation and 3D design collaboration platform, makes it possible to virtually design and simulate distribution centers at full fidelity. Users can improve workflows and throughput with photorealistic, physically accurate virtual environments.\nRetailers could, for example, develop a solution on the Omniverse platform to design, test and simulate the flow of material and employee processes in digital twins of their distribution centers and then bring those optimizations into the real world.\nDigital human simulations could test new workflows for employee ergonomics and productivity. And robots are trained and operated with the NVIDIA Isaac robotics platform, creating the most efficient layout and workflows.\nKinetic Vision is using NVIDIA Omniverse to deliver digital twins technology and simulation to optimize factories and retail and consumer packaged goods distribution centers.\nLeaning In\nWhile manufacturers, supply chain operators and retailers each will have their own approaches to solving challenges, they\u2019re leaning in on AI as a key differentiator.\nSuccessfully implementing AI-enabled supply-chain management has enabled early adopters to improve logistics costs by 15 percent, inventory levels by 35 percent and service levels by 65 percent, compared with slower-moving competitors, according to McKinsey.\nWith some experts predicting the global supply chain won\u2019t return to a new normal until at least 2023, companies are moving to take measures that matter most to the bottom line.\nFor more on how NVIDIA AI is powering the most innovative AI solutions for the supply chain and logistics industry attend the following talks at Manifest:\n\nA fireside chat, \u201cBringing Agility and Flexibility to Distribution Centers with AI,\u201d on Wednesday, Jan. 26, at 2 p.m. Pacific, in Champagne 4 with Azita Martin, vice president and general manager of AI for retail at NVIDIA, and Michael Larsson, CEO of North America region at Dematic.\nA presentation \u201cThe Next Frontier in Warehouse Intelligence\u201d on the same date, at 11:30 a.m. Pacific, in Champagne 4 with Azita Martin and Omer Rashid, vice president of Solutions Designs at DHL Supply Chain, and Renato Bottiglieri, chief logistics officer at Eggo Kitchen & House.\n\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | SoftwareTags: Omniverse Enterprise | Retail \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

That\u2019s why Vulkan is a very big deal.\nWith the release Tuesday of Vulkan 1.3, NVIDIA continues its unparalleled record of day one driver support for this cross-platform GPU application programming interface for 3D graphics and computing.\nVulkan has been created by experts from across the industry working together at the Khronos Group, an open standards consortium. From the start, NVIDIA has worked to advance this effort. NVIDIA\u2019s Neil Trevett has been Khronos president since its earliest days.\n\u201cNVIDIA has consistently been at the forefront of computer graphics with new, enhanced tools, and technologies for developers to create rich game experiences,\u201d said Jon Peddie, president of Jon Peddie Research.\n\u201cTheir guidance and support for Vulkan 1.3 development, and release of a new compatible driver on day one across NVIDIA GPUs contributes to the successful cross-platform functionality and performance for games and apps this new API will bring,\u201d he said.\nWith a simpler, thinner driver and efficient CPU multi-threading capabilities, Vulkan has less latency and overhead than alternatives, such as OpenGL or older versions of Direct3D.\nIf you use Vulkan, NVIDIA GPUs are a no-brainer. Here\u2019s why:\n\nNVIDIA consistently provides industry leadership to evolve new Vulkan functionality and is often the first to make leading-edge computer graphics techniques available to developers. This ensures cutting-edge titles are supported on Vulkan and, by extension, made available to more gamers.\nNVIDIA designs hardware to provide the fastest Vulkan performance for your games and applications. For example, NVIDIA GPUs perform up over 30 percent faster than the nearest competition on games such as Doom Eternal with advanced rendering techniques such as ray tracing.\nNVIDIA provides the broadest range of Vulkan functionality to ensure you can run the games and apps that you want and need. NVIDIA\u2019s production drivers support advanced features such as ray-tracing and DLSS AI rendering across multiple platforms, including Windows and popular Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Kylin and RHEL.\nNVIDIA works hard to be the platform of choice for Vulkan development with tools that are often the first to support the latest Vulkan functionality, encouraging apps and games to be optimized first for NVIDIA. NVIDIA Nsight, our suite of development tools, has integrated support for Vulkan, including debugging and optimizing of applications using full ray-tracing functionality. NVIDIA also provides extensive Vulkan code samples, tutorials and best practice guidance so developers can get the very best performance from their code.\nNVIDIA makes Vulkan available across a wider range of platforms and hardware than anyone else for easier cross-platform portability. NVIDIA ships Vulkan on PCs, embedded platforms, automotive and the data center. And gamers enjoy ongoing support of the latest Vulkan API changes with older GPUs.\nNVIDIA aims to bulletproof your games with highly reliable game-ready drivers. NVIDIA treats Vulkan as a first-class citizen API with focused development and support. In fact, developers can download our zero-day Vulkan 1.3 drivers right now at https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver.\n\nLook for more details about our commitment and leadership in Vulkan on NVIDIA\u2019s Vulkan web page.

A traditional gene panel analysis ordered at the same time took two weeks to return results.\nThis ultra-rapid sequencing method, detailed today in the New England Journal of Medicine, helped clinicians manage the epilepsy case by providing insight about the infant\u2019s seizure types and treatment response to anti-seizure medications.\nThe method set the first Guinness World Record for fastest DNA sequencing technique: five hours and 2 minutes. It was developed by researchers from Stanford University, NVIDIA, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Google, Baylor College of Medicine and the University of California at Santa Cruz.\nThe researchers accelerated both base calling and variant calling using NVIDIA GPUs on Google Cloud. Variant calling, the process of identifying the millions of variants in a genome, was also sped up with NVIDIA Clara Parabricks, a computational genomics application framework.\nEuan Ashley, MB ChB, DPhil, the paper\u2019s corresponding author and a professor of medicine, of genetics and of biomedical data science at Stanford University School of Medicine, will be speaking at NVIDIA GTC, which runs online March 21-24.\nRacing Against Time, Making Clinical Impact\nIdentifying genetic variants associated with a specific disease is a classic needle-in-the-haystack problem, often requiring researchers to comb through a person\u2019s genome of 3 billion base pairs to find a single change that causes the disease.\nIt\u2019s a lengthy process: A typical whole human genome sequencing diagnostic test takes six to eight weeks. Even rapid turnaround tests take two or three days. In many cases, this can be too slow to make a difference in treatment of a critically ill patient.\nBy optimizing the diagnosis pipeline to take only 7-10 hours, clinicians can more quickly identify genetic clues that inform patient care plans. In this pilot project, genomes were sequenced for a dozen patients, most of them children, at Stanford Health Care and Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford.\nIn five of the cases, the team found diagnostic variants that were reviewed by physicians and used to inform clinical decisions including heart transplant and drug prescription.\n\u201cGenomic information can provide rich insights and enable a clearer picture to be built,\u201d said Gordon Sanghera, CEO of Oxford Nanopore Technologies. \u201cA workflow which could deliver this information in near real time has the potential to provide meaningful benefits in a variety of settings in which rapid access to information is critical.\u201d\nAI Calls It: Identifying Variants with Clara Parabricks\nThe researchers found ways to optimize every step of the pipeline, including speeding up sample preparation and using nanopore sequencing on Oxford Nanopore\u2019s PromethION Flow Cells to generate more than 100 gigabases of data per hour.\nThis sequencing data was sent to NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs in a Google Cloud computing environment for base calling \u2014 the process of turning raw signals from the device into a string of A, T, G and C nucleotides \u2014\u00a0 and alignment in near real time. Distributing the data across cloud GPU instances helped minimize latency.\nNext, the scientists had to find tiny variations within the DNA sequence that could cause a genetic disorder. Known as variant calling, this stage was sped up with Clara Parabricks using a GPU-accelerated version of PEPPER-Margin-DeepVariant, a pipeline developed in a collaboration between Google and UC Santa Cruz\u2019s Computational Genomics Laboratory.\nDeepVariant uses convolutional neural networks for highly accurate variant calling. The GPU-accelerated DeepVariant Germline Pipeline software in Clara Parabricks provides results at 10x the speed of native DeepVariant instances, decreasing the time to identify disease-causing variants.\n\u201cTogether with our collaborators and some of the world\u2019s leaders in genomics, we were able to develop a rapid sequencing analysis workflow that has already shown tangible clinical benefits,\u201d said NVIDIA\u2019s Mehrzad Samadi, who co-led the creation of Parabricks and co-authored the New England Journal of Medicine article. \u201cThese are the kinds of high-impact problems we live to solve.\u201d\nRead the full publication in the New England Journal of Medicine and get started with a 90-day trial of NVIDIA Clara Parabricks, which can help analyze a whole human genome in under 30 minutes.\nSubscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news here.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Deep Learning | ResearchTags: Artificial Intelligence | Genomics | Healthcare and Life Sciences | NVIDIA Clara | Science | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The company uses the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier edge AI platform, which provides GPU-accelerated computing in a compact and energy-efficient module, and the NVIDIA TensorRT software development kit for high-performance deep learning inference.\nPulling the Brakes in Real Time\nA train\u2019s braking distance \u2014 or the distance a train travels between when its brakes are pulled and when it comes to a complete stop \u2014 is usually so long that by the time a driver spots a railway obstacle, it could be too late to do anything about it.\nFor example, the braking distance for a train traveling 100 miles per hour is 800 meters, or about a half-mile, according to Hania. Rail Vision systems can detect objects on and along tracks from up to two kilometers, or 1.25 miles, away.\nBy sending alerts, both visual and acoustic, of potential obstacles in real time, Rail Vision systems give drivers over 20 seconds to respond and make decisions on braking.\nThe systems can also be integrated with a train\u2019s infrastructure to automatically apply brakes when an obstacle is detected, even without a driver\u2019s cue.\n\n\u201cTons of deep learning inference possibilities are made possible with NVIDIA GPU technology,\u201d Hania said. \u201cThe main advantage of using the NVIDIA Jetson platform is that there are lots of goodies inside \u2014 compressors, modules for optical flow \u2014 that all speed up the embedding process and make our systems more accurate.\u201d\nBoosting Maintenance, in Addition to Safety\nIn addition to preventing accidents, Rail Vision systems help save operational time and costs spent on railway maintenance \u2014 which can be as high as $50 billion annually, according to Hania.\nIf a railroad accident occurs, four to eight hours are typically spent handling the situation \u2014 which prevents other trains from using the track, said Hania.\nRail Vision systems use AI to monitor the tracks and prevent such workflow slow-downs, or quickly alert operators when they do occur \u2014 giving them time to find alternate routes or plans of action.\nThe systems are scalable and deployable for different use cases \u2014 with some focused solely on these maintenance aspects of railway operations.\nWatch a Rail Vision system at work.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Customer Stories | GPU | Inception | Jetson | Metropolis | Public Sector | Smart Spaces | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The model uses NVIDIA GPUs to simulate 7,000 genetic information processes over a 20-minute span of the cell cycle \u2013 making it what the scientists believe is the longest, most complex cell simulation to date.\nMinimal cells are simpler than naturally occurring ones, making them easier to recreate digitally.\n\u201cEven a minimal cell requires 2 billion atoms,\u201d said Zaida Luthey-Schulten, chemistry professor and co-director of the university\u2019s Center for the Physics of Living Cells. \u201cYou cannot do a 3D model like this in a realistic human time scale without GPUs.\u201d\nOnce further tested and refined, whole-cell models can help scientists predict how changes to the conditions or genomes of real-world cells will affect their function. But even at this stage, minimal cell simulation can give scientists insight into the physical and chemical processes that form the foundation of living cells.\n\u201cWhat we found is that fundamental behaviors emerge from the simulated cell \u2014 not because we programmed them in, but because we had the kinetic parameters and lipid mechanisms correct in our model,\u201d she said.\nLattice Microbes, the GPU-accelerated software co-developed by Luthey-Schulten and used to simulate the 3D minimal cell, is available on the NVIDIA NGC software hub.\nMinimal Cell With Maximum Realism\nTo build the living cell model, the Illinois researchers simulated one of the simplest living cells, a parasitic bacteria called mycoplasma. They based the model on a trimmed-down version of a mycoplasma cell synthesized by scientists at J. Craig Venter Institute in La Jolla, Calif., which had just under 500 genes to keep it viable.\nFor comparison, a single E. coli cell has around 5,000 genes. A human cell has more than 20,000.\nLuthy-Schulten\u2019s team then used known properties of the mycoplasma\u2019s inner workings, including amino acids, nucleotides, lipids and small molecule metabolites to build out the model with DNA, RNA, proteins and membranes.\n\u201cWe had enough of the reactions that we could reproduce everything known,\u201d she said.\nUsing Lattice Microbes software on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs, the researchers ran a 20-minute 3D simulation of the cell\u2019s life cycle, before it starts to substantially expand or replicate its DNA. The model showed that the cell dedicated most of its energy to transporting molecules across the cell membrane, which fits its profile as a parasitic cell.\n\u201cIf you did these calculations serially, or at an all-atom level, it\u2019d take years,\u201d said graduate student and paper lead author Zane Thornburg. \u201cBut because they\u2019re all independent processes, we could bring parallelization into the code and make use of GPUs.\u201d\nThornburg is working on another GPU-accelerated project to simulate growth and cell division in 3D. The team has recently adopted NVIDIA DGX systems and RTX A5000 GPUs to further accelerate its work, and found that using A5000 GPUs sped up the benchmark simulation time by 40 percent compared to a development workstation with a previous-generation NVIDIA GPU.\nLearn more about researchers using NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate science breakthroughs by registering free for NVIDIA GTC, running online March 21-24.\nMain image is a snapshot from the 20-minute 3D spatial simulation, showing yellow and purple ribosomes, red and blue degradasomes, and smaller spheres representing DNA polymers and proteins. \n\n\nCategories: ResearchTags: High-Performance Computing | Science | Scientific Visualization | Simulation and Design | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Optimized, certified and supported by NVIDIA, the latest version of the software suite brings new updates including production support for containerized AI with the NVIDIA software on VMware vSphere with Tanzu, which was previously only available on a trial basis. Now, enterprises can run accelerated AI workloads on vSphere, running in both Kubernetes containers and virtual machines with NVIDIA AI Enterprise to support advanced AI development on mainstream IT infrastructure.\nEnterprise AI Simplified with VMware vSphere with Tanzu, Coming Soon to NVIDIA LaunchPad\nAmong the top customer-requested features in NVIDIA AI Enterprise 1.1 is production support for running on VMware vSphere with Tanzu, which enables developers to run AI workloads on both containers and virtual machines within their vSphere environments. This new milestone in the AI-ready platform curated by NVIDIA and VMware provides an integrated, complete stack of containerized software and hardware optimized for AI, all fully managed by IT.\nNVIDIA will soon add VMware vSphere with Tanzu support to the NVIDIA LaunchPad program for NVIDIA AI Enterprise, available at nine Equinix locations around the world. Qualified enterprises can test and prototype AI workloads at no charge through curated labs designed for the AI practitioner and IT admin. The labs showcase how to develop and manage common AI workloads like chatbots and recommendation systems, using NVIDIA AI Enterprise and VMware vSphere, and soon with Tanzu.\n\u201cOrganizations are accelerating AI and ML development projects and VMware vSphere with Tanzu running NVIDIA AI Enterprise easily empowers AI development requirements with modern infrastructure services,\u201d said Matt Morgan, vice president of Product Marketing, Cloud Infrastructure Business Group at VMware. \u201cThis announcement marks another key milestone for VMware and NVIDIA in our sustained efforts to help teams leverage AI across the enterprise.\u201d\nGrowing Demand for Containerized AI Development\nWhile enterprises are eager to use containerized development for AI, the complexity of these workloads requires orchestration across many layers of infrastructure. NVIDIA AI Enterprise 1.1 provides an ideal solution for these challenges as an AI-ready enterprise platform.\n\u201cAI is a very popular modern workload that is increasingly favoring deployment in containers. However, deploying AI capabilities at scale within the enterprise can be extremely complex, requiring enablement at multiple layers of the stack, from AI software frameworks, operating systems, containers, VMs, and down to the hardware,\u201d said Gary Chen, research director, Software Defined Compute at IDC. \u201cTurnkey, full-stack AI solutions can greatly simplify deployment and make AI more accessible within the enterprise.\u201d\nDomino Data Lab MLOps Validation Accelerates AI Research and Data Science Lifecycle\nThe 1.1 release of NVIDIA AI Enterprise also provides validation for the Domino Data Lab Enterprise MLOps Platform with VMware vSphere with Tanzu. This new integration enables more companies to cost-effectively scale data science by accelerating research, model development, and model deployment on mainstream accelerated servers.\n\u201cThis new phase of our collaboration with NVIDIA further enables enterprises to solve the world\u2019s most challenging problems by putting models at the heart of their businesses,\u201d said Thomas Robinson, vice president of Strategic Partnerships at Domino Data Lab. \u201cTogether, we are providing every company the end-to-end platform to rapidly and cost-effectively deploy models enterprise-wide.\u201d\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise 1.1 features support for VMware vSphere with Tanzu and validation for the Domino Data Lab Enterprise MLOps Platform.\nNew OEMs and Integrators Offering NVIDIA-Certified Systems for NVIDIA AI Enterprise\nAmidst the new release of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, the industry ecosystem is expanding with the first NVIDIA-Certified Systems from Cisco and Hitachi Vantara, as well as a growing roster of newly qualified system integrators offering solutions for the software suite.\nThe first Cisco system to be NVIDIA-Certified for NVIDIA AI Enterprise is the Cisco UCS C240 M6 rack server with NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. The two-socket, 2RU form factor can power a wide range of storage and I/O-intensive applications, such as big data analytics, databases, collaboration, virtualization, consolidation and high-performance computing.\n\u201cAt Cisco we are helping simplify customers\u2019 hybrid cloud and cloud-native transformation. NVIDIA-Certified Cisco UCS servers, powered by Cisco Intersight, deliver the best-in-class AI workload experiences in the market,\u201d said Siva Sivakumar, vice president of product management at Cisco. \u201cThe certification of the Cisco UCS C240 M6 rack server for NVIDIA AI Enterprise allows customers to add AI using the same infrastructure and management software deployed throughout their data center.\u201d\nThe first NVIDIA-Certified System from Hitachi Vantara compatible with NVIDIA AI Enterprise is the Hitachi Advanced Server DS220 G2 with NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. The general-purpose, dual-processor server is optimized for performance and capacity, and delivers a balance of compute and storage with the flexibility to power a wide range of solutions and applications.\n\u201cFor many enterprises, cost is an important consideration when deploying new technologies like AI-powered quality control, recommender systems, chatbots and more,\u201d said Dan McConnell, senior vice president, Product Management at Hitachi Vantara. \u201cAccelerated with NVIDIA A100 GPUs and now certified for NVIDIA AI Enterprise, Hitachi Unified Compute Platform (UCP) solutions using the Hitachi Advanced Server DS220 G2 gives customers an ideal path for affordably integrating powerful AI-ready infrastructure to their data centers.\u201d\nA broad range of additional server manufacturers offer NVIDIA-Certified Systems for NVIDIA AI Enterprise. These include Atos, Dell Technologies, GIGABYTE, New H3C Information Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Inspur Electronic Information, Lenovo and Supermicro, all of whose systems feature NVIDIA A100, NVIDIA A30 or other NVIDIA GPUs. Customers can also choose to deploy NVIDIA AI Enterprise on their own servers or on as-a-service bare metal infrastructure from Equinix Metal across nine regions globally.\nAMAX, Colfax International, Exxact Corporation and Lambda are the newest system integrators qualified for NVIDIA AI Enterprise, joining a global ecosystem of channel partners that includes Axians, Carahsoft Technology Corp., Computacenter, Insight Enterprises, NTT, Presidio, Sirius, SoftServe, SVA System Vertrieb Alexander GmbH, TD SYNNEX, Trace3 and World Wide Technology.\nEnterprises interested in experiencing development with NVIDIA AI Enterprise can apply for instant access to no cost using curated labs via the NVIDIA LaunchPad program, which also features labs using NVIDIA Fleet Command for edge AI, as well as NVIDIA Base Command for demanding AI development workloads.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Its product, Bright Cluster Manager, becomes the latest addition to NVIDIA\u2019s software stack for accelerated computing.\nBright Computing, founded in 2009 and headquartered in Amsterdam, has customers that include household names such as Boeing, NASA, Johns Hopkins University and Siemens.\nWe\u2019ve been working with Bright for more than a decade as they integrated their software with our GPUs, networking, CUDA and most recently DGX systems.\nNow we see an opportunity to combine our system software capabilities to make HPC data centers easier to buy, build and operate, creating a much larger future for HPC.\nNVIDIA\u2019s partners will take Bright\u2019s software to more markets. And Bright\u2019s software and expertise will enhance our growing NVIDIA DGX and data center businesses.\nBright\u2019s flexible software can run at the edge, in the data center and across multiple public or hybrid clouds. It automates administration for clusters whether they\u2019re made up of a handful or hundreds of thousands of servers. And it supports Arm and x86 CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs and Kubernetes containers.\nWe welcome Bright\u2019s employees into NVIDIA. Together, we\u2019ll continue to support Bright\u2019s customers and invest in its product roadmap to grow the business.\n\u201cNVIDIA is changing the world as we know it, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited for our team and software to play a part in that,\u201d said Bill Wagner, CEO of Bright Computing.\nReady for the Industrial HPC Era\nThe combination of HPC, accelerated computing and AI has spawned what NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang calls \u201can industrial HPC era.\u201d\nClusters are at the heart of HPC\u2019s scale-out style of computing, born in supercomputing centers and increasingly going mainstream to support AI.\nCompanies and developers in every field are adopting HPC systems to build physically accurate 3D simulations and digital twins for work as diverse as drug discovery, product design and factory automation \u2014 many of them using NVIDIA Omniverse.\nBolstered by Bright Computing\u2019s team and software, NVIDIA will continue to democratize access to HPC and accelerated computing.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Data Center | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | Digital Twin | GPU | GPU Computing | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA DGX | Omniverse | Simulation and Design | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This year, NVIDIA is showing the radical innovation happening now.\nDuring a special virtual address at the show, Ali Kani, vice president and general manager of Automotive at NVIDIA, detailed the capabilities of DRIVE Hyperion and the many ways the industry is developing on the platform. These critical advancements show the maturity of autonomous driving technology as companies begin to deploy safer, more efficient transportation.\n\nDeveloping autonomous vehicle technology requires an entirely new platform architecture and software development process. Both the hardware and software must be comprehensively tested and validated to ensure they can handle the harsh conditions of daily driving with the stringent safety and security needs of automated vehicles\nThis is why NVIDIA has built and made open the DRIVE Hyperion platform, which includes a high-performance computer and sensor architecture that meets the safety requirements of a fully autonomous vehicle. DRIVE Hyperion is designed with redundant NVIDIA DRIVE Orin systems-on-a-chip for software-defined vehicles that continuously improve and create a wide variety of new software- and service-based business models for vehicle manufacturers.\nThe latest-generation platform includes 12 state-of-the-art surround cameras, 12 ultrasonics, nine radar, three interior sensing cameras and one front-facing lidar. It\u2019s architected to be functionally safe, so that if one computer or sensor fails, there is a back up available to ensure that the AV can drive its passengers to a safe place.\nThe DRIVE Hyperion architecture has been adopted by hundreds of automakers, truck makers, tier 1 suppliers and robotaxi companies, ushering in the new era of autonomy.\nInnovation at Scale\nBringing this comprehensive platform architecture to the global automotive ecosystem requires collaboration with leading tier 1 suppliers.\nDesay, Flex, Quanta, Valeo and ZF are now DRIVE Hyperion 8 platform scaling partners, manufacturing production-ready designs with the highest levels of functional safety and security.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to work with NVIDIA on their DRIVE Hyperion platform,\u201d said Geoffrey Buoquot, CTO and vice president of Strategy at Valeo. \u201cOn top of our latest generation ultrasonic sensors providing digital raw data that their AI classifiers can process and our 12 cameras, including the new 8-megapixel cameras, we are now also able to deliver an Orin-based platform to support autonomous driving applications with consistent performance under automotive environmental conditions and production requirements.\u201d\n\u201cFlex is thrilled to collaborate with NVIDIA to help accelerate the deployment of autonomous and ADAS systems leveraging the DRIVE Orin platform to design solutions for use across multiple customers,\u201d said Mike Thoeny, president of Automotive at Flex.\nThe breadth and depth of this supplier ecosystem demonstrate how DRIVE Hyperion has become the industry\u2019s most open and adopted platform architecture. These scaling partners will help make it possible for the platform to start production as early as this year.\nNew Energy for a New Era\nThe radical transformation of the transportation industry extends from compute power to powertrains.\nElectric vehicles aren\u2019t just better for the environment, they also fundamentally improve the driving experience for consumers. With a quieter and more sustainable profile, EVs will begin to make up the majority of cars sold over the next several decades.\nThis evolution has given way to dozens of new energy vehicle startups. They have reimagined the car, starting with a new vehicle architecture based on programmable, software-defined compute. These NEVs will continuously improve over time with over-the-air updates.\nMany leading NEV makers are adopting DRIVE Hyperion as the platform to develop these clean, intelligent models. From the storied performance heritage of Polestar to the breakthrough success of IM Motors, Li Auto, NIO, R Auto and Xpeng, these companies are reinventing the personal transportation experience.\n\nThese companies are benefiting from new, software-driven business models. With a centralized compute architecture, automakers can deliver fresh services and advanced functions throughout the life of the vehicle.\nTruly Intelligent Logistics\nAI isn\u2019t just transforming personal transportation, it\u2019s also addressing the rapidly growing challenges faced by the trucking and logistics industry.\nOver the past decade, and accelerated by the pandemic, consumer shopping has dramatically shifted online, resulting in increased demand for trucking and last-mile delivery. This trend is expected to continue, as experts predict that 170 billion packages will be shipped worldwide this year, climbing to 280 billion in 2027.\nAt the same time, the trucking industry has been experiencing significant driver shortages, with the U.S. expected to be in need of more than 160,000 drivers by 2028.\nTuSimple is facing these challenges head-on with its scalable Autonomous Freight Network. This network uses autonomous trucks to safely and efficiently move goods across the country. And today, the company announced these intelligent trucks will be powered by NVIDIA DRIVE Orin.\n\nThe advanced SoC will be at the center of TuSimple\u2019s autonomous domain controller (ADC), which serves as an autonomous truck\u2019s central compute unit that processes hundreds of trillions of operations per second, including mission-critical perception, planning and actuation functions.\nAs a result, TuSimple can accelerate the development of a high-performance, automotive-grade and scalable ADC that can be integrated into production trucks.\nEveryone\u2019s Digital Assistant\nKani also demonstrated the NVIDIA DRIVE Concierge platform, which delivers intelligent services that are always on.\nDRIVE Concierge combines NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar, DRIVE IX, DRIVE AV 4D perception, Riva GPU-accelerated speech AI SDK and an array of deep neural networks to delight customers on every drive.\nOmniverse Avatar connects speech AI, computer vision, natural language understanding, recommendation engines and simulation. Avatars created on the platform are interactive characters with ray-traced 3D graphics that can see, speak, converse on a wide range of subjects, and understand naturally spoken intent.\nDuring the CES special address, a demo showed highlights of a vehicle equipped with DRIVE Concierge making the trip to Las Vegas, helping the driver prepare for the trip, plan schedules and, most importantly, relax while the car was safely piloted by the DRIVE Chauffeur.\n\nThese important developments in intelligent driving technology, as well as innovations from suppliers, automakers and trucking companies all building on NVIDIA DRIVE, are heralding the arrival of the autonomous era.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

That could advance fields such as natural-language processing for jobs like identifying harmful content in real time.\nIn addition to performance at scale, Meta cited extreme reliability, security, privacy and the flexibility to handle \u201ca wide range of AI models\u201d as its key criteria for RSC.\nMeta\u2019s AI Research SuperCluster features hundreds of NVIDIA DGX systems linked on an NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand network to accelerate the work of its AI research teams.\nUnder the Hood\nThe new AI supercomputer currently uses 760 NVIDIA DGX A100 systems as its compute nodes. They pack a total of 6,080 NVIDIA A100 GPUs linked on an NVIDIA Quantum 200Gb/s InfiniBand network to deliver 1,895 petaflops of TF32 performance.\nDespite challenges from COVID-19, RSC took just 18 months to go from an idea on paper to a working AI supercomputer (shown in the video below) thanks in part to the NVIDIA DGX A100 technology at the foundation of Meta RSC.\nPenguin Computing is our\u00a0NVIDIA Partner Network delivery partner for RSC. In addition to the 760 DGX A100 systems and InfiniBand networking, Penguin provided managed services and AI-optimized infrastructure for Meta comprised of 46 petabytes of cache storage with its Altus systems. Pure Storage FlashBlade and FlashArray//C provide the highly performant and scalable all-flash storage capabilities needed to power RSC.\n\ufeff\ufeff\n20x Performance Gains\nIt\u2019s the second time Meta has picked NVIDIA technologies as the base for its research infrastructure. In 2017, Meta built the first generation of this infrastructure for AI research with 22,000 NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs that handles 35,000 AI training jobs a day.\nMeta\u2019s early benchmarks showed RSC can train large NLP models 3x faster and run computer vision jobs 20x faster than the prior system.\nIn a second phase later this year, RSC will expand to 16,000 GPUs that Meta believes will deliver a whopping 5 exaflops of mixed precision AI performance. And Meta aims to expand RSC\u2019s storage system to deliver up to an exabyte of data at 16 terabytes per second.\nA Scalable Architecture\nNVIDIA AI technologies are available to enterprises of any size.\nNVIDIA DGX, which includes a full stack of NVIDIA AI software, scales easily from a single system to a DGX SuperPOD running on-premises or at a colocation provider. Customers can also rent DGX systems through NVIDIA DGX Foundry.\n\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep Learning | Hardware | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA DGX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(PHOTO: REUTERS/Dawn Chua)  \u00b7 Dawn Chua / reuters By Chanyaporn Chanjaroen and Low De Wei (Bloomberg) \u2013 Workers in Singapore who are not inoculated against Covid-19 may risk losing their jobs as new restrictions on office access take effect. From Saturday, a prior concession that allowed unvaccinated employees who test negative to go to workplaces will be removed, according to a government advisory. Employers can redeploy those with no jabs to suitable jobs that can be done from home, place them on no-pay leave, or as a last resort, fire them if they can\u2019t perform their contracted work outside the office.  Singapore\u2019s inoculation rate is among the world\u2019s highest and it has adopted a strict nationwide approach against the unvaccinated. The nation bars them from restaurants and shopping malls in a push to prevent the risks of the virus spreading and over-burdening its healthcare system. At the same time, the country has stuck to a gradual reopening path, dropping its default work-from-home stance this month. \u201cIf you think about it, if all the 48,000 were infected with Covid-19, it would indeed impact on our healthcare system,\u201d said Rahayu Mahzam, the Ministry of Health\u2019s parliamentary secretary, referring to the number of workers who had not taken any vaccine dose as of Jan. 2 and who make up less than 2% of the total workforce. A fully vaccinated workforce would be able to operate more safely, Rahayu said in parliament on Jan. 10. She also cited statistics showing how throughout the pandemic, two-thirds of beds in intensive care units are taken up by people who aren\u2019t inoculated.  Venues requiring vaccination for entryDate of implementation F&B establishmentsAug. 10 Shopping malls, attractions, coffee shops and hawker centersOct. 13 In-person visits to hospitals, nursing homesNov. 22 Libraries, selected activities at community clubsDec. 1 Workplaces (without testing alternative)Jan. 15  Most other countries do not take such a uniform approach, and it\u2019s the private sector which takes the lead on deciding office access. In the U.S. for instance, the Supreme Court this week blocked President Joe Biden\u2019s attempt to get 80 million workers to take their shots or undergo periodic tests. Meanwhile, firms including Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have moved to require vaccination for U.S. staff. Understanding Concerns In Singapore, 87% of the total population are fully vaccinated and 49% have gotten booster shots. The Singapore Business Federation and Singapore Manufacturing Federation advocate that employers speak to workers who have yet to get their jabs to understand their concerns.   Story continues \u201cAs the inability to return to the workplace will have implications on the performance of unvaccinated employees, we urge all unvaccinated employees who are eligible for vaccination to go for their vaccination as soon as possible,\u201d Lam Yi Young, chief executive officer of the SBF, said in an emailed reply to Bloomberg questions. Companies can also provide time-off for workers to get their shots, Lam added.As the bulk of vaccinated workers eventually go back to the office more frequently, the prolonged absence from the workplace of those without inoculation may affect both their performance as well as that of the organization, the government advisory, issued with the trade union and the employers federation, states.Some other points made in the Dec 27. advisory:If termination of employment is due to employees\u2019 inability to be at the workplace to perform their contracted work, it would not be considered as wrongful dismissal. Those medically ineligible for vaccines will still be allowed in offices. Still, employers should consider allowing them to work from home if they can do so, and that shouldn\u2019t affect assessment of their performance. Employers should not terminate the employment of medically eligible but unvaccinated pregnant employees and are strongly encouraged to give special consideration to their needs and concerns. \u00a9 2022 Bloomberg L.P.

Homegrown building construction and property development company Lian Beng Group has reported earnings of $14.9 million in the 1HFY2022 ended Nov 30, 2021, 15.5% lower than earnings of $17.6 million during the same period the year before.  The lower results were in line with the group\u2019s profit guidance posted on Jan 6, 2022. On the other hand, the group\u2019s subsidiary, SLB Development, more than doubled its earnings to $12.0 million in the 1HFY2022 due to several reasons, including a stronger pick-up of INSPACE units. During the 1HFY2022, Lian Beng Group\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) fell 15.5% y-o-y to 2.98 cents on a fully diluted basis. Revenue for the period, however, surged 91.0% y-o-y to $377.3 million mainly due to higher contributions from the construction and property development segments. Revenue from the construction segment climbed 98.7% y-o-y to $310.1 million from the low base in the 1HFY2021. The pace of work resumption had been slow after the lifting of the government\u2019s circuit breaker measures that took place during the group\u2019s 1HFY2021. This was due to manpower disruption from the workers\u2019 movement control and stringent safe management measures. The growth in 1HFY2022 reflects a y-o-y improvement in the level of construction activity and progress made in various construction projects, says the group.  Revenue from the property development segment spiked 109.5% y-o-y to $39.9 million in the 1HFY2022 mainly due to the higher number of INSPACE units sold, along with the higher revenue recognition in line with the progress made in construction. The higher revenue was partly offset by the absence of revenue recognised from Mactaggart Foodlink, as the project obtained its temporary occupation limit (TOP) in March 2021. Revenue from the investment holding segment grew by 41.3% y-o-y to $17.0 million in the 1HFY2022 due to contribution from its investment property, BreadTalk IHQ. The acquisition of the property was completed in April 2021. In line with the higher business activity, the group\u2019s cost of sales surged by 99.1% y-o-y to $343.8 million. Accordingly, gross profit for the half-year period increased by 35.2% y-o-y to $33.5 million, although gross profit margin (GPM) fell 4 percentage points to 9% in 1HFY2022 mainly due to the higher cost of sales recognised by the construction segment on the back of the ongoing Covid-19 situation. Other operating income fell 52.4% to $10.0 million due to lower grants and incentives from the Singapore government and the absence of net unrealised net exchange gain recognised in 1HFY2022.   Story continues Distribution expenses rose 109.0% y-o-y to $2.5 million due to the marketing expenses for INSPACE.Other operating expenses increased by $2.3 million to $7.3 million mainly due to a net unrealised exchange loss of $2.1 million in the 1HFY2022. The unrealised exchange loss mainly arose from the revaluation of the group\u2019s British pound (GBP) and Australian dollar (AUD) denominated assets following the depreciation of these currencies against the Singapore dollar (SGD), as well as the US dollar (USD) bank denominated loans as a result of the appreciation of USD against the SGD.Finance cost increased 23.9% to $7.0 million in 1HFY2022, mainly due to the increase in interest expense on bank loans drawn down for development property Thye Hong Centre and investment property BreadTalk IHQ.Share of profit from associates increased from $4.6 million in 1HFY2021 to $12.7 million in 1HFY2022, on the back of higher development profits from the sale of units in Affinity @ Serangoon, Riverfront Residences and Rezi 24, along with progress made in the construction of these projects.Despite higher profit contribution from the property development segment, only 77.6% of the segment\u2019s profit, representing the effective interest held by the group in SLB and excluding non-controlling interest, was recognised as attributable to owners of the company.As at Nov 30, 2021, cash and cash equivalents stood at $204.7 million. An interim dividend of 1.0 cent per share has been declared for the 1HFY2022. The dividend will be paid out on Jan 31.As at Jan 14, the group\u2019s order book stood at $1.3 billion, which should \u201csupport its construction activities through to FY2026\u201d.\u201cThe group will closely monitor the delivery of these projects, while selectively tendering for public and private sector contracts as opportunities arise,\u201d says Lian Beng Group in a statement on Jan 14.The group also expects to face manpower challenges that may impact the completion of some projects under its property development segment. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, Lian Beng Group expects its dormitory and investment holding segments to continue generating stable recurring income in the following months.Looking ahead, Ong Pang Aik, chairman and managing director of Lian Beng Group, warns, \u201cThe construction industry continues to be plagued by rising cost and manpower issues. The group expects the construction sector\u2019s operating conditions to remain difficult in the year ahead, amid continued manpower shortage and deployment challenges.\u201dShares in Lian Beng Group closed 0.5 cent lower or 0.92% down at 54 cents on Jan 14.See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore HC Surgical Specialists report 7.2% lower earnings of $4.6 mil for the 1HFY2022 HC Surgical Specialists report 7.2% lower earnings of $4.6 mil for the 1HFY2022 SLB Development to report 'significant increase' in net profit for 1HFY22; Lian Beng Group expects lower performance Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

(Source: Getty)  SINGAPORE \u2014 While you were casually browsing Instagram, checking out photos of celebrities and influencers, they were likely getting richer with every follow request, like and comment. Social media marketing management platform Hopper has released its 2021 Instagram Rich List, and it seems while a picture is worth a thousand words, it can also add up to a lot of money.  Each paid post rakes in millions for some of the most influential people on Insta and several factors determine their earnings, such as the number of followers/subscribers they have, the endorsement offers they get, engagement of people who follow them, production costs, their track record, etc. Although 56 of the 100 highest-earning Instagram influencers in 2021 were female, the top earner was male. At least 8 Singaporeans are on the full list of 395 influencers, but did any of them make it to the top 10? Take a look. 327.

So, the fact that UOB recently launched a Lady\u2019s Savings Account doesn\u2019t come as a surprise. Unlike the UOB One account, however, the UOB Lady\u2019s Savings Account is not a high interest savings account.  With the UOB Lady\u2019s Savings Account, the bank has moved away from high interest rates as a selling point and appealing to customers with other perks such as female cancer insurance coverage, some medical and wellness benefits. But are these perks attractive enough to justify stashing your cash in a low interest rate account? Let\u2019s find out.   UOB logo   UOB One Account Base Interest Rate p.a. 0.05% 0.05% 2.5% Min.

Highlights Citizenship Status  S$500 S$1,000 S$5 N/A   See all card details  How does the UOB Lady\u2019s Savings Account work? Let\u2019s get to the facts straight away. The UOB Lady\u2019s Savings Account is not a high interest savings account. They pay out a base interest rate of only 0.05% per annum, which is similar to what you\u2019d get from your basic POSB or DBS savings account. What it is however, is a savings account that offers complimentary female cancer coverage as well as some medical and wellness benefits. The amount of insurance coverage you receive increases based on your account balance. The initial deposit required is $1,000, and you have to maintain a minimum balance of $1,000 in order to avoid the fall-below fee of $2 per month.

These healthcare and wellness perks are the same no matter how much or how little cash you have in your account.UOB Savings Account cancer insuranceThe insurance offered by this account covers six cancers specific to women \u2014 breast, cervix uteri, uterus, fallopian tube, vagina/vulva and ovary.The sum assured rises with your account balance. Monthly average balanceFemale cancer insurance sum assured $10,000 and below$1,000 $10,001 \u2013 $25,000$10,000 $25,001 \u2013 $50,000$25,000 $50,001 \u2013 $75,000$75,000 $75,001 \u2013 $100,000$100,000 > $100,000$200,000 Who is the UOB Lady\u2019s Savings Account suitable for?Only women aged 16 to 50 can sign up for the account. The insurance protection is valid until the age of 64.This account could be worthwhile if you already have critical illness protection and want to beef it up with UOB\u2019s free protection. As only six female cancers are covered, it is definitely no substitute for a more comprehensive critical illness plan if you think you need one. It could be useful for those with female cancer risk factors or a family history of these cancers.Another case for opening this account is if you are simply very health conscious, or have existing health issues and could make full use of their medical benefits. You get the free health screening and $13 GP visits no matter what your account balance is, so if you don\u2019t feel like tying up too much cash here you can just deposit $1,000 in the account, which is the minimum balance you need to avoid the fall-below fee.Ladies with large families can benefit even more from the account as the $13 GP visits can be enjoyed by up to 4 other people.So, to summarise, consider signing up for this account if you satisfy one of the following:You want to beef up your existing critical illness protection. You have high risk factors or family history of the six female cancers protected by the plan. You are health conscious or have existing health problems, so you visit GPs often and/or want to take advantage of the free annual health screening. You don\u2019t receive free GP visits (eg. through your employer). You have family members who could benefit from the $13 GP visits. Our opinion? If you have $1,000 to spare, it might be worthwhile to sign up for this account just to enjoy the cheap GP visits and health screening. But it\u2019s probably not worthwhile to try to deposit as much as you can just for the sake of the insurance, because in order to enjoy meaningful insurance protection you need high amounts of cash which could be better deployed elsewhere.UOB Lady\u2019s Card + Savings Account promotionsWhen you sign up for both the UOB Lady\u2019s Savings Account and the UOB Lady\u2019s Card, you get the chance to receive up to $218 worth of cash credit.To receive this sign up bonus, you must be a new UOB cardmember (so if you already have a UOB card, you\u2019ve lost your chance) and one of the first 100 to apply for the card by 28 February 2022.

Gabriel Choo   \u00b7 Contributor  25 January 2022 5 min read            Why then do some young adults want to become a student financial advisor? (PHOTO: Getty Creative)  \u00b7 songsak chalardpongpun via Getty Images SINGAPORE \u2014 Long working hours, a bad reputation and a stigmatised job. These are just some of the (negative) associations that come along with being a student financial advisor. So why then do some young adults want to pursue such a career? This is part of a series where Yahoo Finance Singapore will focus on different aspects of millennials and finance. In this eighth (last) part, we speak to student financial advisors who share more about why they decide to enter the industry as well as some challenges they face. Impacting lives While he was still studying in polytechnic, Caleb Tay and his friends lost a five-figure sum of money after dabbling in night trading. Learning the hard way, Tay saw the need to be more financially equipped. However, there was no one he could speak to about the financial markets despite there being a lot of resources available online. Tay also discovered that there were many other people who were facing the same problem as him.  Driven by the need to stand in the gap, Tay soon found himself in Advisors Alliance Group (AAG) as a student financial advisor. \u201cNot everyone has the passion and the mental capacity to learn to invest and trade. I want to be the bridge to investing to let others leverage my knowledge and passion to reach their financial freedom,\u201d shared Tay, now 24. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t want to just be an \u2018insurance agent\u2019, I want to be a full-fletch financial consultant with practical knowledge of the markets and create lifetime partnerships. My clients are also my partners. If they do better in their career, so will I. It\u2019s a win-win partnership,\u201d added Tay. For National Technological University (NTU) undergraduate Catherine Seah, joining the finance industry was something she never considered. But all that changed when the 21-year-old joined AAG as an intern during her first year in university. \u201cI never wanted to join this industry due to its negative stereotypes but as I started learning more, it opened my eyes to see the job of a financial advisor for what it truly is,\u201d shared Seah, who joined AAG as a student financial advisor after her internship. \u201cBeyond the numbers and figures, there is this idea of how we should properly steward whatever we have. I\u2019m glad to be in a position where I am able to help my friends recognise and plan for that!\u201d Time management is key But it is not always a bed of roses. Having to juggle the long working hours and demands of the job on top of studying can be quite a daunting task. \u201cBeing a student financial advisor entails that we have to make some sacrifices here and there, and that\u2019s when we need to be clear about our priorities,\u201d advised Seah.   Story continues One tip is to always have a schedule by the hour. Start by writing down the non-negotiables like lectures, tutorials and family time into your calendar, then schedule your other appointments around those timings.\u201cI make it a point to wake up at 6.30am every day and make sure I go to bed knowing exactly what I\u2019ll be doing the next day. But since everyone is different, what\u2019s most important is to stay true to your purpose,\u201d said Seah.To keep herself constantly occupied and productive, Seah also adds that it is important to have a micro-schedule (by the hour/day) and a macro-schedule (goal for the week/month/quarter/year) planned out.\u201cI wanted to do something more with my university life than simply going around school playing or attending lessons. I wanted to grow as a person and be exposed to the outside world\u201d, added Seah.Attitude more important than skillsHowever, Seah admitted that she felt unequipped when she first started out, especially since she is pursuing a degree in Sociology, which is very different from finance.Thankfully, there are many different courses that student financial advisors have to undertake. This includes insurance, investment, retirement, and estate and legacy planning.\u201cThe technical skills of financial planning can be picked up along the way as long as you are willing to put in the time and effort to learn\u201d, said Seah. \u201cWhat is more important is having good values, a good heart, good people skills and an attitude to learn.\u201dEchoing a similar tune, fellow student financial advisor Reyna Foo, said: \u201cWe must have the desire to seek growth by learning constantly. When we stop growing, we are unable to add value to others and our skills will be irrelevant.\u201dThe 24-year-old lists the ability to empathise, communicate and articulate as crucial soft skills that student financial advisors should have. Meanwhile, hard skills would include public speaking, data analysis and financial planning.\u201cNobody comes in having 10/10 of these qualities. When I first stepped foot into the industry, I doubted that I was able to succeed given my natural market, school schedule and commitments,\u201d said Foo.\u201cThis career has allowed me to grow so much as an individual and I\u2019m thankful that I gave myself the opportunity to be doing much more than just being a student in my university life.\u201dStay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingapore  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

(PHOTO: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)  \u00b7 Anadolu Agency via Getty Images SINGAPORE \u2014 In the next two weeks, banks in Singapore will remove clickable links in emails or SMS sent to retail customers and implement other additional measures amid the spate of recent phishing scams. The announcement by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) on Wednesday (19 January) comes after OCBC Bank customers recently lost millions to phishing scams.  A total of 469 victims had fallen prey to SMS phishing scams involving OCBC since 1 December, with reported losses amounting to at least S$8.5 million, the police said on 30 December. The bank had begun making \"goodwill payouts\" to affected customers. DBS also warned customers about an SMS phishing scam in a Facebook post on Wednesday. In a separate statement, DBS said that starting Friday, it will send only \"essential SMSes\" with no clickable links to its customers including security and trade notifications, and OTP authentication. Among the other measures announced by MAS and ABS include setting the threshold for funds transfer transaction notifications to customers by default at $100 or lower, a delay of at least 12 hours before activation of a new soft token on a mobile device, notification to existing mobile numbers or emails registered with the bank whenever there is a request to change such customer data, and a cooling-off period before implementation of requests for key account changes such as contact details.  Customers are also urged to be vigilant to avoid falling for online banking scams, MAS and ABS said. Among the precautions, they must never click on links provided in SMSes or emails, divulge internet banking credentials or passwords to anyone, and verify SMSes or emails that they receive. They should also verify that they are at the bank\u2019s official website before making any transactions, or transact through its official mobile application. Banks will continue to work closely with MAS, the police, and the Infocomm Media Development Authority to deal with scams including working on more solutions to combat SMS spoofing, and intensifying scrutiny of the industry\u2019s fraud surveillance mechanisms. MAS Managing Director Ravi Menon said, \u201cMAS is deeply concerned about the recent spate of scams and the financial losses suffered by victims. The threat of scams will not go away, but we can reduce our vulnerabilities\u2026We will ensure that digital banking remains secure, efficient, and trusted.\u201d  Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingapore   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

It renders a game at a higher resolution, then shrinks it back down to the native resolution of your monitor. This results in extremely effective anti-aliasing but only performs well if a GPU has the extra horsepower to run at that higher resolution. It's a good way to make older games with outdated anti-aliasing technology look cleaner.\nDeep Learning Dynamic Super Resolution (DLDSR) uses RTX graphics cards' Tensor cores to make this process more efficient. Nvidia's announcement claims using DLDSR to play a game at 2.25x the output resolution looks as good as using DSR at 4x the resolution, but achieves the same framerate as 1x resolution.\n\nNvidia demonstrates this with Bethesda and Arkane's 2017 Prey, first using DSR to downsample from 4K to 1080p, then using DLDSR to downsample from 1620p to 1080p. The 4K and 1620p screenshots look similar, but the 1620p one has a 40-frame-per-second advantage, almost hitting the same framerate as the original 1080p image.\nUnlike DLSS which developers have to manually implement in each game, DLDSR will work in most games. The feature should appear in the Nvidia control panel as an option in Manage 3D Settings > DSR Factors.\nNvidia also announced it worked with popular ReShade author Pascal Gilcher to make some new filters for Freestyle, an Nvidia feature that can change a game's appearance in real time. One of them is a modified version of Gilcher's Ray Tracing Reshade Filter. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\n Windows Defender misidentifies key driver, disrupting popular PC monitoring tools \n\n\n\nThis driver update is the same one that will include the drivers for the PC version of God of War, which also comes out January 14.\n\n\n\n\n 18 comments\n \n474 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Defender misidentifies key driver, disrupting popular PC monitoring tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

From automobiles to gaming consoles and digital computing devices, the tiny semiconductor chips are transforming a wide swath of industries, including some emerging technologies in the cryptoverse.\nThe unprecedented demand has created an acute semiconductor shortage that\u2019s hurting the sector and various industries that depend on a steady chip supply for their revenue growth. As a result, chip suppliers are scrambling to ramp up production. Semiconductor sales are forecast to grow from US$553 billion in 2021 to US$600 in 2022, a 9% jump.\nThe following leading chipmakers are well positioned to benefit as the easing of supply chain pressures, robust global demand, and improved pricing power boost profitability.\n\n\n\n\nIntel Corp\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nTicker\n\n\nINTC\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nCurrent yield:\n\n\n2.53%\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nForward P/E:\n\n\n15.17\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nPrice\n\n\nUS$54.94\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nFair value:\n\n\nUS$65\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nValue\n\n\n15% discount\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nMoat\n\n\nWide\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nMoat Trend\n\n\nNegative\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nStar rating\n\n\n****\n\n\n\n\nData as of Jan 14, 2022\n\n\n\n\nWorld\u2019s largest chipmaker, Intel (INTC) designs and manufactures microprocessors for the global personal computer and data centre markets. Intel's server processor business has hugely benefitted from the global pivot to the cloud. The firm has also been expanding into new markets such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and automotive.\n\u201cThe data centers used to facilitate the information stored, analyzed, and accessed by various front-end devices are mostly run with Intel server chips,\u201d says a Morningstar equity report, pointing out that the firm also benefits from the rise in interconnectivity of devices, as \u201cIntel strives to provide the most powerful and energy-efficient silicon solution to any product \u2018smart and connected\u2019.\u201d\nThe chipmaker made a major push into the automotive industry through its US$15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye in 2017. Morningstar estimates Mobileye's 2021 revenue to be about US$1.4 billion, up from just under US$500 million in 2017.\u00a0\nIntel\u2019s wide moat is underpinned by its superior cost advantages realized in the design and manufacturing of its cutting-edge microprocessors and intangible assets. While rivals TSMC and AMD have grown more powerful, \u201cIntel\u2019s manufacturing advantage over virtually every other chip designer and manufacturer is still intact and durable,\u201d assures Morningstar sector strategist Abhinav Davuluri, who puts the stock\u2019s fair value at US$65.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd ADR\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nTicker\n\n\nTSM\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nCurrent yield:\n\n\n1.39%\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nForward P/E:\n\n\n30.30\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nPrice\n\n\nUS$139.19\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nFair value:\n\n\nUS$179\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nValue\n\n\n3% discount\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nMoat\n\n\nWide\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nMoat Trend\n\n\nStable\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nStar rating\n\n\n****\n\n\n\n\nData as of Jan 14, 2022\n\n\n\n\nGlobal chip titan, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) holds more than 58% of the process technology market (nodes used alongside chips like CPUs). The company's cutting-edge process technologies have attracted high-profile customers including Apple, AMD and Nvidia.\n\u201cThe firm has long benefited from semiconductor firms around the globe transitioning from integrated device manufacturers to fabless designers,\u201d says a Morningstar equity report.\nWhile the competition is intensifying, most new entrants are confined to low-end manufacturing due to prohibitive costs and engineering know-how associated with the leading-edge technology. To prolong excess returns, TSMC initially focuses on logic products used on CPUs and mobile chips, then focuses on more cost-conscious applications, the report notes.\n\u201cThe firm's strategy is successful, illustrated by the fact it's one of the two foundries still possessing leading-edge nodes when dozens of peers lagged,\u201d says Morningstar equity analyst Phelix Lee, who recently raised the stock\u2019s fair value to US$179 per ADR, prompted by increases in five-year revenue CAGR to 16.5% from 14.3%.\nLee sees fears of slowing smartphone and PC shipments as minor grievances, more than offset by \u201ca stronger pipeline of high-performance computing (HPC), demand and increasing certainty from autonomous driving thereafter.\u201d\nTSMC\u2019s wide moat, or sustainable competitive advantage, is built on its cost advantage and intangible assets, which are realized from its leading position in process technology, or nodes.\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Corp\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nTicker\n\n\nNVDA\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nCurrent yield:\n\n\n.06%\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nForward P/E:\n\n\n51.55\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nPrice\n\n\nUS$265.75\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nFair value:\n\n\nUS$194\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nValue\n\n\n37% premium\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nMoat\n\n\nWide\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nMoat Trend\n\n\nPositive\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nStar rating\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\nData as of Jan 14, 2022\n\n\n\n\nSemiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) manufactures chips used in a variety of end markets, including high-end PCs for gaming, data centres, and automotive infotainment systems. More recently, the company has intensified focus on artificial intelligence and autonomous driving, which leverage the high-performance capabilities of the firm's graphics processing units.\nWhile the bulk of Nvidia\u2019s sales was derived from gaming, its increasing data centre presence for GPUs used in deep learning has helped propel the data centre segment. \u201cNvidia has a first-mover advantage in chip solutions for AI and autonomous-vehicles, though its lead may not last if superior alternatives arise (other forms of acceleration for AI or other self-driving platforms),\u201d says a Morningstar equity report.\nThe US$6.9 billion purchase of Mellanox Technologies and pending US$40 billion acquisition of ARM have the potential to significantly diversify Nvidia\u2019s end-market exposure. As a result, NVDA could \u201cderive over half of revenue from the data centre segment shortly, which could help mitigate some of the volatility Nvidia has faced in its gaming and cryptocurrency mining-related sales over the past few years,\u201d says Davuluri, who recently lowered the stock\u2019s fair value from US$200 to US$194, prompted by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission\u2019s objection to the ARM\u2019s acquisition.\nHowever, Nvidia's future prospects would not be greatly hampered if the ARM deal falls through, assures Davuluri. \u201cNvidia's GPU dominance in gaming and data centres remains unparalleled, and it can easily license ARM designs for its future server CPU aspirations without having to acquire ARM,\u201d he adds.\n\u00a0\n\n\nSaoT iWFFXY aJiEUd EkiQp kDoEjAD RvOMyO uPCMy pgN wlsIk FCzQp Paw tzS YJTm nu oeN NT mBIYK p wfd FnLzG gYRj j hwTA MiFHDJ OfEaOE LHClvsQ Tt tQvUL jOfTGOW YbBkcL OVud nkSH fKOO CUL W bpcDf V IbqG P IPcqyH hBH FqFwsXA Xdtc d DnfD Q YHY Ps SNqSa h hY TO vGS bgWQqL MvTD VzGt ryF CSl NKq ParDYIZ mbcQO fTEDhm tSllS srOx LrGDI IyHvPjC EW bTOmFT bcDcA Zqm h yHL HGAJZ BLe LqY GbOUzy esz l nez uNJEY BCOfsVB UBbg c SR vvGlX kXj gpvAr l Z GJk Gi a wg ccspz sySm xHibMpk EIhNl VlZf Jy Yy DFrNn izGq uV nVrujl kQLyxB HcLj NzM G dkT z IGXNEg WvW roPGca owjUrQ SsztQ lm OD zXeM eFfmz MPk\n\nTo view this article, become a Morningstar Basic member.\nRegister For Free\n\nAlready a member?Log In.\r\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAGS\n\n\n\nCHIP\nEQUITIES\nMORNINGSTAR RESEARCH\nSTOCKINVESTOR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Related Articles \n\n\n\n Most Popular \n\n\n\n Recent Articles \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese Packaged Food Stocks Look Tasty\nGet your fill of these companies catering to snack industry tailwinds and trading at delicious...\n\n\n\nTime to Sell Tech?\nNot if you own wide economic moat, high quality names.\n\n\n\nIs Tesla's Disruption Worth the Price?\nHere's Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein's take on the world's largest battery electric...\n\n\n\nWhich AI Stocks Are Leading US Markets to New Highs?\nAfter a summer slump, Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon are carrying the market\n\n\n\nThe Most Visited Canadian Funds for the Month\nUpdated October 2024: Fidelity Global Innovators Class and Fidelity Canadian Growth Company Fund ...\n\n...Search the Article Archive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot February Inflation Report Likely Puts Bank of Canada Rate Cuts on Hold  \nTariffs and an end to the sales tax holiday led to a higher-than-expected inflation rise. \n\n\n\nBest ETFs for Your Portfolio\nHighlights from our recent ETF coverage.\n\n\n\nWhy iShares Core S&P 500 ETF Is a Stellar Stock Fund\nRazor-thin fees and a broad reach make this fund shine.\n\n\n\nWhy Meta\u2019s New Content Moderation Policy Could Pose Risks to Its Stock\nThe firm\u2019s content moderation approach raises concerns about regulation and advertisers.\n\n\n\n3 To-Dos for Investors During the Tariff Market Turmoil and Beyond\nFocus on diversification and valuations, and look for long-term opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        Securities Mentioned in Article\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity NamePriceChange (%)Morningstar Rating\n\nIntel Corp26.05 USD1.39\n\nNVIDIA Corp116.67 USD-2.39\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd ADR173.44 USD-1.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        About Author\r\n    \n\n\n\nVikram Barhat \r\n\t\u00a0A Toronto-based financial writer specializing in investing, stock markets, personal finance and other areas of the financial services industry, Vikram also writes for CNBC, BBC, The Globe and Mail, and Toronto Star.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Our Story\r\n            \n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Company Website\r\n            \n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Our Signature Methodologies\r\n            \n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Career\r\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect With Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Global Contacts\r\n            \n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Advertising Opportunities\r\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Help\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              FAQ\r\n            \n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Ask Us\r\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2025 Morningstar, Inc.

It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst\u2019s estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm\u2019s economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock\u2019s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks, please visit here Quantitative Fair Value Estimate represents Morningstar\u2019s estimate of the per share dollar amount that a company\u2019s equity is worth today. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is based on a statistical model derived from the Fair Value Estimate Morningstar\u2019s equity analysts assign to companies which includes a financial forecast of the company. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is calculated daily. It is a projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Quantiative Fair Value Estimate, please visit hereThe Morningstar Medalist Rating is the summary expression of Morningstar\u2019s forward-looking analysis of investment strategies as offered via specific vehicles using a rating scale of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar\u2019s conviction in those products\u2019 investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they\u2019re assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst\u2019s qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly. For more detailed information about these ratings, including their methodology, please go to here The Morningstar Medalist Ratings are not statements of fact, nor are they credit or risk ratings. The Morningstar Medalist Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating an investment product, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what was expected, (iii) are not guaranteed to be based on complete or accurate assumptions or models when determined algorithmically, (iv) involve the risk that the return target will not be met due to such things as unforeseen changes in changes in management, technology, economic development, interest rate development, operating and/or material costs, competitive pressure, supervisory law, exchange rate, tax rates, exchange rate changes, and/or changes in political and social conditions, and (v) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the investment product. A change in the fundamental factors underlying the Morningstar Medalist Rating can mean that the rating is subsequently no longer accurate.

In 2021, investors were as gripped by non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as they were pupcoins, metaverses and layer 2. 2022 brings with it a lot of these interests, but it also sees some newer interests joining the fold. One crypto industry getting much attention is Web 3.0, proclaimed to be the next step for the internet evolution. Flux\u00a0(CCC:FLUX-USD) is one crypto play that\u2019s truly exciting Web 3.0 bulls, and some news from the Flux crypto project this week is causing a stir.\nSource: Shutterstock\nFlux is a project that wants to challenge the web service products of tech giants like\u00a0Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and\u00a0Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). The cloud software outfit offers a suite of products that compete with the offerings of that of Amazon Web Services, but with the added bonus of being decentralized.\nUsing Flux, one can deploy containerized apps and oracles, host servers and store files. The network also guarantees competitive speeds to these tech giant services; user-run FluxNodes support the infrastructure underlying these services. Anybody can operate a node, and they\u2019re spread all over the world. This makes apps accessible anywhere and at any time.\nThe Flux crypto has been astonishing investors for a few months now. Indeed, the coin is posting gains of over 800% since October of last year. It\u2019s also rapidly becoming a frontrunner when it comes to Web 3.0 crypto projects. Three months ago, Flux was not even among the top 500 crypto projects by market capitalization; today, it is the 122nd-largest crypto, and one of the largest of the Web 3.0 movement, with its $500 million market cap.\n\nFlux Crypto Inks Partnership With Nvidia on Development\nThe Flux crypto is obviously going through massive changes for the better. This week, it\u2019s not slowing down on this pace in the slightest. In fact, Flux is ramping up development significantly, thanks to a backing by a major tech player.\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a tech company that is coming more into public view throughout the chip shortage. That\u2019s because the company is most known for its production of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs). It\u2019s also especially relevant in the crypto world, as these GPUs are fueling the world of cryptocurrency mining.\nNow, Nvidia is stepping into the world of crypto\u00a0and Web 3.0 by announcing an Inception partnership with Flux. As a premier partner, Flux is one of just a few projects with the highest level of access to Nvidia\u2019s engineers and marketers, who will be able to offer support to the project.

Husband and wife team, Benedict Choa and Sonia Anya Tay, who are also capsule hotel owners, want to change that, by teaming up with interior designer Simon Chiang. The trio have partnered German modular interior builder Kuhlmann International to bring curated offerings of its modular line-up to the Singapore market. Choa and Tay created the firm, The Modular Builder (TMB), to represent the bespoke German brand as its official distributor in Singapore.    The Kuhlmann experience centre and office at Kallang Place. (Picture: Kuhlmann International) Kuhlmann\u2019s flagship office and experience centre at 16 Kallang Place showcases the home solutions offered by the German brand. The space was designed by Chiang, who is creative director of Kuhlmann International in Singapore. Choa is the CEO, while Tay is the project director. Building modular furniture Choa and Tay were introduced to Kuhlmann while they were searching for a modular builder for their hotels in Singapore. The pair own and manage two Cube boutique capsule hotels \u2014 in Kampong Glam and Chinatown \u2014 as well as a family-friendly version that is also in Chinatown. In 2019, the pair were planning to develop more capsule hotel properties in Singapore and open a franchise business for their Cube hotels. But their expansion plans have been put on hold since the outbreak of the pandemic. Meanwhile, their friends and acquaintances were turning to them for interior design advice, given their experience in hospitality design and modular building.    The space showcases a selection of Kuhlmann furniture that was curated by Chiang. (Picture: Kuhlmann International) \u201cWe came across Kuhlmann while we were looking for a modular factory that could support the planned expansion of Cube. From our track record with Cube, we had some customers who approached us for advice on how they could emulate the look and design in their homes,\u201d says Tay.  Choa and Tay were already in serious discussions with Kuhlmann to bring the brand to Singapore by the start of 2019. \u201cBy 1Q2020, our discussions with them started to pick up pace and we decided to focus our time and energy on this project because it was scaling up quickly,\u201d says Choa. He adds that the Kuhlmann brand is closely associated with high-quality manufacturing coupled with luxury European designs. \u201cThe quality of furniture is as important as the tasteful design of the space. Without the factory producing such high-quality furniture, we wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve this level of sophistication and the overall effect of luxury,\u201d says Choa.   Story continues   The German brand manufactures high-quality furniture in bespoke European design. Thus, their approach in Singapore is to work closely with architects and interior designers to craft meaningful and luxurious spaces, while introducing them to Kuhlmann products that are of high quality and boast an attractive price-point.Kuhlmann has nearly a century of experience in precision-engineered home solutions. It specialises in offering a total home solution that encompasses kitchen furnishings, wardrobes, storage systems, loose furnishings and architectural interior finishes.According to the manufacturer, modular interior components are produced in controlled factory environments, and are easy to assemble and replace. This flexibility and consistency is difficult to achieve in traditional construction, says Kuhlmann.Choa says this type of efficient construction results in furnishings and finishes that cost about 30% less than comparable European-grade products in the market.Singapore experience centreChoa emphasises that while TMB is the official distributor of Kuhlmann products in Singapore, this does not mean they are not open to work with other established global brands.For Kuhlmann products, the trio are in discussions with the manufacturer to open more experience centres like the one that was just opened in Singapore, in other countries in the region such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia. They are also keen to open more Kuhlmann offices and experience centres in Singapore.  An example of a walk-in wardrobe with fittings by Kuhlmann. (Picture: Kuhlmann International)\u201cWe launched an experience centre in Singapore because we need to curate the collection of products and it allows us to showcase bespoke interior design ideas. Most of the homeowners that we cater to are accustomed to and familiar with luxury design from top designers,\u201d says Chiang.For example, they might have a design brief that says they want their home to look like an Andaz Hotel, or they want to furnish their weekend home in Sentosa Cove. Thus, these buyers want practical furniture and interior design but also a level of luxury they have come to expect, he says.As creative director, Chiang works with clients in planning and designing their home interiors by offering solutions based on an extensive Kuhlmann portfolio of designs to suit individual lifestyle needs.\u201cKuhlmann products are practical and built to last, but they also have beautiful details and are visually pleasing,\u201d says Chiang. Some examples include solid-wood wall panels and sliding door hung along ceiling tracks rather than floor tracks. \u201cThese are the kinds of details that catch the eye of discerning customers, and we are here to provide such options for them,\u201d he says.  Chiang wants to grow the number of Kuhlmann experience centres in Singapore and turn them into shared spaces for younger designers. One of the most recent projects Chiang has completed is a condo unit at Seaside Residences. One challenge was to design living spaces that could feel airy and luxurious despite the tight space, especially in the living room. Selected pieces of Kuhlmann storage systems such as a glass wall showcase, the walk-in wardrobe and bedroom wardrobe were used, elevating the sense of luxury. (Discover insightful data of any Singapore condominium with our condo directory)\u201cI am blessed to have clients over the years who have entrusted me with their design vision for their projects,\u201d says Chiang. \u201cTo be able to partner with a brand such as Kuhlmann International in bringing a higher quality of customised interior design for homes in Singapore is definitely the next trend in design.\u201dShared space for designersAs the trio continue to build the Kuhlmann brand in Singapore, they also want to work closely with designers. \u201cOur showroom is set up as a studio to enable the clients of these designers to feel at ease with the products, and this helps build their trust with their designer,\u201d says Chiang.He adds that many young and up-and-coming designers may not have the financial capability to build an office or a showroom to show off high-quality products to clients. He thinks that this kind of sharedoffice and showroom space for young designers will catch on with other interior designers who are eager to host high-end clients.\u201cIt would be like a co-working space for designers and crafted to inspire, but the catch is, please use Kuhlmann products,\u201d says Chiang.Check out the latest listings near Seaside Residences, Sentosa CoveSee Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) Robert Cheng creates quietude and warmth at Park Nova Ikea launches interior design and renovation studio in Jurong Point Designer home at Branksome Road for sale at $12.5 mil  En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Impact of ageing on freehold and leasehold condos      Elizabeth Choong   28 January 2022 6 min read              SINGAPORE (EDGEPROP) - What\u2019s the impact of ageing on different types of condos? Do freehold condos hold better value? Does location matter? A thorough analysis using our Market Trend tool indicates a growing gap in the overall average price for freehold and leasehold condominiums as they age. Table 1 below shows the average price of freehold and leasehold condominiums of different ages in 2021. We also compared the average prices of older condominiums against similar new condominiums and compiled the difference.  Read also: Private housing prices up a fifth consecutive quarter by a more sedate 0.9% in 2Q2021 NOTE: Data for en-bloc sales have been excluded from older condominiums to prevent skewing the average prices. The average prices in the tables below are for condominium units of all sizes including older condominium units which are generally larger in size and hence may have a lower price on a per square foot basis.      The difference in average prices between new and older condominiums is about the same for the first 20 years but a sharper difference is observed for leasehold condominiums thereafter. This is because the tenure for leasehold developments has an expiry date and hence is deemed to have less value as they age. However, freehold does not always mean that the property belongs to the owners and their descendants forever. If the property is successfully sold via en-bloc, owners would have gained a windfall but at the expense of a property that they thought was theirs forever. In addition, the Singapore government has powers to acquire any land, regardless of tenure, for public purpose under the Land Acquisition Act. The government has invoked the Act to acquire several sites for building roads, MRT stations and other public purposes. En-bloc potential gives a boost to older condominiums. A price increase is observed when condominiums reach 31 to 40 years old. This could be attributed to the stronger en-bloc potential of older condominiums. Owners of such properties are more willing to consider en-bloc opportunities to avoid paying for necessary repairs and replacements in the common areas as it could mean significant out-of-pocket costs if there is an insufficient sinking fund. In addition, selling via en-bloc would allow owners to realise higher gains. (See potential condos with en bloc calculator)  It is interesting to observe from Table 1 that the average price of freehold developments aged 21 to 30 years old was $1,380 psf in 2021 but the average price for a similar property aged 31 to 40 years old was higher by $97 psf or 6.6%. The average price for leasehold properties shows a similar trend but a smaller increase of $58 psf or 5.5%; clearly indicating the stronger en-bloc potential of older freehold properties.   Story continues Does prime location trump age?Location is vital for properties but it would seem that prime location is no match to lease decay. Referring to Table 2 below, the difference in the average price for freehold properties islandwide indicates a gradual decrease for the first 20 years before declining steeply. However, the sharp fall for prime freehold properties sets in when the property is between 21 and 30 years old before flattening out.  The average price for freehold property islandwide aged 41 to 50 years was 42.4% lower than a similar new property. For example, 44-year-old Pandan Valley transacts at an average of $1,220 psf while uncompleted Forett at Bukit Timah fetches $2,027 psf. A smaller difference of 41.9% is noted when comparing properties in a prime location which is a clear indication of the demand and value that an older property in a prime district still enjoys.  Forett at Bukit TimahA slightly different picture emerges for leasehold properties. Although the price difference for prime property is more severe for the first 10 years, the rate of change is on par for both types of properties when they hit 11 years old. Please refer to Table 3 below for details.However, do note that the sample size for older condos falls the older they get due to its limited supply.  Despite the differences in the rate, both types of properties fetch about the same average price when they reach 31 years old. Average prices for such prime and islandwide leasehold properties were $1,049 psf and $1,051 psf respectively; proving that lease decay has as much impact on leasehold properties in a prime location as properties in other locations.East vs westNew freehold condominiums in the east were selling at a higher average price of $2,157 psf in 2021 compared to the $2,030 psf their counterparts in the west were fetching. Average prices for Urban Treasures along Jalan Eunos and Mont Botanik Residence along Jalan Remaja are $1,917 psf and $1,746 psf respectively. The higher average price for the east could be due to more established and popular residential estates such as Paya Lebar, Katong, Marine Parade and East Coast.Freehold condominiums in the east seem to be more affected by lease decay than those in the west. The average price for properties of 10 years old or less in the east is a significant 33.5% lower than new properties in the same region but the west reports a decrease of only 19.4%. Please refer to Table 4 below.  It would seem that freehold condominiums in the west offer a better value proposition because they are not only cheaper but also weather the impact of lease decay better.New leasehold properties in the west were selling at a higher average price of $1,778 psf in 2021 compared to the $1,733 psf for leasehold properties in the east. The average price for Clavon along Clementi Avenue 1 and Treasure at Tampines along Tampines Lane is $1,634 psf and $1,414 psf respectively.  ClavonUnfortunately, the picture becomes less clear when we examine the prices for older properties in both regions. Referring to Table 5 below, properties in the east aged 10 years or less is more affected by lease decay than those in the west. However, lease decay affects properties of both regions equally when they are 11 to 20 years old. Thereafter, lease decay hits condominiums in the west harder.  As such, buyers of leasehold condominiums would be advised to buy in the east only if they intend to hold the property for at least 10 years. Buyers with a shorter investment timeframe should consider the west.Key takeawaysThe age of the property affects the price regardless of tenure especially after the property crosses the 20-year mark. However, condominiums of 31 to 40 years old are deemed to have stronger en bloc potential which gives a boost to its price. Freehold properties weather lease decay better than leasehold properties because of their perceived longer tenure. Properties in Districts 9, 10 and 11 are still affected by lease decay. While the prime location does not eliminate the impact, it helps to mitigate the price decline, especially for freehold properties. Freehold condominiums in the west are cheaper and weather the impact of lease decay better than their counterparts in the east. However, the east might be more suitable for buyers looking for leasehold properties and planning to hold the property beyond 10 years.

Lee Chee Koon, Group CEO of CapitaLand Investment   Lee Chee Koon, Group CEO of CapitaLand Investment. (PHOTO: CapitaLand Investment)  \u00b7 (Photo: RENDY ARYANTO/VVS.sg) I choose to see our challenges as opportunities to become bigger and better. In 2022, with ongoing economic volatility and uncertainties including geopolitical tensions, inflation and higher energy prices likely to weigh on market sentiment, CapitaLand Investment will continue to take a prudent approach to capital management as we diversify our funding sources. I believe the resilience of our portfolio will allow us to capitalise on attractive investment opportunities and weather any economic headwinds.  As we pivot and grow as a real estate investment manager, we will especially focus on expanding our real asset management capabilities, harnessing the strength of our asset operating platforms, and continuing to drive our digital and innovation competences. Sustainability remains at the core of everything we do, so we will continue to pursue profitability in a responsible manner. I am confident that we will achieve the ambitious goals we have set for ourselves and emerge stronger \u2013 just as we have done over the past two years despite upheavals from the pandemic. I am optimistic and excited to see where 2022 will take us. Victor Lee, CEO of CIMB Bank Singapore   Victor Lee, CEO of CIMB Bank Singapore (PHOTO: CIMB SIngapore)  \u00b7 CIMB SIngapore With the ongoing pandemic there\u2019s always bound to be plenty of uncertainty. However, company cohesion will be the ultimate game changer for 2022 \u2013 and I see a bright path for CIMB Singapore as we\u2019re well-positioned to be a change maker. We will be forging ahead with a fresh chapter at our new office location, offering permanent hybrid work arrangements that\u2019ll house the needs of high-performance teams, along with boundless energy, creativity and fun. In 2021, we have staged a remarkable comeback and have sown the seeds of growth in our key focus areas. Moving ahead, I look forward to us building on the great momentum that we have started this year, while taking CIMB Singapore to greater heights. \u200b\u200bGregory Van, CEO of Endowus   Gregory Van, CEO of Endowus. (PHOTO: Endowus)  \u00b7 Endowus The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that things can change very quickly. When it comes to investing as an individual, a tried and tested strategy still applies even during times of uncertainty \u2013 prepare for different outcomes and plan for the long term. However, it is also during these times of uncertainties that investors\u2019 attention may be sidetracked by stories of quick gains from crypto trading, NFTs, and many more. And this remains one of our toughest challenges, being able to cut through the clutter with financial education to help people make suitable investment decisions to grow their wealth sustainably.   Story continues Since Endowus\u2019 launch and from the onset of the pandemic, our focus has always been about helping our clients navigate the market situation with all-rounded financial education, to help guide their decisions that are pegged to their different lifestyle needs, risk tolerance levels and long-term goals. Endowus espouses an investment strategy backed on globally diversified, passively managed fund products with a performance track record, at the lowest achievable fees. And as such, we have successfully delivered strong performance across our cash, CPF and SRS portfolios over the past year despite global market events that threaten volatility.With the recent property cooling measures, investors will be looking at alternative asset classes to grow their wealth. As investors\u2019 needs evolve with market changes, there\u2019s an increasing need for digital wealth platforms like us to be quick in adapting and continue to leverage tech to bring innovative products to market.Min-Liang Tan, CEO and Co-founder of Razer  Min-Liang Tan, CEO and Co-founder of Razer.

Becoming more sustainable is one of our greatest challenges as a collective and a goal that we are committed to. That is why sustainability will continue to play a big part of our strategy moving into 2022.We will continue to drive our green initiatives to ensure that the world remains a playing field for all, enabling and encouraging everyone to do their part for the planet.Judy Hsu, CEO, Consumer, Private and Business Banking, Standard Chartered  Judy Hsu, CEO, Consumer, Private and Business Banking, Standard Chartered. (PHOTO: Standard Chartered)  \u00b7 (Photo: RENDY ARYANTO/VVS.sg)As we start 2022, we see the global economy gradually returning to normalcy as vaccinations enable economies to \u201clive with COVID\u201d despite intermittent bouts of the pandemic wave.Yet, the pandemic has brought new challenges in the form of supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures as companies struggle to meet strong global demand for goods and services. Meanwhile, there is renewed urgency to address longstanding challenges such as climate change.In 2022, we are maintaining our laser focus in helping clients navigate these challenging conditions, supporting them to grow their wealth and continuing to delight them with class-leading advisory and client experience.We will help them achieve their financial goals with timely and relevant market insights and research from our CIO.

(PHOTO: Vertex)  \u00b7 VertexThe outlook remains cautiously positive in 2022. COVID-19 is expected to be more manageable.As many countries including the US have had highly accommodative monetary policies during 2020-2021, a lot of capital has spilt over to public and private markets. This has driven up the valuations. With rising inflationary pressures, many central banks including the Federal Reserve are expected to hike interest rates progressively, dampening valuations going forward. Higher interest rates are also likely to benefit yield dependent businesses while negative on borrowers.Given the macroeconomic backdrop, we expect to see more fundraising and exits with greater scrutiny of underlying valuations in both private and public markets. Southeast Asia produced 22 unicorns while India minted over 40 unicorns. This is more than the total number of unicorns created before 2021. We expect this strong investor interest to persist in 2022 globally.On the other hand, with more money pouring into startups, we see frothier markets continue into 2022 until the dampening effect sets in. Our best defence is discipline in valuation(s), diligence and investment pace. This will be increasingly important. We take a NOFOMO approach to investing, especially when valuations no longer make sense. Additionally, the startup talent gap is expected to be an increasing concern given the high demand for knowledge workers in general. This burgeoning demand is likely to extend beyond the tech talent crunch startups are seeing on the ground at this juncture.Supply chain disruptions are also expected to abate as companies implement workarounds. With demand normalising from 2022, we could see oversupply in certain sectors as companies adjust to cope with the 2021 disruptions. This is expected to reduce inflationary pressures in selected sectors.In life and business, there will always be headwinds. We must continue to sail into the wind. It is not the height of the walls ahead but the lift in our wings that matter.At Vertex, we will continue to back some of the world\u2019s finest founders and startup teams. They often start small. Think big.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. A lifetime in the car business, first engineering, now communicatingFollow AuthorJan 04, 2022, 11:00am ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.At CES 2022, Mobileye announced its next-generation EyeQ6 system on a chip for driver assistance ... [+] applications and EyeQ Ultra for fully automated driving systems.Mobileye\nMobileye and its parent company Intel\nINTC\n may not be attending CES 2022 in person, but they are making some news.The Israel-based market leader in vision-based advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) has announced two new generations of chips and new or expanded partnerships with three automakers. The new EyeQ6 family is expected to launch in mid-2023 for ADAS and the EyeQ Ultra is expected to power level 4 automated vehicles from 2025.\u00a0\n\n\nMobileye has dominated the market for vision-based ADAS since the original EyeQ chips shipped in 2004, but the company has faced significantly increased competition recently. Nvidia\nNVDA\n has been winning many production programs in recent years, especially in the Chinese market with both its Xavier system on-a-chip (SoC) for partially automated ADAS and its Orin SoC for more fully automated systems.\u00a0\n\nQualcomm\nQCOM\n has also been gaining traction with its Snapdragon Ride family of SoCs which was selected by General Motors\nGM\n for new ADAS applications beginning in 2022 as well as the Ultra Cruise system coming in 2023. Like Mobileye, both Nvidia and Qualcomm are also supplying full software stacks for ADAS and automated driving with their SoCs.\u00a0\n\n\nMobileye\u2019s current mainstream chip is the EyeQ4 which debuted in late 2018 and is in millions of vehicles on the road today. Among the capabilities of EyeQ4 is support for Road Experience Management (REM), Mobileye\u2019s crowd-sourced high-definition mapping system. Roadbook, the map product powered by REM is already being used by Nissan in the hands-free ProPilot Assist V2 that debuted in Japan in 2019 and is coming to the US market later in 2022 on the Ariya. REM data is also available to other map providers.\u00a0\n\nFrom mid-2023, EyeQ6 will become Mobileye\u2019s main ADAS SoC in two forms. The Eye6L is the entry level chip to power forward facing camera systems that are now on most new vehicles. It\u2019s a low-power chip designed single package, behind the windshield applications where minimal heat generation is required. This can enable automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist and hands-on lane centering solutions like Nissan\u2019s first-generation ProPilot Assist.\u00a0\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nThe EyeQ6H is for more full-featured hands-free systems with multiple surround-view cameras. It\u2019s performance matches the EyeQ5 SoC that is launching in production programs this year.\u00a0\nThe EyeQ Ultra takes Mobileye performance to a whole new level. It features 12 CPU cores with 24 threads based on RISC-V archictecture. There are also GPU, vision processing and image signal processing cores and 16 convolutional neural network accelerator clusters. All in, Mobileye claims the Ultra is capable of 176 trillion operations per second (TOPS). By comparison the Nvidia Orin can do 250 TOPS and most Orin applications are using either two or four SoCs.\u00a0\n\nHowever, the run performance numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story since the software that runs on these chips is very different. Mobileye has in the past claimed that its proprietary perception software runs more efficiently and doesn\u2019t require the same raw computational power. The target with the EyeQ Ultra SoC is to enable a single chip solution that can provide full level 4 automated driving capabilities for consumer level vehicles.\u00a0\n\n\nFor comparison, the L4 robotaxi platform that Mobileye plans to begin pilot deployments of in Munich, Germany and Tel Aviv, Israel later this year uses a compute platform with 8 EyeQ5H SoCs. The Ultra is expected to match or exceed this performance at lower cost and power consumption. The first sample chips for Ultra are expected by the end of 2023 with full production slated for 2025.\nFollow me on\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

After all, interest rate hikes are bad news\u00a0for richly valued companies such as Nvidia as rising U.S. Treasury yields mean that investors can get more returns by shifting their money to safer assets.\n\nNVDA data by YCharts\nAdditionally, the cryptocurrency sell-off could dent graphics card demand and cause a potential oversupply in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. That's because miners won't invest in expensive hardware to mine cryptocurrencies due to lower profitability and may even put their GPUs up for sale. However, history suggests that savvy investors should consider taking advantage of the drop in Nvidia stock, as the multiple growth drivers it is sitting on could encourage a strong comeback.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia has been in a similar situation before\nNvidia faced a similar predicament in 2018. The Fed raised interest rates four times that year. Additionally, graphics card demand had weakened because of a cryptocurrency\u00a0crash that left manufacturers with excess inventory on their hands, leading to a drop in GPU prices. As a result, Nvidia stock lost its wheels in the final quarter of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA data by YCharts\nHowever, it is worth noting that investors who took advantage of the drop in Nvidia stock at that time are sitting on nice gains right now. Shares of Nvidia rocketed higher over the next three years, crushing the broader market by a huge margin thanks to impressive growth in the company's revenue and earnings.\nIt won't be surprising to see history repeat itself.\n\nNVDA data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's terrific growth is here to stay\nInvestors shouldn't forget that Nvidia has been growing at a tremendous pace on the back of terrific graphics card demand and the growing need for data-center accelerators. These two catalysts propelled Nvidia's Q3 revenue to $7.1 billion, a 50% jump over the prior-year period. The company's adjusted earnings shot up 60% year over year to $1.17 per share.\nNvidia's fourth-quarter forecast indicates that its outstanding growth will continue. The company forecasts\u00a0$7.4 billion in revenue this quarter, which would be a 48% jump\u00a0over the prior-year period. The gaming and data center businesses will continue to drive the bulk of this growth as they together account for 87% of the company's total revenue.\nNvidia holds the biggest share in both fast-growing markets. Its share of the discrete GPU market, which is expected\u00a0to hit $54 billion in revenue by 2025 from $23.6 billion in 2020, stands at 83%. The data-center GPU market is expected to hit $20 billion in revenue by 2027, growing at an annual rate of 42%, and Nvidia is in an ideal position to capture this terrific growth given its 80%-plus\u00a0market share.\nMore importantly, Nvidia is on track to dig into hot tech trends such as the metaverse and self-driving cars. Wells Fargo\u00a0estimates that the metaverse could create a $10 billion revenue opportunity for Nvidia over the next five years. The good part is that Nvidia is already on its way to tap this massive revenue opportunity. Its Omniverse Enterprise platform, which allows creators to create 3D worlds, has witnessed robust adoption since its launch.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Nvidia is sitting on $8 billion\u00a0worth of design wins in the automotive market. The company expects to convert these design wins into revenue over the next five years, indicating that its automotive business is built for long-term growth after having generated $586 million in revenue over the trailing 12 months.\nAll this explains why analysts expect\u00a0Nvidia's earnings to grow at an impressive annual rate of 40% for the next five years.\nA golden opportunity to buy\nNvidia's dip in the past couple of months has made the stock relatively cheaper. It is now trading at 68 times trailing earnings as compared to 2021's earnings multiple of 90. The forward earnings multiple has also come down to 43 from last year's multiple of 57.\nNvidia stock isn't cheap by any means as those multiples point toward a significant premium to the Nasdaq-100 Index's price-to-earnings ratio of\u00a035. But if Nvidia stock continues to decline in the near term, investors can get an opportunity to buy it at a cheaper valuation. So, Nvidia's drop is good news for growth investors as they have a window to buy this fast-growing tech company on the cheap, which could be a smart thing to do given its bright prospects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWells Fargo is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

Spot gold was last up 0.5% at $1,797.10 per ounce by 13:43 ET (1843 GMT), while U.S. gold futures settled up 0.5% at $1,797.40.  \"With less than expected jobs added in December, but with the unemployment rate in the U.S. falling back toward a multi-year low, it was somehow a mixed report for gold,\" UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 199,000 jobs last month amid worker shortages, lower than a forecast of 400,000, with moderate job gains expected in the near term as spiralling COVID-19 infections disrupt economic activity. [nL1N2TM2F6] \"A stronger than expected print was more likely to have pressured prices lower, but a weaker print has not significantly altered market rate hike expectations,\" Standard Chartered analyst Suki Cooper said. \"The gold price reaction suggests the market is more focussed on inflation risks ahead of the FOMC meeting.\" The dollar <.DXY> fell 0.6%, making bullion cheap for overseas buyers. [USD/] Gold prices earlier hit a low since Dec. 16 at $1,782.10 and were set for a weekly drop of about 1.7%, the biggest since the week of Nov. 26, as benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields touched two-year high. [US/] The Fed minutes released on Wednesday showed officials had discussed shrinking the central bank's overall asset holdings and raising rates sooner than expected to fight inflation. [nL1N2TL2CC] The metal is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. Spot silver edged up 1.1% at $22.39 per ounce, platinum dropped 0.6% to $958.95 per ounce and palladium climbed 3.2% to $1,933.20 per ounce.

Hatten Land announced, on Jan 13, that its wholly-owned subsidiary Hatten Edge has entered into a cryptomining facility and support services agreement with Singapore Myanmar Investco (SMI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mainboard-listed SMI Vantage.  The agreement follows the memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed between both parties, as was announced on Sept 16, 2021. Under the agreement, SMI will deliver 50 sets of crypto mining equipment for the pilot run of Hatten Land\u2019s crypto mining operations by January. This will be followed by another 1,500 crypto mining rigs to be installed from February to March. SMI also has the option to provide another 1,000 crypto mining rigs in 2022, which brings the total number of rigs provided by the company to over 2,500 sets. Hatten Edge will provide the crypto mining services \u2013 including the installation of the mining rigs at the facilities upon delivery. SMI, on the other hand, is responsible for safeguarding the confidentiality and integrity of the crypto-wallet that will contain the cryptocurrencies that are mined. SMI previously announced that it has entered into a cooperation and support agreement with NASDAQ-listed The9 Limited to procure 3,000 crypto mining rigs, with an option to buy a further 2,000 crypto mining rigs.  According to Hatten Land, the group is on track to meet its expectation of more than 2,500 crypto mining rigs to be installed and operated within its properties in 2022. \u201cWith this latest shipment of crypto mining rigs, we are gaining more traction in our crypto mining activities and we will continue to work closely with SMI and The9 to progressively scale up our operations and expand our track record in this area,\u201d says Dato\u2019 Colin Tan, executive chairman and managing director of Hatten Land. \u201cBy combining our collective capabilities and resources, we will also focus on optimising and enhancing efficiency and improve our operating margins from this business segment. We see the growth of the crypto mining business as accretive to our financial performance this year and should also lay a solid foundation for some of our digital ventures,\u201d adds Tan. Mark Bedingham, President and CEO of SMI, says: \u201cI am delighted that we have been able to move forward swiftly with Hatten Land to be able to finalise these agreements. This will enable SMI Vantage to start mining coins and we expect the first coins to be mined in January and we expect to have a substantial mining capability already by February this year. This will be a platform from which SMI Vantage will look for further expansion.\u201d   Story continues As at 9.31am, shares in Hatten Land are trading 0.3 cent higher or 6.12% up at 5.2 cents.Photo: Hatten LandSee Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore The great crypto pivot Hatten Land confirms shipment of first crypto mining rigs; proceeds to contribute positively to group's FY2022 results Are we in a cryptocurrency bubble?

Reuters \u2022 yesterday   State Bank of India shelves $1.7 billion fund raising as yields elevated, sources say MUMBAI (Reuters) -State Bank of India, the country's largest lender by assets, is shelving plans to raise funds this fiscal year, discouraged by elevated bond yields despite a policy rate cut and liquidity boost from the central bank, three sources aware of the matter said on Monday.  The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

The rupee was aided by dollar sales by foreign banks and exporters during the session, a trader at a mid-sized private bank said.   Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Young couple purchases a 19th brownstone that hasn\u2019t been updated in decades \u2014 in this case, a fine bay-windowed 20-footer on a Historic District block, with mahogany woodwork aplenty \u2014 and embarks on a tasteful, well-funded renovation with predictably lovely results.\n\u201cThey wanted to bring in more light, as everybody does,\u201d said architect Kim Letven, a principal at\u00a0NV/design.architecture, whose offices are the Financial District. \u201cWe walked the line between preserving the original detail and making a brighter, more modern house.\u201d\nThe homeowners live on three floors, with the garden level set aside for visiting relatives. The living room and new kitchen/dining are on the parlor floor; there\u2019s a primary bedroom, study and new bath on the second, and two children\u2019s rooms and two new baths on the third. \nClose\n\nBrooklyn in Your InboxStay up to date with more great news and articles like this one.\nThank you for subscribing!\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTerms of Service apply.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSign Up\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore The Insider\nFind your Brooklyn design inspiration\n\n\nThe big 21st-century move was blowing out the rear wall on the parlor and garden levels, replacing it with wide openings of steel and glass. Elsewhere, the beautiful original woodwork, including burled mahogany doors and intact carved moldings throughout, was retained and restored, along with repairs to the plasterwork as needed.\nRe mechanicals, Letven said, \u201cIt was a full gut. All the building systems were replaced.\u201d That includes plumbing and electrical, with radiant heat elements installed underneath new pale white oak floors, laid in a herringbone pattern on the parlor floor and a straight run elsewhere.\nThe decor was driven by the clients\u2019 love of the color blue, the architect said, starting with the sectional sofa that dominates the front room (top photo). A chandelier from the Italian company Luceplan, between the magnificent entry doors and the pier mirror, heightens the glamour.\nThe general contractor, Brooklyn-based Burda Construction, completed the job in 14 months.\n\nThe house was well supplied with mahogany woodwork in very decent shape, as well as hefty plaster cove moldings and intact wainscoting.\nThe light fixture in the front entry hall came from Restoration Hardware.\n\nThe architects kept the opening between the front and rear parlors where it was, turning the back half of the parlor floor into a thoroughly modern kitchen.\n\nThe kitchen\u2019s lower cabinets are painted Benjamin Moore\u2019s Beau Green, with white Caesarstone countertops. The matte gold fixture from Restoration Hardware echoes the finish on the faucets.\nA tiny gap in the crown molding above the new window wall accommodates an automatic roll-down window shade.\n\nThe primary bedroom\u2019s minimalism puts emphasis on the perfectly intact original moldings and window trim.\n\nThe study/library on the second floor stands out for its blue-backed bookcases and the preserved plaster arch.\n\nThere\u2019s a subtle color scheme in the primary bath, with a custom wood vanity designed to look like a piece of furniture, gold-toned hardware and gray marble hex tiles on the floor.\n\nA giant new skylight and wood-veneer pendant from the Spanish company LZF illuminate the top floor landing.\n\nA boy\u2019s room is distinguished by a wall covered with a blueprint for a rocket ship.\n\nIn one of two new top-floor baths, turquoise glass tiles line the shower, with marble mosaics on the floor.\n\nThe other top floor bath is enlivened by a floor of Popham encaustic cement tile from Ann Sacks.\n\nThe lower level, used for guests, also had its back wall blown out, with an expansive kitchen.\n[Photos by Regan Wood]\nThe Insider\u00a0is Brownstoner\u2019s weekly in-depth look at a notable interior design/renovation project, by design journalist\u00a0Cara Greenberg.

With the licence, the firm can now seek investment capital from retail investors in Singapore. Previously, RealVantage could only seek investment capital from accredited investors in the country, as well as from investors outside of Singapore.  RealVantage allows investors to gain access to various real estate investment opportunities globally, including institutional-grade deals that are often inaccessible to retail investors. In a Jan 17 press release announcing the licence, RealVantage states it has funded 23 deals across the UK, Australia, US and Singapore since its formation in 2019. In 2021, the company increased its investor base six-fold and realised four deals. \u201cThe CMS licence grants us the ability to pool capital together as one significant property investor; and position ourselves on a level playing field with large institutional investors of the real estate world, so as to secure even better deals,\u201d states Keith Ong, co-founder and CEO of RealVantage. Ong views that the deeper capital base will allow RealVantage to provide investors with a wider range of investment options.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

The company mostly known for gaming and graphics cards evolved over the course of the year, and investors took notice. For the full year 2021, Nvidia stock returned a resounding 125.3%, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nSo what\nMuch of the gains in shares of Nvidia came late in the year as the concept of the metaverse took hold. In September and October alone, Nvidia stock soared more than 50%. That period led up to when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg officially announced the company was changing its name to Meta Platforms as he laid out his vision for the future of interactive virtual technology. Investors realized then that Nvidia would play a large role with its Omniverse Enterprise technologies for commercial application in the metaverse.\u00a0\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNow what\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang presented investors with his vision of the company's role as it pushes into artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality, and autonomous vehicle (AV) applications. The company says it will use its technologies \"to deliver a powerful, cloud-based computing platform capable of generating a wide range of real-world scenarios for AV development and validation.\"\nNvidia's omniverse virtual collaboration and simulation platform will power its self-driving vehicle technology. The company will use lidar sensor maker Luminar Technologies' sensors for its AV platform and has announced that the vehicle computing platform with Luminar's sensors will begin production in 2024.\u00a0\nBut self-driving vehicles are only one application for Nvidia's omniverse platform. The company expects customers to utilize it for gaming development, media and entertainment, and manufacturing, among other uses.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia reported record revenue of $7.1 billion in its fiscal 2022 third quarter ended Oct. 31, 2021. That represented a jump of 50% over the prior-year period. Gaming still comprised 45% of that revenue. But data center revenue increased 55% and its Omniverse Enterprise visualization segment revenue soared 144% year over year. \nThe automotive segment still doesn't amount to a significant contribution to revenue, but investors believe it will be a future catalyst. As automotive, virtual reality, and other manufacturing uses grow, Nvidia could continue to be a winning metaverse stock. After the significant gains realized in 2021, that helps explain why Nvidia stock has been a favorite of investors and analysts alike.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHoward Smith has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The Xbox found success with the Kinect sensor, but Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) discontinued it in the fall of 2017. Nintendo\u2019s (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) Wii was more successful but failed to permanently alter the gaming landscape. The company has since found that people are eager to embrace augmented reality instead. Through its partnership with Niantic, Nintendo released the multi-billion dollar hit Pok\u00e9mon Go in July 2016. In many ways, the game paved the way for current metaverse trends. Metaverse stocks should fare well in 2022.\nAfter half a decade since Nintendo\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon blockbuster, the game is still a hit. It had almost 830,000 daily active users at the start of this year in the U.S on one platform alone.\nThe tech industry has taken notice of this continued success. Social networking giant Meta (NASDAQ:FB) (formerly Facebook) wants to pivot towards VR and the metaverse. The company believes that its apps will be critical to the metaverse. The firm bought Oculus in 2014 for a mere $2 billion. Right now, Meta\u2019s revenue depends largely on advertising. As TikTok erodes its Instagram platform, the firm must double down on the metaverse.\nIncluding Meta, here are seven metaverse stocks that investors should consider:\n\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nMeta Platforms\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC)\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX)\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY)\nUnity Software (NYSE:U)\n\n\nQuality and valuation scores for metaverse stocks\n\nChart courtesy of Stock Rover\nNotice the stocks have a fair value score, according to Stock Rover. Investors get quality stocks with a favorable return on investment in exchange for paying a premium.\n\nMetaverse Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL)\n\n\nSource: WeDesing / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkeptical investors may think Apple\u2019s iPhone refresh cycle does not signal its play in the augmented reality space. Apple has yet to officially enter the space. However, customers get access to Unity, Roblox and Tencent games from the Apple App Store. Its indirect exposure to the metaverse will buy it some time.\nApple may assess the potential of VR first before it invests billions in acquisitions to catch up. It could buy a gaming software platform or invest in companies that make VR hardware. Investors may speculate that Apple will buy into smart eyewear. It already has the Apple Watch and Beats headphones. The eyewear market would complement those two businesses.\nAt its current stock price, AAPL stock does not trade at a favorable valuation. As mentioned above, the value score is 25/100. This is below that of Meta and Unity stock. In the current quarter, investors are holding the stock to bet on strong holiday sales. Expect strong growth in Apple Watch and Bluetooth earphone sales. Naturally, Apple will exceed expectations on iPhone sales despite supply constraints.\n\nMeta Platforms (FB)\n\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the first firm to go \u201call in\u201d on investing billions in the metaverse in the next decade, Meta will create an impenetrable moat. The company proposed buying the VR fitness app Supernatural. Still, it needs to answer to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission\u2019s antitrust probe.\nThe FTC did not indicate why it is scrutinizing the deal. Meta has a big market share in VR from strong Quest 2 headset sales. The FTC needs to check that Meta does not dominate the VR gaming studio market. Gaming conglomerates like Microsoft or Sony (NYSE:SONY) have made similar acquisitions. This suggests that the FTC will approve the Supernatural deal.\nOn Dec. 9, Meta opened its VR space, Horizon Worlds, for free. Now that it is out of beta, people may try out its 3-on-3 laser tag game called Arena Clash. Furthermore, game developers may access new creator tools. Investors should treat Meta\u2019s Horizon Worlds opening as a positive catalyst. By releasing the environment first, it will grab market share.\n\nMetaverse Stocks to Buy: Intel (INTC)\n\n\nSource: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.com\n\nLooked at as a slow-moving gorilla of computer chips, Intel is pivoting into the gaming space. The firm is losing desktop and server market share to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Yet Intel also recognizes that customers are under-served in the discrete graphics chip market.\nThanks to cryptocurrency mining and a chip shortage, GPU prices are through the roof. To profit from this sector, Intel is introducing its Arc graphics solutions. It is coming in Q1 2022. The GPU is still in the validation phase with partners. They are providing feedback to Intel. After it fixes any bugs and addresses partner concerns, consumers will be able buy Intel\u2019s GPU.\nThe graphics industry suffers from supply problems. Intel has the flexibility in building chips from its fabs and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). This could put an end to the high AMD and Nvidia graphics card prices. Markets are underestimating the impact Intel\u2019s entrance will have on the AMD-Nvidia duopoly.\nINTC stock has a favorable value score. Plus, each share pays a $1.39 dividend annually, currently a 2.7% dividend.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\n\nSource: NPS_87 / Shutterstock.com\n\nComputers need powerful graphics chips. And since Nvidia\u2019s card is out of stock or in limited supplies at most retailers, the company will enjoy healthy profit margins. Nvidia also has an edge over AMD in that it addresses driver software issues faster.\nIntel is not yet an imminent threat with the Arc chip release. Besides, Intel will address the needs of the budget and mainstream market. Nvidia will continue to cater to gamers who demand high-end VR performance.\nVR and AR will require mobile edge computing and\u00a0cloud gaming solutions. Nvidia\u2019s Grid vGaming supports up to 160 PC games running concurrently. Should people require higher concurrency ratios, Nvidia\u2019s RTX server will easily meet such power demands. In the next few years, the company will enjoy strong revenue from hardware sales. Subscription revenue from its cloud gaming will grow.\nInvestors worried about NVDA stock valuations may wait for a pullback before starting a position. Nasdaq\u2019s performance weakened in December. This hurt Nvidia\u2019s stock, but not enough to lower its valuations.\n\nMetaverse Stocks to Buy: Roblox (RBLX)\n\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox is a social gaming platform benefiting from strong user growth. In November, the company posted daily active users growing by 35% year-over-year to 49.4 million. Hours engaged also rose by 32% YoY to 3.6 billion.\nThe lower risks of the omicron variant should limit the lockdown measures. Roblox\u2019s strong user growth despite fewer people staying at home is bullish. As the metaverse unfolds in 2022, Roblox has plenty of work ahead. It needs to offer far better quality graphics in games. Also, it depends too much on young children for sustained engagement. If parents decide to restrict their children\u2019s time spent on the platform, Roblox risks reporting lower bookings growth.\nFacebook\u2019s Oculus Quest allows users to play Roblox games. This suggests that VR is certainly in the gaming and metaverse future. At current levels, RBLX stock is priced to perfection. Like the stocks mentioned in this article, it is vulnerable to a valuation correction. Readers cannot time the market and guess when to best buy the stock. What is certain is Roblox\u2019s growth rate is not slowing.\n\nTencent Holdings (TCEHY)\n\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBefore considering TCEHY stock, investors should beware that stocks listed in China face regulatory risks. Fortunately, China said that Tencent may publish app updates again. The government previously suspended it. It had previously been found that a few of Tencent\u2019s apps infringed on users\u2019 rights and interests.\nTencent is exploring the prospects of the metaverse. In its Q3 2021 conference call, Tencent President Martin Lau said the metaverse is a vague concept. Tencent has the technology and know-how building blocks to develop products that maximize the metaverse opportunity. For example, the company has experience developing games and social network experiences.\nTencent is in a good position to align its social network, games, AI capabilities and hardware server architecture to offer the metaverse to users. It is a dominant player in Asia. Investors will benefit from exposure to strong growth in this geographical area.\nTencent has plenty of resources and cash to invest in the metaverse. This includes investing in research and developing, acquiring or partnering with firms.\n\nMetaverse Stocks to Buy: Unity Software (U)\n\n\nSource: Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors who prefer Unity\u2019s superior graphics over Roblox\u2019s offering should consider U stock. In November, Unity bought Weta Digital\u2019s VFX division for $1.625 billion. This will enhance Unity\u2019s solutions.\nWeta has a cloud-based workflow. Unity will get a suite of VFX tools along with 275 talented engineers from the deal. Weta has a long history of success in visual effects from hit movies. Unity will develop dozens of proprietary graphics and VFX tools in 2022. Investors should expect games made with the software firm\u2019s tools to have even more impressive graphics.\nWeta VFX tools will extend beyond the film and gaming industry. When Unity develops it for the cloud, it will play a big part in content creation in the metaverse. Until then, investors will benefit from the tool used in other industries. This includes the automotive, e-commerce and architecture segments.\nUnity is betting that it will lead in the metaverse through 3D content creation in AR and VR. The industry needs to move quickly in this space. Unity is empowering creators with its tools. In doing so, it is strategically positioned to capture a big portion of the metaverse market share.\nOn the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

As part of this core purpose\u2014and with diversity, equity, and inclusion engrained in everything we do\u2014we\u2019re committed to providing investors with disabilities access to our products and services.\nAnd the commitment never stops, which is why we maintain an Accessibility Office to continually review and advocate for accessibility enhancements on our websites and apps.\n\n\n\n\nWeb accessibility\nVanguard believes that all people should have equal access to online information and functionality. We have adopted the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Level A and AA for web and mobile.\n\u00a0\nBrowser access with a screen reader\nA screen reader is an assistive technology that reads content out loud.

The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been and remain in high demand in hot sectors like gaming, data centers, and artificial intelligence. The stock appreciated by 125% last year, crushing the broader market.\nThere's an investing philosophy that says that \"winners keep winning,\" but while NVIDIA's business could keep growing at a rapid clip, the stock might disappoint investors in 2022.\n\nImage Source: Getty Images\n\nShare price gains have outrun revenue gains\nThe market's positive sentiment toward NVIDIA has been building gradually over the past several years -- for understandable reasons. The company's revenue has grown by 107% over just three years.\nIts leadership position in the GPU segment has allowed it to capitalize on the growth of numerous applications that require heavy computing power -- among them, gaming, cryptocurrency mining, data centers, AI, and autonomous driving. NVIDIA has also expanded beyond its core hardware business, developing and tying software into its GPU products to offer more complete solutions to its clients.\n\nNVDA data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, its share price increases have steadily outpaced its revenue growth, and the gap widened throughout 2021. NVIDIA is now nearing nine-bagger returns in just three years.\nAs such, NVIDIA stock has been valued at a rising premium. It traded at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of less than 8 in 2019, but its P/S is approaching 31 today.\nCan the stock support this valuation?\nI think it's fair to argue that NVIDIA's higher valuation multiples are justified. Its revenue growth has dramatically accelerated over the past several years.\n\nNVDA PS Ratio data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nHigher valuations typically are based on higher expectations from investors, so NVIDIA's business will need to support its current stock price with strong revenue and earnings growth. However, some of NVIDIA's growth in recent quarters may be related to the global chip shortage, which is pushing product prices higher as demand outstrips supply. In November, PC Magazine reported that the retail price of NVIDIA's RTX 3070 GPU rose 32% over the course of a year, from $569 to $749.\nSuch increases would undoubtedly help boost revenue growth, but selling more units is likely a more sustainable way for the company to boost its top line. When chipmakers bring more manufacturing capacity online, a return to more competitive pricing would naturally slow down the revenue growth unless the higher number of GPUs sold makes up the difference.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nMore potential downside than upside\nInvestors must consider both the potential upsides and downsides of a stock when making buying decisions. Nobody can be sure what the future will hold for NVIDIA, especially in the face of today's inflation and supply chain challenges.\u00a0\nWhile NVIDIA supplies industries that could continue growing, its own revenue growth might slow, especially given the business world's version of \"the law of large numbers,\" which explains that the bigger a company grows, the harder it is to grow at rapid percentage rates. NVIDIA could finish its fiscal 2021 with more than $26 billion in revenue, and it sports a massive $735 billion market cap.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysts seem to be factoring these concerns into their revenue estimates for the chipmaker. The consensus estimate is for 18% revenue growth in fiscal 2022 to $31.5 billion and 16.5% growth in fiscal 2023 to $36.7 billion. Those would be serious slowdowns compared to its gains in recent years.\nIf that scenario plays out, investors would likely find it difficult to justify the stock's elevated valuation, and we could see its price fall. Again, there is much to like about NVIDIA's long-term growth prospects, but investors might want to pump the brakes a bit. After its strong multiyear run, we could see NVIDIA cool off a bit in 2022.\n\n\n\nJustin Pope has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns and recommends Nvidia.

Its upcoming driver, scheduled for release on January 14th, includes what Nvidia calls DLDSR (Deep Learning Dynamic Super Resolution). It\u2019s quite different from Nvidia's current and quite popular scaling solution, DLSS. DLDSR renders a game at higher and therefore more detailed resolution using the Tensor cores of an RTX GPU before scaling back down to the resolution of your monitor. This means you\u2019ll get enhanced image quality with higher detail and smoother edges.\u00a0Nvidia released a screenshot showing three side by side images, one at native 1080p, one using DSR at 4K>1080p and one using DLDSR at 1620p>1080p. Looking at the image, the boxes with Petersons written on them look sharper in the DSR image and better again on the DLDSR image. And at 145 FPS for the native shot vs 143 for the DLDSR shot, the performance impact is negligible.Tips and advice(Image credit: Future)How to buy a graphics card: tips on buying a graphics card in the barren silicon landscape that is 2021As this is a driver level tech, Nvidia say it \u2018works in most games\u2019 and any RTX GPU with Tensor cores will support DLDSR.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia announces DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, says it can help multiply frame rates by 'up to 8X over traditional brute-force rendering'\n\n\n\n\nAMD's FSR 4 will use machine learning but requires an RDNA 4 GPU, promises 'a dramatic improvement in terms of performance and quality'\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Nvidia announced a partnership with Pascal Gilcher, a modder and the author of the ReShade Ray Tracing Filter to produce three Freestyle filters for its GeForce Experience tool. Nvidia claims these filters apply lighting and shadow enhancements that look as good as an actual remastered experience. That\u2019s a bold claim. It will be interesting to see how the tech works across a wide variety of games.Image upscaling and downscaling tech is developing rapidly along with the acronyms to describe them. DLSS continues to evolve, and there\u2019s also AMD\u2019s RSR or Radeon Super Resolution. Intel is also working on its own XeSS technology.DLDSR and the new Freestyle will be included in Nvidia\u2019s driver that will be available on the 14th of January.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\nChris SzewczykSocial Links NavigationHardware WriterChris' gaming experiences go back to the mid-nineties when he conned his parents into buying an 'educational PC' that was conveniently overpowered to play Doom and Tie Fighter. He developed a love of extreme overclocking that destroyed his savings despite the cheaper hardware on offer via his job at a PC store. To afford more LN2 he began moonlighting as a reviewer for VR-Zone before jumping the fence to work for MSI Australia. Since then, he's gone back to journalism, enthusiastically reviewing the latest and greatest components for PC & Tech Authority, PC Powerplay and currently Australian Personal Computer magazine and PC Gamer.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA stunning new, special-edition graphics card from Nvidia has appeared on its social media pages in China. An Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics card wrapped with The Matrix Resurrections tribute design poses from all angles in a Weibo post. Even more excitingly, the limited-edition cards are up for grabs as a prize to Nvidia and The Matrix fans. Unfortunately, this particular competition looks like it is limited to China-only, but read below for some links to similar global contests.Tom's Hardware has reviewed several Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti by AIB partners such as Zotac, Galax, with special mention for the Asus ROG Strix LC model combined with an AIO cooler. So, readers know pretty much what to expect in terms of hardware under the shroud. With this card, you are getting what appears to be a reference design cooler; however, the graphics for The Matrix fans will make it a real object of desire.(Image credit: Nvidia)The reference GeForce RTX 3080 Ti features 10,240 CUDA cores, a GPU boost clock of 1.67 GHz, and 12GB of GDDR6X memory on a 384-bit bus. While its boost clocks are a smidgeon lower than the standard GeForce RTX 3080 (at 1.71 GHz), the CUDA core count represents a significant uplift over the 8,704 / 8,960 offered by the 10GB / 12GB RTX 3080 models, respectively.(Image credit: Nvidia)If you live in China, you can follow the Weibo link in the intro and enter the competition to grab an Nvidia The Matrix Resurrections GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Tribute Graphics Card by sharing the original post. You must also leave a comment about Nvidia and The Matrix. The competition, which went live on Friday, closes ahead of the January 21 prize draw.Nvidia Global The Matrix GiveawaysNvidia's global social media also has some prizes up for grabs, but please be quick. Nvidia shared a post featuring a complete custom GeForce Matrix PC build on its Twitter accounts, which looks exciting, though it is a singular product. Meanwhile, a post showcases three custom Matrix-themed backplates, which Nvidia gives away with GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics cards. Like the Weibo competition, you need to share and say something to enter. As the global competitions are on Twitter, Nvidia wants you to add a hashtag #TheMatrix, too.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nasus\nCUDA\nGeForce RTX 3080\nZotac\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (3)\n\n\n\nMark TysonSocial Links NavigationNews EditorMark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

If the rumor is correct, then NVIDIA's Hopper GH100 will go on to become the largest GPU design ever conceived, measuring around 1000mm2, easily topping the current monster GPUs by at least 100mm2.\nRelated Story NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDPBut that's not all, the die size in question is for a singular GH100 GPU die and we have heard rumors that Hopper will be NVIDIA's first MCM chip design so considering that we get at least two Hopper GH100 GPUs on the same interposer, the dies alone would measure 2000mm2. All of this means that the interposer would be vastly bigger than what we have seen yet, considering it will pack several HBM2e stacks and other connectivity on board. However, Greymon55 has stated that it is not the GH100 that will feature an MCM but another chip, the GH102. So this means that GH100 is likely to remain a monolithic design but Hopper will feature MCM parts.\n\nGH100 has a huge single die of slightly less than 1000mm\u00b2.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) January 29, 2022\n\nhttps://twitter.com/greymon55/status/1487259506723594243\nhttps://twitter.com/greymon55/status/1487360093440000001\nNVIDIA Hopper GPU - Everything We Know So Far\nFrom previous information, we know that NVIDIA's GH100 accelerator would be based on TSMC's 5nm process node. Hopper is supposed to have two next-gen GPU modules so we are looking at 288 SM units in total.\nWe can't give a rundown on the core count yet since we don't know the number of cores featured in each SMs but if it's going to stick to 64 cores per SM, then we get 18,432 cores which are 2.25x more than the full GA100 GPU configuration. NVIDIA could also leverage more FP64, FP16 & Tensor cores within its Hopper GPU which would drive up performance immensely. And that's going to be a necessity to rival Intel's Ponte Vecchio which is expected to feature 1:1 FP64.\n\nIt is likely that the final configuration will come with 134 of the 144 SM units enabled on each GPU module and as such, we are likely looking at a single GH100 die in action. But it is unlikely that NVIDIA would reach the same FP32 or FP64 Flops as MI200's without using GPU Sparsity.\nBut NVIDIA may likely have a secret weapon in their sleeves and that would be the COPA-based GPU implementation of Hopper. NVIDIA talks about two Domain-Specialized COPA-GPUs based on next-generation architecture, one for HPC and one for DL segment. The HPC variant features a very standard approach which consists of an MCM GPU design and the respective HBM/MC+HBM (IO) chiplets but the DL variant is where things start to get interesting.\u00a0 The DL variant houses a huge cache on an entirely separate die that is interconnected with the GPU modules.\n\n\n\nArchitecture\nLLC Capacity\nDRAM BW\nDRAM Capacity\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n(MB)\n(TB/s)\n(GB)\n\n\nGPU-N\n60\n2.7\n100\n\n\nCOPA-GPU-1\n960\n2.7\n100\n\n\nCOPA-GPU-2\n960\n4.5\n167\n\n\nCOPA-GPU-3\n1,920\n2.7\n100\n\n\nCOPA-GPU-4\n1,920\n4.5\n167\n\n\nCOPA-GPU-5\n1,920\n6.3\n233\n\n\nPerfect L2\ninfinite\ninfinite\ninfinite\n\n\n\n\nVarious variants have been outlined with up to 960 / 1920 MB of LLC (Last-Level-Cache), HBM2e DRAM capacities of up to 233 GB, and bandwidth of up to 6.3 TB/s. These are all theoretical but given that NVIDIA has discussed them now, we may likely see a Hopper variant with such a design during the full unveil at GTC 2022.\nNVIDIA Hopper GH100 'Official Specs':\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Tesla Graphics CardTesla K40\n(PCI-Express)Tesla M40\n(PCI-Express)Tesla P100\n(PCI-Express)Tesla P100 (SXM2)Tesla V100 (SXM2)NVIDIA A100 (SXM4)NVIDIA H100 (PCIe)NVIDIA H100 (SMX5)\n\n\n\n\nGPUGK110 (Kepler)GM200 (Maxwell)GP100 (Pascal)GP100 (Pascal)GV100 (Volta)GA100 (Ampere)GH100 (Hopper)GH100 (Hopper)\n\n\nProcess Node28nm28nm16nm16nm12nm7nm4nm4nm\n\n\nTransistors7.1 Billion8 Billion15.3 Billion15.3 Billion21.1 Billion54.2 Billion80 Billion80 Billion\n\n\nGPU Die Size551 mm2601 mm2610 mm2610 mm2815mm2826mm2814mm2814mm2\n\n\nSMs1524565680108114132\n\n\nTPCs1524282840545766\n\n\nFP32 CUDA Cores Per SM19212864646464128128\n\n\nFP64 CUDA Cores / SM64432323232128128\n\n\nFP32 CUDA Cores2880307235843584512069121459216896\n\n\nFP64 CUDA Cores9609617921792256034561459216896\n\n\nTensor CoresN/AN/AN/AN/A640432456528\n\n\nTexture Units240192224224320432456528\n\n\nBoost Clock875 MHz1114 MHz1329MHz1480 MHz1530 MHz1410 MHzTBDTBD\n\n\nTOPs (DNN/AI)N/AN/AN/AN/A125 TOPs1248 TOPs\n2496 TOPs with Sparsity1600 TOPs\n3200 TOPs2000 TOPs\n4000 TOPs\n\n\nFP16 ComputeN/AN/A18.7 TFLOPs21.2 TFLOPs30.4 TFLOPs312 TFLOPs\n624 TFLOPs with Sparsity1600 TFLOPs2000 TFLOPs\n\n\nFP32 Compute5.04 TFLOPs6.8 TFLOPs10.0 TFLOPs10.6 TFLOPs15.7 TFLOPs19.4 TFLOPs\n156 TFLOPs With Sparsity800 TFLOPs1000 TFLOPs\n\n\nFP64 Compute1.68 TFLOPs0.2 TFLOPs4.7 TFLOPs5.30 TFLOPs7.80 TFLOPs19.5 TFLOPs\n(9.7 TFLOPs standard)48 TFLOPs60 TFLOPs\n\n\nMemory Interface384-bit GDDR5384-bit GDDR54096-bit HBM24096-bit HBM24096-bit HBM26144-bit HBM2e5120-bit HBM2e5120-bit HBM3\n\n\nMemory Size12 GB GDDR5 @ 288 GB/s24 GB GDDR5 @ 288 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 732 GB/s\n12 GB HBM2 @ 549 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 732 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 900 GB/sUp To 40 GB HBM2 @ 1.6 TB/s\nUp To 80 GB HBM2 @ 1.6 TB/sUp To 80 GB HBM2e @  2.0 GbpsUp To 80 GB HBM3 @  3.0 Gbps\n\n\nL2 Cache Size1536 KB3072 KB4096 KB4096 KB6144 KB40960 KB51200 KB51200 KB\n\n\nTDP235W250W250W300W300W400W350W700W\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs;

These two tech behemoths have dominated the graphics card conversation for nearly two decades, and it's been a long time since any other tech outfit took a good shot at the two. \nIntel's upcoming Arc Alchemist graphics card aside, choosing between the two is difficult. If you buy a new GPU, you're either buying from Team Red or Team Green. So, does it really make a difference who you buy from? Isn't all GPU performance roughly similar? Can't you expect a similar level of gaming performance, no matter if you buy an Nvidia or an AMD GPU? \n                        AMD vs. Nvidia: Does It Really Matter?\n               \nPC hardware enthusiasts worldwide are spitting coffee across their screens as they read. Debates about the merits of each GPU manufacturer are a never-ending source of conversation, especially since AMD rolled its socks up and clawed back Nvidia's considerable advantage with the launch of its Ryzen GPUs.\nThen there are advanced memory caches, differences in superscaling implementation, development of Compute Units and CUDA Cores, and on and on it goes.\nHowever, for many would-be gamers, those (admittedly very interesting) specs don't actually mean much. The raw figures and processing power on paper don't marry to real-world performance, and not everyone has the time (or want) to learn about the differences between AMD's Compute Units and Nvidia's CUDA Cores.\nFor most users, the simple question is, will this graphics card make my games look better? Will installing an AMD GPU give me better frame rates than an Nvidia GPU? And even then, that's assuming you're using gaming hardware that allows you to swap your hardware out and make that decision. If your primary gaming machine is a console like the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X, the conversation will wash over you, as both machines use AMD hardware. There, you're an AMD fan, and you didn't even know it\u2014welcome to Team Red. \n                        AMD vs. Nvidia: Who Makes the Best GPUs?\n               \nPerhaps the question is best broached from another perspective. Who makes the best graphics cards out of Nvidia and AMD?\nAgain, answering the question isn't easy without getting involved with specs and costs. But if you're building out or buying a new PC, these are valid questions, and understanding at least some of what's being sold to you is important. At the very least, you'll understand more about what to expect from your graphics card, and you could save yourself some extra pennies when PC hardware prices continue to rise.\nSo, let's look at a few factors that might help you figure out which graphics card you want to buy. \n            1. Performance\n    \nAt the top end of the GPU market, you'll find incredible hardware like the Nvidia RTX 3090 and the AMD RX 6900 XT, and the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT. The Nvidia RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti bookend AMD's RX 6700 XT, but they're all there in the mix.\n\n\n\nAll of these equivalent cards offer similar performance, give or take a few frames per second, along with the other hardware in your machine. However, Nvidia typically edges just ahead in terms of outright power, boosted by the additional tech it brings to the table, such as DLSS, which is undoubtedly better than AMD's Fidelity FX.\nRelated: Nvidia DLSS vs. AMD FidelityFX: What's the Difference & What Looks Better?\nSo, in terms of gaming performance, an Nvidia GPU is likely the better option, but you won't go wrong with an AMD card either. \n            2. Price\n    \nNext up, price. If performance is similar outside of advanced features like ray tracing and upscaling, the next best metric is price. Even if you think it doesn't matter which GPU manufacturer you choose, the difference in price between AMD and Nvidia may cause you to reconsider.\nPrice is one aspect where AMD typically beats out Nvidia. For example, Nvidia's RTX 3080 has an MSRP of $699, while the equivalent AMD card, the RX 6800 XT, has an MSRP of $649.\nNow, what're 50 bucks when you're already spending that much on a GPU? The difficulty is that currently, GPU prices are drastically inflated due to chip shortages, manufacturing issues, energy inflation, crypto mining, scalpers, and so on. Where there was just a $50 gap between these two equivalent GPUs at launch, the current price is much, much higher\u2014and with a larger gap between the two.\nAccording to Tom's Hardware, the average price for an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 on eBay was $1,783 in December 2021, while the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT was substantially cheaper, averaging $1,387. That difference of around $400 is significant, maybe allowing you to spend extra on other hardware components such as more or faster RAM.\nRelated: Why PC Hardware Prices Are Set to Rise Again in 2022 \n            3. Availability\n    \nFollowing on from that, availability is another problem facing both GPU manufacturers. As Nvidia's GPUs are better for cryptocurrency mining and hold a slight edge when it comes to gaming performance, they're harder to get hold of (due to global shortages, as above). As a result, you'll struggle to find an Nvidia at MSRP. Whereas, you stand a better chance of picking up an AMD GPU at a lower price, with wider availability in general.\nSo, does it matter which GPU you buy? When it comes to availability, it may come down simply to what is available when you have the funds to spend and not much else. \n                        Which GPU Should You Buy? AMD or Nvidia?\n               \nWhen it comes down to it, the current state of the GPU market doesn't make it easy for anyone to buy new hardware, let alone be picky when it comes to choosing between Nvidia and AMD. If you can hold out or splash the extra cash required for the GPU you really want, go for it. Otherwise, don't get too hung up on the smaller details.\nRemember, if you're upgrading from an older GPU, say an Nvidia GTX 980 or an AMD RX 580, to a sparkling RTX 3080 or RX 6800 XT, your graphics experience is going to improve an unfathomable amount, regardless of extra features, cache size, upscaling, or otherwise. Sure, Nvidia's ray tracing tech is streets ahead of AMD's equivalent. But a top-end AMD GPU will still play your games at the highest settings at 4K, which is more than enough for most people. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Explained\n\n\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n\n\nGraphics Card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support MakeUseOf.

It was the first step up into GTX gaming.\nNow, 3 of the top 5 GPUs on Steam are GTX 50-class, including the GeForce GTX 1050. When it was released in 2016, the GTX 1050 could power the top games of the time at over 60 frames per second. But the production value of games continues to rise, and modern games need much more GPU horsepower. The GTX 1050 struggles to keep up. Even a GTX 1050 Ti or the more modern GTX 1650 can\u2019t power the latest games at 60 FPS.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, we are announcing the GeForce RTX 3050. It brings the performance and efficiency of the NVIDIA Ampere architecture to more gamers than ever before.\nGeForce RTX 3050 graphics cards come equipped with 2nd generation RT Cores for ray tracing and 3rd gen Tensor Cores for DLSS and AI. For the first time, you can play ray traced games on a 50-class GPU at over 60 FPS. RTX-powered ray tracing and DLSS are the new standard in gaming and the RTX 3050 makes them more accessible than ever. It further comes equipped with 8GB of GDDR6 memory.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, with the GeForce RTX 3050, you also get the many other benefits and features of our platform. That includes NVIDIA Reflex to minimize your system latency in games, the NVIDIA Broadcast app for AI-powered voice and video, NVIDIA Encoder\u00a0for great streaming, NVIDIA Studio to accelerate and enhance creative applications, our reliable Game Ready Drivers and Studio Drivers, and more.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting at \u00a3239, the GeForce RTX 3050 will be for sale worldwide on January 27th from all of our partners.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Out Our CES Announcements\nLearn about the rest of our CES announcements in our CES 2022 overview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\n#SHOTWITHGEFORCE\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United Kingdom\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The card sounds like it's the same as the original 10GB version, but with an extra 2GB of VRAM. And while that's the gist of it, there's a little more to the release. Along with the extra memory, there's a 3% increase in core count and an 8% increase for the ROPs. This sees the 12GB model jump up to a 384-bit wide memory bus for a 20% increase in memory bandwidth, despite the same 19 Gbps GDDR6X memory is being used.\nThe key change is a 20% increase in memory bandwidth and capacity. With all said and done, the 12GB 3080 will land between the original 3080 and 3080 Ti in terms of performance, and we suspect it will often be closer to the 3080 Ti, so a nice little upgrade there.\n\nBut the pressing issue with the 12GB RTX 3080 is the same problem we face with all graphics cards right now: pricing and availability. Given the performance, it's no surprise to find that the 12GB model is positioned between the original 3080 and 3080 Ti.\nDepending on where you are, the 12GB 3080 might actually be slightly better value than the 10GB 3080, so you could argue that it's a welcomed upgrade. Personally though, I'd rather Nvidia remained committed to improving availability of the product they released in September 2020, which many people are still waiting for, the original 10GB RTX 3080.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nGeForce RTX 3090\nGeForce RTX 3080\nGeForce RTX 3080 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3080 Ti 12GB\n\n\nPrice (MSRP)\n$1500\n$700\n$1200\n???\n\n\nRelease Date\nSeptember 2020\nJune 2021\nJanuary 2022\n\n\nDie Size\n628.4 mm2\n\n\nCore Config\n10496 / 328 / 112\n8704 / 272 / 96\n10240 / 320 / 112\n8960 / 280 / 104\n\n\nCore/Boost Clock\n1695 MHz\n1710 MHz\n1665 MHz\n1710 MHz\n\n\nMemory Capacity\n24 GB\n10 GB\n12 GB\n12 GB\n\n\nMemory Speed\n19.5 Gbps\n19 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Type\nGDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus Bandwidth\n384-bit\n320-bit\n384-bit\n384-bit\n\n\nTDP\n350 watts\n320 watts\n350 watts\n320 watts\n\n\n\nWe'll touch more on that towards the end of this review. For now, let's go over the test system specs and then jump into a few benchmark results. For testing we're using our Ryzen 9 5950X GPU test system featuring 32GB of dual rank, dual channel DDR4-3200 CL14 memory. For the GPUs we've tested at the default AMD and Nvidia clock specifications (no factory overclocking) and that means the MSI Suprim X model used to test the 12GB RTX 3080 has been downclocked to that spec.\n\nAnother testing note is that while we have decided to start testing CPUs with ResizableBAR enabled, we've yet to do the same for GPUs. The reason is that for CPUs it's a platform feature, so when reviewing a CPU, we're accurately portraying the performance of that product when using Resizable BAR. But for GPUs it's a little different, although ReBAR is technically still a GPU feature, we don't want to assume that everyone has a Ryzen 5000 series processor. Using ReBAR with older Ryzen processors, and of course, Intel CPUs will lead to different results, and in many cases it's not even supported.\n\nFor example, the Radeon RX 6800 XT receives a ~20% boost in Assassin's Creed Valhalla with Resizable BAR enabled when using our Ryzen 9 5950X test system, but if you had a Core i9-9900K, the feature isn't supported, which means no gains. This is an issue as the RTX 3080 only receives around a ~5-10% boost with ReBAR enabled in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and that gives AMD a massive advantage on our Ryzen 5000 test system, an advantage you're unlikely to see on all other platforms. So, until Resizable BAR is supported and works well on a wide range of modern platforms, we're going to limit its use to CPU/platform testing. With that out of the way, let's get into the benchmark data...\nBenchmarks\nFirst up let's go over the updated Assassin's Creed Valhalla data. Starting with 1080p, the 3080 12GB, original 3080 and the 3080 Ti all delivered about the same performance, and here we're architecturally bottlenecked with Ampere unable to efficiently feed all the cores at this lower resolution, leading to the 6800 XT showing ~14% more performance.\n\n\nThat margin is halved at 1440p with the 6800 XT now just 7% faster than the 12GB 3080, while the updated GeForce GPU basically matched the 3080 Ti, while offering an extremely mild 6% gain over the original 10GB 3080.\n\nThen at 4K the new 12GB 3080 overtakes the 6800 XT, beating it by 8%, while surpassing the original 3080 by 10%. It was also within a frame of the 3080 Ti, so we're looking at 3080 Ti-like performance in this title.\n\n\nNext, we have Far Cry 6, and here we're CPU limited at 1080p and that means no difference in performance between the 3080 variants, along with the 3080 Ti and 3090. It's actually a similar story at 1440p with these high-end GPUs and although the 6900 XT hits the lead, it's well down when it comes to 1% low performance.\n\nAt 4K, those weaker 1% lows of the Radeon GPUs are gone, likely because frame rates aren't driving quite as high, and we're now seeing the 12GB 3080 matching the 6800 XT with 77 fps on average, placing it pretty well between the 10GB version and 3080 Ti.\n\nWatch Dogs Legion presents us with more of the same, at 1080p the Radeon GPUs generally perform better, while the 12GB 3080 can be found between the 10GB 3080 and 3800 Ti, but generally closer to the Ti model.\n\n\nMoving up to 1440p sees the 12GB model outpace the 10GB version by a 7% margin, making it just 4% slower than the 3080 Ti, and roughly on par with the 6800 XT. Then as expected, the Ampere GPUs fares best at 4K. Here the 12GB 3080 was 11% faster than the 6800 XT, which is a commanding lead, and just 3% behind what was achieved by the 3080 Ti.\n\nLast up we're going to look at Cyberpunk 2077. We've tested more games but for this review we'll skip all that repetitive data and jump to the 12-game average. The 1080p data is as expected, the 12GB 3080 basically matched the 3080 Ti making it a fraction faster than the original 3080.\n\n\nAt 1440p the margins open up a little, the 3080 12GB is now 5% faster than the 10GB version and just 3% slower than the 3080 Ti. Technically, the 3080 is now faster than the 6800 XT, though the margin is ultimately worthless. Then at 4K, the 12GB 3080 nudged ahead of the 6900 XT to beat the 6800 XT by an 8% margin, making it just 4% slower than the 3080 Ti, so that's probably enough looking at individual game data.\nPerformance Comparisons\nHere's the 12 game average data at 1080p, and as you can see the small upgrade has allowed the 12GB 3080 to match the 6800 XT, but all it needed was a 4% boost. If the original 3080 and 3080 Ti weren't close enough for you, the 12GB model is just 1.5% slower. That's some heavy product segmentation, but then we are only at 1080p.\n\n\nJumping up to 1440p we see that the original 3080 and 6800 XT are evenly matched, so the mere 5% boost offered by the 12GB model is enough to hit the lead by a minor margin, and now it's just 3% slower than the 3080 Ti.\n\nWhen compared to its Radeon competition, Nvidia's Ampere is at its best when playing games at 4K and here the 12GB 3080 was 10% faster than the 6800 XT, which is a reasonable margin. That's a 6% improvement over the original 3080 and 4% slower than the 3080 Ti.\nPower Consumption\nTake the 12GB 3080 numbers as a ballpark figure, that's because for most of these cards we've used the Nvidia Founders Edition models which are better power optimized when compared to MSI's beefy Suprim X version.\n\nEven though the Suprim X is downclocked, the voltages aren't optimized for the default clock speeds, and this increases power usage. Had we received an FE model, we'd expect power consumption to land somewhere between the original 3080 and 3080 Ti.\nRay Tracing Performance\nBefore wrapping things up we'll take a quick look at ray tracing. Like the rasterization results, nothing will have changed from the original 3080 and 3080 Ti testing. For example, in Cyberpunk 2077 the 6800 XT is crippled with any form of ray tracing enabled, with the high setting hitting frame rates by 46%.\n\nThe 12GB 3080 is still hit hard, dropping 31% of its original performance, but enabling DLSS restores frame rates to roughly what we saw without RT enabled. Of course, image quality isn't quite as good as native, but the latest version of DLSS works very well in this game, so for the full effect ray tracing + DLSS is the way to go, but whatever your preference, there are more options available with the RTX 3080.\n\nRay tracing in Far Cry 6 is more subtle, though some areas of the game do look very impressive with it enabled. As an AMD sponsored title this one is better optimized for RDNA2 GPUs, so the 6800 XT is respectable here.\n\nWatch Dogs Legion, on the other hand, is Nvidia sponsored. It was also released well before AMD's RDNA2 architecture, so very little optimization for Radeon GPUs has been done here. As a result, the 6800 XT takes a 53% performance hit with high quality RT enabled, while the 12GB 3080 takes a 39% hit, but with DLSS enabled can restore most of that performance, seen with the ultra settings which boosted performance by 33% with DLSS enabled. Alternatively, you can just enable DLSS without ray tracing and that resulted in a modest 9% gain.\n\nResident Evil Village is an AMD sponsored game, so like Far Cry 6 we find that ray tracing isn't used quite as heavily, and it's used in a way that works better with AMD's implementation. Still, we're looking at a 49% hit for the 6800 XT with a 35% hit for the 12GB 3080, though in both cases performance at 1440p remains excellent.\nOverclocking & Temps\nHere's a quick look at how the MSI RTX 3080 12GB Suprim X performs out of the box. After 30 minutes of gameplay, the GPU temperature peaked at 77C which is quite high, though we're looking at a relatively low fan speed of 1500 RPM, meaning the card was basically whisper quiet. This is impressive given GPU power was up around 390 watts. The typical core clock speed was 1905 MHz, and of course, the memory operated at 19 Gbps.\nOverclocked, our sample peaked at 78C, with a very slight increase in fan speed and here it averaged 1950 MHz, a mere 2% boost from stock. Going higher would cause the card to crash. The memory also peaked at 20 Gbps, which is an insignificant 5% bump. In other words, stock the Suprim X wasn't far from being maxed out.\nWho Is It For?\nThat's how the GeForce RTX 3080 12GB performs, and as expected, there are no surprises. For Nvidia, the 12GB version of the RTX 3080 allows them to significantly boost profit margins on silicon that would have otherwise sold as the original 10 GB model, and therefore allows board partners and/or distributors to cash in on the current market's demand. Of course, we'd prefer if they looked after loyal customers who ordered an RTX 3080 at a reasonable price 16 months ago, but clearly there's no business incentive in doing that.\n\nSo, we know exactly why Nvidia has released the 12GB 3080, and why they're not crazy about reviewers getting their hands on them, but what does it mean for consumers? Frankly, not a lot. Those of you holding out for cheaper prices will have to continue to remain patient, and Nvidia's move to further segment the GA102 lineup does nothing to improve supply.\nThere's no good news here, unless you already planned to overpay for a graphics card. The 12GB 3080 is already on sale in a few countries, and when compared to the 3080 Ti, we guess you could say it's... \"better\" value.\nThe original RTX 3080 (10GB) is listed for as little as $1,400 in the US, but they're mostly out of stock at that price, while the 3080 Ti is closer to $2,000 and then new 12GB version is selling somewhere in the middle. Based on those street price points, the 10GB model still offers the best value for gamers, but the 12GB model is better than the 3080 Ti (woo!). Of course, you shouldn't buy any of them, but that's how the market is pricing these products.\nThat's all we have to say about the 12GB RTX 3080. On a final note, the MSI RTX 3080 12GB Suprim X is a beast of a graphics card, it's just a shame we can't recommend you buy one at this point.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nGeForce RTX 3080 12GB on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3080 on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3070 Ti on Amazon\nRadeon RX 6600 on Amazon\nRadeon RX 6600 XT on Amazon\nRadeon RX 6800 XT on Amazon\nRyzen 5 5600X on Amazon\nRyzen 9 5950X on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 33\n\n\n Got something to say?

New technology is exciting but sometimes it's a frustrating reality\u00a0when compatibility restrictions limit use to only a few of the latest games. Another issue often faced is a requirement to update multiple parts of a gaming rig to enjoy the benefits. Nvidia's DLDSR seems to be a solution for both of these problems and it's coming soon. \nNvidia is the leading GPU manufacturer and its\u00a0ray tracing technology was unchallenged for many years. Recent advances by AMD, however, have closed the gap and AMD's latest Radeon RX-6000 series compares well with Nvidia's newest GeForce RTX 30-series graphics cards. Beyond raw power, both companies have been refining their software solutions and super-resolution scaling has been a great focus recently, with AMD matching Nvidia's DLSS with FidelityFX and Radeon Super Resolution.\nRelated: GPU Shortage Might Start To Ease In Second Half Of 2022, Says NVIDIA\nNvidia recently introduced a new type of super-resolution scaling technology called DLDSR (Deep Learning Dynamic Super Resolution) and it's available across a wider range of games and devices\u00a0than the similarly named DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling). Whereas DLSS requires game developers to code specifically for this graphics technique, the new DLDSR is automatically applied to all games. Another important difference is DLDSR is a downscaling technology, rather than upscaling as DLSS does. That means it's useful when the gaming rig has more power than needed for gaming in the native resolution of the attached monitor. In an example to clarify this, Nvidia explained that\u00a0with a gaming system that has a 1080p monitor and gets 145 FPS (frames per second) while playing Prey at 1080p, DLDSR can deliver 143 FPS with a downscaled resolution that's perceptually similar to 4K quality. The takeaway is a much cleaner image at nearly the same speed. \n                        How Nvidia's DLDSR Downscaling Works\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownscaling means the computer and GPU are processing graphics at 4K resolution, but outputs to the display at its normal 1080p resolution. While there's no way to make a 1080p monitor as crisp\u00a0as a 4K display, this downsampling method improves image quality by smoothing edges, reducing shimmering, and enhancing detail. Nvidia GPUs already have a form of this called DSR, but it typically results in a big performance hit. In the example given above, when playing Prey while using DSR, the frame rate drops to 108 FPS. While still very playable, it's much lower than the 143 FPS of the newer DLDSR.\nDLSS upscales from lower resolution to higher, which is nice when connecting to a 4K monitor but running a computer system that can't process 4K graphics rapidly enough. DLDSR is for the opposite case, where the computer has plenty of power but the attached display is lower resolution. Nvidia said the update will be available starting January 14, 2022. To enable DLDSR, the user simply needs to install the new driver, open the NVIDIA Control Panel, and select DLDSR under Manage 3D Settings and DSR Factors. This should result in an immediate improvement in frame rates on any game, a very nice New Year's gift from Nvidia.\nNext: Nvidia Just Launched Another RTX 3080 That You Probably Can't Buy\nSource: Nvidia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech\n\n\n\n\nPC Games\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWarhammer 40K: Space Marine 2's Most Exciting Changes & Additions In Patch 7.0\n\t\t\n\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Space Marine II\n\nPatch 7 for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is coming with a lot of new features and balance adjustments to make the game a lot more fun for players.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nJorge A.

Your \u201chero\u201d is likely to greet you with blurry, low-resolution graphics that have you questioning your fond memories. Worry not, time traveler: Nvidia has a solution for you! \nNvidia GeForce Integer Scaling\nNvidia integer scaling will take a low-resolution image, such as a classic game, and upscale it to better match your monitor. This means cleaner text, and an overall sharper image. With the new pixelized image, it\u2019s a breath of fresh air compared to other solutions that often make the image blurry and undefined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\nIf you have a 4K monitor and want to play a more demanding game with a weaker GPU, integer scaling can help there too. In this case, you can scale the game to 1080p, thus making it less demanding on a weaker graphics card. You\u2019ll still have a sharper and better-quality image with better performance, too. Even though you\u2019re not utilizing the entirety of your 4K monitor\u2019s resolution, the integer scaler will help bridge the gap.\nHow to turn on Integer Scaling\nFirst, you\u2019ll want to make sure you have at least a GeForce GTX 16-series or later GPU, such as an RTX 20/30 series. This will not work on Pascal 10 Series GPUs, like a GTX 1080 Ti, for example. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThiago Trevisan/IDG\nAfter making sure you have up-to-date GeForce drivers, you\u2019ll want to right-click on the desktop and open up Nvidia Control Panel. (On Windows 11 you\u2019ll first click Show more options, and then the panel option will appear)\nHead over to Display > Adjust desktop size and position. Here, you\u2019ll want to select the fourth option, Integer scaling. That\u2019s it, now this option is activated! Fire up your old-school games and give it a spin.\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Thiago Trevisan, Contributor, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\nThiago Trevisan is a Mac and PC enthusiast for over 20 years, and has written for PCWorld and Macworld since 2021. He runs the YouTube channel Classical Technology with over 50,000 subscribers, which covers NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards, along with Macs such as the 2019 Mac Pro, and also writes about technology for HotHardware.

They had wicked green matrix themed looks and specs to make a PC gamer drool with two of the units packing Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti cards and while the third rocked an RTX 3090. As someone who didn\u2019t win one, the whole thing made me very sad.As Videocardz reports, Nvidia is back to keep the gut punches of disappointment rolling with this new Matrix themed RTX 3080 Ti that\u2019s free to win, but only for residents of China. That does give hopefuls a heap of potential competition, especially as the blog post features on the popular website Weibo. Not only is it a shot at a nice GPU, which are hard enough to buy at the moment let alone win, but it\u2019s a neat looking one too.Tips and advice(Image credit: Future)How to buy a graphics card: tips on buying a graphics card in the barren silicon landscape that is 2021Based on the RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition, the card has a black base colour with matrix green highlights. These include the matrix style code printed on the card as well as a laser-etched LED logo that reads \u201cWar Starts on 1/14\u201d in Chinese to commemorate the worldwide release of the new film Matrix Resurrections.

The initial trailer drop before the movie had many fans pretty excited, even sparking a bit of deja vu for Keanu\u2019s slightly younger clean shaven baby face. The film itself was a bit of a shift from what some fans expected, but without going into spoilers here, it\u2019s also a great critique of videogame culture.Funnily enough, this card probably won\u2019t let you play the new Matrix Awakens demo which was also released around the same time as the film, but has only come to consoles. It\u2019s a shame because it\u2019s very cool and I have spent some time wandering around the open city, driving cars one of the 38,146 driveable cars, a bit gobsmacked on the PS5.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\nHope CorriganSocial Links NavigationHardware WriterHope\u2019s been writing about games for about a decade, starting out way back when on the Australian Nintendo fan site Vooks.net.

While we are bound to hear more details later this month, it looks like a few European retailers have decided to list various custom models online. Videocardz was able to spot several Swiss and German retail outlets that are listing the MSI variant of the cards at various prices. These prices are preliminary but you also shouldn't expect the card to be priced at all around its MSRP which is going to be higher than the existing RTX 3090 ($1499 US). The prices are listed below:\nRelated Story NVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n#1 MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Ti SUPRIM X:\u00a03201 EUR / ~3654 USD\n#2 MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Ti SUPRIM X:\u00a03678 CHF / ~4024 USD\n#3 MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Ti SUPRIM X:\u00a04111\u00a0 CHF / ~4497 USD\nMSI GeForce RTX 3090 Ti GAMING X TRIO:\u00a03129 EUR / ~3571 USD\n\nNow, these prices aren't stable and vary a lot from retailer to retailer. The same MSI GeForce RTX 3090 SUPRIM X can be found for as low as $3654 USD and up to $4497 US. That's a difference of 23% and we also have to consider that all of these prices are with VAT included. Compared to the RTX 3090 prices from the same retailers, you are looking at a 30% price bump for the 'Ti' variant.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Custom Models Listed Online With Prices (Image Credits: Videocardz):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti is going to be really pricey when it launches but when it launches is the bigger question since the production of custom models has reportedly been halted due to the BIOS and hardware issues. Now, these are all rumors for now and NVIDIA has stated that they will have more details to share later this month.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Graphics Card Specifications - Full Fat GA102 GPU & 24 GB GDDR6X Memory\nAt the heart of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics card lies the GA102 GPU. The GA102 is one of the many Ampere GPUs that we will be getting on the gaming segment. The GA102 GPU is the fastest gaming GPU that NVIDIA has produced. The GPU is based on Samsung's 8nm custom process node designed specifically for NVIDIA and features a total of 28 Billion transistors. It measures 628mm2 which makes it the 2nd biggest gaming GPU ever produced right below the Turing TU102 GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe new shader core on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture is 2.7x faster, the new RT cores are 1.7x faster while the new Tensor cores are up to 2.7x faster than the previous generation Turing GPUs. The 2nd Generation RT core delivers dedicated hardware-accelerated ray-tracing performance & features twice the ray/triangles intersection with concurrent RT graphics and compute operations.\nFor the GeForce RTX 3090, NVIDIA has enabled a total of 84 SM units on its flagship which results in a total of 10,752 CUDA cores (vs 82 SM / 10496 cores on RTX 3090 Non-Ti). In addition to the CUDA cores, NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti also comes packed with next-generation RT (Ray-Tracing) cores, Tensor cores, and brand new SM or streaming multi-processor units. The GPU runs at a base clock speed of 1560 MHz and a boost clock speed of 1860 MHz. The card has a TDP of 450W.\nIn terms of memory, the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti comes packed with 24 GB of memory and that too the next-generation GDDR6X design. With Micron's latest and greatest graphics memory dies, the RTX 3090 Ti can deliver GDDR6X memory speeds of 21 Gbps. That along with a bus interface of 384-bit will deliver a cumulative bandwidth of 1008 Gbps.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series Graphics Card Specifications\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 12 GBNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 6 GB\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA102-350?Ampere GA102-300Ampere GA102-225Ampere GA102-220Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA104-400Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA104Ampere GA104-200\nAmpere GA103-200Ampere GA106-300Ampere GA106Ampere GA106-150Ampere GA107-325\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie Size628.4mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2 (GA104)276mm2276mm2276mm2 (GA106)200mm2 (GA107)\n\n\nTransistors28 Billion28 Billion28 Billion28 Billion28 Billion17.4 Billion17.4 Billion17.4 Billion17.4 Billion (GA104)13.2 Billion13.2 Billion13.2 Billion (GA106)8.7 Billion (GA107)\n\n\nCUDA Cores1075210496102408960870461445888486448643584358425602048\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs336 / 112328 / 112320 / 112280 / 104272 / 96184 / 96184 / 96152 / 80152 / 80112 / 64112 / 6480 / 32TBD\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores336 / 84328 / 82320 / 80280 / 70272 / 68184 / 46184 / 46152 / 38152 / 38112 / 28112 / 2880 / 20TBD\n\n\nBase Clock1560 MHz1400 MHz1365 MHzTBA1440 MHz1575 MHz1500 MHz1410 MHz1410 MHz1320 MHz1320 MHz1552 MHzTBD\n\n\nBoost Clock1860 MHz1700 MHz1665 MHzTBA1710 MHz1770 MHz1730 MHz1665 MHz1665 MHz1780 MHz1780 MHz1777 MHz1470 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute40 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs34 TFLOPsTBA30 TFLOPs22 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs13 TFLOPs13 TFLOPs9.1 TFLOPsTBD\n\n\nRT TFLOPs74 RFLOPs69 TFLOPs67 TFLOPsTBA58 TFLOPs44 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs32 TFLOPs32 TFLOPs25 TFLOPs25 TFLOPs18.2 TFLOPsTBD\n\n\nTensor-TOPsTBA285 TOPs273 TOPsTBA238 TOPs183 TOPs163 TOPs192 TOPs192 TOPs101 TOPs101 TOPs72.8 TOPsTBD\n\n\nMemory Capacity24 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X10 GB GDDR6X8 GB GDDR6X8 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6X8 GB GDDR612 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR66 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus384-bit384-bit384-bit384-bit320-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit192-bit128-bit128-bit96-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed21 Gbps19.5 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps14 Gbps16 Gbps15 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth1008 GB/s936 GB/s912 Gbps912 Gbps760 GB/s608 GB/s448 GB/s608 GB/s448 GB/s384 GB/s240 GB/s224 GB/s168 GB/s\n\n\nTGP450W350W350W350W320W290W220W175W175W170W150W130W (GA106)\n115W (GA107)70W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)TBD$1499 US$1199$999 US?$699 US$599 US$499 US$399 US$399 US$329 USTBD$249 USTBD\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)29th March 2022?24th September 20203rd June 202111th January 202217th September 202010th June, 202129th October 2020October 20222nd December 202025th February 2021October 202227th January 20222024\n\n\n\n\nThe card will be available in both reference and custom flavors at launch but considering the existing market situation, expect final retail prices to vary between $3000-$3500 US.

It\u2019s almost a year later, and LHR versions of NVIDIA GPUs are par for the course, when one can buy an NVIDIA GPU at all, that is.\nOkay, so maybe the narrative was almost entirely about availability and pricing, and the LHR thing ended up having a lot less of an impact on the general availability of the RTX 3060 than prospective buyers could have hoped. Let\u2019s just hope that Ethereum (and all other crypto) crashes to unprofitable levels soon, so this madness can finally end.\nWait \u2013 isn\u2019t this supposed to be a review of some new, entry-level GPU in NVIDIA\u2019s RTX 30 Series product stack? Why, yes! Enter the RTX 3050, based on the same GA106 GPU as the RTX 3060, but with 20 SMs enabled, down from 28. This translates into a card with 2560 CUDA cores, and it offers 8GB of 14Gbps GDDR6 memory on a 128-bit bus.\n \n\n\nRather than continue listing random specs, let\u2019s look at a table:\n \n\n\n\n\nRTX 3050\nRTX 3060\nRTX 3060 Ti\nRTX 3070\n\n\nGPU\nGA106\nGA106\nGA104\nGA104\n\n\nArchitecture\nAmpere\nAmpere\nAmpere\nAmpere\n\n\nSMs\n20\n28\n38\n46\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n2560\n3584\n4864\n5888\n\n\nTensor Cores\n80 (3rd Gen)\n112 (3rd Gen)\n152 (3rd Gen)\n184 (3rd Gen)\n\n\nRT Cores\n20 (2nd Gen)\n28 (2nd Gen)\n38 (2nd Gen)\n46 (2nd Gen)\n\n\nBase Clock\n1552 MHz\n1320 MHz\n1410 MHz\n1500 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1777 MHz\n1777 MHz\n1665 MHz\n1725 MHz\n\n\nTexture Units\n80\n112\n152\n184\n\n\nROPs\n32\n48\n80\n96\n\n\nMemory\n8GB GDDR6\n12GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Data Rate\n14 Gbps\n15 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Interface\n128-bit\n192-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n224 GB/s\n360 GB/s\n448 GB/s\n448 GB/s\n\n\nTransistor Count\n12B\n12B\n17.4B\n17.4B\n\n\nDie Size\n276 mm^2\n276 mm^2\n392 mm^2\n392 mm^2\n\n\nProcess Tech\n8nm Samsung\n8nm Samsung\n8nm Samsung\n8nm Samsung\n\n\nTGP\n130W\n170W\n200W\n220W\n\n\nLaunch Price\n$249\n$329\n$399\n$499\n\n\n\n \nWhile obviously sporting lower-end specs than the rest of the RTX 30 Series, I can remember when 2560 CUDA cores was a big deal (GTX 1080, anyone?). Rather, it\u2019s the memory interface which will likely hold the GPU back. Now, 8GB is perfectly reasonable amount of VRAM for a card in this segment, but a 128-bit interface with 14 Gbps GDDR6 can only produce up to 224 GB/s of memory bandwidth \u2013 down from 360 GB/s with the RTX 3060.\nThe the RTX 3050 and RTX 3060 have identical 1777 MHz Boost clocks, oddly enough (our sample is higher, but more on that later). The RTX 3050 has a TGP (total graphics power) rating of 130W, down quite a bit from the 170W of the RTX 3060. Oh, and the MSRP starts at $249, so expect to find it in stock everywhere at that price tomorrow (ha ha).\n \nThe EVGA RTX 3050 XC BLACK GAMING Card\nI\u2019m sure every outlet that received the EVGA sample that we did faced the same dilemma before publishing their reviews: do we re-test with the correct VBIOS for the EVGA XC BLACK after being informed late Monday that it was actually the faster XC card\u2019s VBIOS that shipped, or leave the results as is, with a disclaimer? Guess which option I chose?! (Consider this your disclaimer.)\n \n\n\nBottom line, the faster RTX 3050 XC offers a Boost clock of 1845 MHz, vs. the stock 1777 MHz, a 68 MHz overclock. Not much, and EVGA informed us that this translates into a 1% \u2013 3% performance uplift compared to the stock XC BLACK version. Also, the XC (non-black) has a backplate. It also carries a higher list price (naturally).\nForgetting the VBIOS SNAFU for a moment, let\u2019s look at the XC BLACK card we received:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis card looks identical to the RTX 3060 XC BLACK GAMING we reviewed last February. Outputs include three DisplayPort and one HDMI, and the card is powered via a single 8-pin PCIe connector. At 130W it probably just needs a 6-pin, but then it wouldn\u2019t be quite as identical to the RTX 3060, now would it?\nSomething about the card I didn\u2019t notice at first: the RTX 3050 uses a PCI-E 4.0 x8 interface. This wasn\u2019t apparent just looking at the PCB, since it\u2019s still electrically a x16 card.\n \n\n\nIt has been said that this x8 limitation exists to allow for another GPU (i.e. GA107) to be used in place of GA106 the future. As to testing Gen4 vs. Gen3 PCI-E x8 performance? No thanks! We aren\u2019t talking about a x4 interface this time, and x8 Gen4 is equivalent to x16 Gen3. There\u2019s more than enough throughput available (heck, the GTX 1080 Ti used a Gen3 x16 interface, and it\u2019s a much faster card!). You should still use the RTX 3050 at Gen4 to match that Gen3 x16 connection, but I think we\u2019re all going to be OK.\nNow, let\u2019s forget all about the XC BLACK version pictured above and look at results from the VBIOS-enhanced XC non-black version with the faster clocks, below!\n \n \n \n\n\nRTX 3050 Benchmark Results\nThis section is a bit of a mess, but the results at lower settings \u2013 something I did due to all-new testing for the AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT review last week \u2013 prompted me to test again at higher settings, and against a different group of GPUs. Instead of shifting the review to one GPU group or the other, I left them both in. Thus, in the charts below you\u2019ll see lower-end GPUs represented on the 1080 medium/high charts, and higher-end GPUs represented on the 1080 high/ultra charts. It sort of makes sense!\n \n\n\n\nPC Perspective GPU Test Platform\n\n\nProcessor\nAMD Ryzen 7 5800X (1800MHz FCLK)\n\n\nMotherboard\nASUS ROG Crosshair VIII HERO (Wi-Fi)BIOS 3703AGESA V2 PI 1.2.0.3 Patch C\n\n\nMemory\n32GB (16GBx2) G.Skill Trident Z NEO DDR4-3600 CL14\n\n\nStorage\nSamsung 980 PRO 2TB NVMe SSDSamsung 850 EVO 1TB SSD\n\n\nPower Supply\nCORSAIR RM1000x 1000W\n\n\nOperating System\nWindows 10 64-bit (21H1, 19043.928)\n\n\nDrivers\nGeForce Game Ready Driver 472.12GeForce GRD 511.32 (RTX 3050 Press Driver)Radeon Software Adrenalin 21.10.2 \u2013 22.1.2\n\n\n\n \n3DMark\nHere\u2019s a look at our first group of cards, mostly from the \u201clow-end\u201d segment, and how they performed in both the Time Spy (DX12, 2560\u00d71440) and Fire Strike (DX11, 1920\u00d71080) benchmarks.\n \n\n\n\n\n1080p/Medium Testing\nGiven the position of the RTX 3050 on the 3DMark charts above, one might assume that it will be the fastest card of this small group. And one\u2019s assumption would be correct.\nNote: by \u201cmedium\u201d testing I actually mean medium/high, as medium settings were used in demanding tests, and high was used in older, less demanding tests. In all cases the settings were 4GB VRAM friendly, to prevent issues with cards like the GTX 1050 Ti and RX 6500 XT.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven its position at the top of these charts, it looks like we need to add more cards to the mix, and increase the detail settings a bit. Also, it appears that the RTX 3050 might be around the level of a GTX 1660 Ti. If only I had tested the 1660 Ti\u2026 Oh, wait. I DID. (At high/ultra settings.)\nTime to switch to the higher-end GPU group for some more benchmarks!\n \n1080p/High Testing\nThis might as well be \u201c1080p high/ultra\u201d testing, as the less demanding Far Cry 5 and F1 2019 tests were run at their highest preset settings (ultra), and the more demanding Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla and Metro Exodus tests were run at the \u201chigh\u201d preset.\n \n\n\nInteresting result here, as the RTX 3050 is quite a bit faster than the GTX 1660 Ti, effectively tied with a Vega 56 in ACV at 1080/high. Let\u2019s see how the card fares in Metro Exodus at the high preset.\n \n\n\nWell, this is less impressive. This time the RTX 3050 finishes just behind the GTX 1660 Ti, and the Vega 56 is 10 FPS faster. On to the \u201cultra\u201d tests.\n \n\n\nEven at the \u201cultra\u201d preset, and with optional HD textures enabled, Far Cry 5 still isn\u2019t all that demanding a test anymore. Once again, the Vega 56 is 10 FPS ahead of the RTX 3050, but this time the difference is only ~10% rather than the ~16% with Far Cry 5. The GTX 1660 Ti is only 2 FPS behind the RTX 3050 here, and it does seem that the cards offer similar performance \u2013 depending on the game, of course.\n \n\n\nSomehow the slightly-overclocked RTX 3050 is nearly matching the performance of a stock RTX 3060 in this test, though I am suspicious of this result, and will have to re-test the RTX 3060 soon.\n \nPower Draw\nWe look at power draw next, this time combining all tested GPUs from the various benchmarks. Of interest, the numbers on the chart below include the power needed for the testbed\u2019s Ryzen 7 5800X CPU, 32GB of DDR-3600 memory, two SSDs, and a 280 mm AiO cooler running at full speed.\n \n\n\nWhile NVIDIA has something of a reputation these days for high power draw, possibly due to some product called \u201cRTX 3090\u201d (and an upcoming Ti variant of said GPU), the result from this RTX 3050 XC card are quite impressive. With a total system draw of only 242W measured at the wall, the RTX 3050 was pulling exactly the same power under load as a GTX 1060 6GB.\n \n \n \n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nBased on at least some of the results above, it looks like the RTX 3050 could easily be compared to the GTX 1660 Ti, a GPU which launched in February, 2019 for $279. We all know that the graphics card market is out of whack right now, perfectly illustrated AMD\u2019s launch of a $199+ card with just 4GB of VRAM last week. NVIDIA has priced the RTX 3050 starting at $249, so on paper it looks like a good deal \u2013 $50 for double the VRAM and better overall performance.\n \n\n\nBut, given the state of things, it feels like the RTX 3050 will end up being a.) harder to buy and b.) a lot more than $249 when you can find it. I hope I\u2019m wrong. I hope the LHR is never defeated with this one. I hope they make a ton of them, and enthusiasts can actually buy one for less than $300. PC gaming has been a depressing subject for too long, with two years of nearly unobtainable retail GPUs, and insane prices from scalpers. (Much of this thanks to the ridiculously inflated ETH and BTC prices from pandemic-fueled speculation.)\nSpeaking of pricing, our sample \u2013 if it was actually an XC BLACK GAMING (EVGA product code 08G-P5-3551-KR) does carry the base $249 list price, though our card had the XC GAMING (product code 08G-P5-3553-KR) VBIOS, turning it into a $329 card minus the backplate. At the $300+ level this GPU does start to feel more like a 2022 product, though not anywhere near the level of the RX 6500 XT (a.k.a. the most 2022 product of all time). NVIDIA is at least providing 8GB of memory, and the card can out-perform a GTX 1660 Ti at times. Still, a newly-released $249 \u2013 $329 product trading blows with a $279 GPU from 2019 isn\u2019t exactly going to have people dancing in the streets.\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nReview Disclosures\n\n\n\n\nThis is what we consider the responsible disclosure of our review policies and procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Product Was Obtained\nThe product is on loan from EVGA for the purpose of this review.\n\n\nWhat Happens To Product After Review\nThe product remains the property of EVGA but is on extended loan for future testing and product comparisons.\n\n\nCompany Involvement\nEVGA had no control over the content of the review and was not consulted prior to publication.\n\n\nPC Perspective Compensation\nNeither PC Perspective nor any of its staff were paid or compensated in any way by EVGA for this review.\n\n\nAdvertising Disclosure\nEVGA has not purchased advertising at PC Perspective during the past twelve months.\n\n\nAffiliate Links\nIf this article contains affiliate links to online retailers, PC Perspective may receive compensation for purchases through those links.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousG.SKILL And ASUS Raise The Bar, DDR5-8888 CL88 Overclocking World Record \n\nNextFishing For Chips During Sustained Semiconductor Shortages \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nSebastian Peak\nEditor-in-Chief at PC Perspective.

Today, Meta is announcing that we\u2019ve designed and built the AI Research SuperCluster (RSC) \u2014 which we believe is among the fastest AI supercomputers running today and will be the fastest AI supercomputer in the world when it\u2019s fully built out in mid-2022. Our researchers have already started using RSC to train large models in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision for research, with the aim of one day training models with trillions of parameters.RSC will help Meta\u2019s AI researchers build new and better AI models that can learn from trillions of examples; work across hundreds of different languages; seamlessly analyze text, images, and video together; develop new augmented reality tools; and much more. Our researchers will be able to train the largest models needed to develop advanced AI for computer vision, NLP, speech recognition, and more. We hope RSC will help us build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people, each speaking a different language, so they can seamlessly collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together. Ultimately, the work done with RSC will pave the way toward building technologies for the next major computing platform \u2014 the metaverse, where AI-driven applications and products will play an important role.Why do we need an AI supercomputer at this scale?Meta has been committed to long-term investment in AI since 2013, when we created the Facebook AI Research lab. In recent years, we\u2019ve made significant strides in AI thanks to our leadership in a number of areas, including self-supervised learning, where algorithms can learn from vast numbers of unlabeled examples, and transformers, which allow AI models to reason more effectively by focusing on certain areas of their input.To fully realize the benefits of self-supervised learning and transformer-based models, various domains, whether vision, speech, language, or for critical use cases like identifying harmful content, will require training increasingly large, complex, and adaptable models. Computer vision, for example, needs to process larger, longer videos with higher data sampling rates. Speech recognition needs to work well even in challenging scenarios with lots of background noise, such as parties or concerts. NLP needs to understand more languages, dialects, and accents. And advances in other areas, including robotics, embodied AI, and multimodal AI will help people accomplish useful tasks in the real world.High-performance computing infrastructure is a critical component in training such large models, and Meta\u2019s AI research team has been building these high-powered systems for many years. The first generation of this infrastructure, designed in 2017, has 22,000 NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs in a single cluster that performs 35,000 training jobs a day. Up until now, this infrastructure has set the bar for Meta\u2019s researchers in terms of its performance, reliability, and productivity. In early 2020, we decided the best way to accelerate progress was to design a new computing infrastructure from a clean slate to take advantage of new GPU and network fabric technology. We wanted this infrastructure to be able to train models with more than a trillion parameters on data sets as large as an exabyte \u2014 which, to provide a sense of scale, is the equivalent of 36,000 years of high-quality video.While the high-performance computing community has been tackling scale for decades, we also had to make sure we have all the needed security and privacy controls in place to protect any training data we use. Unlike with our previous AI research infrastructure, which leveraged only open source and other publicly available data sets, RSC also helps us ensure that our research translates effectively into practice by allowing us to include real-world examples from Meta\u2019s production systems in model training. By doing this, we can help advance research to perform downstream tasks such as identifying harmful content on our platforms as well as research into embodied AI and multimodal AI to help improve user experiences on our family of apps. We believe this is the first time performance, reliability, security, and privacy have been tackled at such a scale. RSC: Under the hoodAI supercomputers are built by combining multiple GPUs into compute nodes, which are then connected by a high-performance network fabric to allow fast communication between those GPUs. RSC today comprises a total of 760 NVIDIA DGX A100 systems as its compute nodes, for a total of 6,080 GPUs \u2014 with each A100 GPU being more powerful than the V100 used in our previous system. Each DGX communicates via an NVIDIA Quantum 1600 Gb/s InfiniBand two-level Clos fabric that has no oversubscription. RSC\u2019s storage tier has 175 petabytes of Pure Storage FlashArray, 46 petabytes of cache storage in Penguin Computing Altus systems, and 10 petabytes of Pure Storage FlashBlade.Early benchmarks on RSC, compared with Meta\u2019s legacy production and research infrastructure, have shown that it runs computer vision workflows up to 20 times faster, runs the NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) more than nine times faster, and trains large-scale NLP models three times faster. That means a model with tens of billions of parameters can finish training in three weeks, compared with nine weeks before.Building an AI supercomputer\u2026Designing and building something like RSC isn\u2019t a matter of performance alone but performance at the largest scale possible, with the most advanced technology available today. When RSC is complete, the InfiniBand network fabric will connect 16,000 GPUs as endpoints, making it one of the largest such networks deployed to date. Additionally, we designed a caching and storage system that can serve 16 TB/s of training data, and we plan to scale it up to 1 exabyte. All this infrastructure must be extremely reliable, as we estimate some experiments could run for weeks and require thousands of GPUs. Lastly, the entire experience of using RSC has to be researcher-friendly so our teams can easily explore a wide range of AI models.A big part of achieving this was in working with a number of long-time partners, all of whom also helped design the first generation of our AI infrastructure in 2017. Penguin Computing, an SGH company, our architecture and managed services partner, worked with our operations team on hardware integration to deploy the cluster and helped set up major parts of the control plane. Pure Storage provided us with a robust and scalable storage solution. And NVIDIA provided us with its AI computing technologies featuring cutting-edge systems, GPUs, and InfiniBand fabric, and software stack components like NCCL for the cluster.\u2026and doing it remotely, during a pandemicBut there were other unexpected challenges that arose in RSC\u2019s development \u2014 namely the coronavirus pandemic. RSC began as a completely remote project that the team took from a simple shared document to a functioning cluster in about a year and a half. COVID-19 and industry-wide wafer supply constraints also brought supply chain issues that made it difficult to get everything from chips to components like optics and GPUs, and even construction materials \u2014 all of which had to be transported in accordance with new safety protocols. To build this cluster efficiently, we had to design it from scratch, creating many entirely new Meta-specific conventions and rethinking previous ones along the way. We had to write new rules around our data center designs \u2014 including their cooling, power, rack layout, cabling, and networking (including a completely new control plane), among other important considerations. We had to ensure that all the teams, from construction to hardware to software and AI, were working in lockstep and in coordination with our partners.Beyond the core system itself, there was also a need for a powerful storage solution, one that can serve terabytes of bandwidth from an exabyte-scale storage system. To serve AI training\u2019s growing bandwidth and capacity needs, we developed a storage service, AI Research Store (AIRStore), from the ground up. To optimize for AI models, AIRStore utilizes a new data preparation phase that preprocesses the data set to be used for training. Once the preparation is performed one time, the prepared data set can be used for multiple training runs until it expires. AIRStore also optimizes data transfers so that cross-region traffic on Meta\u2019s inter-datacenter backbone is minimized. How we safeguard data in RSCTo build new AI models that benefit the people using our services \u2014 whether that\u2019s detecting harmful content or creating new AR experiences \u2014 we need to teach models using real-world data from our production systems. RSC has been designed from the ground up with privacy and security in mind, so that Meta\u2019s researchers can safely train models using encrypted user-generated data that is not decrypted until right before training. For example, RSC is isolated from the larger internet, with no direct inbound or outbound connections, and traffic can flow only from Meta\u2019s production data centers.To meet our privacy and security requirements, the entire data path from our storage systems to the GPUs is end-to-end encrypted and has the necessary tools and processes to verify that these requirements are met at all times. Before data is imported to RSC, it must go through a privacy review process to confirm it has been correctly anonymized or alternative privacy safeguards have been put in place to protect the data. The data is then encrypted before it can be used to train AI models and both the data and the decryption keys are deleted regularly to ensure older data is not still accessible. And since the data is only decrypted at one endpoint, in memory, it is safeguarded even in the unlikely event of a physical breach of the facility. (Updated on January 28, 2022 at 2:30PM PT to note that alternative privacy safeguards must be put in place to protect data in instances where certain types of data (i.e., audio, images, and video) cannot be fully anonymized for research purposes, and to clarify that data is also regularly deleted).Phase two and beyondRSC is up and running today, but its development is ongoing. Once we complete phase two of building out RSC, we believe it will be the fastest AI supercomputer in the world, performing at nearly 5 exaflops of mixed precision compute. Through 2022, we\u2019ll work to increase the number of GPUs from 6,080 to 16,000, which will increase AI training performance by more than 2.5x. The InfiniBand fabric will expand to support 16,000 ports in a two-layer topology with no oversubscription. The storage system will have a target delivery bandwidth of 16 TB/s and exabyte-scale capacity to meet increased demand.We expect such a step function change in compute capability to enable us not only to create more accurate AI models for our existing services, but also to enable completely new user experiences, especially in the metaverse. Our long-term investments in self-supervised learning and in building next-generation AI infrastructure with RSC are helping us create the foundational technologies that will power the metaverse and advance the broader AI community as well.Written ByKevin LeeTechnical Program ManagerShubho SenguptaSoftware Engineer Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Our approachAbout AI at MetaPeopleCareersResearchInfrastructureResourcesDemosProduct experiencesMeta AIAI StudioLatest newsBlogNewsletterFoundational modelsLlamaOur approachOur approachAbout AI at MetaPeopleCareersResearchResearchInfrastructureResourcesDemosProduct experiencesMeta AIAI StudioLatest newsLatest newsBlogNewsletterFoundational modelsLlamaPrivacy PolicyTermsCookies Meta \u00a9 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It has plenty of memory and doesn\u2019t make any unusual technical compromises, unlike AMD\u2019s rival Radeon RX 6500 XT, but that potentially makes it a target for GPU miners\u2014which could mean bad things for price and availability.\n\nA year and a half into the latest generation of graphics cards\u2014one plagued by chip shortages, logistics woes, tariffs, crypto demand, and scalpers\u2014we\u2019re finally starting to see the first GPUs for PC gamers on a tighter budget. And as the GeForce RTX 3050 we\u2019re reviewing today shows, Nvidia and AMD couldn\u2019t be going about it any more differently.\nAMD landed the first strike. The Radeon RX 6500 XT arrived just last week, and AMD made some hard compromises to hit its low $199 price point. AMD\u2019s cheap card strips out various features we\u2019ve typically come to expect, and packs just 4GB of onboard memory with a scant 64-bit bus. That\u2019ll help it evade the attention of crypto miners and hopefully free up supply on the streets, but AMD\u2019s memory approach restricts the 6500 XT to 1080p gaming on Medium or High settings. Push beyond that, and performance stumbles hard.\n\n\nNvidia, on the other hand, takes the opposite route with the $250 GeForce RTX 3050. It\u2019s essentially a traditional graphics card, using a cut-down RTX 3060 GPU with 8GB of VRAM and a standard 128-bit memory bus. This bad boy is built to run games with eye candy cranked up and those glorious real-time rays a-tracin\u2019.\nThe memory configuration will likely make the RTX 3050 more attractive to miners (though it wields Nvidia\u2019s Lite Hash Rate tech) when it launches on January 26, so we\u2019ll have to see whether it or the Radeon RX 6500 XT wind up being more widely available on the streets. But there\u2019s no question that the RTX 3050 absolutely spanks AMD\u2019s GPU in the benchmark sheets. Let\u2019s dig in.\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3050 specs, features and price\nThe GeForce RTX 3050 uses a pared-back version of the GA106 GPU found in the RTX 3060. As such, it packs much beefier specs than the GTX 1650 Nvidia uses in the spec comparison chart below. (It\u2019s also worth noting that the GTX 1650 launched at $150, a full $100 less than the RTX 3050.)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\nThe RTX 3050 tops out at the same 1,777MHz boost clock speed as a reference spec, matching the RTX 3060\u2019s rate. But it has fewer CUDA cores\u20142560, versus 3584\u2014along with fewer ROPs and texture units. That obviously affects performance. The  RTX 3050 also wields a full array of Nvidia\u2019s dedicated second-gen RT cores to enable real-time ray tracing, and 80 third-gen tensor cores to help with DLSS, Nvidia Broadcast, and other AI-infused tasks. The Radeon RX 6500 XT ostensibly includes ray tracing hardware of its own, but that GPU is so stripped-down, you can\u2019t practically enable the cutting-edge lighting feature in games. The RTX 3050, on the other hand, handles ray tracing like a champ, especially in games that also support Nvidia\u2019s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) tech.\n\nNvidia also gave the RTX 3050 a standard memory configuration that will have no problem playing games at 1080p today or in the future. It comes with 8GB of GDDR running at 14Gbps, all over a 128-bit bus. That\u2019s good for 224GB per second of memory bandwidth\u2014slower than the RTX 3060\u2019s 360GB/s over its wider bus, but still a-ok for the 1080p gaming this card is intended for. The extra memory capacity also helps with ray tracing, since flipping on that feature places much more stress on a graphics card\u2019s VRAM.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nAMD stripped out various decoding and encoding functions from its budget GPU, while cutting the display outputs on the Radeon RX 6500 XT down to just singular HDMI and DisplayPort connections. That\u2019s not the case with the RTX 3050, which comes with all the modern encode/decode functionality of other RTX 30-series GPUs (including AV1 support) and a full complement of visual outputs. The EVGA RTX 3050 XC Black model we\u2019re reviewing today comes with a single HDMI 2.1 port and a trio of DisplayPorts, along with a 8-pin power connector.\n\n\nSince the RTX 3050 comes with all the hardware and software as its other Nvidia siblings, just in pared-down form, that means it also supports Nvidia\u2019s wide ecosystem of killer software features. Nvidia Broadcast, latency-lowering Nvidia Reflex, ShadowPlay, NVENC encoding, DLSS, Nvidia Image Scaling, it all works. Hallelujah.\nAs with the RTX 3060, Nvidia isn\u2019t rolling out one of its snazzy Founders Edition models for the RTX 3050. Instead, it\u2019s relying on custom cards from partners to carry the load in today\u2019s scorching-hot graphics card market. The EVGA GeForce RTX 3050 XC Black sent over for testing largely mirrors the design of the RTX 3060 XC Black we benchmarked before. This dual-slot graphics card sticks to reference specs and eschews cost-adding extras like a dual-BIOS switch or a backplate to help it land at Nvidia\u2019s $249 price point for the RTX 3050. The lack of a backplate makes the EVGA XC Black a bit of an eyesore in an era when backplates have largely become the norm, but it\u2019s otherwise inoffensive aesthetically, with a blacked-out design.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nEVGA mistakenly loaded review samples with a slightly faster BIOS intended for a step-up overclock model. Our unit is rated for a 1845MHz boost clock, opposed to the 1777MHz reference spec. That should only move the performance needle by a couple percentage points, EVGA says, but production units being shipped to store shelves have the correct BIOS installed, with the correct speeds.\nIf you want to put the dual-axial fans to more work in a bid to squeeze even more performance out of the EVGA RTX 3050 XC Black, the company\u2019s sublime\u00a0Precision X1 GPU management software\u00a0contains everything you need to monitor and overclock the card. The slickly designed program is one of our favorites.\n\n\nAnd now the stage is set. Let\u2019s get to the benchmarks.\nOur test system\nWe test graphics cards on an AMD Ryzen 5000-series test rig in order to benchmark the effect of PCIe 4.0 support on modern GPUs, as well as the performance-boosting AMD Smart Access Memory and Nvidia Resizable BAR features (which are both based on the same underlying PCIe standard). Currently, we\u2019re testing it on an open bench with AMD\u2019s Wraith Max air cooler. Most of the hardware was provided by the manufacturers, but we purchased the storage ourselves.\n\nAMD Ryzen 5900X, stock settingsAMD Wraith Max coolerMSI Godlike X570 motherboard32GB G.Skill Trident Z Neo DDR4 3800 memoryEVGA 1200W SuperNova P2 power supply1TB SK Hynix Gold S31 SSD\nWe\u2019re comparing the $250 EVGA GeForce RTX 3050 XC Black against its EVGA RTX 3060 XC Black cousin, and yesteryear\u2019s RTX 2060 Founders Edition. On the AMD side of things, we\u2019ve included the RTX 3050\u2019s direct competitor, the $199 XFX Radeon RX 6500 XT Qick 210, along with the step-up XFX Radeon RX 6600 Swft 210 and Asus ROG Strix Radeon RX 6600 XT, plus the Radeon RX 5600 XT and 5700 from last generation.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nAgain, EVGA mistakenly loaded review samples of the RTX 3050 XC Black with a slightly faster BIOS intended for a step-up overclock model. Our unit is rated for a 1845MHz boost clock, opposed to the 1777MHz reference spec. Production units being shipped to retail shelves have the correct BIOS installed, with the correct speeds. The performance results shown below may be a frame or three faster than what you\u2019d get from this card in real life as a result, but there should be nothing tangibly different in the gaming experience. \n\n\nWe test a variety of games spanning various engines, genres, vendor sponsorships (Nvidia, AMD, and Intel), and graphics APIs (DirectX 11, DX12, and Vulkan). Each game is tested using its in-game benchmark at the highest possible graphics presets unless otherwise noted, with VSync, frame rate caps, real-time ray tracing or image upsampling effects, and FreeSync/G-Sync disabled, along with any other vendor-specific technologies like FidelityFX tools or Nvidia Reflex. PCIe Resizable BAR and AMD\u2019s Smart Access Memory were also disabled for testing. We\u2019ve enabled temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) to push these cards to their limits. We run each benchmark at least three times and list the average result for each test.\nYou\u2019ll see the Radeon RX 6500 XT lagging hard in several of these tests, but the reality is even uglier than it seems. AMD\u2019s budget GPU also suffered from severe lag spikes in several games thanks to its barely-there 4GB of RAM and scant 64-bit bus. It runs fine at 1080p Medium or High settings, but the maxed-out graphics options used in this testing are simply too much for it, giving the RTX 3050 the clear edge.\n\nGaming performance benchmarks\nWatch Dogs: Legion\nWatch Dogs: Legion\u00a0is one of the first games to debut on next-gen consoles. Ubisoft upgraded its Disrupt engine to include cutting-edge features like real-time ray tracing and Nvidia\u2019s DLSS. We disable those effects for this testing, but\u00a0Legion\u00a0remains a strenuous game even on high-end hardware with its optional high-resolution texture pack installed.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nHorizon Zero Dawn\nYep, PlayStation exclusives are coming to the PC now.\u00a0Horizon Zero Dawn\u00a0runs on Guerrilla Games\u2019 Decima engine, the same engine that powers\u00a0Death Stranding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nGears Tactics\nGears Tactics\u00a0puts it own brutal, fast-paced spin on the\u00a0XCOM-like genre. This Unreal Engine 4-powered game was built from the ground up for DirectX 12, and we love being able to work a tactics-style game into our benchmarking suite. Better yet, the game comes with a plethora of graphics options for PC snobs. More games should devote such loving care to explaining what flipping all these visual knobs mean.\nYou can\u2019t use the presets to benchmark\u00a0Gears Tactics, as it intelligently scales to work best on your installed hardware, meaning that \u201cUltra\u201d on one graphics card can load different settings than \u201cUltra\u201d on a weaker card. We manually set all options to their highest possible settings.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nWolfenstein: Youngblood\nWolfenstein: Youngblood\u00a0is more fun when you can play cooperatively with a buddy, but\u00a0it\u2019s a fearless experiment\u2014and an absolute technical showcase. Running on the Vulkan API,\u00a0Youngblood\u00a0achieves blistering frame rates, and it supports all sorts of cutting-edge technologies like ray tracing, DLSS 2.0, HDR, GPU culling, asynchronous computing, and Nvidia\u2019s Content Adaptive Shading. The game includes a built-in benchmark with two different scenes; we tested Riverside.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nMetro Exodus\nOne of the best games of 2019,\u00a0Metro Exodus\u00a0remains one of the best-looking games around, too. The latest version of the 4A Engine provides incredibly luscious, ultra-detailed visuals, with one of the most stunning real-time ray tracing implementations released yet. The Extreme graphics preset we benchmark can melt even the most powerful modern hardware, as you\u2019ll see below, though the game\u2019s Ultra and High presets still look good at much higher frame rates. Bumping the settings down to \u201cjust\u201d Ultra essentially doubles frame rates.\n\n\nWe test in DirectX 12 mode with ray tracing, Hairworks, and DLSS disabled. The Radeon RX 6500 XT refused to run at our test settings whatsoever, hence the zero score.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nBorderlands 3\nBorderlands\u00a0is back! Gearbox\u2019s game defaults to DX12, so we do as well. It gives us a glimpse at the ultra-popular Unreal Engine 4\u2019s performance in a traditional shooter. This game tends to favor AMD hardware.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nStrange Brigade\nStrange Brigade\u00a0is a cooperative third-person shooter where a team of adventurers blasts through hordes of mythological enemies. It\u2019s a technological showcase, built around the next-gen Vulkan and DirectX 12 technologies and infused with features like HDR support and the ability to toggle asynchronous compute on and off. It uses Rebellion\u2019s custom Azure engine. We test using the Vulkan renderer, which is faster than DX12.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nTotal War: Troy\nThe latest game in the popular\u00a0Total War\u00a0saga,\u00a0Troy\u00a0was given away free for its first 24 hours on the Epic Games Store, moving over 7.5 million copies before it went on proper sale.\u00a0Total War: Troy\u00a0is built using a modified version of the\u00a0Total War: Warhammer 2\u00a0engine, and this DX11 title looks stunning for a turn-based strategy game. We test the more intensive battle benchmark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nF1 2020\nF1 2020\u00a0is a gem to test, supplying a wide array of both graphical and benchmarking options, making it a much more reliable (and fun) option that the\u00a0Forza\u00a0series. It\u2019s built on the latest version of Codemasters\u2019 buttery-smooth Ego game engine, complete with support for DX12 and Nvidia\u2019s DLSS technology. We test two laps on the Australia course, with clear skies on and DLSS off.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0concludes the reboot trilogy, and it\u2019s still utterly\u00a0gorgeous. Square Enix optimized this game for DX12 and recommends DX11 only if you\u2019re using older hardware or Windows 7, so we test with DX12.\u00a0Shadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0uses an enhanced version of the Foundation engine that also powered\u00a0Rise of the Tomb Raider\u00a0and includes optional real-time ray tracing and DLSS features.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nRainbow Six Siege\nRainbow Six Siege\u00a0still dominates the Steam charts years after its launch, and Ubisoft supports it with frequent updates and events. The developers have poured a ton of work into the game\u2019s AnvilNext engine over the years, eventually rolling out a Vulkan version of the game that we use to test. By default, the game lowers the render scaling to increase frame rates, but we set it to 100 percent to benchmark native rendering performance on graphics cards. Even still, frame rates soar.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nRay tracing performance\nWe also benchmarked the GeForce RTX 3050 in a handful of titles that support cutting-edge real-time ray tracing effects. While the newer Radeon RX 6000-series GPUs now support ray tracing, older AMD models don\u2019t.\n\n\nNvidia holds a key advantage in ray-traced games thanks to its Deep Learning Super Sampling technology (DLSS), which leverages AI tensor cores embedded in RTX GPUs to internally render games at a lower resolution, then up-res them to your desired resolution using machine learning to fill in the gaps. DLSS 2.0 works like black magic and gives Nvidia a strong lead in ray-tracing performance. Without it, you usually can\u2019t run ray-traced games above 1080p resolution.\n\n\n\nAMD offers its own FidelityFX Super Resolution to achieve the same basic function, but it uses different underlying technology with no reliance on AI or dedicated hardware. Both DLSS and FSR only work in games that support them, however, so our benchmarks below only show performance with ray tracing enabled but no DLSS or FSR. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to AMD, as these games all support DLSS alone. Flip those features on in compatible games and you\u2019ll see frame rates soar. Testing without upsampling active also gives us a glimpse into the raw ray tracing performance chops for these GPUs.\nWe plan to expand our ray-traced game suite soon, but for now we\u2019re giving\u00a0Watch Dogs: Legion, Metro: Exodus,\u00a0and\u00a0Shadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0a whirl to put the capabilities to the test, with ray tracing options set to Ultra in each title.\u00a0Legion\u00a0packs ray-traced reflections,\u00a0Tomb Raider\u00a0includes ray-traced shadows, and\u00a0Metro\u00a0features more strenuous (and mood-enhancing) ray-traced global illumination. Spoiler: It doesn\u2019t go well for the $199 Radeon RX 6500 XT and its unusual technical configuration.\nLet\u2019s kick things off with\u00a0Shadow of the Tomb Raider\u2019s ray-traced shadows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nMetro: Exodus\u00a0uses ray tracing for global illumination. The Radeon RX 6500 XT refused to run at our test settings, hence the zero score. We test at maxed-out settings, but dropping the visual preset down from \u201cExtreme\u201d to \u201cUltra\u201d and flipping on DLSS would greatly improve performance in this game from a practical standpoint.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nWatch Dogs: Legion\u00a0hammers your system regardless of whether you have ray tracing on, at least with the high-resolution texture pack installed. Activating the ray-traced reflections exacerbates the issue. Just ask the Radeon RX 6500 XT.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nBottom line? While the inclusion of ray accelerators in the Radeon RX 6500 XT gave AMD the chance to crow about being the first sub-$200 graphics card to support ray tracing, our tests show that you wouldn\u2019t actually want to game on that card with ray tracing on. The GeForce RTX 3050 runs laps around its rival.\nPower draw, thermals, and noise\nWe test power draw by looping the\u00a0F1 2020\u00a0benchmark at 4K for about 20 minutes after we\u2019ve benchmarked everything else and noting the highest reading on our Watts Up Pro meter, which measures the power consumption of our entire test system. The initial part of the race, where all competing cars are onscreen simultaneously, tends to be the most demanding portion.\u00a0\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t a worst-case test; this is a GPU-bound game running at a GPU-bound resolution to gauge performance when the graphics card is sweating hard. If you\u2019re playing a game that also hammers the CPU, you could see higher overall system power draws. Consider yourself warned.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nNo complaints here. The GeForce RTX 3050 simply doesn\u2019t need a lot of power to do work. Nvidia\u2019s Ampere architecture isn\u2019t quite as efficient as AMD\u2019s rival RDNA 2 design, as peering closely at this results indicate, but it doesn\u2019t matter this far down the GPU stack.\nWe test thermals by leaving GPU-Z open during the\u00a0F1 2020\u00a0power draw test, noting the highest maximum temperature at the end.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nAgain, no complaints here. EVGA\u2019s XC Black cooler may lack frills, but it sure gets the job done, and it stays nice and quiet (though not quite inaudible) doing it.\n\n\nShould you buy the GeForce RTX 3050?\nIf you can find the GeForce RTX 3050 for close to its $250 MSRP, absolutely. In today\u2019s market it\u2019d still be a relative steal at $300 to $350 (sigh), even though the GTX 1650 launched at $150, and the 3050 is only a bit faster than the GTX 1660 Ti that launched at $280 last generation (and is currently selling for $400 to $475 used on Ebay, double sigh). The GTX cards lacked ray tracing or DLSS capabilities, however.\nWe\u2019re not in 2019 anymore though. The GeForce RTX 3050 is a great 1080p graphics card in these trying times, capable of chewing through games at 60-plus frames per second or higher at 1080p resolution even with all visual bells and whistles usually enabled. (You may need to bump some settings down to High in especially strenuous games.) It absolutely smashes AMD\u2019s $199 rival Radeon RX 6500 XT. That goes doubly so in ray-traced games, where the AMD card struggles to achieve frame rates in the single digits without the help of image upsampling. Gross. The GeForce RTX 3050\u2019s ample 8GB memory buffer and support for killer Nvidia features like Reflex, Broadcast, and DLSS only sweeten the pot. The GeForce RTX 3050 delivers everything you\u2019d want from a modern 1080p graphics card, from fast frame rates to fully loaded features.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nBut what PC gamers really want is to be able to buy graphics cards at sane prices. That hasn\u2019t happened in well over a year. The jury remains out on whether Nvidia will be able to keep the RTX 3050 in better supply than its other GPUs over the weeks and months to come, but I\u2019m less optimistic here than I am with AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 6500 XT.\nThe GeForce RTX 3050 runs laps around AMD\u2019s offering, but the severe compromises AMD made while building the Radeon RX 6500 XT means it has a chance of evading the attention of crypto miners, while its ultra-tiny GPU die also lets AMD pump out a lot of chips. The GeForce RTX 3050, on the other hand, sticks to a standard memory configuration that can be used to mine Ethereum, and uses a cut-down version of the big GA106 die found in the RTX 3060. Yes, crypto prices have plummeted in recent days and Nvidia equipped the RTX 3050 with anti-mining Lite Hash Rate technology, but that\u2019s been beaten before. And the RTX 3050\u2019s GPU is over 2.5x larger than the Radeon\u2019s die, which means AMD can squeeze many, many more chips out of a wafer.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll see it how it goes. If the RTX 3050 disappears from retailers and pops up on Ebay for 1.5x to 2x its MSRP like every other modern GPU has, it\u2019s a lot less appealing. But if you can score one for $250 to $300 in today\u2019s wild market, snatch it up pronto. There\u2019s nothing else in this price range\u2014new or used\u2014that can hang with it, especially the Radeon RX 6500 XT.\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Brad Chacos, Executive Editor, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos spends his days digging through desktop PCs and tweeting too much.

Unlike DLSS, this one does zero upsampling (quite the opposite).\nFrom NVIDIA:\n\nOur January 14th Game Ready Driver updates the NVIDIA DSR feature with AI. DLDSR (Deep Learning Dynamic Super Resolution) renders a game at higher, more detailed resolution before intelligently shrinking the result back down to the resolution of your monitor. This downsampling method improves image quality by enhancing detail, smoothing edges, and reducing shimmering.\nDLDSR improves upon DSR by adding an AI network that requires fewer input pixels, making the image quality of DLDSR 2.25X comparable to that of DSR 4X, but with higher performance. DLDSR works in most games on GeForce RTX GPUs, thanks to their Tensor Cores.\u00a0\nCheck out the improvement in performance vs. the original below.\n\n \n\n\nThe above image was re-sized to fit 1920\u00d71080; for the full res version (3614\u00d72033, 3.3 MB) follow this link.\n\nWe\u2019ve worked with the modding community and teamed up with Pascal Gilcher, a popular ReShade Author, to release three advanced, depth-based Freestyle filters, SSAO, Dynamic DOF, and SSRTGI, a modified version of his popular \u201cRay Tracing ReShade Filter\u201d. These depth-based filters are accessible by pressing Alt+F3 during gameplay when GeForce Experience\u2019s in-game overlay is enabled in the app\u2019s settings menu.\n\nSSRTGI (Screen Space Ray Traced Global Illumination), commonly known as the \u201cRay Tracing ReShade Filter\u201d enhances lighting and shadows of your favorite titles to create a greater sense of depth and realism.\nSSAO (Screen Space Ambient Occlusion) emphasizes the appearance of shadows near the intersections of 3D objects, especially within dimly lit/indoor environments.\nDynamic DOF (Depth of Field) applies bokeh-style blur based on the proximity of objects within the scene giving your game a more cinematic suspenseful feel.\n\n\nThe feature will be found in the NVIDIA Control Panel beginning with Friday\u2019s update, under Manage 3D Settings > DSR Factors > DLDSR.\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousRather Than Abandon Copy Protected Ink, Canon\u2019s Own Cartridges Are Now 3rd Party \n\nNextMove Over HDR Half Life 2.5, It\u2019s Half-Life: Ray Traced \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nSebastian Peak\nEditor-in-Chief at PC Perspective.

Lori Grunin/CNET   Nvidia on Tuesday unveiled a new version of its GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card with 12GB of memory, a 2GB bump over the 10GB version of the RTX 3080 that came out in 2020.\u00a0The upgraded 12GB RTX 3080 will be available starting today from Nvidia's partners, though specific pricing could vary depending on board makers. Though difficult to find in stock, the 10GB RTX 3080 starts at around $700.Nvidia's RTX computer cards -- designed for\u00a0gaming, artificial intelligence work and other graphics-intense activities, as well as cryptocurrency mining -- are in high demand, and frequently out of stock amid continued supply chain constraints. The additional RAM matches the 12GB in the higher-end 3080 TI card, and comes with a wider memory bus. That means higher bandwidth for faster performance, but the new card also needs more power: 350W vs. 320W for the 10GB version of the 3080.\u00a0During a virtual presentation at the\u00a0CES\u00a02022 technology show last week, Nvidia introduced new products for entry-level and ultra-high-performance computing. The new GeForce RTX 3050 GPU, which launches later this month, aims to help PCs run the latest games and goes for $249. Nvidia also announced the high-powered GeForce RTX 3090 Ti GPU, which it said bests the earlier $1,499 RTX 3090.See also: Best gaming PC for 2022    \n    Computing Guides\n   \n      Laptops\n     \n  \n          Best Laptop\n        \n          Best Chromebook\n        \n          Best Budget Laptop\n        \n          Best Cheap Gaming Laptop\n        \n          Best 2-in-1 Laptop\n        \n          Best Windows Laptop\n        \n          Best Macbook\n        \n          Best Gaming Laptop\n        \n          Best Macbook Deals\n        \n      Desktops & Monitors\n     \n  \n          Best Desktop PC\n        \n          Best Gaming PC\n        \n          Best Monitor Under 200\n        \n          Best Desktop Deals\n        \n          Best Monitors\n        \n          M2 Mac Mini Review\n        \n      Computer Accessories\n     \n  \n          Best PC Speakers\n        \n          Best Printer\n        \n          Best External Hard Drive SSD\n        \n          Best USB C Hub Docking Station\n        \n          Best Keyboard\n        \n          Best Webcams\n        \n          Best Mouse\n        \n          Best Laptop Backpack\n        \n      Photography\n     \n  \n          Best Camera to Buy\n        \n          Best Vlogging Camera\n        \n          Best Tripod\n        \n          Best Waterproof Camera\n        \n          Best Action Camera\n        \n          Best Camera Bag and Backpack\n        \n          Best Drone\n        \n      Tablets & E-Readers\n     \n  \n          Best E-Ink Tablets\n        \n          Best iPad Deals\n        \n          Best iPad\n        \n          Best E-Reader\n        \n          Best Tablet\n        \n          Best Android Tablet\n        \n      3D Printers\n     \n  \n          Best 3D Printer\n        \n          Best Budget 3D Printer\n        \n          Best 3D Printing Filament\n        \n          Best 3D Printer Deals\n                         Your guideto a better future DealsReviewsBest ProductsGift GuideCouponsVideosSoftware Downloads About CNET Press Room Newsletters Licensing Sitemap Careers Accessibility Cookie Settings Privacy Policy  Terms of Use Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information instagram youtube tiktok facebook x flipboard  US France Germany Japan Korea \n  \u00a9 2025 CNET, a Ziff Davis company.\n  All rights reserved.\n   \n\n\n"

Finding an Nvidia graphics card in 2021, and likely in 2022, will continue to be difficult, especially for those on the lookout for the latest and greatest cards. Thanks to Nvidia's showcase at CES 2022 this year, the GPU manufacturer is adding a couple more RTX 3000 series cards into the fray: The relatively affordable RTX 3050 GPU starting at $249, and the presumed inverse of affordable with the insane top-of-the-line RTX 3090 Ti, with no confirmed pricing yet. \nConsidering how the original RTX 3090 card starts at around $1,500 MSRP, it's expected (and likely) that the step-up Ti card is going to be even more expensive than that. This is Nvidia's current top-dog graphics card, and the specs that are known so far (a full reveal is expected to come later this month, according to Nvidia senior vice president Jeff Fisher) promise some pretty impressive graphical capability. The true competence of the card won't be put to the test until reviewers and players are able to benchmark the 3090 Ti, but based purely on the performance specs confirmed by Nvidia's showcase announcement, the 3090 Ti may live up to its \"BFGPU\" moniker.\nRELATED: Nvidia Announces Ray Tracing Coming to Hitman 3, Rainbow Six Extraction, And More \n                        Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti: Teased Specs Overview\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, this is just a hint of what the RTX 3090 Ti's specs are, as the full reveal is planned for later on in January, based on Nvidia's CES announcement. That being said, the teased specs for this GPU are promising an impressive baseline of performance. The RTX 3090 Ti graphics card will be capable of outputting 40 Shader TFlops, 78 RT TFlops, 320 Tensor TFlops, and 24 GB of G6X VRAM, which reportedly runs at a brisk 21 GB/s processing speed. Granted TFlops are a bit nebulous of a metric to measure while the amount of CUDA cores on offer in the 3090 Ti are 10,752 in total, boasting an additional 256 cores over the base RTX 3090 card.\nGenerally speaking, these specs amount to almost a 10% boost in performance over its sister card, the base RTX 3090. It's no Titan-style card or anything to that degree of an upgrade, but these initial specs still paint a picture of a pretty significant boost over the very potent original card. Clock speeds, system power requirements, and other more specific specs are unavailable right now, but will likely be provided with the full reveal later in January. Price for the new GPU is not confirmed, but given that the RTX 3090 has a starting MSRP of $1,499, it's almost certainly going to be more expensive, presumably hovering around the $2,000+ mark at MSRP alone.\nRELATED: Nvidia GPU Truck Heist Explained \n                        How The RTX 3090 Ti Stacks Up To Similar Cards\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to the base graphics card, the RTX 3090 Ti is not as big of a jump from its predecessor compared to the RTX 3080 vs. RTX 3090. However, considering how much more powerful the 3090 is compared to lower-tier cards, the 3090 Ti is a worthwhile investment for those looking to get the top-of-the-line graphics card. Any player with a 4K monitor setup in particular will absolutely benefit from the added horsepower, whether it's for gaming, or intensive 3D work for creators as well. The RTX 3090 Ti is perfectly capable of 60+ FPS up to the most demanding games at max settings, which makes a lot of sense given it's soon to be Nvidia's flagship card in 2022.\nThe benefits extend even further for older cards, even for those in the same RTX 3000 series. Even the arguably most sought after 3000 series card, the RTX 3080, will presumably be far outpaced by the 3090 Ti based on the early specs. The RTX 3090 Ti has a massive 10,752 CUDA core count compared to the RTX 3080's 8,704 CUDA cores, and even more drastic is the difference in VRAM between both cards: 10 GB VRAM (RTX 3080 GB) versus the massive 24 GB VRAM (RTX 3090 Ti). Compared to any lower end cards, and especially so for any of the previous gen 2000 series, Nvidia's new flagship graphics card is a significant improvement for anyone who needs an upgrade.\nWhen Nvidia reveals the more in-depth tech specs for the new card later this month, and reviewers get their hands on it as well, PC gamers will have a better understanding of what the latest flagship graphics card is truly capable of. That being said, even compared to the RTX 3090 proper, the RTX 3090 Ti is a chunky high performance card only reserved for the beefiest builds. Hopefully the sale situation won't be as dismal as its been with buying every other new graphics card, but PC gamers shouldn't hold their breath.\nThe Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti is rumored to release in late January 2022.\nMORE: With the GPU Shortage, Gaming Laptops and Pre-Builts Are The Only Alternative \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGR Originals\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nPC Gaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS2 is No Longer the Best-Selling Video Game Console of All Time in the US\n\t\t\n\n\nPS2\n\nSony's beloved PlayStation 2 is no longer the best-selling console in video game history as new sales figures reveal a new industry leader.\n\n\nPosts\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nAaron McKinley\n\n\nDec 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS5 Pro Confirms Release Date and Massive Price Tag\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nDalton Cooper\n\n\nSep 10, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS5 Pro Launch Sales Numbers Compared to PS4 Pro\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nGabriel Machado Pureza\n\n\nNov 16, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS5 Pro Packaging Has Interesting Spin on Console's Lack of a Disc Drive\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nAaron McKinley\n\n\nNov 1, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSave on GameSir Cyclone 2, a Wireless Controller With Hall Effect Triggers and Customization Features\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nMatti Robinson\n\n\n4 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWin a PlayStation 5 Pro With Game Rant\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nTim Lord\n\n\nNov 6, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDaredevil: Born Again Is Helping The Marvel Cinematic Universe Stay Grounded\n\t\t\n\n\nDaredevil: Born Again\n\nThe MCU has become so cosmic and existential.

Thankfully, NVIDIA believes it may see the light at the end of the tunnel, as the company believes it's in a \"good position\" to meet demand. \nIn an interview with The Register, NVIDIA's CFO, Colette Kress, discussed all sorts of things, including the chip shortage.\n\"We continue to try and get more supply for the latest quarter. But at the same time, we are procuring supply commitments for longer term. In many cases they can be for a year out, some of the times they may be for multiple years out,\" Kress said.\n\"We are working, as we've mentioned, in terms of longer-term, getting that supply.\" Kress continued. \"In the second half of calendar '22, we believe we'll be in a great position with our overall supply in terms of our estimations of what we will need going forward.\"\nRelated: PSA: Scammers Are Using the Chip Shortage to Trick People\nIf there's one company we'd like to see be optimistic about the chip shortage, it's NVIDIA, as it makes some of the most popular graphics cards on the market (and some of the hardest to find).\nWe'll have to wait and see if video cards are readily available in the near future. NVIDIA's optimism makes us feel like we might actually be able to head out to our local electronics store to find a GPU at some point soon, but we shall see. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware\n\n\n\n\nComputer Hardware\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

At its price point, the RTX 3050 is the least-expensive GeForce to include RTX features, like DLSS and RT cores. Let\u2019s see how the latest X050 GeForce card fares across 11 game titles and many synthetic tests. \n\n\nPage 1 \u2013 Games: AC Valhalla, Borderlands 3, God of War, Monster Hunter\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA has just released its newest Ampere-based GeForce: RTX 3050. This card comes to us a mere week after AMD kicked-off 2022\u2019s desktop GPU launches with its Radeon RX 6500 XT. Both that ($199) and the RTX 3050 ($249) are priced in a similar category, with NVIDIA\u2019s $50 premium being tied to the card being a bit faster in the end, and also including a larger 8GB frame buffer.\nThe GeForce RTX 3050 is a bit of a special release, as it\u2019s the lowest-end card NVIDIA\u2019s put out that still features RTX features (eg: RT and Tensor cores, DLSS, VRS, et cetera). With the previous-gen Turing series, NVIDIA\u2019s lowest-end parts retained the GTX naming, as those RTX features of the bigger Turing cards were not included. It\u2019s great to now see those RTX features at a $249 price-point.\n\nWhenever a CPU or GPU company releases a new product, it\u2019s standard fare to put it up against a previous-generation option, to highlight how far we\u2019ve come. With the RTX 3050, NVIDIA\u2019s foremost comparison is against the GTX 1650, which is a bit of a testament to the times we\u2019re in, since that GTX 1650 retailed for $100 less than the RTX 3050 will. From a pricing perspective, the best comparison should be against the GTX 1660 SUPER, which was priced at $229 (the GTX 1660 Ti went even higher, at $279).\nWith AMD\u2019s launch of the Radeon RX 6500 XT last week, the same thing was done. AMD compared the new card to a two-generation old RX 570, despite the last-gen RX 5500 XT costing the exact same $199 (which included a frame buffer twice the size). It\u2019s easy to understand why these companies choose the comparison models they do, but for this article, we\u2019re going to stick to the $$$ comparisons, and include both the RX 5500 XT and GTX 1660 SUPER in our test results.\nBefore we move on, here\u2019s an updated look at NVIDIA\u2019s Ampere-based GeForce lineup:\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s GeForce Gaming GPU Lineup\n\n\n\nCores\nBoost MHz\nPeak FP32\nMemory\nBandwidth\nTDP\nSRP\n\n\nRTX 3090\n10,496\n1,700\n35.6 TFLOPS\n24GB 1\n936 GB/s\n350W\n$1,499\n\n\nRTX 3080 Ti\n10,240\n1,670\n34.1 TFLOPS\n12GB 1\n912 GB/s\n350W\n$1,199\n\n\nRTX 3080\n8,704\n1,710\n29.7 TFLOPS\n10GB 1\n760 GB/s\n320W\n$699\n\n\nRTX 3070 Ti\n6,144\n1,770\n21.7 TFLOPS\n8GB 1\n608 GB/s\n290W\n$599\n\n\nRTX 3070\n5,888\n1,730\n20.4 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n448 GB/s\n220W\n$499\n\n\nRTX 3060 Ti\n4,864\n1,670\n16.2 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n448 GB/s\n200W\n$399\n\n\nRTX 3060\n3,584\n1,780\n12.7 TFLOPS\n12GB 2\n360 GB/s\n170W\n$329\n\n\nRTX 3050\n2,560\n1,780\n9.0 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n224 GB/s\n130W\n$249\n\n\nNotes\n1 GDDR6X; 2 GDDR6\nRTX 3000 = Ampere\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve been paying attention to NVIDIA\u2019s Ampere GeForces since their launch, you could likely sum up its overall potential simply looking at the specs. Fortunately, whereas AMD cut down on the frame buffer size of its RX 6500 XT, and not to mention culled the accelerated video encoders, NVIDIA didn\u2019t take the same route with the RTX 3050. While it performs under the rest of the Ampere cards, it still retains the same feature set.\nNote: After we had finished testing, EVGA, the supplier of our RTX 3050 sample, alerted us to an issue with the BIOS. The card supplied was an EVGA RTX 3050 XC Black edition, but had the BIOS of a higher clocked XC SKU which bumped the clock speed from 1777 MHz to 1854 MHz. This higher clock model also has a backplate to help dissipate heat. We did not have time to retest with the correct BIOS, so as a result, our performance numbers will be approximately 2-3% higher than they should be. \nWith that, let\u2019s head into our testing \u2013 but first, a brief look at our test system and benchmarking methodologies:\nBenchmarking PC & Testing Methodology\n\n\n\n\nTechgage Gaming GPU Test PC\n\n\nProcessor\nAMD Ryzen 9 5950X (3.4GHz Base, 4.9GHz Turbo, 16C/32T)\n\n\nMotherboard\nASRock X570 TAICHI (EFI: P4.60 08/03/2021)\n\n\nMemory\nCorsair VENGEANCE (CMT64GX4M4Z3600C16) 16GB x4\nOperates at DDR4-3200 16-18-18 (1.35V)\n\n\nAMD Graphics\nAMD Radeon RX 6600 XT (8GB; Adrenalin 22.1.1)\nAMD Radeon RX 6600 (8GB; Adrenalin 22.1.1)\nAMD Radeon RX 6500 XT (4GB; Adrenalin 22.1.1)\nAMD Radeon RX 5500 XT (8GB; Adrenalin 22.1.1)\n\n\nNVIDIA Graphics\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti (8GB; GeForce 511.23)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (12GB; GeForce 511.23)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 (8GB; GeForce 511.32)\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER (6GB; GeForce 511.23)\n\n\nStorage\nGeForce: WD Blue 3D NAND 1TB (SATA 6Gbps)\nRadeon: WD Blue 3D NAND 1TB (SATA 6Gbps)\n\n\nPower Supply\nCorsair RM850x (850W)\n\n\nChassis\nFractal Design Define C Mid-tower\n\n\nCooling\nCorsair iCUE H115i RGB PLATINUM (240mm)\n\n\nEt cetera\nResizable BAR is disabled\nWindows 10 Pro build 19044.1466 (21H2)\n\n\n\nAll of our testing is completed using the latest version of Windows 10 (21H2), recent graphics drivers, and up-to-date games. For this performance look, we carried over the five GPUs we tested for the RX 6500 XT review, and augmented the lineup with the last-gen RX 5500 XT and GTX 1660 SUPER. We would have liked to have included additional GPUs in our testing, but couldn\u2019t get more tested in time for embargo.\nFor our real gaming tests, we\u2019re using nine regular titles, and two focused on esports. As usual, we have a plethora of synthetic benchmark results on the following page. Those results are presented without commentary, but are worth a look if you want to compare any of your own numbers to ours.\nHere are some general testing guidelines we follow:\n\nDisruptive services are disabled; eg: Search, Cortana, User Account Control, Defender, etc.\nOverlays and / or other extras are not installed with the graphics driver.\nVsync is disabled at the driver level (and in any tested game).\nOSes are never transplanted from one machine to another.\nWe validate system configurations before kicking off any test run.\nTesting doesn\u2019t begin until the PC is idle (keeps a steady minimum wattage).\nAll tests are repeated until there is a high degree of confidence in the results.\n\nAs the RTX 3050 primarily targets 1080p resolution, that\u2019s the one we\u2019ve stuck with here. As with the RX 6500 XT review, we\u2019ve added a few new games to our suite: Forza Horizon 5, God of War, and Monster Hunter Rise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla\n\n\n\n\nBorderlands 3\nBorderlands 3\n\n\n\n\nCounter-Strike Global Offensive\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive\n\n\n\n\nDeath Stranding\nDeath Stranding\n\n\n\n\nF1 2021\nF1 2021\n\n\n\n\nForza Horizon 5\nForza Horizon 5\n\n\n\n\nGod of War\nGod of War\n\n\n\n\nMonster Hunter Rise\nMonster Hunter Rise\n\n\n\n\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege\n\n\n\n\nTotal War Three Kingdoms\nTotal War Three Kingdoms\n\n\n\n\nWatch Dogs Legion\nWatch Dogs Legion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the full breakdown of our tested games:\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla \u2013 AMD Ryzen partner\nBorderlands 3 \u2013 AMD Radeon partner\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive\nDeath Stranding\nF1 2021\nForza Horizon 5\nGod of War\nMonster Hunter Rise\nTom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow Six Siege\nTotal War: Three Kingdoms\nWatch Dogs Legion \u2013 NVIDIA GeForce partner\n\nNote: You can download all of the tested setting images at once here (ZIP, 12MB).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla - Configuration (1)\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla tested settings\n\n\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla - Configuration (2)\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla tested settings\n\n\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla - Configuration (3)\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla tested settings\n\n\n\n\nBorderlands 3 - Configuration (1)\nBorderlands 3 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nBorderlands 3 - Configuration (2)\nBorderlands 3 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nBorderlands 3 - Configuration (3)\nBorderlands 3 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nCounter-Strike Global Offensive - Configuration (1)\nCounter-Strike Global Offensive tested settings\n\n\n\n\nBorderlands 3 - Configuration (2)\nCounter-Strike Global Offensive tested settings\n\n\n\n\nDeath Stranding - Configuration (1)\nDeath Stranding tested settings\n\n\n\n\nDeath Stranding - Configuration (2)\nDeath Stranding tested settings\n\n\n\n\nDeath Stranding - Configuration (3)\nDeath Stranding tested settings\n\n\n\n\nF1 2021 - Configuration (1)\nF1 2021 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nF1 2021 - Configuration (2)\nF1 2021 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nForza Horizon 5 - Configuration (1)\nForza Horizon 5 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nForza Horizon 5 - Configuration (2)\nForza Horizon 5 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nForza Horizon 5 - Configuration (3)\nForza Horizon 5 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nGod of War - Configuration (1)\nGod of War tested settings\n\n\n\n\nGod of War - Configuration (2)\nGod of War tested settings\n\n\n\n\nMonster Hunter Rise - Configuration (1)\nMonster Hunter Rise tested settings\n\n\n\n\nMonster Hunter Rise - Configuration (2)\nMonster Hunter Rise tested settings\n\n\n\n\nMonster Hunter Rise - Configuration (3)\nMonster Hunter Rise tested settings\n\n\n\n\nMonster Hunter Rise - Configuration (4)\nMonster Hunter Rise tested settings\n\n\n\n\nMonster Hunter Rise - Configuration (5)\nMonster Hunter Rise tested settings\n\n\n\n\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege - Configuration (1)\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege tested settings\n\n\n\n\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege - Configuration (2)\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege tested settings\n\n\n\n\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege - Configuration (3)\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege tested settings\n\n\n\n\nTotal War Three Kingdoms - Configuration (1)\nTotal War: Three Kingdoms tested settings\n\n\n\n\nTotal War Three Kingdoms - Configuration (2)\nTotal War: Three Kingdoms tested settings\n\n\n\n\nWatch Dogs Legion - Configuration (1)\nWatch Dogs Legion tested settings\n\n\n\n\nWatch Dogs Legion - Configuration (2)\nWatch Dogs Legion tested settings\n\n\n\n\nWatch Dogs Legion - Configuration (3)\nWatch Dogs Legion tested settings\n\n\n\n\nWatch Dogs Legion - Configuration (4)\nWatch Dogs Legion tested settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla\n\nOut of the gate, we see a little bit of a performance uptake with the RTX 3050 over the 1660 SUPER, so it seems like that GPU has turned out to be quite appropriate to test with. It\u2019s easy to understand why NVIDIA has compared this new GPU to the GTX 1650, because if the RTX 3050 just inches ahead of the 1660 SUPER, it would have obliterated the GTX 1650.\nOverall, at high-detail, the RTX 3050 handles this game fine at 1080p, although if you are a stickler (like I am) for high frame rates, you may want to reduce detail a bit in order to hit 60 FPS minimum.\nBorderlands 3\n\nIn Borderlands 3, NVIDIA\u2019s RTX 3050 delivers almost the same performance as it did in AC: Valhalla, albeit with a higher minimum FPS. Since this test revolved around the Ultra graphics preset, there\u2019s a lot of room to be made if you want to eke a little more performance out.\nDeath Stranding\n\nDeath Stranding is one of the rarer games that manages to look amazing while not requiring a powerhouse gaming rig to deliver solid frame rates. In the case of the RTX 3050, the minimum FPS keeps well above 60 FPS. 1440p in this game will be no problem with this GPU. In a quick test, we hit about 68 FPS average at that resolution, bumped to 92 FPS when DLSS Quality was enabled.\nF1 2021\n\nAt what\u2019s effectively maxed detail levels, F1 2020 runs ideally on the RTX 3050 out-of-the-gate at 1080p. Performance could be further improved if 1440p is desired, simply by enabling DLSS. That said, we\u2019ve not tested DLSS in-depth in this title since it was released last summer, so we\u2019re not sure if the occasional ghosting issue still exists or not. If you do play this game with DLSS, you should snag the latest DLSS .DLL file and plop it into the game install folder for the best result.\nForza Horizon 5\n\nIf you were expecting the RTX 3050 to storm past the likes of the GTX 1660 SUPER, you\u2019re going to be disappointed with a result like this. But, there\u2019s little reason to be, as the RTX 3050 hits 70 FPS average at 1080p with high detail, and keeps close to 60 FPS on the minimum. This game unfortunately doesn\u2019t support upscaling features like DLSS or FSR, so you\u2019ll be dropping detail levels if 1440p is in your sights.\nGod of War\n\nGod of War might be a \u201cconsole port\u201d, but it\u2019s one of the best ones we\u2019ve come across. The game looks good, and the graphics options are simple enough to not be overwhelmed by. Here, we once again see the RTX 3050 not pulling too far ahead of the 1660 SUPER, so if you\u2019re still rocking one of those GPUs, you should be pretty satisfied with its 2022 performance.\nMonster Hunter Rise\n\nAs we covered in our look at AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 6500 XT, Monster Hunter Rise is one of the newest entrants to our gaming GPU test suite, although it may not stick around for long, as it\u2019s simply not that great of a challenge for any one of the current GPUs at 1080p. This is despite the fact that the default image resolution value for the \u201cHigh\u201d profile is 150%. That said, this game still looks really good, so to experience this level of performance on even lower-end GPUs is pretty amazing.\nTotal War: Three Kingdoms\n\nThree Kingdoms, like many Total War titles, has an obscene number of graphics settings to tweak. What\u2019s reflected via results here is not with the game running at nearly its max settings, so regardless of the GPU you own, there will be many tweaks that can be made. With our fairly high graphics setting configuration, the RTX 3050 proves no problem for this game, implying 1440p will be an option for those who yearn for a higher res.\nWatch Dogs Legion\n\nTo wrap up our normal game testing, we have Watch Dogs Legion, a game that is still receiving game updates, despite having released nearly a year-and-a-half ago (it\u2019s also one we\u2019re overdue on actually playing). Nonetheless, with 1080p as the target, the RTX 3050 has no problem surpassing 60 FPS average, although the percentile lows might leave a bit to be desired. Like most of the games tested here, there are enough graphics options to tweak to help you achieve the performance / image quality level you desire.\nCounter-Strike Global Offensive\n\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive runs well on any modern gaming rig, even if you want to achieve a high-refresh (assuming your CPU can keep up). Unlike Siege, which we\u2019ll see next, the minimums leave a bit to be desired, but the overall frame rate is sky-high.\nTom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow Six Siege\n\nSiege is something else when it comes to optimization. Esports titles are typically bound somewhat by the CPU performance, but even so\u2026 we\u2019re seeing performance of close to 500 FPS average a mid-range RTX 3060 Ti. Unlike CS: GO, the minimum frame rate is a lot more reasonable, with even the last-gen RX 5500 XT hitting well over 144 FPS on the minimum.\nWe\u2019ve splattered the following page with synthetic tests, sans commentary, but encourage you to look there if you want to see how current-gen GPUs scale in various feature tests.\n\n\n\n\nPage List:\nTop\n\n\r\n\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.

Even though this release adds a new low-end Ampere offering to the lineup, it's based on the same GA106 silicon used by the RTX 3060.\nThe RTX 3050 drops the MSRP from $330 to $250, so you can expect a significant part of the die to be disabled. Case in point, the core configuration has been reduced from 3584 cores to just 2560, a near 30% reduction, but interestingly the same 48 ROPs remain. Although the core boost frequency remains the same at 1,777 MHz, the memory speed has been slightly reduced from 15 Gbps to 14 Gbps. Couple that with the smaller 128-bit wide memory bus and we end up with a 38% drop in bandwidth.\n\nAn advantage of this however is a 24% drop in power use to just 130 watts, meaning a basic 550-watt power supply will be more than sufficient to power an RTX 3050 gaming system.\nNow, when compared to the Radeon RX 6500 XT, the MSRP of the RTX 3050 is 25% higher at $250, but of course, we expect that it will retail for more than that which we'll discuss in more details in our conclusion. So although the RTX 3050 will be more costly, it is also a significantly better product on paper than the budget Radeon, packing 8GB of VRAM, PCIe x8 bandwidth, four display outputs, AV1 decoding, and an actual hardware encoding engine. All the stuff you'd just expect on a modern graphics card, but don't get with the 6500 XT.\n\n\nAlthough Nvidia has cut the PCIe bandwidth in half, which we never like to see on GPUs priced over $200, with 8GB of VRAM and x8 bandwidth, the PCIe 3.0 performance will be the same as 4.0 in today's games, meaning the RTX 3050 won't be crippled on PCIe 3.0 systems like the 6500 XT was.\nWith that out of the way, let's talk test system specs and then jump into the benchmark results.\n\nFor testing we're using our Ryzen 9 5950X GPU test system. Since we're testing GPU performance and wish to avoid introducing a CPU bottleneck which would skew the data, a high-end CPU works well for this purpose.\nAlso, all benchmark data for this review is fresh. We've spent the last few weeks updating our mid-range GPU results for the 6500 XT and RTX 3050 reviews, and much of the testing has been done using dialed down quality settings at 1080p and 1440p, appropriate for these segment of GPUs.\nBenchmarks\nStarting with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, using the medium quality preset at 1080p, we find that the RTX 3050 is good for 79 fps on average, so here it's basically a GTX 1660 Super. That made it 18% faster than the 6500 XT using PCIe 4.0, and 30% faster when compared to the PCIe 3.0 configuration. It was also only 8% slower than the RTX 2060, a decent result overall.\n\n\nThe 1440p data is much more favorable for the RTX 3050, when compared to AMD's recently released 6500 XT. The 3050 is again mimicking the performance of the GTX 1660 Super, meaning it was 38% faster than the 6500 XT, or 45% faster when limiting the Radeon GPU to PCIe 3.0.\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider was tested using the highest quality preset as it's an old game now and our measuring stick for this testing, the 4GB 5500 XT was good for over 60 fps on average, so that seemed reasonable.\nThe RTX 3050 blasted past that result with 87 fps on average, edging it slightly ahead of the GTX 1660 Super this time. That made it 34% faster than the 6500 XT or 85% faster when limiting the 6500 XT to PCIe 3.0. A super easy win here for Nvidia.\n\nThe situation worsens for the 6500 XT at 1440p once again. Now even with PCIe 4.0 we can't even achieve a 40 fps average, meanwhile the RTX 3050 fell just shy of 60 fps and was seen matching the 1660 Super.\n\nThe Watch Dogs: Legion results are quite good for the 6500 XT when using the medium quality preset. Here the RTX 3050 was good for 88 fps and that only made it 17% faster than the 6500 XT, or 28% faster when compared to the PCIe 3.0 configuration, which remains a big win.\nWhen compared to the 1660 Super, it was 5% faster and 15% slower than the 5600 XT and RTX 2060, so a little behind when compared to those older models.\n\nThe RTX 3050 does race away with it at 1440p, averaging over 60 fps to make it 28% faster than the 6500 XT or 36% faster than the PCIe 3.0 configuration. It was also 10% faster than the GTX 1660 Super, but 14-15% slower than the RTX 2060 and 5600 XT.\n\nFor testing Rainbow Six Siege we're using the ultra quality preset with the HD texture pack enabled. As before, we used the 5500 XT to establish the test settings, and this GPU was good for well over 100 fps at all times averaging 147 fps.\nThe RTX 3050 had no issue crushing that result with 225 fps on average, making it just 11% slower than the RTX 2060 and 14% faster than the GTX 1660 Super. Unbelievably, it was 92% faster than the 6500 XT, and let's not even bother with the PCIe 3.0 result for that GPU.\n\nMoving to 1440p sees the RTX 3050 beat the 6500 XT by an embarrassing 110% margin, as it slotted in between the GTX 1660 Super and RTX 2060. Heck, it was only 10% behind the RX 6600.\n\nThe RTX 3050 was 52% faster than the 6500 XT at 1080p using the second highest quality preset with 141 fps on average. PCIe 3.0 completely crippled the 6500 XT and now the RTX 3050 is seen to be 114% faster, and I should note I got the exact same result using PCIe 3.0 with the RTX 3050.\n\nMoving to 1440p increases the margin in favor of the 3050, which is now 66% faster than the 6500 XT when using PCI 4.0 and 128% faster than the PCIe 3.0 configuration. We're also looking at slightly better performance than the GTX 1660 Super.\n\nNext we have Horizon Zero Dawn where the 6500 XT using PCIe 4.0 did well relative to most other games with 72 fps on average. The RTX 3050 was 14% faster, though with both using PCIe 3.0 the GeForce GPU would be a massive 55% faster.\n\nNow the RTX 3050 is 24% faster than the 6500 XT at 1440p. It was also a few frames faster than the 1660 Super and trailed the RTX 2060 by 15%.\n\nMoving on to Far Cry 6, we find an average of 96 fps using the GeForce RTX 3050 at 1080p with the medium quality preset. As we've seen multiple times already, it's basically delivering 1660 Super performance, though it wasn't a great deal slower than the 2060 in this one, at least when looking at the average frame rate.\nThe 6500 XT turns in one of its better figures in Far Cry 6 and as a result the 3050 was just 14% faster, though the issue for the 6500 XT is PCIe 3.0 and when compared to that configuration the 3050 was 37% faster.\n\nThe 6500 XT does crumble at 1440p, whereas the RTX 3050 remains strong, turning in over 60 fps on average to make it 42% faster.\n\nIn Doom Eternal, the RTX 3050 does extremely well matching the RTX 2060 with 178 fps on average. That meant it was 82% faster than the 6500 XT and 287% faster than the PCIe 3.0 configuration. That's all we need to say about that.\n\n1440p is an ugly affair for the 6500 XT and it's disappointing to see that while the 4GB RX 570 can hit 60 fps and a very playable experience, the 6500 XT using PCIe 3.0 was reduced to 36 fps.\nThe RTX 3050 had no such issues though, pumping out a super impressive 130 fps while keeping 1% lows above 100 fps. It was also 13% faster than the RTX 2060 and just 11% slower than the RX 6600. A stellar result there.\n\n\nResident Evil Village isn't a very demanding game, especially with the balanced quality preset, so it's no surprise that at 1080p the RTX 3050 is comfortably pushing over 100 fps, averaging 114 fps. This is GTX 1660 Super-like performance and it meant the new budget GeForce was 52% faster than the 6500 XT, or 78% faster if we compare with the PCIe 3.0 configuration.\n\nNext up we have Death Stranding, and this is another game that isn't terribly demanding, despite looking quite nice. The GTX 3050 was good for 108 fps using the default quality preset at 1080p and that placed it directly between the 1660 Super and GTX 2060, a great result.\nIt was also 24% faster than the 6500 XT and dropping the Radeon graphics card down to PCIe 3.0 only extended the margin to 27%, so you could argue that this is a good result for the Radeon.\n\nEven at 1440p the 6500 XT hangs in there averaging 64 fps against the RTX 3050's 79 fps, which made the GeForce GPU 23% faster and given the price difference, even at MSPR, that's a decent result for AMD.\n\nThe RTX 3050 rendered 112 fps on average in Hitman 3 using the medium quality preset at 1080p and that placed it very close to the RTX 2060, while beating the GTX 1660 Super by a 23% margin. It was also 29% faster than the 6500 XT, or 42% faster when restricted to PCIe 3.0.\n\nEven at 1440p, the RTX 3050 managed well over 60 fps and this made it 9% faster than the RTX 2060, and 35% faster than the 6500 XT, a great result given the current market.\n\nLast up we have Cyberpunk 2077, and here the RTX 3050 managed to break the 60 fps barrier with the medium quality preset, averaging 66 fps which all things considered is quite a good result. Unfortunately, it was 18% slower than the RTX 2060, but it was also 40% faster than the 6500 XT, or 69% faster when using PCIe 3.0.\n\nThose margins remained at 1440p. Here the RTX 3050 was 37% faster than the 6500 XT, or 58% faster when using PCIe 3.0. It only managed 41 fps on average, so for this game I'd say the RTX 3050 is better suited for 1080p gameplay.\nPower Consumption\nThe GeForce RTX 3050 is very light on power, pushing total system usage to just 277 watts in our Doom benchmark. Considering the performance output, that makes it much more efficient than the 6500 XT, but even if we take a more favorable game such as Death Stranding or Hitman 3, the RTX 3050 still stacks up well as it only increased total system usage over the 6500 XT by 15%.\n\nPCIe 3.0 vs. 4.0\nAlthough we've mentioned that the RTX 3050 delivers the exact same level of performance using PCIe 3.0 or PCIe 4.0, here's a quick sample of this. We tested all 12 games and found nothing outside the margin of error, though most results were exactly the same as shown below in Tomb Raider at 1440p.\nWhereas the 6500 XT dropped performance by 13% with PCIe 3.0, we see no change for the RTX 3050. So gamers limited to a PCIe 3.0 platform (which as of writing is likely a majority), the RTX 3050 is going to be significantly faster.\n\n12 Game Average\nAnd here's a look at the 12 game average data, which has been calculated using the geomean. The RTX 3050 averaged 108fps at 1080p, which made it just 5% slower than the GTX 1660 Super, 10% slower than the RTX 2060, and 23% slower than the Radeon RX 6600.\n\nWhen compared to the 6500 XT, we're looking at a 37% performance boost, or a massive 74% increase when compared to the PCIe 3.0 result.\n\nAs we often saw, the 1440p data is even more brutal for the 6500 XT. Here the RTX 3050 was 54% faster, or 85% faster when comparing PCIe 3.0 performance. The RTX 3050 also averaged 74 fps, meaning it was more often than not good for over 60 fps at 1440p using respectable quality settings in many titles.\nRay Tracing Performance\nWe don't feel the RTX 3050's rasterization performance is powerful enough to justify turning ray traced effects on, but you can, and some of you might want to anyway, so let's take a look.\nStarting with Watch Dogs Legion, we see that stock the RTX 3050 is good for 88 fps on average with the dialed down medium quality preset. Enabling DLSS without RT effects can be of big help, boosting the average frame rate by 26% for 111 fps, and now we're looking at RX 6600-like performance.\n\nTurning on ray tracing with the medium quality setting + DLSS dropped the average frame rate to 60 fps, which is still very playale, but personally I'd rather play the game with a higher quality preset and perhaps leave DLSS enabled.\nThe game was playable with ray tracing enabled and DLSS, delivering ~60 fps on average. Without DLSS, the frame rate dropped into the low 40s, and that's about the same level of ray tracing performance than you can expect from the RX 6600 in this title.\n\nTesting with Far Cry 6, which doesn't support DLSS, sees the RTX 3050 able to comfortably break the 60 fps barrier with ray tracing fully enabled. It was slower than the much more expensive RX 6600, but whereas it was 28% slower without RT enabled, it was just 14% slower with it enabled.\n\nOn Cyberpunk 2077 we find that DLSS is most impressive, boosting rasterization performance by an incredible 48%, allowing the RTX 3050 to beat the Radeon RX 6600. Then using ray tracing without DLSS enabled saw the RTX 3060 and RX 6600 delivering comparable performance at 30-40 fps. But of course, enabling DLSS offered a big boost and then the RTX 3050 was good for around 60 fps on average.\nFor those of you wondering why we are comparing with the RX 6600 and not the 6500 XT for the ray tracing benchmark, we simply didn't want to be so cruel. Seriously though, the 6500 XT is so weak with ray tracing enabled that the data isn't useful for comparison.\nCost Per Frame\nTime for the all important cost per frame analysis. We're going to start with the MSRP using the 1080p data, but we'll include 1440p results and other data points (and assumptions) for a more realistic pricing comparison in just a moment.\nBut let's get the Fantasyland stuff out of the way first... if the RTX 3050 was to sell for $250 (which it obviously won't), it would smoke the $200 6500 XT, offering a discount of 9% per frame or 28% when comparing the PCIe 3.0 data.\nThat said, it would also be much worse value than the GTX 1650 Super and slightly worse than the RX 5600 XT, but that's to be expected given the current market, so we can accept a little bit of stagnation, even if we don't like it.\n\nNow, if we look at real world pricing, the situation is quite different.\nFor the used GPUs, we're taking the average sale price seen over at eBay over the past 4 weeks, and for the new GPUs the pricing is based on what we could find in stock at places like Newegg. This places the 6500 XT at $270, and we're expecting the RTX 3050 to cost at least $450, though please note that's an educated guess since the cards have yet to go on sale.\nWith the 6500 XT currently selling for at least 35% over the MSRP, we're expecting the RTX 3050 to come in at a much larger 80% premium, but hopefully it will be less than that.\n\nEven at $450, the RTX 3050 is better value for PCIe 3.0 owners as it reduces the cost per frame when compared to the 6500 XT (PCIe 3.0) by 4%, while including a number of important features.\nIf you have PCIe 4.0 and don't require any of the missing features of the 6500 XT and are willing to sacrifice some visual quality in order to achieve acceptable performance, you could argue that the 6500 XT is \"better value\" at $270, as it was 18% cheaper per frame than the RTX 3050, but that's a serious stretch given everything you get with the GeForce GPU.\n\nIf you're targeting entry-level 1440p gaming, the RTX 3050 is without question the superior product, vastly superior in my opinion. Not only are you likely to be pushing well over 60 fps with the GeForce GPU, but it's also just 8% more expensive per frame when compared to the 6500 XT in the PCIe 4.0 mode. So for those of you gaming at 1440p, even at $450, the RTX 3050 is a much better product and well worth spending the extra money on, or saving up for.\nIt's worth keeping in mind that at this price point, the RX 6600 is technically better value as it costs just 24% more, but offers 26% more performance. Granted, they are about the same in terms of value, but when spending this much, the RX 6600 does become a viable alternative.\nWhat Does It Need to Cost?\nWhile we fear the GeForce RTX 3050 will end up around $450 or more, and we've seen even there it's generally better value than the 6500 XT, what price does it need to be before no one can argue the 6500 XT has any value? We believe that figure is ~$370, which is likely wishful thinking, but if Nvidia pulled that off it would be extremely embarrassing for AMD.\n\nAt $370, the RTX 3050 would be on par with the 6500 XT using PCIe in terms of cost per frame (1080p), while offering twice as much VRAM, twice as much PCIe bandwidth, better decoding support, encoding support, and more than two display outputs. So I can't see it being that competitive on pricing, but anywhere between $370 and $450 is going to be rough for the 6500 XT.\nWhat We Learned\nHow desirable the GeForce RTX 3050 ends up being will depend entirely on pricing and availability. If it ends up costing over $500, it's going to be a big fat nothing burger, and you might as well just get the faster Radeon RX 6600.\nThus, it's difficult to say just how excited you should get about the RTX 3050. Based on the performance we've just seen, we know exactly where it should be priced in order to make sense, but making sense isn't something the GPU market does anymore...\n\nWe expected the Radeon 6500 XT to come in at ~$300, where it's still awful, even when it's the cheapest \"new\" graphics card you can buy. So far it's done slightly better, hitting $270, at least for now, but ultimately sucks at that price and we don't recommend anyone to buy it. Instead you should continue to hold out or buy a used graphics card. Frankly, the RX 570 4GB for $220 second hand is a significantly better compromise, and hands down the best option for those using a PCIe 3.0 system.\nAs for the new GeForce RTX 3050, we're expecting that part to come in for at least $450, but with the RTX 3060 selling for a 112% premium over MSRP on average, anything is possible. As noted earlier, we strongly believe that the RTX 3050 needs to be priced at around $370 to be a great deal in the current market and become the go-to option for PC gamers.\n\nAt that price it would be unbeatable, even when looking at the second hand market, which sees the similarly performing GTX 1660 Super going for $470. Based on that unfortunate reality though, it's likely that the 3050 will go for something closer to $500.\nIf that's the case, then you're best off being upsold to the RX 6600, or perhaps the smarter option would be to look for a cheaper second hand option to tie you over.\n\nFor now, we'll have to wait and see where the RTX 3050 lands and surely we'll be following up in the coming weeks with a pricing update. But in the meantime, if you have the chance to snap up an RTX 3050 at the MSRP or around $400, that's a good deal in our opinion.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nGeForce RTX 3050 on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3060 on Amazon\nGeForce GTX 1660 Super on Amazon\nRadeon RX 6600 XT on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3070 Ti on Amazon\nRyzen 5 5600X on Amazon\nIntel Core i5-12400 on Amazon\nIntel Core i5-12600K on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 104\n\n\n Got something to say?

Nvidia says graphics card supply will improve in the second half of\u00a02022\nHow much will it\u00a0help?\n\n By Rob Thubron \nJanuary 14, 2022, 5:19\n\n46 comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.\n  TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you\u00a0can\u00a0trust.\n \n\nSomething to look forward to: We're all sick of the GPU market being in such shambles, but could things change this year? Nvidia chief financial officer (CFO) Colette Kress says that the company expects to increase supply of its cards in the second half of 2022, which likely coincides with the arrival of the RTX 4000 'Ada Lovelace' series. \nSpeaking at the virtual 24th Annual Needham Growth Conference (via Seeking Alpha), Kress said that demand for Nvidia's GeForce products far outweighed supply last year, as we know, but team green is optimistic that the situation will improve later this year.\n\"We are working, as we've mentioned, in terms of longer-term, getting that supply. In the second half of calendar '22, we believe we'll be in a great position with our overall supply in terms of our estimations of what we will need going forward,\" Kress explained.\nWhy the sudden increase in GPU supply? The obvious answer would be the arrival of Ampere's successor, codenamed Lovelace---we previously heard that the new series of cards would arrive in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nExpect these to be replaced with RTX 4000 cards later this year\nThis is the second time Kress has claimed Nvidia would improve the supply of its graphics cards in the second half of 2022. At the UBS Global TMT conference last month, the CFO said, \"The company as a whole will take the appropriate work to continue to procure more supply. We've been able to grow quite well during this year, each quarter, sequentially growing. And we do continue to plan to do that for Q4 [...] So we believe we will be in a better situation in terms of supply when we look at the second half of next year.\" \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\n OpenAI rolls out GPT-4.5 to Pro users only, faces shortage of GPU horsepower \n\n\n\nNvidia tends to release a new graphics card family every two years, so we can expect to see the RTX 4000 series in September if it follows that same cadence. Nvidia is rumored to be moving away from Samsung's 8nm node, which it uses for the RTX 3000 series, and tap TSMC's 5nm process node, used by Apple, AMD, and others.\nWe'll have to wait and see if there really is enough supply of RTX 4000 cards to meet consumer demand. TSMC recently committed to spending up to $44 billion on upgrading capacity this year, and lowering demand from miners is obviously a good thing, but scalpers aren't going away anytime soon. Moreover, the supply of RTX 3000 cards could get even tighter if Nvidia puts more focus on producing its latest generation of products.\n\n\n\n\n 46 comments\n \n360 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Defender misidentifies key driver, disrupting popular PC monitoring tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

Though we know that MSRP these days is a non-valid pricing figure, it's still a figure that we can take into perspective to know which market these new products are positioned at. The RTX 3050 is a budget-tier card and is planned for launch on 27th January.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM MemoryAs per reports from Board Channels (via Videocardz), it is reported that NVIDIA partners will have a huge supply of the GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card, even bigger than both RTX 3060 Ti & RTX 3060, combined. It is not stated if this is the launch supply or the immediate after-launch supply that will get the surplus of GPUs but it's likely that since the card launches right in the midst of the Chinese New Year, most orders won't be fulfilled at least 2 weeks after launch. So the surplus of stock could be a way to compensate for the CNY 2022 delay, offering a huge initial stock at launch & resuming that after the Chinese New Year. We will see how this pans out but so far, none of the promises or rumors about availability and pricing being any better have worked in favor of GPU manufacturers.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 8 GB Graphics Card\nJust like the GeForce RTX 3060, the GeForce RTX 3050 will also be featuring the GA106 GPU but a cut-down configuration.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia had a pretty good CES 2022, all things considered. While its keynote presentation on January 4 was a bit hit and miss (we could have done with fewer game trailers and more detailed looks at Nvidia\u2019s hardware), the products that Team Green showed off were warmly received.As soon as Nvidia announced its RTX 3070 Ti and RTX 3080 Ti laptop graphics cards, a slew of powerful new gaming laptops was announced by all the big names. If Nvidia can deliver on its promises, it looks like 2022 is going to be a great year for gaming on a laptop.For many of us, though, the highlight of Nvidia\u2019s show was the reveal of two desktop graphics cards: the affordable RTX 3050 and the ultra-high-end RTX 3090 Ti. But, while most of the excitement was around the (very) brief glimpse we got of the RTX 3090 Ti, I firmly believe the RTX 3050 will prove to be the more important release.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nForget the RTX 5090 \u2013 the RTX 5070 is the best gift Nvidia has given PC gamers in ages\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m suddenly really excited about Nvidia\u2019s new RTX 5090 \u2013 but probably not for the reason you\u2019re expecting\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)Filling a gapFrom what little we know about the RTX 3090 Ti, it will undoubtedly be a very powerful GPU. The current RTX 3090 is the king of gaming GPUs, offering a level of performance that allows it to handle any modern game with all graphical settings whacked up to their fullest, even at 4K.The even more powerful RTX 3090 Ti will only be of interest, then, to people who want the most cutting-edge technology or to push ultra-high resolutions of 8K. With most PC gamers playing at 1080p or 1440p, that kind of power is just not needed.\u00a0Don\u2019t get me wrong; I love that Nvidia is still pushing the envelope in this regard and I definitely can\u2019t wait to plug an RTX 3090 Ti into my 8K monitor. However, Nvidia\u2019s high-end range of GPUs is now looking pretty crowded, with not just the RTX 3090 Ti and RTX 3090, but also the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3080.\u00a0Meanwhile, gamers who don\u2019t need, or can\u2019t afford, a high-end GPU may be feeling a bit neglected by Nvidia. So, the RTX 3050 is very welcome.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.(Image credit: Nvidia)A larger audienceAs Nvidia itself points out in its RTX 3050 announcement, three of the top five GPUs used by PC gamers on Steam are GTX 50 models: the GTX 1050, GTX 1050 Ti and GTX 1650. It\u2019s clear that more affordable GPUs that also offer some of the features and tech found in more expensive graphics cards are way more popular than the ultra-powerful, ultra-expensive high-end cards, which remain resolutely niche.There are many people out there that have been eying up Nvidia\u2019s latest RTX 3000 series GPUs and the advances they bring, including improved ray tracing and DLSS support but have been put off by the high prices. (And that\u2019s before we even get into the whole nightmare that is the current GPU market with stock shortages and inflated prices.)The RTX 3050 should give budget-conscious gamers a chance of getting those RTX 3000 series features, for a much more affordable price of $249 / \u00a3239 (around AU$350). It comes with 8GB GDDR6 memory, 2nd generation RT Cores for ray tracing, and 3rd gen Tensor Cores for DLSS and AI. Nvidia claims you\u2019ll be able to play games with ray tracing on at 60 fps. You\u2019ll also be able to use Nvidia Reflex features to reduce latency.Suddenly, these new features will be opened up to a lot more people. PC gaming should be as accessible as possible, and that\u2019s where the RTX 3050 could play a big part.(Image credit: Shutterstock)DLSS FTWOf the new gaming features the RTX 3050 packs, it\u2019s Nvidia\u2019s DLSS tech that\u2019s going to be the real star. I\u2019ve waxed lyrical before about DLSS, which stands for Deep Learning Super Sampling. It allows compatible GPUs to cleverly upscale game graphics, giving an impressively noticeable boost to performance.In the past, I\u2019ve used DLSS to get the RTX 3090 to play graphically intensive games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Watch Dogs: Legion at huge 8K resolutions and near 60 frames per second. That would have been unimaginable even a few years ago.While that\u2019s impressive, the real magic of DLSS is when it\u2019s used with lower-powered GPUs to allow them to hit higher resolutions and frame rates, while also including graphical effects that the GPU wouldn\u2019t normally be able to.The Nvidia RTX 3050 will support DLSS 2.0 and it\u2019s the perfect candidate for it. Thanks to DLSS, this $250 GPU should be able to hit 1080p resolutions with a decent level of graphical effects, including ray tracing in some titles.If it manages this, then the Nvidia RTX 3050 will be a literal game-changer for a lot of people. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get our hands on it soon to really test it out.Today's best GPU deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $39.99 $34.99View $63ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesCheck out all of TechRadar's CES 2022 coverage\u00a0with reviews, reaction, and analysis of the best new tech we've seen, from 8K TVs and foldable displays to new phones, laptops and smart home gadgets.\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nCES\n\n\nMatt HansonSocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, Core TechMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Core Tech, looking after computing and mobile technology.

It aims to improve image sharpness and quality on GeForce RTX graphics cards, using AI to reduce the performance loss of Nvidia\u2019s existing DSR feature, and it\u2019s now available to install and enable through GeForce Game Ready Driver 511.23.\r\n\n\n\r\nThis is a beefy driver update in general, adding optimisations for God of War as well as some flashy new filters to enable in GeForce Experience (one of them even has a decent crack at spoofing ray traced lighting effects). But if you own one of the best graphics cards from Nvidia\u2019s RTX range, it\u2019s DLDSR that could make best use of its Tensor cores, by rendering games at a higher resolution before \u201cintelligently\u201d shrinking down each frame to fit your monitor\u2019s native res. The result: better-defined details and smoother edges. In theory.\r\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA CES 2022 Special Address\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\r\nStandard DSR already does this, of course, but eats an FPS drop in the process. Nvidia's idea is that DLDSR\u2019s Tensor-enabled AI enhancements can drastically reduce the performance hit that downsampling would normally dish out. I\u2019ll be testing DLDSR in-depth next week to see how true this is in different games, though since the driver is already available, go ahead and try it out yourself if you want. (Update - it is now next week, and I have indeed tested DLDSR. It's pretty good!)\n\n\r\nIntentionally rendering games at higher-than-native resolution might not make much sense if your PC hardware is already struggling to reach 60fps (or 144fps, or whatever your preference is). Indeed, you could argue DSR is only worth having in games where there\u2019s enough performance headroom to justify the loss in frames per second. DLDSR is evidently trying to minimise this tradeoff by keeping the fidelity enhancement while keeping performance as close to pure native level as possible.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nLike Nvidia Image Scaling, DLDSR is driver-level tech, so should work in most games as they are; if it plays by the same rules as DSR, any game that\u2019s compatible with the GeForce Experience app should also work with DLDSR. Below is a quick guide on how to set it up, once you\u2019ve installed Game Ready Driver 511.23 (and assuming you have a compatible graphics card).\r\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nHow to use Nvidia DLDSR\r\n\n\nStep 1: Open up Nvidia Control Panel and click \u201cManage 3D settings\u201d in the left sidebar.\r\n\n\nStep 2: In the list of Global Setttings, scroll down to \u201cDSR \u2013 Factors\u201d and click where it currently reads \u201cOff\u201d. This will bring up a list of rendering resolution options for both DLDSR and standard DSR.\r\n\n\nStep 3: Click one or both of the \u201cDL scaling\u201d options, then \u201cOK\u201d and \u201cApply\u201d.\r\n\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            Amazon are making a God Of War TV show\n          \n\n\n\n            God of War now has AMD FSR 2.0 support on PC\n          \n\n\n\n            A third of PlayStation\u2019s first-party releases will be on PC by 2025, say Sony\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor.

The low-end video card is being positioned to round out the bottom of NVIDIA\u2019s product stack, offering a modern, Ampere-based video card for a more entry-level market. All of this comes as PC video card market still in chaos due to a combination of the chip crunch and crypto miner demand, so any additional cards are most welcome \u2013 and likely to be sucked up rather quickly, even at a MSRP of $249 (and higher).\nThe GeForce RTX 3050 comes as both NVIDIA and AMD are finally addressing the lowest segments of their market stack. AMD launched their Navi 24-based Radeon RX 6500 XT just last week, and now NVIDIA is taking their turn to follow with the RTX 3050. A traditionally lower-margin segment of the video card industry, the low-end desktop cards are typically the last to launch, and that has been particularly the case this generation, as the required production resources have been tied up making higher-end video cards.\nThis is most evident in NVIDIA\u2019s choice of GPU for the desktop RTX 3050. Even though the company launched the laptop versions of the RTX 3050 series almost 8 months ago, and based it on a purpose-built low-end GPU (GA107), NVIDIA isn\u2019t using GA107 for the desktop RTX 3050. Instead, they\u2019re using salvaged GA106 GPUs that didn\u2019t make the cut for use in the RTX 3060, which are then being cut down to a configuration matching the GA107-based laptop parts. Put simply, this means that NVIDIA isn\u2019t allocating any GPU production capacity specifically to the RTX 3050, at least not right now. Instead, the company is relying on their stockpile of salvaged GA106 GPUs, which NVIDIA has been amassing ever since the RTX 3060 launched almost a year ago.\nBut either way you get there, the net result is an RTX 3050. Like it\u2019s existing laptop counterpart, this SKU is aimed at more modest 1080p gaming. I hesitate to call the card \u201centry-level\u201d (despite being at the bottom of the stack) due in part to the overall performance profile and the relatively high TDP of 130W, but if the RTX 3060 is for uncompromised 1080p gaming, then the RTX 3050 is certainly a step down in both performance and in its intended market segment.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nRTX 3060\nRTX 3050\nGTX 1650 Super\nGTX 1650\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n3584\n2560\n1280\n896\n\n\nROPs\n48\n32\n32\n32\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1.78GHz\n1.78GHz\n1725MHz\n1665MHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n15Gbps GDDR6\n14Gbps GDDR6\n12Gbps GDDR6\n8Gbps GDDR5\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n192-bit\n128-bit\n128-bit\n128-bit\n\n\nVRAM\n12GB\n8GB\n4GB\n4GB\n\n\nSingle Precision Perf.\n12.8 TFLOPS\n9.1 TFLOPS\n4.4 TFLOPs\n3 TFLOPS\n\n\nTensor Perf.

This means we\u2019re looking at 2560 CUDA cores spread out over two or three GPCs within the GA106 die. Relative to the RTX 3060, NVIDIA isn\u2019t touching the clockspeed ranges here, so the card gets the same 1.78GHz boost clock rating as its bigger sibling. Though I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the RTX 3050 maintain slightly higher clockspeeds in practice, especially on cards that are reusing designs for the more power-hungry RTX 3060.\n\nIn terms of performance expectations and on-paper throughput, the RTX 3050 is basically two-thirds of an RTX 3060. This means it can offer 66% of the pixel throughput on the ROPs, while shading/compute/texturing performance is a bit higher at around 71% of the RTX 3060\u2019s performance. Though in either case it should be leaps and bounds ahead of the RTX 3050\u2019s predecessor, the GTX 1650.\nThe two-thirds rule also applies to RTX 3050\u2019s memory bus, which is cut down from 192-bits wide to 128-bits wide. NVIDIA has paired this with 8GB of relatively common 14Gbps GDDR6 memory, which gives the RTX 3050 a total memory bandwidth of 224GB/second. Notably, this does mean that relative to the RTX 3060, the single biggest hit to the RTX 3050 is to memory bandwidth, as this is just 62% of the bigger card\u2019s memory bandwidth.\nMeanwhile TDPs have also been scaled down accordingly with the weaker hardware. Whereas RTX 3060 was a 170W TDP card, RTX 3050 is a 130W card. On a historical basis this is quite high for an NVIDIA 50-series card \u2013 you can forget about any configurations that don\u2019t rely on an external PCIe power plug \u2013 but that comes with the territory of using a relatively beefy GPU like GA106. RTX 3050 is functionally more of a second-tier RTX 3060, and it shows with things like TDP.\nMore unexpectedly, the PCIe bus width has also been scaled down for this part. While GA106 supports a PCIe 4.0 x16 bus, NVIDIA is only offering a x8 link here. It should not make much (if any) of a performance difference, but it underscores the fact that RTX 3050 was meant to be a GA107-based card. Consequently, by reducing every spec to something GA107 can do, NVIDIA is keeping the door open to swapping in GA107 at a later date, should market conditions make producing more GA107 dies more favorable.\nFinally, like the rest of NVIDIA\u2019s current-generation RTX 30 series cards, the RTX 3050 implements the company\u2019s Ethereum hash rate limiter (LHR), which is designed to artificially cap the mining performance of the card. Coming up on a year since LHR was first introduced, it\u2019s been a modest victory for NVIDIA (driver snafus excluded), however miners have been able to chip away at its effects. As it stands the RTX 3050 has a decent amount of memory bandwidth and enough VRAM (8GB) to handle Ethereum mining, so unlike last week\u2019s Radeon RX 6500 XT, I\u2019m not writing it off for mining duties.\nPartner Cards, Product Positioning, & Availability\nAs with the RTX 3060, NVIDIA is not producing a reference (Founder\u2019s Edition) RTX 3050 this time around. So this week\u2019s launch is a pure virtual launch, as NVIDIA likes to call it, with their add-in board partners hitting the ground running with their own designs.\nGiven the reuse of GA106, expect to see most (if not all) of the AIBs also reuse their RTX 3060 board designs. As is typical for these sort of second-tier cards, there\u2019s little need to put together new board designs, and reusing existing boards is a big part of what allows AIB to get cards out in volume early in a virtual launch. Consequently, expect to see the usual mix of dual and triple fan cooled cards, with a heavy emphasis on factory overclocked cards.\n\nGallery: Zotac GAMING GeForce RTX 3050 Twin Edge OC\nAnd since NVIDIA doesn\u2019t have a reference card of their own, it\u2019s been NVIDIA\u2019s AIBs that have been sampling cards directly to the press. Our sample, Zotac\u2019s GAMING GeForce RTX 3050 Twin Edge OC, is a very typical example of these cards. Zotac is offering versions of the card with and without factory overclocks, with the factory overclocked version set to come at a pricing premium. As we\u2019ve seen with the RTX 3060 before it, don\u2019t be too surprised to see AIBs focus more on factory overclocked cards for that reason.\nMeanwhile in terms of product positioning, the launch of the RTX 3050 rounds out the bottom of NVIDIA\u2019s product stack. The company rarely announces when cards are discontinued, so it\u2019s not clear if NVIDIA has ramped down production of low-end GTX 16 series cards. The RTX 3050 is significantly more powerful than any of the GTX 1650 series cards \u2013 and even edges out some of the 1660 cards \u2013 so even if GTX 16 series production continues, those cards are definitely getting knocked down a peg this week. And for NVIDIA\u2019s product marketing efforts, the company can now focus on a completely holistic RTX 30 series product stack.\nAs for competitive positioning, the RTX 3050 occupies a bit of an odd space in no-man\u2019s land relative to AMD\u2019s offerings. The card is well ahead of the RX 6500 XT, but also well behind the RX 6600 (often splitting the difference), so the RTX 3050 isn\u2019t an especially direct competitor to either card. And if we were in a world where MSRPs meant something, that would be reflected by NVIDIA pricing the card $50 (25%) above the RX 6500 XT. Among current generation cards, at least, the RTX 3050 seems set to occupy a niche of its own with regards to performance.\nThis also makes it very hard to predict street pricing, however. The bulk of pricing in the current video card market is being driven by Ethereum mining performance/profitability, and as a mining-capable card, the RTX 3050 is unlikely to be any different. So like the rest of NVIDIA\u2019s RTX 30 series product stack, I don\u2019t expect street prices for the RTX 3050 to stabilize anywhere close to the MSRP. RTX 3060 cards are going for north of $600, so two-thirds of an RTX 3060 could easily end up being a $400 card \u2013 if not more due to competing demand from actual consumers.\nThe upshot is that the additional card volume from the launch of the RTX 3050 means that NVIDIA and its AIBs are putting that many more cards on the market, where every last bit helps to satiate demand that much more. So like the launch of the RX 6500 XT last week, even the launch of a low-end video card can be a big help in getting video cards into the hands of hungry PC users. In that respect, it\u2019s a given that the RTX 3050 will sell out; the only real question is at what price.\nRetail sales for the GeForce RTX 3050 will start tomorrow, January 27th. And like the other video card launches in the past year, we expect to see them sell out quickly. So good hunting.\n\n\n\nQ1 2022 GPU Product Lineups\n\t\t\t(Theoretical MSRPs, Please See eBay For Street Pricing)\n\n\nAMD\nPrice\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\u00a0\nN/A\nGeForce RTX 3090 Ti\n\n\n\u00a0\n$1499\nGeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\u00a0\n$1199\nGeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n\n\n\u00a0\nN/A\nGeForce RTX 3080 12GB\n\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XT\n$999\n\u00a0\n\n\nRadeon RX 6800 XT\n$649/$699\nGeForce RTX 3080\n\n\nRadeon RX 6800\n$579/$599\nGeForce RTX 3070 Ti\n\n\nRadeon RX 6700 XT\n$479/$499\nGeForce RTX 3070\n\n\nRadeon RX 6600 XT\n$379/$399\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti\n\n\nRadeon RX 6600\n$329\nGeForce RTX 3060\n\n\n\u00a0\n$249\nGeForce RTX 3050\n\n\nRadeon RX 6500 XT\n$199\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n44 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\ndwillmore - Wednesday, January 26, 2022 - link\nSo, this is a new GF9600GSO?\n\n\n\nmeacupla - Wednesday, January 26, 2022 - link\nPros: It's not good at mining, and it's not a RX6500XTCons: It's still mighty expensive for something that barely does 1080p gaming\n\n\n\nmeacupla - Sunday, January 30, 2022 - link\nspoke too soon, it's good at mining.

Normally Nvidia would not go below 3072 cuda cores for such a gpu, and Nvidia already cuts down more than AMD. It really makes you wonder if there is an issue with Samsung 8lpp, especially when Nvidia chose to launch a GA 106 RTX 3050 instead of a GA 107 RTX 3050 with specialty models using the GA 106 gpu.\n\n\n\nSpunjji - Monday, January 31, 2022 - link\nIt's possible, but I think it's more likely that this is an Emergency Edition designed primarily to shit up the launch of the 6500 XT. It seems to have worked - people are praising this for being ~20% faster, while it's often 80%+ more expensive and doesn't appear to be available in any reasonable quantities, ergo there probably aren't a lot of GA106 dies that are defective enough (and yet there are /some/, which is not a great look).\n\n\n\nOxford Guy - Monday, January 31, 2022 - link\nThe 6500 is so bad that Nvidia didn\u2019t have to do more than release something competent.\n\n\n\nTheinsanegamerN - Tuesday, February 1, 2022 - link\nIt's MSRP is only $250 vs $200 for the 6500xt, and it's ~20% faster, int he most AMD favoring benchmarks.

Unfortunately, that also means there's not a snowball's chance in hell that it won't sell for radically inflated prices. It lands between the previous-gen RTX 2060 and GTX 1660 Super, both of which currently sell for far more than Nvidia's asking price.

On paper, there aren't any major compromises to speak of, and the launch price falls squarely into the mainstream market at $249. Unfortunately, GPU prices are still extremely inflated, and while cryptocurrency prices have plummeted, that doesn't mean we'll see reasonable prices on the best graphics cards any time soon. But setting aside real-world pricing and supply, how does the RTX 3050 stack up to the competition?\n\nThankfully, Nvidia hasn't put the Ampere architecture on the chopping block to create the desktop RTX 3050. While the GA107 used in mobile RTX 3050 Ti and RTX 3050 only uses an x8 PCIe interface, the desktop RTX 3050 uses the larger GA106 chip and includes full PCIe 4.0 x16 connectivity, along with full support for all the latest video codecs. It also includes 8GB of GDDR6 memory, though on a narrower 128-bit interface than the RTX 3060. Here's the full specs overview of Nvidia's RTX 3050, along with some competing GPUs.Swipe to scroll horizontallyGraphics CardRTX 3050RTX 2060GTX 1650 SuperRX 6500 XTArchitectureGA106TU106TU116Navi 24Process TechnologySamsung 8NTSMC 12FFNTSMC 12FFNTSMC N6Transistors (Billion)1210.86.65.4Die size (mm^2)276445284107SMs / CUs20302016GPU Cores2560192012801024Tensor Cores80240N/AN/ART Cores2030N/A16Boost Clock (MHz)1777168017252815VRAM Speed (Gbps)14141218VRAM (GB)8644VRAM Bus Width12819212864ROPs48484832TMUs801208064TFLOPS FP32 (Boost)9.16.54.45.8TFLOPS FP16 (Tensor)36 (73)52N/AN/ABandwidth (GBps)224336192144Board Power (Watts)130160100107Launch DateJanuary 2022January 2019November 2019January 2022Official Launch MSRP$249 $349 $159 $199 Along with the RTX 3050, we've included the RTX 2060, GTX 1650 Super, and RX 6500 XT as points of reference. The official launch prices are obviously a bit of a joke right now, with most of these cards costing 50\u2013100% more than the suggested values, but that's not likely to change any time soon. A key difference between the RTX 3050 and its nominal predecessors, the GTX 1650 and GTX 1650 Super, is that the 3050 adds RT and Tensor cores to the mix. That brings Nvidia's ray tracing and DLSS support to a new tier of hardware, and like all Ampere GPUs, these are second-gen RT and third-gen Tensor cores.\n\nOf course, that makes performance comparisons between the old and new GPUs sort of pointless in some cases. For example, Nvidia showed how RTX 3050 with RT and DLSS delivered performance compared to the GTX 1650, GTX 1050 Ti, and GTX 1050. So naturally, those GPUs all scored zero in RT and DLSS tests since they can't run either one. Meanwhile, the GTX 1660 series can support ray tracing (in some games) but still lacks Tensor hardware. So, in effect, every GTX GPU scores zero on RT + DLSS performance, and the same applies to all AMD GPUs. That's not a particularly helpful comparison.\n\nOne interesting item to note is the die size for the various chips. Nvidia hasn't revealed a die size for the (currently) laptop-only GA107, but GA106 ends up roughly the same size as the TU116 chip used in the GTX 16-series cards, and 150% larger than AMD's tiny Navi 24. Some of that is thanks to TSMC's N6 process, and the cost per square mm for TSMC N6 is certainly higher than Samsung 8N, but die size definitely favors AMD.\n\nAt the same time, we've already said we think AMD went too far in cutting features and specs to keep the Navi 24 chip as small as possible. Look at all the other specs and RTX 3050 should easily dominate over AMD's RX 6500 XT, and it might even give the RX 6600 some competition at times. We'll have the RX 6600 in our performance charts, along with some other current and previous-gen GPUs. One thing to keep an eye on is how the RTX 3050 compares to the RTX 2060. It has quite a bit less bandwidth but also more compute performance. RTX 2060 will be faster for mining purposes (not necessarily a good thing) as well, which means the RTX 3050 will likely end up in the hands of more gamers going forward.\n\nObviously, real-world pricing and availability will be the deciding factors for any current graphics card purchase. Nvidia told us it has been working to build up inventory before launching its new GPUs, and it knows the RTX 3050 will be in very high demand thanks to its lower price. It's still going to sell out, but hopefully we'll see a decent number of cards available at reasonable prices with tomorrow's launch. However, once the initial supply gets cleared out, we'll have to wait and see how things develop going forward.AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT at Amazon for $216.30EVGA GeForce RTX 3050 XC BlackImage 1 of 9(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)For our launch review, Nvidia provided us with an EVGA RTX 3050 XC Black\u2026 except, it sort of didn't. Officially, the XC Black runs at reference clocks, meaning a boost clock of 1777MHz. EVGA inadvertently put the non-Black 3050 XC Gaming VBIOS on the card, which gave it a modest factory overclock to 1845MHz boost clock. EVGA did send a corrected VBIOS, and we have now retested everything, but the initial data used the overclocked results.\n\nFundamentally, we're not particularly concerned with receiving a factory overclocked card. AMD sent us factory-overclocked RX 6600 XT, RX 6600, and RX 6500 XT cards. Nvidia has also sent some factory overclocked GPUs in the past. The performance difference between the XC Gaming and XC Black should only be about 2\u20133%, and not surprisingly, the XC Black ran just fine at the XC clocks. You could certainly manually overclock just about any RTX 3050 card to similar levels. If you're looking at this review and wondering if you should buy the XC Black, the only thing you really need to know is that performance is slightly lower than what we show here, and power consumption is also a tiny bit lower.\n\nThe XC Black comes with a suggested starting price of $249, meaning it will likely be available for that price in limited quantities for the launch tomorrow. After the initial launch, all bets are off. We also have a Zotac RTX 3050 Twin Edge OC (1807MHz boost clock), and we're working on testing that and will post that review in the near future. We have a pricing table in our conclusion that will certainly raise some eyebrows, if you were hoping for more cards selling at the $249 base price.\n\nThe RTX 3050 GPU doesn't require a lot in the way of power or cooling, and as a baseline design, the EVGA XC Black trims most of the extras you'll find on higher-cost models. There's no RGB lighting, and the card has two 87mm EVGA fans \u2014 it's essentially identical in appearance to the RTX 3060 EVGA card, except with less VRAM and fewer GPU cores. The card doesn't include a backplate, but there are still three DisplayPort 1.4a connections and a single HDMI 2.1 port, which is standard for just about every recent GPU introduction other than AMD's RX 6500 XT.\n\nThe card measures 202x110x38mm, only slightly longer than an x16 PCIe slot and also smaller than the XFX RX 6500 XT we reviewed. There's a single 8-pin PEG power connector that should provide more than enough power for the RTX 3050, and any power from the PCIe slot is just gravy. Interestingly, the XC Black weighs 527g, about 125g lighter than the EVGA RTX 3060. Some of that comes from the two extra memory chips on the 3060, but it also has a slightly reworked heatsink with two fewer copper heatpipes (not that the GPU really needs them).\u00a0(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Test Setup for GeForce RTX 3050TOM'S HARDWARE 2022 GPU TEST PCIntel Core i9-12900K\nMSI Pro Z690-A WiFi DDR4\nCorsair 2x16GB DDR4-3600 CL16\nCrucial P5 Plus 2TB\nCooler Master MWE 1250 V2 Gold\nCooler Master PL360 Flux\nCooler Master HAF500\nWindows 11 Pro 64-bitAs discussed in our Radeon RX 6500 XT review, we've recently updated our GPU test PC and gaming suite. We're now using a Core i9-12900K processor, paired with a DDR4 motherboard (because DDR5 is nearly impossible to buy and ludicrously expensive right now). We also upgraded to Windows 11 Pro, since it's basically required to get the most out of Alder Lake. You can see the rest of the hardware in the boxout.\n\nBesides the change in hardware, we've also updated our gaming test suite, focusing on newer and more demanding games. While we could include various esports games and lighter fare, we don't feel that's particularly useful. Just about any GPU can handle games like CS:GO, for example. Instead, we're pushing the GPU to its limits to see how the various cards fare.\n\nWe've selected seven games and test at four settings: 1080p \"medium\" (or thereabouts) and 1080p/1440p/4K \"ultra\" (basically maxed out settings except for SSAA). We'll only test at settings that make sense for the hardware, however, so for example we didn't test the RTX 3050 at 4K ultra. We intend to run every card at 1080p medium and ultra, as those will be used for determining ranking in our GPU hierarchy. We'll also include results with DLSS for the card being reviewed, in games that support the technology.\n\nThe games we're using for the coming year are Borderlands 3, Far Cry 6, Flight Simulator, Forza Horizon 5, Horizon Zero Dawn, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Watch Dogs Legion. Six of the seven games use DirectX 12 for the API, with RDR2 being the sole Vulkan representative. We didn't include any DX11 testing because, frankly, most modern games are opting for DX12 instead. We'll revisit and revamp the testing regimen over the coming year as needed, but this is what we're going with for now.\n\nAlong with our standard suite of games, we have a separate suite of games that support ray tracing. We'll be including performance testing with the same 1080p \"medium\" and 1080p/1440p/4K \"ultra\" settings, but with ray tracing enabled \u2014 again, where it makes sense for the particular GPU. Our DXR (DirectX Raytracing) test suite uses the following games: Bright Memory Infinite, Control Ultimate Edition, Cyberpunk 2077, Fortnite, Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition, and Minecraft. We want to provide apples-to-apples comparisons, so we're testing without DLSS (or FSR or NIS) enabled as our baseline, though on RTX cards like the 3050, we'll also show performance using DLSS quality mode.GeForce RTX 3050 Gaming PerformancePlease note: Our XC Black came with a boost clock of 1845MHz, not the reference boost clock of 1777MHz. We've now included both the original (overclocked) results as \"EVGA XCG\" along with reference clocked results.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3050 focuses primarily on 1080p gaming, though unlike the RX 6500 XT, it can generally stretch to ultra settings and even manage 1440p at playable (>30 fps) framerates. Naturally, any less demanding games or settings should run even better than what we'll show in our charts, but we prefer to focus more on a \"worst-case scenario\" for gaming performance over using games that just about any GPU can run. We'll start with our 1080p medium testing.Image 1 of 8(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Straight out of the gate, it's obvious the RTX 3050 performs significantly better than the RX 6500 XT, even at modest settings. It's a decent step up in performance relative to the GTX 1660 Super as well, which also easily outperformed AMD's newcomer. (Note that the GTX 1660 Ti and GTX 1660 Super perform nearly identically in all of our previous testing.) The only serious competition will come in the form of higher tier GPUs like the RTX 3060 and RX 6600, though the RTX 2060 and RX 5600 XT also delivered slightly better performance, thanks in no small part to having 192-bit memory interfaces.\n\nOverall, the RTX 3050 averaged 98 fps across our new test suite, at settings that won't strain the 8GB of VRAM. It was 26% faster than AMD's RX 6500 XT, 69% faster than the previous generation GTX 1650, and 56% faster than the two-generations-old GTX 1060 6GB, but it only beat the GTX 1660 Super by 6%. At the same time, the RTX 2060 was 9% faster than the RTX 3050, the RTX 3060 beat it by 33%, the RX 5600 XT averaged out to 18% faster as well, and the RX 6600 was 41% faster. (And as a quick side note, the \"overclocked\" original VBIOS was indeed 2.4% faster overall.)\n\nIn other words, the RTX 3050 doesn't radically change the status quo. If the supply of GPUs was relatively \"normal,\" the 3050 would slot in just below the three-years-old RTX 2060 6GB. On the other hand, if the supply chain and other factors weren't happening, this might have been a $199 or $229 card instead of starting at a hypothetical $249.\n\nNaturally, there's a wider spread in performance when we look at the individual games. Compared to the RX 6500 XT, the closest AMD got was in Flight Simulator, where the 3050 was only 16% faster. Far Cry 6, Forza Horizon 5, and Red Dead Redemption 2 were all 22\u201323% faster on the 3050, while the biggest lead was in Borderlands 3, with the 3050 beating the 6500 XT by 44%. That's largely because Borderlands 3 likes having more memory and memory bandwidth, even when using the 1080p medium preset.\n\nYou can also see how much DLSS quality mode improves performance, even at these relatively low settings. HZD was 20% faster, RDR2 improved by 9%, and WDL ran 24% faster. That last result puts the RTX 3050 just behind the RTX 3050 and RX 6600.\n\nNow let's turn up the heat a bit and see what happens.Image 1 of 8(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The RX 6500 XT and other cards with only 4GB VRAM can really struggle at ultra settings in many modern games, but the RTX 3050 continues to perform quite well. Average performance across our test suite was still 58 fps, though only Far Cry 6 and Horizon Zero Dawn managed to exceed 60 fps. Perhaps more importantly, the RTX 3050 beat AMD's RX 6500 XT by 53% and increased its lead over other GPUs with 4GB VRAM. Sticking with the current generation \"budget\" GPU focus, the RTX 3050 was anywhere from 28% faster than the 6500 XT (in HZD) to as much as 95% faster (Forza Horizon 5).\n\nOf course, it's not all sunshine and roses. Yes, the RTX 3050 can run circles around the RX 6500 XT, but it came in slightly behind the old RTX 2060, and if you're willing to forego ray tracing hardware, the RX 5600 XT was 14% faster. It also trailed the RTX 3060 by 26%, and the RX 6600 was 36% faster. While it's not perfect scaling going from the 3050 to the 3060, the 3060 has 50% more memory, 61% more memory bandwidth, and 40% more compute. That works out to 36% higher performance at 1080p ultra.\n\nThis isn't to say that you should run 1080p ultra settings on many of the GPUs in our charts, but at least with the RTX 3050 and faster cards, you can legitimately do so without killing performance. While running at less than 60 fps isn't ideal, it's still definitely playable, and none of the tested games had minimums that consistently fell below 30 fps. DLSS was also able to boost performance by 29% in HZD, 10% in RDR2, and WDL ran 23% faster.\n\nBut there's still a bit of gas in the RTX 3050's tank\u2026Image 1 of 8(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Okay, 1440p ultra definitely isn't the sweet spot for the RTX 3050, but while most of the other cards dropped well below 30 fps (1660 Super and above being required to remain \"playable\"), the RTX 3050 averaged 44 fps. In fact, it averaged over 30 fps in all seven of the games in our test suite. If you feel like beating a dead horse, it's also more than twice as fast as the RX 6500 XT this time.\n\nDLSS starts to make even more sense at 1440p ultra, though the gains aren't any better. HZD performance improved by 21% this time, RDR2 showed its largest gains but still only 12%, and WDL wins out with the biggest improvement so far in our DLSS testing, with 33% higher performance. That was enough to overtake both the RX 5600 XT and RX 6600, and just a few percent behind the RTX 3060 (which of course could run with DLSS as well).\n\nNot counting DLSS, the RTX 3050 is also the slowest of the mainstream graphics cards that we tested. Even at 1440p ultra, the RTX 2060 still eked out a 5% lead, and in the individual game charts, the 3050 only beat the 2060 in Forza Horizon 5 and Watch Dogs Legion, both games that are known to like having 8GB of VRAM or more. The RX 5600 XT was 15% faster as well, the RX 6600 came out 28% ahead, and the RTX 3060 ended up 37% faster than the 3050.GeForce RTX 3050 Ray Tracing PerformanceAs an RTX card, ray tracing performance is something to consider, and we tested DLSS on the RTX 3050 as well (in quality mode where applicable, though Minecraft selects its own setting). RT hardware is basically required to run the expanded test suite (GTX 10/16-series cards with 6GB or more VRAM can try to run RT in most of the games in our DXR suite), but with a bit more time, we've now managed to collect performance results from some competing GPUs and have charts. (Yay for charts! Who doesn't love these things?)\n\nAs we've stated previously, while games with simpler forms of RT that only use one effect (typically shadows) exist, we don't find the often miniscule visual gains to be worth the performance penalty. In some cases, like Dirt 5, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and World of WarCraft, it's hard to tell the difference, even if you're specifically staring at the shadows. As a result, our RT test suite uses games that all include multiple RT effects.\n\nIncidentally, the RX 6500 XT wouldn't even let us try to run at our selected RT settings in Control or Fortnite, likely due to only having 4GB VRAM, resulting in a score of \"0\" for now. The RX 6600 successfully launched Fortnite with our \"DXR medium\" settings, but it also crashed repeatedly during attempted benchmarking (note that the RX 6600 previously ran Fortnite just fine). We assume there are some driver issues to work out, but we did manage to collect some data for the game.Image 1 of 7(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Image 1 of 7(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)While we tested DXR with both medium and ultra settings, the latter mostly proves too much for the RTX 3050. Sure, it breaks 30 fps with DLSS in all of the games, but generally speaking, the RTX 3050 hardware is intended for medium to high settings with ray tracing enabled. Therefore, we'll focus the rest of the discussion on the DXR medium results.\n\nOnce again, the RTX 3050 ends up being slightly slower than the RTX 2060, even in ray tracing games. At 1080p medium, the best it can do is a tie in Cyberpunk 2077. That officially makes this the slowest desktop RTX card, by about 7%. But while that might seem bad, you only need to look at the RX 6500 XT, or even the RX 6600, to see just how bad things can get.\n\nThe RTX 3050 averaged 40 fps across our demanding DXR test suite at native 1080p. Using the same settings, even if we discount the failed attempts at two of the games, the RX 6500 was still 60\u201380% slower. In other words, the RTX 3050 was typically more than three times as fast in games with more than a token amount of RT effects.\n\nThe RTX 3050 also beat the RX 6600 in DXR performance by 10%, and turning on DLSS only makes things look worse. DLSS quality mode improved the RTX 3050's performance by 60% on average (and 70% at our ultra settings), making the RTX 3050 potentially 75\u201395% faster than the RX 6600. Interestingly, without DLSS, AMD's RX 6600 did notch one victory in Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition, where it was 10\u201315% faster.\n\nIf you're at all interested in giving ray tracing games a shot but you want to keep costs as low as possible, the RTX 3050 is a good effort. The RTX 2060 still delivered better performance overall, but it's certainly possible to get playable framerates in all of the major RT-enabled games, particularly if the game supports DLSS.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)GeForce RTX 3050 Power, Temps, Noise, Etc.The GeForce RTX 3050 has an official TDP (board power) rating of 130W. We tested with the original and corrected \"reference clocks\" VBIOS, but thought it would be interesting to include both results here. We're using our Powenetics testing equipment and procedures to measure in-line GPU power consumption and other aspects of the cards. We collect data while running Metro Exodus at 1080p/1440p ultra (whichever uses more power) and run the FurMark stress test at 1600x900. Our test PC remains the same old Core i9-9900K as we've used previously, as it's not a power bottleneck at all.Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Power usage is one of the RTX 3050's few disadvantages relative to the RX 6500 XT. The EVGA RTX 3050 averaged 124W of power during the Metro Exodus benchmark loop, compared to just 90W for the 6500 XT. Of course, it also provided substantially better performance, but potentially some PCs with weaker power supplies might benefit \u2014 though if that's the case, we'd recommend upgrading your PSU as well as your GPU. Meanwhile, FurMark's power use was slightly higher at 134W on average. Interestingly, the XC VBIOS only made a 3.4W difference in gaming and almost no difference at all in FurMark.Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Clock speeds for both the reference-clocked VBIOS and the XC VBIOS end up quite a bit higher than the official boost clock, which is typical of Nvidia GPUs. The reference VBIOS still averages 1927MHz throughout the Metro Exodus test, and the XC VBIOS clocked in at 1994MHz, 67MHz higher and almost exactly in line with the difference in official boost clocks (1MHz off). Clock speeds were over 200MHz lower in FurMark, but that's also expected behavior. The difference in clock speeds between the two VBIOS versions was again almost exactly equal to the difference in boost clock rating \u2014 63MHz this time, compared to the 68MHz difference in specs.Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The RTX 3050 doesn't require a ton of power, which means it also doesn't generate a lot of heat or require high fan speeds. Temperatures maxed out at around 60C for the reference-clocked card, weighed in at 62C for the XC VBIOS in FurMark, and were about 1C lower in Metro Exodus. Fan speeds showed a slightly larger gap, with the reference card sitting at 1818 RPM on average compared to 1918 RPM for the XC VBIOS in Metro. FurMark bumped the fan speed up another 60-70 RPM.\n\nAlong with the Powenetics data, we also measure noise levels at 10cm using an SPL (sound pressure level) meter. It's aimed right at the GPU fans to minimize the impact of other fans like those on the CPU cooler. The noise floor of our test environment and equipment measures 33 dB(A), and the EVGA RTX 3050 reached a peak noise level of 45.3 dB during testing, with a fan speed of 71%. That's typical of EVGA's budget-oriented cards, opting for higher fan speeds with weaker heatsinks and compromising a bit on noise levels. It's not that the card is loud, but it's certainly louder than some of the other mainstream cards we've tested. We also tested with a static fan speed of 75%, at which point the card generated 48.4 dB of noise, and in warmer environments, it's entirely possible for the card to exceed that value.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)GeForce RTX 3050: Good in Theory\u2026There are two ways to look at the GeForce RTX 3050: How it's ostensibly supposed to stack up to the competition, and what it looks like in the real world. Let's start with the former.\n\nThe RTX 3050 brings all of Nvidia's RTX features to a new, lower price point. Technically, we saw RTX 2060 cards bottom out at around $270 back in the day (from mid-2019 to early 2020), but the lowest MSRP was still $299. However, the 3050's lower price does come with slightly lower performance, except in a few instances where the extra 2GB VRAM comes into play, at which point the RTX 3050 can basically tie the RTX 2060.\n\nThe real saving grace for all of the RTX cards continues to be DLSS. With or without ray tracing, DLSS can provide a nice boost to performance with virtually no loss in image fidelity. We only tested DLSS in our DXR test suite, but it's also supported in quite a few games that lack ray tracing, like Red Dead Redemption 2, God of War, and many others. AMD's FSR isn't really a direct competitor, either. It competes more with Nvidia's Image Scaling, or at least, Radeon Super Resolution does \u2014 it can all get a bit confusing. In short, DLSS quality mode wins out on image quality and does things that FSR, NIS, and RSR can't. Maybe Intel's XeSS will be able to directly compete with DLSS at some point, but DLSS has a significant head start on game developer adoption.\n\nIn theory, then, the RTX 3050 looks like a good option. It's basically the same price as the previous-gen GTX 1660 Super, offers ray tracing and DLSS support (along with Nvidia Broadcast and any other Nvidia technologies that can use the RT or Tensor cores), gives you 2GB more VRAM, and performance is typically 10\u201315% faster. So if you could buy the RTX 3050 for $249, it's certainly a reasonable option. Which brings us to the practical aspects of this review.Swipe to scroll horizontallyGeForce RTX 3050 Launch ProductsBrandProduct NamePriceAsusROG-STRIX-RTX3050-O8G-GAMING$489 AsusDUAL-RTX3050-O8G$439 AsusPH-RTX3050-8G$249 EVGAXC GAMING$329 EVGAXC BLACK GAMING$249 GigabyteGV-N3050GAMING OC-8GD$379 GigabyteGV-N3050EAGLE OC-8GD$349 GigabyteGV-N3050EAGLE-8GD$249 MSIRTX 3050 Gaming X 8G$379 MSIRTX 3050 Ventus 2X 8G OC$349 MSIRTX 3050 Aero ITX 8G$249 ZotacTwin Edge OC$399 ZotacTwin Edge$249 The GeForce RTX 3050 officially goes on sale tomorrow, January 27. We've already seen advance listings pop up with prices that are nowhere near the \"recommended\" $249, and in some cases, prices are $400 or more. We'll see how things shake out over the coming weeks and months, but when the GTX 1660 Super has a current average selling price of $475 on eBay during the past week \u2014 and that's after the recent drop in GPU prices that we've noticed \u2014 there's little reason to expect the RTX 3050 to sell at substantially lower prices. If the miners don't nab them, the bots and scalpers probably will.\n\nYou can see the above table of \"official\" launch prices from Nvidia's various add-in card partners. Every one of them has a card with a $249 price point, but the jump from there to the overclocked cards ranges from as little as $80 for the EVGA XC Gaming to a whopping $240 gap for the Asus Strix card. Considering EVGA inadvertently proved there's little difference between the XC Gaming and XC Black other than the VBIOS, you probably don't want to spend a ton of extra money on the typically modest factory overclocks.\n\nFor Nvidia's partners, it's clear that if they can successfully overclock a chip and sell it for more money, they would much rather sell a $349 or $489 card than a $249 model in a market where every card gets sold. We've seen this in the past, like the EVGA RTX 2080 Ti Black that was one of the few 2080 Ti cards with an official price of $999. They were almost never in stock, and most 2080 Ti models sold at $1,199 or more (the Founders Edition's price).\n\nFundamentally, it all goes back to supply and demand. Even if the RTX 3050 isn't great for mining \u2014 and in the current market, it most certainly isn't, averaging just 22MH/s in Ethereum, which would net a mere $0.60 per day at current prices \u2014 there are far too many other people looking to upgrade their PCs. The supply of the RTX 3050 at launch might be okay (it will still sell out in minutes), but it still uses the same GA106 chip as the RTX 3060, and we don't expect long-term supply to be any better than that card. As with the AIC partners, why would Nvidia want to sell GA106 chips in a nominally $249 card if it can put those same chips into a $329 card?\n\nGiven that the performance generally ends up being worse than the RTX 2060 and RX 6600, those cards should represent a practical ceiling on RTX 3050 prices. That doesn't bode well since both of those currently average around $510 on eBay. How much should you actually pay for an RTX 3050, if you're interested in buying one? That depends in part on how badly you need it, but we'd try to keep things under $350 as an upper limit. If you can't find the card for less than that, you should probably just wait.\n\nWhatever you choose to do, let's also not forget that Ada Lovelace (we've heard it referred to by both the first and last name), a.k.a. the RTX 40-series, will likely land this fall. Nvidia will probably start with the top-tier parts like the RTX 4090 and 4080 rather than looking at the budget and mainstream parts, but AMD is also working on RDNA3. With both slated to use TSMC's N5 process, supply may or may not be any better than the current GPUs, but we expect a decent performance jump. Depending on where prices go between now and the fall, sitting out the current generation of GPUs isn't a bad idea at this stage.MORE:\u00a0Best Graphics CardsMORE:\u00a0GPU Benchmarks and HierarchyMORE:\u00a0All Graphics ContentAMD Radeon RX 6500 XT: Price Comparison $216.30ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nEVGA\nGeForce\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (11)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

In fact, I will be very surprised if the 128 EU/Vector Engine cards (assuming they have 4GB VRAM) can actually beat the RX 6500 XT. We'll know in the next couple of months, but the design sort of feels like beefed up Intel GPU with really weak RT capabilities plus some tensor cores for XeSS. Probably designed more for datacenter but then funneled over into the consumer sector. Raw 64-bit and 128-bit compute might be better than anything AMD and Nvidia offer for the price, but in games, FP64 and FP128 are totally irrelevant.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvalidError\n\n\nJarredWaltonGPU said:Probably designed more for datacenter but then funneled over into the consumer sector.

On Tuesday morning, Nvidia quietly and surprisingly launched a new 12GB version of GeForce RTX 3080 that fixes our biggest (albeit minor) gripe with an otherwise stellar graphics card.\nThe 10GB of VRAM on the original RTX 3080 felt somewhat lacking right out of the gate, as games like Doom already chew up immense amounts of memory with every graphics knob cranked at 4K resolution. It probably wouldn\u2019t be something you\u2019d have to worry about in most games soon, but the new version\u2019s 12GB of GDDR6X completely alleviates any potential concerns. Nvidia also expanded the memory bus width in this model from 320-bit to 384-bit, which helps boost overall memory bandwidth to 912GB/s, up from 760GB/s in the original.\n\n\nNvidia also tweaked the GPU configuration of the new 12GB RTX 3080, bumping the CUDA graphics core count from 8704 in the original to 8960 now. That, combined with the upgraded memory, should make the 12GB RTX 3080 just a wee bit faster than the original, though we would\u2019ve preferred that Nvidia gave this card a slightly different name (like RTX 3080 Super) given the small-but-key GPU tweaks.\nDon\u2019t bother trying to hunt down a Founders Edition version of this graphics card. Nvidia told PCWorld to contact board vendors (like EVGA, Asus, MSI, et cetera) for more product information\u2014including pricing. Yes, Nvidia didn\u2019t even slap an official MSRP on this bad boy. Gulp. The original 10GB version ostensibly retailed for $700 but is currently impossible to find in traditional stores, and is going for $1,500 to $2000-plus on Ebay depending on the model. Thanks to the ongoing GPU shortage, don\u2019t expect this upgrade to come cheap.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: Yep, these aren\u2019t cheap. EVGA\u2019s standard 10GB RTX 3080 XC Ultra Gaming model costs $840 on the company\u2019s website. The 12GB RTX 3080 XC Ultra Gaming costs $1,250\u2014a $410 markup, and even more than the non-Ultra version of the step-up RTX 3080 Ti XC Gaming, which costs $1210. Well, if any of them were in stock, that is. Considering that mining desirability is largely driven by memory bandwidth, that isn\u2019t really surprising, even if it\u2019s a bit disheartening.\nStill, more GPUs is better than fewer GPUs. You might not have noticed the 12GB RTX 3080\u2019s launch if you weren\u2019t paying close attention\u2014Nvidia didn\u2019t release any announcements or blog posts, it only quietly updated the RTX 3080 family\u2019s spec page and slipped mention of the GPU into its new driver release notes\u2014but it\u2019s here. We\u2019ll try to get our hands on one for testing. \n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Brad Chacos, Executive Editor, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos spends his days digging through desktop PCs and tweeting too much.

It\u2019s essentially an AI-fuelled upgrade to Nvidia\u2019s DSR downsampling tool, aiming to more intelligently render the frames of your games so that they appear more detailed \u2013 without the same performance loss that comes with standard DSR. It\u2019s an intriguing new feature that could make some of the best graphics cards even better, and I\u2019ve been trying it out to see if it performs as effectively as Nvidia claims.\r\n\n\n\r\nIn games, downsampling is the practice of rendering an image at a higher resolution than the display could normally show, then rescaling that image so it will actually fit the screen\u2019s native resolution. This will tax your GPU harder, in the same way that rendering a native 4K image would take more horsepower than 1080p, but in exchange can make games look noticeably sharper. \r\n\n\n\n\nGod of War \u2013 Ultrawide Trailer | PC\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\r\nFor years, DSR has been making it easy to enable downsampling at the driver level, and now DLDSR looks to take the next step: using the Tensor cores on RTX cards to provide the same fidelity enhancements, without losing as many frames per second. \r\n\n\r\nFor reference, I tested DLDSR on a GeForce RTX 3070, alongside an Intel Core i5-11600K and 16GB of RAM. Just to reiterate, you will need an RTX-branded GPU to use DLDSR (unlike DSR, which works on all recent and semi-recent Nvidia GPUs), though since it operates at the driver level it should work with most games out of the box. Out of the .exe. Whatever.\r\n\n\r\nSince DLDSR launched in an Nvidia Game Ready Driver with God of War optimisations, I decided to focus my testing on the adventures of ol\u2019 Grumpy Beard himself. And straight away, it confirmed one similarity between DSR and DLDSR: neither are particularly fond of borderless windowed mode. There\u2019s an easy workaround for this, though: once DLDSR is enabled in Nvidia Control Panel, you can set your monitor to the higher render resolution in Windows Display settings. Just as with DSR, this should let you select that target resolution in any in-game settings, even if it\u2019s in borderless mode.\r\n\n\r\nIn announcing DLDSR, Nvidia cited a Prey comparison that put the new tech on equal performance footing as native rendering, with standard DSR far behind. In God of War, this turned out half true: my 1080p, Ultimate-quality benchmark averaged 62fps on the DLDSR 2.25x setting, which is a considerable drop from my native resolution result of 87fps. The supposedly equivalent DSR 4x setting, however, only produced 48fps, so DLDSR does indeed go easier on the GPU.\r\n\n\r\nVisually, too, DLDSR 2.25x not only looks sharper than native, but to my eyes beats out DSR 4x as well. Take a peek at the comparison below: you can see how DSR tidies up details like the shape of the glowing chain links, or the grass just to the right of Kratos\u2019s unkempt jaw. But DLDSR improves this further by adding definition to the Nordic wall pattern on the left and sharpening up the ground textures in general.\r\n\n\n\n \nLeft: Ultra quality, DSR 4x. Right: Ultra quality, native 1920x1080\n\n\n\n \nLeft: Ultra quality, DLDSR 2.25x. Right: Ultra quality, native 1920x1080\n\n\r\nWhat\u2019s impressive here is that DLDSR 2.25x, as you might have guessed from the numbers, isn\u2019t even rendering at such a high resolution as DSR 4x. With a native 1080p monitor, DLDSR 2.25x will render at 2880x1620, while DSR 4x will go the full 4K at 3840x2160. The difference lies in the algorithm: DLDSR has enough machine learning smarts that it doesn\u2019t need as many input pixels to produce a similar, or in this case slightly better, final image. And since fewer pixels need to be pushed, overall performance is higher. Is it a night-and-day difference in visual quality between this and DSR? Not really \u2013 I\u2019m sure you noticed those comparison shots needed to be zoomed in to highlight the changes \u2013 but better looks plus better performance equals a clear upgrade for RTX users.\r\n\n\r\nThere\u2019s also one other addition that can soften the frame rate blow even further: DLSS. Now, this won\u2019t be available in every game, but you can use both it and DLDSR simultaneously. And while the mathematics of upscaling and downsampling each frame are a bit much for my humanities graduate brain, I do know that DLSS on its Balanced setting helped get 79fps out of DLDSR 2.25x. That\u2019s nearly 20fps more than when using the default anti-aliasing, and less than 10fps below the all-native performance.\r\n\n\n\n \nLeft: Ultra quality, DLDSR 2.25x. Right: Ultra quality, DLDSR 2.25x, DLSS Balanced\n\n\r\nSticking with a PlayStation port theme, I also tried DLDSR out on Horizon Zero Dawn, which simply listed the higher resolution in its display menu without any Windows setting tweakery. Compared to stock 1080p, at which the built-in benchmark averaged 109fps on Ultimate quality, DSR 4x produced a similar frame rate-tanking to God of War with 52fps. Switching to DLDSR was enough to bump this back up to 83fps, and adding DLSS to the mix scored 104fps \u2013 only 5fps below native rendering.\r\n\n\r\nThese are good results from a speed standpoint, though I found the fidelity differences even harder to notice than in God of War. In the comparison below you can make out a touch of extra definition on the dusty ground texture, and maybe a teensy bit on parts of Aloy\u2019s armour, but it\u2019s proper squinty stuff. \r\n\n\n\n \nLeft: Ultimate quality, DLDSR 2.25x, DLSS Balanced. Right: Ultimate quality, native 1080p\n\n\r\nThis does raise the question of whether, as a matter of course, enabling DLDSR is really the right play. I\u2019d admit that while it works very well in God of War, I personally could live with leaving it off \u2013 especially when it would save me having to tinker with Windows Display settings every time I wanted to play it.\r\n\n\r\nBut then, I\u2019m almost always more inclined towards higher frame rates than having the crispest, sharpest, most high-tech visuals possible. If you are a fidelity nut, and you own an RTX graphics card, I actually would recommend giving it a try. Especially in games that support DLSS, as these will come much closer to fulfilling Nvidia\u2019s promise of higher detail at a lower performance cost.\r\n\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            PlayStation put the axe in a live service God Of War game, alongside a project from the Days Gone studio\n          \n\n\n\n            Former God of War and Star Wars devs team up to make new \"single-player-focused action adventure\"\n          \n\n\n\n            NCSoft's Project Skyline rumoured to be Horizon MMO, in the works for PC and Unreal Engine 5\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor.

The most pessimistic sign of things to come, sadly, comes from GPU manufacturers themselves, as both Nvidia and AMD have begun pricing new products a bit more in line with market realities.\nJanuary has already seen some woeful GPU launches. The mildly tweaked RTX 3080, now with 12GB of VRAM instead of 10GB, arrived earlier this month at an MSRP of roughly $1,200\u2014a whopping 42 percent jump over the highly reviewed launch model's\u00a0suggested price. On the other side of the price spectrum, last week's AMD RX 6500XT, at an MSRP of $199, has proven quite underwhelming thus far in reviews.\u00a0Between its 64-bit memory interface, its 4GB of VRAM, and its penalties for PCIe 3.0 systems, the card's performance pales even in comparison to the $199 RX 5500XT... which launched in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                The RTX 3050's specs are dramatically cut down from its RTX siblings\u2014and they're even ho-hum compared to 2016's GTX 1070.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Nvidia\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The RTX 3050's specs are dramatically cut down from its RTX siblings\u2014and they're even ho-hum compared to 2016's GTX 1070.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Nvidia\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nNot wanting to be left out of the latest low-end headlines, Nvidia arrives this week with the RTX 3050, which continues the longtime GPU manufacturer practice of repurposing \"binned\" GPUs. The card's $249 MSRP is the lowest yet in the RTX desktop series, below the $329 MSRP attached to the nearly one-year-old RTX 3060 but above the $229 MSRP of 2019's GTX 1660 Super. I get the feeling that this GPU is the monkey's paw proposition PC gamers get when we scream things like, \"Please produce more graphics cards!\"\nStarting with the verdict: This is a 1080p card\nWill you find RTX 3050 cards in the wild, let alone at prices 25 percent lower than the 3060? We're not optimistic. But if you do, be warned: even with proprietary tricks like Nvidia DLSS in its pocket, the RTX 3050 will still generally leave you fiddling with settings menus to get modern games running at 60 frames per second... at 1080p resolution. This is a card that, for the most part, maxes out at 1080p for reasonable PC performance, not only for the newest games but for some of the best games of the past seven years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                3DMark alternates between 1080p and 4K tests, and it includes a ray tracing intensive test (Port Royal). As you can see here, on a pure synthetic testing level, the years-old GTX 1070 and brand-new RTX 3050 trade blows for the most part (ray tracing excluded).\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      3DMark alternates between 1080p and 4K tests, and it includes a ray tracing intensive test (Port Royal). As you can see here, on a pure synthetic testing level, the years-old GTX 1070 and brand-new RTX 3050 trade blows for the most part (ray tracing excluded).\n\n          \n\n\n\nIf your PC's GPU is particularly long in the tooth and you're happy maxing out your favorite PC games at 1080p resolution, you might\u2014out of desperation\u2014want to head to a brick-and-mortar shop when the RTX 3050 goes on sale. Retail outlets historically do a better job with \"one GPU per customer\" limits and other reasonable measures than online ones do.\nAdditionally, I recommend setting a price limit somewhere around the $329 mark, since OEMs may choose to pile onto Nvidia's MSRP with extras like ornate fans and overclock promises\u2014and we know at least one overclocked RTX 3050 model will launch at a $329 price. But that recommendation is more about market concerns than it is about this GPU being a bargain in any sense of the word.\nGTX 1070 flashbacks\nDepending on the game or benchmark in question, the RTX 3050's closest performance peer on the market is the Nvidia GTX 1070, which launched at roughly $379 back in June 2016. If we lean on Ars Technica's usual battery of tests, which largely examine in-game performance, the results align remarkably close to that older card:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the RTX 2060 Super, which provided performance upticks across the board compared to the GTX 1070, the RTX 3050 simply cannot muster the same progress this many years later. For some rendering scenarios, the silicon shortcomings of the RTX 3050 are very noticeable.\nBut the above and below charts emphasize something that is critical in any graphics card benchmarking tests: how a GPU handles overkill settings and higher resolutions so that a given workload is GPU-specific and can be compared across cards.\u00a0That default scenario sadly assumes that you have a lot of choices in the marketplace. In the here and now, however, seeing that the RTX 3050 disappoints in all-settings-maxed 1440p situations isn't necessarily useful; you can't expect to buy a rival card that is either cheaper or more likely to be future-proof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're still reading this review, you're likely eager to just get a working graphics card with 1080p performance as a baseline. Will the RTX 3050 cut it? In a word: mostly. I have found that its strengths emerge on a case-by-case basis, but there are few legitimate 1440p applications.\n\nRT + DLSS - 3050 impact = GPU math in 2022\nI'll start with ray tracing, which is an icing-on-top toggle you might hope to access with a modern GPU, even one whose specs have been pared back pretty severely. My RTX 3050 tests looked at a collection of ray-tracing-compatible games, and they indeed work... if you're happy dropping resolutions to the roughly 720p mark. On my testing rig, I could run the ray tracing stunner\u00a0Control at that paltry pixel resolution with general settings turned down to \"medium\" and ray tracing settings left untouched, and my lowest frame rates hovered around 58 fps (with an average closer to 62 fps).\nNvidia may respond to this anecdote by pointing to its DLSS system, which Control supports, and how it can neatly upscale compatible games to get them to performant levels. In my opinion, that sales pitch is true\u2014if a game upscales from a base pixel resolution of no less than 900p. But the 60 fps performance I'm talking about is with DLSS starting from a 720p base, then upscaling to 1080p, and it serves as a stark reminder that DLSS can only properly upscale to a certain extent. A DLSS upscale from 720p to 1080p is certifiably blurry, complete with pixels that suddenly appear or disappear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI still think Control looks fantastic with this tradeoff, where vibrant, world-altering ray tracing effects work on the RTX 3050 at the cost of blurrier visuals and occasional upscaling artifacts. You may not agree, in which case you can turn off ray tracing and get raw 1080p performance close to 60 fps on the RTX 3050. Or you can play around with settings to try other mostly acceptable options, like putting general settings at \"medium,\" ray tracing settings down to \"medium,\" and raw resolution boosted to 1080p (which, combined, makes the game run at roughly 46 fps on my testing rig).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSub-1080p resolutions can get the RTX 3050 GPU to 60 fps on other ray-tracing-intensive games as well. Minecraft RTX's default DLSS implementation brings it close to 58 fps on average when upscaling from something close to 720p, and Quake II RTX can lock to 60 fps when it runs at around\u00a0900p (a resolution it automatically reaches via its own handy dynamic scaling system). Yet the GPU-intensive Watch Dogs Legion pounds the RTX 3050 with ray tracing enabled, requiring an even more aggressive resolution-scaling scenario than the other tested games to get it anywhere near a consistent 60 fps refresh. (Or, of course, disable ray tracing on all of these games to get them closer to decent native 1080p performance.)\nAnd as a reminder, AMD's recent salvo in this price category, the RX 6500XT, completely falls apart in ray-tracing-intensive benchmarks, so at least the 3050 gives you the option of\u00a0some ray tracing action.\nMaking peace with tolerable 1080p numbers\nAs far as those tests are concerned, the scaled-back specs of the RTX 3050 push its ray-tracing-specific results well below the same tests conducted with the 2.5-year-old RTX 2060 Super. That aligns with the overall tale of the tape, in terms of specs like CUDA cores, texture units, and memory bandwidth.\nIf you've missed out on the past seven or so years of modern PC software, the RTX 3050 is still competent enough to run many 3D games without any ray tracing effects at a 1080p resolution. Grand Theft Auto V, for example, needs some settings massaging to approach a 60 fps minimum at 1080p resolution on the RTX 3050. On my aforementioned testing rig, I had to drop settings like anti-aliasing quality, reflection quality, and grass density, while leaving all other meters maxed out, to get a \"real gameplay\" benchmark average of 81.9 fps, which came with a \"1 percent low\" floor of 58.7 fps\u2014meaning it rarely dropped frames beneath the 60 fps standard. I had to fiddle with sliders a bit more to get the demanding 2018 adventure game\u00a0Assassin's Creed Odyssey\u00a0to a 1080p/60 fps threshold, dropping it two steps down from \"ultra high\" to \"high\" at 1080p\u2014and I did the same thing with its 2020 sequel\u00a0Assassin's Creed Valhalla to produce similar 1080p/60 fps performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Yes, you'll get better performance from the more capable cards in this chart, but if you'd like to rip and tear through any of the idTech 6 or idTech 7 games in recent years, the RTX 3050 will get you to acceptable performance levels, even at 1440p resolution.\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Yes, you'll get better performance from the more capable cards in this chart, but if you'd like to rip and tear through any of the idTech 6 or idTech 7 games in recent years, the RTX 3050 will get you to acceptable performance levels, even at 1440p resolution.\n\n          \n\n\n\nMore efficient PC fare, meanwhile, can push the RTX 3050 to impressive 1440p numbers, most notably the idTech 6 and idTech 7 games Doom 2016, Doom Eternal, and Wolfenstein Youngblood. Each of these games can run at max settings with ray tracing disabled and get into 1440p benchmark averages of between 77 and 100 fps, and you can tweak settings even further to get their frame rate bottoms to exceed 60 fps (or keep all settings maxed out and stomach a few dips to the mid-50s). The latter two games on that list also support Nvidia DLSS, and they do look pretty good when upscaling 900p and 1080p signals to 1440p resolution, should you want to flex that RTX 3050 feature.\nAs far as very recent PC software is concerned, the RTX 3050 offers some hope. The 2018 PlayStation 4 smash God of War just got an impressive, highly optimized port to PC, and Nvidia's latest low-end RTX card can run the game at a mix of \"original\" and \"high\" settings at a native resolution of close to 1080p, upscaled by DLSS to 1440p, and maintain a frame rate average of roughly 60 fps. Capcom's Monster Hunter Rise was previously a Nintendo Switch exclusive before landing on PC earlier this month, and its low-powered Switch heritage likely explains why the RTX 3050\u00a0can put up a roughly 65 fps average with all settings maxed at 1440p.\nAnd my spot checks of the recently remastered Crysis trilogy showed generally promising 1080p/60 fps performance with settings turned to the \"high\" preset... however, that's with all ray tracing disabled, as the RTX 3050 simply can't process even the \"performance\" ray tracing toggle. (The RTX 3050 ray tracing performance in the trilogy\u00a0is better than comparable AMD GPUs, to be fair, but that's not saying much.)\n\nA note about last-minute benchmarking\nIn an alternate universe with a reasonable GPU market, I would expect the RTX 3050 to be one of two things: either far more powerful for the 1080p set, with enough horsepower to legitimately push into more 1440p gaming across the board (either with or without DLSS trickery), or just plain cheaper. If you track the 3050 on a plot line of prices and power with its RTX 2000 brethren (or, heck, its GTX 1000 ancestors), there's no getting past the severe drop-off in price-to-performance ratio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of that comes from the RTX 3050 having some headroom to spare if it is safely overclocked. I learned this inadvertently because Ars' review hardware, the EVGA RTX 3050 XC Black, was accidentally loaded with EVGA's backplate-mounted, overclocked 3050 firmware. That meant all of my earliest tests were run at speeds and temperatures that would not have been warranty-friendly.\nWhen I re-ran those tests\u201436 hours before this review went live, mind you, thanks to a last-minute email from EVGA about its factory error and correction\u2014I found I had to tweak settings a bit more to lock down 1080p/60 fps performance. EVGA charges $80 more for its backplate-mounted 3050 model, at $329. According to my tests, that 33 percent jump in price accounts for as much as 10 percent more performance (as seen in GTA V, Quake II RTX, and Doom Eternal), though across the board, the OC model's jump can be as little as half a frame per second (especially when ray tracing is enabled).\nSpeaking of overclocking, my oversight in double-checking the clock and boost speeds on my testing rig arguably happened because of how quietly the EVGA version of the RTX 3050 runs. I wonder if the incorrect firmware worked so well because of how flexible the RTX 3050 might be to manual settings trickery. Your mileage (and warranty) will vary, obviously\u2014and I should also point to weird bugs I ran into with my tests of EVGA's 3050 model. The below blue screen of death, which includes an Nvidia DLL in its log, sprung up 12 hours after I had updated the card's firmware and was apparently triggered by uploading RTX 3050 pictures to Ars Technica's database via our web client tools. What does that mean? Search me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                One of the weirder BSODs I've ever seen in PC testing.

Last week's RX 6500XT was a disaster by all accounts, especially because of the performance penalties it put on systems that max out at PCIe 3.0 bandwidth\u2014as in, the machines most likely to use the card. Nobody with a top-of-the-line PCIe 4.0 system is buying either the RX 6500XT or the RTX 3050.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Box glamour shot.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          EVGA / Nvidia\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Box glamour shot.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          EVGA / Nvidia\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nWhen I moved past the battery of typical GPU tests and got around to playing 3D games on the RTX 3050, I found I could still generally run software at \"high\" or \"very high\" settings\u2014not maxed\u2014at 1080p resolution and expect mostly capable frame rates. That general result for a $249 MSRP certainly compares favorably to AMD's $379 RX 6600XT, which hovers weirdly between 1080p and 1440p performance. (MSRPs don't necessarily reflect what you'll see in the marketplace, but that whopping 33 percent drop will likely mean the RTX 3050 will establish a lower average price on store shelves and eBay listings alike.)\nBut this card lives in the shadow of Nvidia's own GTX 1050 and 1060 families, and that shadow darkens the value proposition here. 1080p is by no means a satisfying pixel resolution for modern PC gaming at a GPU price above $200, especially in a space that favors ultrawide screens (usually no less than 1440p in vertical resolution). If you've been waiting since the launch of the GTX 1070 for a worthy GPU upgrade to match a newer, bigger monitor, this isn't necessarily it.\nAt the same time, the RTX 3050 could have\u00a0been worse. Until the doom and gloom of inflated GPU prices and crypto-mining pains subside\u2014which could theoretically be any day now, should this month's cryptocurrency crash persist\u2014the pared-down RTX 3050, and its welcome configuration of ray tracing and DLSS cores on top of its otherwise meek specs, might not be a bad stopgap card to lean on for the next nine to 15 months.\nThat advice holds until an Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti or AMD RX 6600XT appears anywhere near retail price in your vicinity, of course.\u00a0In which case, you should buy one of those superior options instead.\nArs Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through\u00a0affiliate programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Machkovech\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Machkovech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    191 Comments\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Comments\n  \n\n\nForum view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Loading comments...\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrev story\n\n\nNext story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Most Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\nEverything you say to your Echo will be sent to Amazon starting on March 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\u201cAwful\u201d: Roku tests autoplaying ads loading before the home screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\nTrump plan to fund Musk\u2019s Starlink over fiber called \u201cbetrayal\u201d of rural US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\nReport: mRNA vaccines are in RFK Jr\u2019s crosshairs; funding in question\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\nSobering revenue stats of 70K mobile apps show why devs beg for subscriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArs Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

The company said it hoped to \"one day\" train models with trillions of parameters and build new AI systems that can power real-time voice translations to large groups of people.Meta said that development of the supercomputer was delayed by remote working and chip and component supply chain constraints, both caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Facebook/Meta\n\n\n\nBack in 2017, Meta's Facebook AI Research lab built a supercomputer with 22,000 Nvidia V100 Tensor Core GPUs in a single cluster. Performing 35,000 training jobs a day, it served as the company's main AI supercomputer.But in 2020, Facebook decided to increase its computing power, building a new supercomputer to handle more advanced AI workloads. The current RSC system is comprised of 760 Nvidia DGX A100 systems, each of which includes eight A100 GPUs and two CPUs (Meta did not confirm the vendor, but the standard DGX has two 64-core AMD CPUs).The 6,080 GPUs are connected via an Nvidia Quantum 200 Gb/s InfiniBand two-level Clos fabric. The system has 175 petabytes of Pure Storage FlashArray, 46 petabytes of cache storage in Penguin Computing Altus systems, and 10 petabytes of Pure Storage FlashBlade.Compared with Meta\u2019s previous system, the RSC runs computer vision workflows up to 20 times faster, runs the Nvidia Collective Communication Library (NCCL) more than nine times faster, and trains large scale NLP models three times faster, according to internal - and unverified - benchmarks.Meta said that a model with tens of billions of parameters can finish training in three weeks, compared with nine weeks before.The company is still building out the supercomputer, ultimately expecting to connect 16,000 GPUs as endpoints. Meta has designed a caching and storage system that can serve 16 TB/s of training data, and plans to scale it up to one exabyte.The final system is predicted to be capable of five exaflops of mixed precision compute.Depending on the benchmark, the current world's fastest AI supercomputer is the Department of Energy's Perlmutter supercomputer. Capable of four exaflops of AI performance, it features 6,159 Nvidia A100 GPUs and 1,536 AMD Epyc CPUs.Italy's Leonardo system, which features 3,500 Intel Sapphire Rapids CPUs and 14,000 GPUs, is set to overtake Perlmutter when it launches soon.Later this year, the US expects to launch two systems capable of more than an exaflops of performance - under the LINPACK benchmark, not the AI benchmark used by Meta.The first, Frontier, is expected to be capable of more than 1.5 exaflops, and will feature 9,000 AMD Epyc CPUs and 36,000 AMD Radeon Instinct MI200 GPUs.It will be followed by Aurora, an oft-delayed system that could exceed 2 exaflops. It will boast 18,000 Intel Xeon Sapphire Rapids CPUs, and 54,000 Intel Xe GPUs.However, China is believed to have secretly launched two exascale supercomputers last year.\n\n\n\n Subscribe to our daily newsletters\n\n\n Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in HPC & Quantum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n\nSwiss quantum hardware startup ZuriQ raises $4.2m in seed funding round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nGoogle CEO: Practical quantum computers likely still a decade away\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nThe architecture of a supercomputer: A journey into advanced HPC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nMeta\n\n\nAI Research SuperCluster\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nNvidia DGX A100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

Colette also pointed out the huge demand for GeForce graphics cards and GPUs and expects it to outweigh their supply of existing chips.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSSo even throughout all of calendar 2021, we have seen strong demand for GeForce. And it continues to remain strong and stronger than our overall supply that we have. The holiday demand, for example, was quite strong, particularly in laptops. And we're still finishing out our quarter. But we'll look at the end of the quarter in terms of what we've seen in terms of channel levels. We had seen channel levels be quite lean, and we are working with our supply chain partners to increase the availability of supply. And we feel better about our supply situation as we move into the second half of the calendar year '22.\nSome of the other record breaking things that we've seen is gaming demand is quite strong. We're seeing record concurrent users, for example, on Steam. 28 million concurrent users breaking a prior record quite easily. Also, we're seeing momentum build -- momentum building for creative and/or Metaverse like type of applications that are addressed with our Studio offerings, but also [indiscernible].\nNow when we focus in terms of cryptocurrency, the contribution of cryptocurrency to our gaming revenue continues and will be difficult for us to quantify. We believe that our process on light hash rate cards for GeForce, also with our CMP product, has been an effective strategy to steer GeForce to the supply of other gamers. However, new crypto hash rate has stemmed and we're seeing several different sources of that. That can be our GeForce GPUs, it could be AMD GPUs, custom ASICs, and our CMP product, all of these are contributing. But again, it's just very difficult for us to quantify.\nNVIDIA CFO, Colette Kross via Seeking Alpha\nNot only NVIDIA's CEO, but Intel and AMD's CEOs have also previously hinted at the whole chip shortage situation easing down by the second half of 2022. But it isn't stated as to what will be attributed to the situation getting better. It looks like as the company moves into 2H 2022, they could start focusing on their next-gen GPU architecture, codenamed Ada Lovelace which is going to power their GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs. As such, moving over to a new generation may move off-set some load off the existing GPU lineup.\n\nIn a recent rumor, it was reported that NVIDIA has spent several billions of dollars to acquire large quantities of 5nm wafers from TSMC that will go on to power its next-gen GPU lineup. If this is true, then NVIDIA is really aiming to launch its latest products with a stronger supply than we had seen for GeForce RTX 30 series. Currently, there have also been reports that the entry-level GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card is bound to get a better supply than both the GeForce RTX 3060 and RTX 3060 Ti, combined. The new card launches on 27th January so it won't be long before we see if that holds any truth.\nConsumers are really looking forward to things getting better in the 2nd half of 2022 and we also hope that the chip supply shortages get better so gamers and PC users have access to the latest GPUs and CPUs on time and at MSRP.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n98\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n48\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n43\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n32\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

And RTX momentum continues to build.\u00a0 Since last CES, we have added over 150 RTX games and applications now supporting RTX accelerated innovations like GPU-accelerated ray tracing, and AI powered NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS).\nAt CES 2022, the tech industry\u2019s biggest trade show, we\u2019re announcing that RTX technologies are coming to The Day Before, Rainbow Six Extraction, Escape From Tarkov, SUPER PEOPLE, Hitman III, Voidtrain, The Anacrusis, Phantasy Star Online 2 New Genesis, Ratten Reich, and Midnight Ghost Hunt.\nFor all the details and exclusive new RTX trailers, keep reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Day Before Launching June 21, 2022 With NVIDIA DLSS & Ray Tracing Effects \nFNTASTIC and MYTONA\u2019s The Day Before is an open-world MMO survival game set in a deadly, post-pandemic America overrun by flesh-hungry infected and survivors battling each other for food, weapons, and cars. Players will be able to freely explore the world, including individual homes, skyscrapers, banks, hotels, shopping malls, and more.\nWhen The Day Before launches this June, performance will be accelerated with NVIDIA DLSS, and its detailed world will be greatly enhanced by ray-traced reflections, ambient occlusion, and NVIDIA RTX Global Illumination (RTXGI).\nRTXGI generates performant infinite-bounce global illumination light from the sun, moon and other natural light sources. For examples, check out our exclusive The Day Before RTX ON trailer below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you lack a GeForce RTX PC or laptop, or are away from your system, you\u2019ll also be able to play The Day Before with NVIDIA DLSS on GeForce NOW, NVIDIA\u2019s cloud gaming platform. GeForce NOW Founders, Priority, and RTX 3080 members can also stream the game with beautiful RTX features enabled.\nFor further updates on The Day Before, wishlist the game on Steam, and stay tuned to GeForce.com.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRainbow Six Extraction Launches January 20 With NVIDIA DLSS & Reflex\nLast year we brought NVIDIA DLSS and NVIDIA Reflex to Tom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow Six Siege, the hugely popular 5v5 tactical shooter. On January 20th, it\u2019s time to join millions of players in the Rainbow Six universe and fight an evolving and deadly Alien threat in Rainbow Six Extraction. Extraction is a brand-new tactical co-op PvE FPS for up to three players, featuring a deep gear and ability progression system, over 90 weapons and gadgets, 12 ever-evolving maps, unpredictable enemy mutations, and more.\nWith NVIDIA DLSS already accelerating performance in Rainbow Six Siege, and NVIDIA Reflex optimizing system latency for more responsive gameplay, we can confirm that the two technologies will be coming to Rainbow Six Extraction, giving GeForce RTX gamers the definitive experience when Ubisoft\u2019s new game launches on January 20th.

It provides incredible 1080p gaming performance, even with ray tracing \u2013 something the GTX 1650 couldn\u2019t even do. However, its high price pits it against the RTX 2060, a fight the RTX 3050 just cannot win.

Find out more about how we test.\n\n\n\nTwo-minute reviewThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 arrives at the perfect time \u2013 maybe even a little late \u2013 as the best graphics cards keep getting more and more expensive. And because GPUs keep selling out even the few that are reasonably priced haven\u2019t exactly been worth the price tag \u2013 just look at the AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT.\u00a0However, with the RTX 3050, you\u2019re not getting much lower performance than the next up Nvidia\u2019s lineup, the RTX 3060. The RTX 3050 has no problem hitting 60 fps in any 1080p game you throw at it, though it might start to struggle in the most demanding games of the generation \u2013 think Cyberpunk 2077.While that all sounds good, it\u2019s hard to ignore how much prices have changed generation-on-generation. While a price tag of $249 (about \u00a3185, AU$350) might not seem high when you\u2019re used to seeing graphics cards at $1,000 or more these days, it\u2019s still significantly more expensive than xx50 cards of the past. For instance, the GTX 1050 Ti launched at $139 (\u00a3139, about AU$200), and the GTX 1650 launched at just $149 (\u00a3149, about AU$200).\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti review: nearly perfect, but with one major flaw\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5080 review: nearly RTX 4090 performance for a whole lot less\n\n\n\nSo, likely due to an ongoing silicon shortage that\u2019s seeing computing prices rise dramatically across the industry, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 is nearly double the price of its last-generation sibling.\u00a0That drastic price increase does come with a huge increase in performance. However, people that were hoping to see a graphics card at actual budget prices will have to keep waiting \u2013 or turn to the used market. We just hope the RTX 4000 series has something more budget-friendly, assuming the shortage lets up any time soon.\u00a0(Image credit: Future)Nvidia GeForce RTX at Amazon for $1,099Price and availabilityThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 is available now, starting at $249 (about \u00a3185, AU$350), with prices going up from there for more advanced third-party boards. We\u2019re not sure what the aftermarket situation will look like once the boards become available, but if it\u2019s anything like the RTX 3060, there may not be many graphics cards available at that starting price \u2013 instead prices might start to climb.\u00a0For instance, the EVGA GeForce RTX 3050 XC Black we\u2019re reviewing here costs $249 (about \u00a3185, AU$350) and it\u2019s a pretty basic version of the graphics card. If you want something with fancy RGB lighting and overclocking-friendly cooling setups, you\u2019re going to have to spend quite a bit more.\u00a0Nvidia isn\u2019t making a Founders Edition of the GeForce RTX 3050 \u2013 just like it didn\u2019t with the RTX 3060 \u2013 which is the major reason that graphics cards at the low end of the pricing scale for this GPU will be incredibly rare. Hopefully, as the RTX 3050 isn\u2019t going to be very good for crypto mining, it won\u2019t see massive price increases after release. Only time will tell with that one.\u00a0(Image credit: Future)Features and chipsetThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050, just like the rest of the RTX 3000 series, is built on Nvidia\u2019s Ampere core. In previous launches in this lineup, the improvements Nvidia made to this core over the last-gen Turing core offered a huge gen-on-gen increase in performance \u2013 both for ray tracing and regular rasterization.\u00a0And the GeForce RTX 3050 is no different. Because of the smaller manufacturing process of Nvidia Ampere, Team Green was able to fit more Streaming Multiprocessors without increasing the size of the die, up to 20 from 14 on the GTX 1650. Nvidia was able to effectively double FP32 cores on each SM, giving the RTX 3050 2,560 CUDA cores, up from 892 on the GTX 1650. This means it\u2019s way more powerful \u2013 at least on paper.\u00a0With this increase in SMs, there\u2019s of course an increase in power required to drive the RTX 3050 \u2013 but not as much as we thought. TGP has only increased to 130W over the 75W TGP of the GTX 1650. That does mean that the AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT consumes way less power, but as we\u2019ll see later, it results in a major loss in performance.\u00a0This is also the first xx50 card that's got Nvidia\u2019s full RTX feature set. This means this GPU gets both RT cores and Tensor cores, so it\u2019s capable of ray tracing and DLSS. Both the GTX 1650 and the GTX 1650 Super got excluded from these features in the last generation, so it\u2019s nice to see them make their way to a 'budget' graphics card \u2013 especially DLSS.\u00a0Luckily, Nvidia also upped the VRAM on the RTX 3050 to 8GB of GDDR6 on a 128-bit bus with 224 GB/s of bandwidth. It\u2019s not the fastest memory of this generation, but it should keep this graphics card fighting at 1080p for quite a while.\u00a0Because while it\u2019s cool that an affordable graphics card has ray tracing, that\u2019s not the main draw here. DLSS is going to be far more valuable for folks buying this graphics card, as it will boost performance significantly without impacting visual quality much. It\u2019s not free performance per se \u2013 and you will notice a quality drop on Performance Mode, for instance \u2013 but it does stretch what the RTX 3050 will be capable of at 1080p.\u00a0You also get access to other Nvidia RTX tech, as well. Nvidia Reflex is going to be a big deal for this graphics card in particular, as the performance level it offers is already perfect for esports. Nvidia Reflex will enhance the esports experience further by cutting down on input lag. This feature is starting to appear in other games too \u2013 it was announced for God of War at CES 2022, for instance \u2013 and while it may be nice for a single-player title, it\u2019s especially nice for multiplayer games like Fortnite or Counter-Strike.\u00a0(Image credit: Future)DesignWe got the EVGA GeForce RTX 3050 XC Black for our review, and it\u2019s pretty plain as far as graphics cards go. It has a simple gray and black colorway, with two fans and a nameplate on the side featuring the EVGA and GeForce RTX logos.\u00a0There\u2019s nothing in the way of RGB lighting or much visual flair, which will make it a good fit for folks that want a low-profile build.\u00a0It\u2019s also a very small graphics card, fitting in the same 7.94-inch design profile as the EVGA RTX 3060 XC Black. Combined with the small 130W TGP, this graphics card will have no problem fitting in a small form-factor build.\u00a0Because this graphics card is using the same cooler as its RTX 3060 counterpart, temperatures stay extremely low. Throughout all of our testing, temperatures didn\u2019t rise above 60C. That was in an open-air test bench, so you may see slightly higher temperatures in your case, but either way, there\u2019s going to be plenty of thermal headroom here. This means there should be enough room to overclock it a bit for extra performance \u2013 though we didn\u2019t test that for this review.\u00a0Image 1 of 14(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)PerformanceTest system specsThis is the system we used to test the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050CPU:\u00a0Intel Core i9-12900K (16-core, up to 5.2GHz)\nCPU Cooler:\u00a0Corsair H150i Elite Capellix\nRAM:\u00a032GB Corsair Dominator Platinum @ 5,200MHz\nMotherboard:\u00a0MSI MPG Z690 Carbon Wifi\nSSD:\u00a0ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro @ 1TB\nPower Supply:\u00a0Corsair AX1000\nCase:\u00a0Praxis WetbenchNvidia is pitching the GeForce RTX 3050 as a budget 1080p graphics card, even though it costs as much as a mid-range card from 2018. Generally, the RTX 3050 is about 70% faster than the GeForce GTX 1650, which is a pretty massive improvement.\u00a0However, if you look a bit higher in the Turing pile, the comparison is less favorable. The RTX 3050 is only about 10-15% faster than the GTX 1660, which was about $40 cheaper than the RTX 3050 when it came out. And, if you look at the RTX 2060, which ended its lifespan at around the same price as the RTX 3050, Nvidia\u2019s new card is between 10-20% slower.\u00a0Again, this is a symptom of the terrible state of the graphics card market right now, but it\u2019s hard to look at the performance of this card, along with its price, and not reminisce about better days.\u00a0That being said, if you\u2019re looking at the GeForce RTX 3050 in a vacuum, it\u2019s actually kind of impressive for what it\u2019s trying to do. Even in Metro Exodus with ray tracing on and DLSS disabled, it's able to get a solid 46 fps. Turn on DLSS and that\u2019s 60 fps, easy.\u00a0It\u2019s even more impressive in games with no ray tracing, though. We ran our testing suite with all the games on the high (or equivalent) preset, and the RTX 3050 stayed well above 60 fps in all of them. And, in a game like Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, it was able to get a solid 143 fps \u2013 enough for high-refresh gaming.With the RTX 3050, you should be able to play pretty much any game in your library without having to compromise much on visual quality. Now that it includes DLSS, that performance is going to be stretched even further.\u00a0We just wish it was a bit cheaper. Because at the end of the day, it\u2019s sitting between where the GTX 1660 Super and the RTX 2060 sat in price in the last generation, and it doesn\u2019t meaningfully improve on that performance. So, while the RTX 3050 is a massive improvement over the GTX 1650, it still feels like stagnation, regardless of what the name on the box says.\u00a0(Image credit: Future)Buy it if\u2026You can find it at a decent price\nIf you can find an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 close to $249 (about \u00a3185, AU$350), jump on it. The price isn\u2019t ideal for the performance it offers, but the market is the way it is right now.\u00a0You\u2019re good with 1080p\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 is a pretty great little 1080p graphics card, able to play pretty much any game at high settings.You need a new graphics card\nWith the way the graphics card market has been looking for the last year or so, this is the cheapest graphics card that\u2019s worth getting. It\u2019s not as cheap as we\u2019d like, though.\u00a0Don\u2019t buy it if\u2026You\u2019re waiting for a true budget graphics card\nIf you bought the GTX 1050 back in the day and you\u2019re looking to upgrade it with its current-generation equivalent keep waiting for a bit.You want to do 1440p or 4K gaming\nWhile the RTX 3050 is equipped with 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM, this is a 1080p card through and through.

GTC features talks from dozens of healthcare researchers and innovators harnessing AI for smart hospitals, drug discovery, genomics and more.\nSensor Solutions Bring Ambient Intelligence to Clinicians\nLi\u2019s interest in AI for healthcare delivery was sparked a decade ago when she was caring for a sick parent.\n\u201cThe more I spent my time in ICUs and hospital rooms and even at home caring for my family, the more I saw the analogy between self-driving technology and healthcare delivery,\u201d she said.\nHer vision of sensor-driven \u201cambient intelligence,\u201d outlined in a Nature paper, covers both the hospital and the home. It offers insights in operating rooms as well as the daily living spaces of individuals with chronic disease.\nFor example, ICU patients need a certain amount of movement to help their recovery. To ensure that patients are getting the right amount of mobility, researchers are developing smart sensor systems to automatically tag patient movements and understand their mobility levels while in critical care.\nAnother project used depth sensors and convolutional neural networks to assess whether clinicians were properly using hand sanitizer when entering and exiting patient rooms.\nOutside of the hospital, as the global population continues to age, wearable sensors can help ensure seniors are aging healthily by monitoring mobility, sleep and medicine compliance.\nThe next challenge, Li said, is advancing computer vision to classify more complex human movement.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not content with these coarse activities like walking and sleeping,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s more important clinically are fine-grained activities.\u201d\nProtecting Patient, Caregiver Privacy\u00a0\nWhen designing smart hospital technology, Li said, it\u2019s important that developers prioritize privacy and security of patients, clinicians and caretakers.\n\u201cFrom a computer vision point of view, blurring and masking has become more and more important when it comes to human signals,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are really important ways to mitigate private information and personal identity from being inadvertently leaked.\u201d\nIn the field of data privacy, Li said, federated learning is another promising solution to protect confidential information.\nThroughout the process of developing AI for healthcare, she said, developers must take a multi-stakeholder approach, involving patients, clinicians, bioethicists and government agencies in a collaborative environment.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, healthcare is about humans caring for humans,\u201d said Li. \u201cThis technology should not replace our caretakers, replace our families or replace our nurses and doctors. It\u2019s here to augment and enhance humanity and give more dignity back to our patients.\u201d\nWatch the full talk on NVIDIA On-Demand, and sign up for GTC to learn about the latest in AI and healthcare.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | GTC 2021 | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Science | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

See our ethics statement.Nvidia says its AI-powered upscaling is more powerful than regular super-resolution. Image: NvidiaNvidia\u2019s latest game-ready driver includes a tool that could let you improve the image quality of games that your graphics card can easily run, alongside optimizations for the new God of War PC port. The tech is called Deep Learning Dynamic Super Resolution, or DLDSR, and Nvidia says you can use it to make \u201cmost games\u201d look sharper by running them at a higher resolution than your monitor natively supports.DLDSR builds on Nvidia\u2019s Dynamic Super Resolution tech, which has been around for years. Essentially, regular old DSR renders a game at a higher resolution than your monitor can handle and then downscales it to your monitor\u2019s native resolution. This leads to an image with better sharpness but usually comes with a dip in performance (you are asking your GPU to do more work, after all). So, for instance, if you had a graphics card capable of running a game at 4K but only had a 1440p monitor, you could use DSR to get a boost in clarity.DLDSR takes DSR and adds AIDLDSR takes the same concept and incorporates AI that can also work to enhance the image. According to Nvidia, this means you can upscale less (and therefore lose less performance) while still getting similar image quality improvements. In real numbers, Nvidia claims you\u2019ll get image quality similar to running at four times the resolution using DSR with only 2.25 times the resolution with DLDSR. Nvidia gives an example using 2017\u2019s Prey: Digital Deluxe running on a 1080p monitor: 4x DSR runs at 108 FPS, while 2.25x DLDSR is getting 143 FPS, only two frames per second slower than running at native 1080p.Of course, you may want to take those impressive results with a grain of salt, as Nvidia\u2019s obviously going to want to show one of the best-case examples. In the real world, you may get different results with different games, both in terms of FPS and what settings you have to run DLDSR in to get it looking crisp. Given its wider game support, though, you\u2019ll probably be able to play around with it using one of your favorite older titles \u2014 though you still will need an RTX card, and they aren\u2019t exactly easy to get right now.Nvidia has had a lot of success with deep learning latelyThis isn\u2019t the first time Nvidia\u2019s used deep learning to improve image quality and performance \u2014 it\u2019s gotten a lot of praise for its Deep Learning Super Sampling, or DLSS, system. However, DLSS needs to be specifically supported by the game, and the list of games you can use it with is relatively small (though, as of today, it includes God of War).AMD, Nvidia\u2019s graphics card competitor, has also announced tech to improve performance and graphics on a wide array of games. It calls its approach Radeon Super Resolution, and while it doesn\u2019t use exactly the same methods as DLSS or DLDSR (AMD has its own upscaling tech called virtual super resolution), it\u2019s aiming towards the same goal.If you want to try out Nvidia\u2019s DLDSR, update to the latest driver, then open up Nvidia Control Panel app. Go to Manage 3D Settings, click the DSR - Factors drop-down, and select one of the DL Scaling options.See More: EntertainmentGamingNewsNvidiaPC GamingTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
