Volume at the open ranks as one of the highest opening levels for\u00a0Nvidia all year.\u00a0The $200 level is key as a large psychological number. Bulls want it to bounce off this level, but bears are persuaded that Nvidia stock dropping below support at $206.50 on Thursday was the key to a broader move lower. Falling below $200 is then in the cards.\nOther growth stocks are also selling off as the Nasdaq Composite sheds 0.8% at about 10:45 AM in New York. At the time of writing, bulls are manning the barricades quite well. NVDA stock is up 0.5% at $202.76. On the 5-minute chart below, it is easy to see that a symmetrical wedge has formed for Friday's session. The apex sits at $201.88, which bodes well for the bulls, at least for now. Dropping below the lower line should lead to a steeper fall off before the close. Likewise, climbing above the top line should engender a positive move as well.\n\nNVDA April 22, 2022 15-minute chart\nNvidia stock (NVDA) collapsed more than 6% on Thursday and lost further ground afterhours. In doing so, NVDA shares broke through an important support at $206.50 that implies a further drop below $200. Shares dropped to $201.83 at market close on Thursday before shedding another half percentage point to $200.90. The psychologically significant $200 level seems doomed to fail fairly soon.\n\u00a0\nNvidia Stock Price: Netflix read-across, agressive Fed lead to worries\nThe now infamous Netflix\u00a0Q1 earnings call handed the streaming leader its first subscriber drop-off in 10 years. Yes, it would not have lost subscribers if not for the 700,000 abandoned accounts that were a casualty of the Russia-Ukraine War, but Netflix would have still only gained about 500,000 during the quarter without that added surprise. Half a million was still much less than the 2 million it\u00a0guided for last earnings call. More than 600,000 accounts were abandoned in the US and Canada alone during Q1 as well.\nNetflix preceded to lose 35% in the following session. As Netflix has spent the past 15-odd years as the quintessential growth stock, the news of its demise and/or fall from grace has affected the entire sector. With Facebook falling off a cliff to start the year and now Netflix, investors are reassessing all their high-mulitple growth stocks. Docusign (DOCU), Roku (ROKU) and Shopify (SHOP) have all suffered related falls this week in light of Netflix. Nvidia as a major member of this group has been treated the same.\nSecond, news from the Federal Reserve has emerged this week that interest rates may increase at a faster pace in a bid to deal resolutely with stubbornly high inflation. Japenese investment bank Nomura now predicts a 50 basis point interest rate hike in May, followed by two 75 basis point jumps in June and July. This would amount to one of the fastest hiking cycles in the Fed's history and could engender a more severe\u00a0sell-off in growth stocks, which typically do better during low interest rate environments.\nLastly, Deutsche Bank reduced its price target on NVDA shares from $285 to $255. This still gives Nvidia stock 25% upside at current prices, but it is in line with other Wall Street firms that have reduced their bullish fervor for Nvidia.\nNvidia Stock Forecast: Breaking $206.50 is a warning\nAny trader should see NVDA stock breaking through $206.50 on Thursday as a clear bearish sign. If you have not already, it is time to sell. The support level from $206.50 to $208.95 has held strong on three separate occasions since the start of the year. Even $210 has worked as solid support for most of the year. At $200 then, Nvidia looks quite weak, though the big round rumber may hold up if investors are lucky. Shares have not traded here since the beginning of October 2021.\nMore likely is that Nvidia will melt down to one of the three support levels that have been indicated on the daily chart below. These are $195.54 from last October, $185.23 from last August and $177.80 from July 2021. Any one of these may hold up in a sell-off, but from this vantage point it is difficult to know which one.\nIf there is a turnaround and Nvidia stock remains above $200, then it quickly needs to regain $206.50 to remain neutral. NVDA would then need to rally above the 21-day moving average, which currently sits at $217.39 (as can be\u00a0seen on the weekly chart). The 200-day moving average above\u00a0$244 is out of the question for now, but that level would prove a bull trend.\n\nNVDA 1-day chart\nAs another way of showing $206.50's importance, just look at the falling wedge scenario the semiconductor has been trading within since December. NVDA shares were able to climb out of the wedge in March but quickly fell back in and then through the bottom support level at $206.50 on Thursday. This action has turned what would have been a bullish sign into a demonstrably bearish signal. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 40 proves that the market can stomach another leg down for Nvidia shares at its present location. It may not be oversold until the $180s.\nNVDA 1-week\u00a0chart\n\nShare:\n\n  Feed news\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

It is not surprising, though. The company is a leader in the industry and has stellar margins that prove its potential. Most importantly, it is a company that is helping multiple companies grow and expand within the tech sector. Despite the supply chain issues, NVDA stock is up 27.9% over the past six months. It was trading at $207 at the end of September and is trading at $264 today. The stock hasn\u2019t fallen much despite the overall market slump and tech sell-off.\nNvidia has a reach across several industries including graphics, gaming, supercomputing, autonomous driving, machine learning, the metaverse, artificial intelligence, robotics, and automotive. This clearly shows that the company is not dependent on a single industry for growth and all of these industries are growing at a rapid rate. I believe Nvidia holds a strong position in the industry and its bottom line will continue to grow. The company is irreplaceable and NVDA stock is the one to own and hold for a decade.\n\n\n\nNVDA\nNvidia Corporation\n$264.65\n\n\n\n\nMassive Opportunity Outside The Gaming Sector\nNvidia seems to have set the gold standard in graphics processing units (GPUs) and the majority of its revenue flows from the gaming segment. However, it looks like the company is ready to shift focus. At the GPU Technology Conference, the company increased its addressable market opportunity to $1 trillion with a breakup of $300 billion each for automotive, chips, and software with only $100 billion for gaming. The company is making the right moves to ensure that it captures the thriving market. It already holds a strong position in the gaming segment, which means the company is ready to move toward dominating the other industries.\nThe company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jensen Huang stated that Nvidia has an \u201c$11 billion vehicle tech order pipeline over the next six years.\u201d Huang added that it could be really significant for the business in the automotive industry.\nThe automotive industry could drive continuous growth for the company. The CEO believes that it could be the next multi-million dollar business for Nvidia. It has signed contracts with Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID), Daimlers\u2019\u00a0(OTCMKTS:DMLRY) Mercedes Benz, and BYD Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) for the driving systems. Nvidia aims to increase the revenue from the automotive sector in the coming years and it will impact the bottom line.\n\nWall Street Loves NVDA Stock\nEvercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse considers Nvidia as the most important technology company today. The analyst has an Outperform rating for the stock with a price target of $375. Muse added that besides having the best-in-class hardware solutions with its GPUs, the company is also expanding its portfolio and depending on the expertise across central processing units (CPUs) and data processing units (DPUs). To ensure these devices run smoothly, Nvidia also has software at the foundation level and the application-specific level, which will help the expansion of artificial intelligence.\nIvan Feinseth, a Tigress Financial analyst has a price target of $410 for NVDA stock with a Buy rating. After the recent analyst day and GPU Technology Conference, where the company highlighted its products, the analyst added that Nvidia continues to evolve as the leading artificial intelligence processing provider in the world.\nThe Bottom Line on NVDA Stock\nI have always loved NVDA stock and the recent technology conference threw light on how much potential the company has. There is ample room to grow and Nvidia will certainly make the most of the opportunity. Besides the metaverse and artificial intelligence, the company also has a solid growth opportunity in the automotive industry and it has strong plans for it.\nNVDA stock is a strong buy and hold for the long-term.

On Sunday, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said investors are growing increasingly concerned that declining gaming card prices suggest\u00a0demand from cryptocurrency miners and gamers could be falling.\nThe Numbers: Gaming makes up about 45% of Nvidia's total sales, and it includes gaming cards purchased by both gamers and crypto miners. In addition, Nvidia's custom Nintendo Switch console chips make up a large portion of its gaming segment revenue. Arya said Nvidia gaming cards prices are now down to between 10% and 15% above MSRP, well off of peak prices of more than 100% above MSRP.\nRelated Link: Why This HP Analyst Remains Skeptical Even After Warren Buffett's $4.2B Investment\nArya said falling prices have investors concerned about a repeat of the company's 2018 cycle, when PC gaming sales dropped 28% and crypto mining\u00a0demand dried up as crypto prices crashed. The company's overall gaming segment revenue dropped 45% from peak levels.\nHow To Play It: The good news for Nvidia stock investors is that Arya said the stock is already pricing in at least a 25% cut to Nvidia's 2022 gaming sales. He\u00a0said Nvidia's current valuation is already seemingly pricing in a downturn identical to 2018.\n\t\t\n\n\n\"So all-in, we believe an apples-apples cut is already well reflected, while a (lower-probability-since console supplies tight) worse situation would suggest further downside,\" Arya said.\nDespite the potential gaming headwinds, Arya has a Buy rating and $320 price target for NVDA stock.\nBenzinga's Take: If 2018 is any indication, long-term investors should be buying the dip in Nvidia shares hand-over-fist. Since the end of 2018, Nvidia shares are up more than 480%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNVIDIA NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX PRO Comes to Workstations and Servers for Designers, Developers, Data Scientists and Creatives to Build and Collaborate With Agentic AIGlobeNewswire 25m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces DGX Spark and DGX Station Personal AI ComputersGlobeNewswire 27m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces Spectrum-X Photonics, Co-Packaged Optics Networking Switches to Scale AI Factories to Millions of GPUsGlobeNewswire 42m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell Ultra AI Factory Platform Paves Way for Age of AI ReasoningGlobeNewswire 52m \n\n\n\nNvidia GTC 2025: Rubin, reasoning, robotics and moreSeeking Alpha 1h \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Dynamo Open-Source Library Accelerates and Scales AI Reasoning ModelsGlobeNewswire 1h \n\n\n\nGeneral Motors and NVIDIA Collaborate on AI for Next-Generation Vehicle Experience and ManufacturingGlobeNewswire 2h \n\n\n\nNVIDIA and Telecom Industry Leaders to Develop AI-Native Wireless Networks for 6GGlobeNewswire 2h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStart Trading Futures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n\n\n\n\nNVDA\n\n\n\n116.20\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-3.33 (-2.79%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:25:19 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time NVDA charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFind News\n\t\t\t\tNews\n\n\n\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n            See also:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                - Explore more categories\n            \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

A couple of factors seem to be operating at crosscurrents. On the one hand, interest rates are heading higher, with the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rising past 2.8% to its highest yield in four years.\nAnd granted, \"2.8%\" may not sound like a lot of money relative to the more than 38% that Nvidia stock is up over the past 52 weeks. But interest on Treasury bonds is the closest thing you'll find to a risk-free investment in this market, and the higher bond yields go, the less interested investors will be in investing money in volatile tech stocks like Nvidia, which can lose money even faster than they gain money.\n(Hint: Although up 38% over the last 52 weeks, Nvidia stock is also down 34% over the last five months).\n\n\n\n\n\nNow what\nOn the other hand, though, investors also have to read the tea leaves from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSM -1.36%) earnings report late last week, which showed the company thrashing earnings estimates with a $1.40 per-share quarterly profit -- and better-than-expected sales as well. \u00a0\nAs a contract manufacturer for major semiconductor clients that include Nvidia itself, TSMC is something of a bellwether for the chips industry, and if business is going well for TSMC in April, then this probably bodes well for Nvidia's own quarterly earnings report, which is due out next month. \u00a0\nOne note of caution, though, before you join the stampede of Nvidia stock buyers: TSMC warned that its second-quarter sales might come in a bit short of what analysts have been forecasting. That cautious forecast kept the lid on stock price gains at TSMC last week.

A leader in the creation of graphics chips and cards for gaming, in addition to content creation, the company has morphed into one of the preeminent artificial intelligence processing companies on Earth. Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang (the company\u2019s current CEO), Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, the trio of engineers didn\u2019t expect the silicon they were building would eventually be chosen to power supercomputers at facilities, including The Energy Department\u2019s Los Alamos National Laboratory.  The firm, which initially focused on gaming and entertainment products, launched its first chip, the NV1, in 1995. While it wasn\u2019t a massive success, it did put Nvidia on video game maker Sega\u2019s map. Sega originally considered using Nvidia\u2019s NV2 chip in its Dreamcast console, but later abandoned the effort. In 1996, Nvidia launched its first Microsoft (MSFT) DirectX drivers, specialized software used to render 3D graphics on Windows-based PCs. The following year, the company launched its first hit product the NV3, otherwise known as the Riva 128. Nvidia would later go on to sell a whopping 1 million units in the card\u2019s first four months of availability, helping generate revenue for the research and development of future products.   In January of 1999, Nvidia hit the public markets at $12 per share, and by 2000, Nvidia\u2019s market position was strong enough to swallow former rival 3DFX. The same year, Microsoft chose the chip giant to power the graphics in its first Xbox console. Eventually, Nvidia\u2019s graphics capabilities moved beyond gaming. In 2003, the company not only worked with Blizzard on the launch of its massively popular \u201cWorld of Warcraft,\u201d it also teamed up with NASA to create a photorealistic simulation of Mars. Nvidia continued its work with console makers in 2005 when Sony chose the company to power the graphics in its PlayStation 3. Five years later, Nvidia became the graphics chip supplier for Audi, powering the interfaces for the automaker\u2019s various vehicles. In 2015, the company launched its Nvidia Drive chip for powering driver assistance systems.  In 2016, Nvidia went all in on AI with its DGX-1 server for artificial intelligence applications. Since then, the company has continued to pour money into its AI capabilities. The company\u2019s stock price has matched that march, rising from $7.40 per share in 2016 to $70.25 by the end of 2018, thanks to its data center offerings and a run on graphics cards for crypto mining. Two years later, Nvidia launched its RTX platform, which brought real-time ray-tracing technologies to games and digital graphics spaces. The tech makes it so that lighting in graphics applications looks as realistic as real life, dramatically improving immersion.   Story Continues   Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, makes a point at his keynote address at CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. January 7, 2018. REUTERS/Rick Wilking  \u00b7 Rick Wilking / reutersToday, Nvidia continues to power the graphics in gaming PCs and consoles around the world. But it\u2019s gone far beyond that. In March 2022, the company debuted its first discrete CPU for data centers and announced it is using its version of the metaverse, called Omniverse, to better understand climate change.While the global chip shortage has made it difficult for consumers to get their hands on new Nvidia cards, they\u2019re still among the most sought after on the market.However, Nvidia isn\u2019t alone in the graphics chip market. AMD (AMD) has its own line of powerful Radeon chips, and Intel (INTC) is moving forward with its own discrete graphics chips for laptops and desktops, putting further pressure on Nvidia to continue holding its position as the leader in graphics technology.Still, for a company that's gone from three engineers working on a graphics card, to thousands of employees working on chips that will power the AI supercomputers of the future, Nvidia remains at the top of its game.

That\u2019s a positive for CLF stock as it smashes Wall Street\u2019s adjusted EPS estimate of $1.40 for the period. It\u2019s also a massive jump over the 7 cents per share reported during the same time last year.\nAnother positive for CLF stock comes from the company\u2019s revenue of $6 billion. Yet again, this comes in well above the $5.46 billion that analysts\u2019 were looking for. It\u2019s also a major increase over the $4 billion reported in the first quarter of 2021.\nLourenco Goncalves, chairman, president and CEO of Cleveland-Cliffs, said this in the earnings report boosting CLF stock higher today.\n\u201cOur first quarter results are a clear indication of the success we have been able to achieve as we renewed our fixed-price contracts last year. Despite the decline in spot prices for steel from Q4 to Q1 and its lagged impact on our results, we were able to continue to deliver strong profitability. As this trend persists, we expect to set another free cash flow record in 2022.\u201d\nOn top of all of this, Cleveland-Cliffs also revealed an updated outlook for 2022. This has it expecting its average selling price to come in at $1,445 per net ton. That\u2019s a $220 jump from its previous guidance of $1,225 per net ton. It attributes this to \u201chigher than expected prices on renewals of fixed-price contracts,\u201d and other factors.\nCLF stock is up 4.7% as of Friday morning and is up 43.1% since the start of the year.\nInvestors looking for more recent stock market news will want to keep reading!\n\nWe\u2019ve got all the latest stock news that traders need to know about for Friday.

Keppel Infrastructure Holdings has entered into a master research collaboration agreement with the National University of Singapore (NUS). The agreement was made in a bid to bolster the former\u2019s low-carbon energy innovation and translational research and development of solutions in smart grid, renewables and clean energy, as well as decarbonisation technologies.   The partnership will also provide educational and training opportunities for students in NUS. It will also provide opportunities for open collaboration with other ecosystem players such as start-ups, SMEs and researchers. Under the agreement, Keppel Infrastructure and NUS will tap into the NUS Kent Ridge campus for the Keppel Infrastructure-NUS Low Carbon Living Laboratory, where they will create, test bed and scale up several trials including the deployment of commercially viable innovations in distributed energy management and the integration of solar photovoltaics (PV). Both Keppel Infrastructure and NUS have already jointly identified technologically proven innovations to test bed, demonstrate and adapt in live environments and system as well as subsystem integration. The selected projects include novel electric vehicle (EV) charging strategies, smart AC/DC hybrid microgrid, innovative district cooling systems (DCS) for buildings integrated with thermal energy storage as well as the experimentation and laboratory proof-of-concept on enhanced seawater desalination pre-treatment technology for carbon dioxide sequestration and scalant removal.   Cindy Lim, CEO of Keppel Infrastructure, says, \u201cWe are redoubling our efforts in sustainability-linked innovation and technology development to sharpen Keppel Infrastructure\u2019s competitive advantage in the low-carbon economy, and to partner and add value to industries and our customers in their green transition.\u201d \u201cTo this end, we are excited to forge this significant partnership with NUS to accelerate the commercial deployment of innovative energy technologies, leveraging digitalisation and decentralisation for speed and scale. This is in line with Keppel\u2019s Vision 2030 which places sustainability firmly at the core of the company\u2019s strategy,\u201d she adds. Professor Chen Tsuhan, NUS deputy president (Research and Technology), says, \u201cNUS is very excited to harness our strong capabilities in energy and sustainability research in this collaboration with Keppel Infrastructure to co-create commercially viable solutions for a smooth green transition. The NUS Kent Ridge campus will serve as a vibrant living laboratory, where innovative solutions are tested in a realistic operational environment before they are deployed at a larger scale. These technological capabilities will in turn help enhance the climate resilience of our campuses.\u201d   Story continues   Shares in Keppel Corporation, Keppel Infrastructure\u2019s parent company, closed 5 cents higher or 0.76% up at $6.60 on April 19.

In 15 Dec 2021, the Government announced that ABSD rates will be raised with effect from 16 Dec 2021, as part of a package of measures to cool the private residential and HDB resale markets. But the nationals from these five countries, just like Singapore citizens, are exempt from the current rate of the Additional Buyer\u2019s Stamp Duty (ABSD) levied on foreigners when they purchase residential properties. The ABSD for foreigners in Singapore is 30%. For Singapore Citizens, as far as Stamp Duty treatment is concerned, there is no ABSD on their first residential property. What is ABSD? ABSD is a property tax that\u2019s levied on top of Buyer\u2019s Stamp Duty (a tax that property buyers have to pay when they buy a property), and it\u2019s computed based on the valuation or the selling price of the property, whichever is higher. Liable buyers are required to pay ABSD on top of the existing Buyer\u2019s Stamp Duty (BSD). ABSD and BSD are computed on the purchase price as stated in the dutiable document or the market value of the property (whichever is the higher amount). How Do You Calculate ABSD? For instance, say if a property is valued at $1 million but the selling price is $1.1 million. Assuming that you\u2019re subjected to 12% ABSD, the ABSD amount that you\u2019ll need to pay is $1.1 million X 12% = $132,000. Who Needs to Pay ABSD? ABSD applies to the following group of buyers: Singapore Citizens: ABSD will be levied on the second (17%) and subsequent (25%) property purchases Singapore Permanent Residents (PRs): ABSD will be levied on all purchases. The first purchase will be 5% while the second purchase will be 25%, and third and subsequent purchases will be 30%. Foreigners: 30% ABSD for any property purchase Entities (companies or associations): 35% for each property (plus additional 5% non-remittable ABSD for developers)    source: IRAS  As a result of Free Trade Agreements signed by the Singapore Government, nationals and permanent residents of these five countries are accorded the same property Stamp Duty treatment as Singapore Citizens. The Free Trade Agreements signed with the United States of America and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), provides these exemptions to the residents of these countries. Those who are able to enjoy this remission of ABSD are: Nationals of the United States of America; and Nationals and Permanent Residents of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland    Story continues This means that if you are a citizen of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland or United States of America, instead of paying an additional 30% for the ABSD, you do not need to pay any ABSD at all on your first residential property purchase in Singapore. And the ABSD would be 17% for your second residential property and 25% for your third and subsequent properties.This applies to only private non-landed residential properties, as foreigners are not allowed to purchase and own land in Singapore with the only exception being the luxurious water-front bungalows on Sentosa Cove.Foreign investors who are eligible can submit an application of remission through their legal representative who can manage their stump duty treatment and transactions with the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) on your behalf.The ABSD liability will depend on the profile of the buyer as at the date of purchase or acquisition of the residential property:A. Whether the buyer is an individual or an entityB. The profile of the buyer andC. The count of residential properties owned by the buyerIs the Buyer an Individual or an Entity matters for Stamp Duty treatmentAn entity means a person who is not an individual. It includes the following:An unincorporated association A trustee for a collective investment scheme when acting in that capacity A trustee-manager for a business trust when acting in that capacity The partners of the partnership whether or not any of them is an individual, where the property conveyed, transferred or assigned is to be held as partnership property If a property is jointly purchased by buyers of different profiles, the profile with the highest ABSD rate will apply on the entire value purchased.If A purchases a residential property to be held on trust for the beneficial owner B, ABSD is charged based on the profile of the beneficial owner, B.Profile of the BuyerThe applicable ABSD rate is based on the profile of the buyer on the date of purchase. You must have been granted the Singapore Citizenship status or Singapore Permanent Resident status by the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (ICA) as at the date of property purchase in order to enjoy lower ABSD liability. The date of issue reflected in the IC collection slip would be taken as when the status was granted.When must ABSD and BSD be paid?BSD and ABSD must be paid within 14 days after the date of the signed Contract or Agreement. Where the Contract or Agreement is executed (signed) overseas, BSD and ABSD must be paid within 30 days after the receipt of the Contract or Agreement in Singapore. A document is considered to be duly stamped only when stamp duty is fully paid. Audit checks will be conducted by IRAS to ensure that BSD and ABSD are duly paid. Under the Stamp Duties Act, a penalty of 4 times the amount of unpaid duty can be imposed.Can you defer the payment of Stamp Duty?Stamp duty is an upfront cost that a buyer has to consciously set aside when he decides to purchase a property. It must be paid in full and cannot be deferred. Inadequate payment or late payment of stamp duty is tantamount to non-stamping and penalties would apply.ASBD was first introduced in December 2011 as a \u201ccooling measure\u201d to discourage foreigners and entities from purchasing residential properties, especially multiple properties. The latest round of cooling measures took effect on 16 December. Aside from tightened loan limits which saw the Loan-to-Value (LTV) limit for HDB-granted loans dip from 90% to 85% and Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) threshold tightening, dropping from 60% to 55%, ABSD rates were adjusted.The post Stamp Duty treatment for some foreigners are the same as for Singaporeans appeared first on iCompareLoan.

Whole genome, whole exome and targeted-panel sequencing are more widely used today in clinical research and practice, to diagnose cancers and identify the course of treatment for cancer patients based on tumor mutations. This has led to the formation of consortia dedicated to studying cancer genomics at a large scale3,5. As the volume of data increases, the algorithms and workflows used to analyze the data are proving to be the primary bottleneck. NVIDIA Clara Parabricks addresses this issue by providing an accelerated, scalable, and reproducible software suite optimized for genomic analysis on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).\nIn a previous blog post, we discussed the germline variant calling tools available in Clara Parabricks. In this post, we will provide an overview of how to perform somatic variant analysis for cancer workflows using Parabricks from the AWS Marketplace. Somatic variants are genetic alterations which are not inherited but acquired during one\u2019s lifespan, for example those that are present in a tumor. In this post, we will demonstrate how to perform somatic variant calling from matched tumor and normal, as well as tumor-only whole genome and whole exome datasets using an NVIDIA GPU-accelerated Parabricks pipeline and compare the results with baseline CPU-based workflows.\nSomatic variant calling pipeline overview\nThe Parabricks somatic variant workflow starts with tumor and normal bam files as input for five state of art somatic variant calling tools Mutect2, MuSE, Somatic Sniper, LoFreq \u2013 which are GPU accelerated in the Clara Parabricks software suite \u2013 and Strelka2, which is not. The vcf output of these algorithms can be used to generate consensus vcf or intersection vcf for downstream secondary analysis. Parabricks also provides another important feature where users can provide a set of normal samples to create a panel of normal (PON). Mutect2 can be run in tumor-only mode, with or without a panel of normal (PON).\n\n\nFigure 1: Overview of NVIDIA Clara Parabricks somatic variant calling software suite \u2013 Mutect2, MuSE, Somatic Sniper and LoFreq are GPU accelerated (highlighted in green), while Strelka2 is not (highlighted in blue).\n\nDataset used\nIn this post, we will use the ~50x Tumor/Normal short-read human data from the Somatic Mutation Working Group of the SEQC26-9 consortium. The dataset consists of both whole genome and whole exome HCC1395 (triple negative breast cancer cell line) and HCC1395 BL (matched normal cell line), sequenced on multiple platforms with multiple technical replicates. The WGS data had ~55x mean coverage for tumor and normal, and the WES data had ~100x for tumor and 80x for normal sample. We chose this dataset, because it is well characterized, and the consortium provides a Truth set for the somatic variant calls.\nRunning NVIDIA Clara Parabricks Somatic Workflow\nWe detailed how to subscribe and use the NVIDIA Clara Parabricks AMI from the AWS Marketplace in the previous post on benchmarking the germline pipeline. We followed the same prerequisites and initial setup from that post up until \u201cStep 3. Download data\u201d where we shifted to leveraging resources for the somatic pipeline benchmark.\nWe ran 4 variant callers (Mutect2, Somatic Sniper, Muse and LoFreq) on the SEQC2 dataset. The details of the command line options to download the data and run each of these variant callers can be found at this GitHub repository the Clara Parabricks team have provided for this blog post. You can also find a more detailed overview of somatic variant calling tools available in Clara Parabricks within the NVIDIA documentation.\nResults\nRuntime comparison with respect to the baseline CPU algorithms versus GPU accelerated NVIDIA Clara Parabricks variant callers.\nThe NVIDIA Clara Parabricks software can run on different NVIDIA GPUs instances like the Amazon EC2 G4, P3, and P4, but here we will focus on the Parabricks runs on g4dn.12xlarge (4 NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs) runs in comparison to the baseline callers that were run on an m5.8xlarge (32 vCPU) instance.\nRuntime comparison of Parabricks versus the CPU-based baseline callers on seqc2 WGS shows a significant speedup ranging from 4x for LoFreq, 6.5x for MuSE, 9x for Somatic Sniper and 42x acceleration for Mutect2 (tumor/normal mode) relative to the baseline callers detailed runtime for each caller is represented in Figure 2. If users want to run tumor-only somatic variant calling, Parabricks provides the ability to do so with 56x acceleration relative to Mutect2 baseline caller (Figure 2).\n\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of execution time (minutes) for running the NVIDIA Clara Parabricks somatic variant calling pipeline on the SEQC2 dataset on g4dn.12x large (NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPU) vs m5.8xlarge (32 vCPU) instance types. Parabricks shows significant acceleration (4x-56x) as compared to the corresponding CPU-based baseline caller. **Strelka2 was excluded from this analysis, since it is not accelerated.\n\nConcordance analysis\nThe concordance analysis of the output VCFs generated from the NVIDIA Clara Parabricks somatic callers to the baseline somatic callers was performed using GATK Concordance tools. The SNV recall and precision performance was performed using the baseline caller output vcf files as truth set and evaluating the vcf file generated using NVIDIA Clara Parabricks represented in (Figure 3). The concordance (F1-score) was 100% for MuSE, LoFreq and Somatic Sniper followed by Mutect2 tumor-only mode and Mutect2 tumor/normal mode 99.99% and 99.96% respectively. Similarly, for INDELS we achieved F1-score 99.99% and 99.94% for Mutect2 tumor-only mode and Mutect2 tumor/normal mode respectively (Figure 4). The reason for the difference in the Mutect2 results is due to the underlying algorithm that uses random number generation, resulting in a non-deterministic output. In contrast, NVIDIA Clara Parabricks is focused on providing more deterministic results on different hardware platforms.\n\n\nFigure 3: Single nucleotide variant calling performance comparison of accelerated NVIDIA Clara Parabricks callers versus the baseline counterparts for Recall and Precision on a WGS dataset. Note that precision and recall for each of the callers relative to baseline > 0.9995.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: INDEL variant calling performance comparison of accelerated Mutect2 versus baseline Mutect2 for Recall and Precision. The accelerated Mutect2 indel precision and recall performance was almost identical to baseline > 0.999.\n\nCost of running somatic variant calling using NVIDIA Clara Parabricks\nIn-addition to acceleration and accuracy, NVIDIA Clara Parabricks also provides the advantage of minimizing the processing cost per sample. Overall, Parabricks demonstrates a reduction in cost ranging from 2-fold for LoFreq to 16-fold for Mutect2 tumor-only run. In addition to being faster and highly concordant with the corresponding baseline variant callers, Parabricks is also significantly cheaper on a per-sample basis, making it more feasible to perform large-scale exome/genome studies (Figure5).\nAll the WGS/WES analysis was performed in the AWS us-east-1 region, pricing in other regions may vary. The costs below are based on EC2 instance runtimes (billed per second), and do not include the NVIDIA Parabricks AMI license cost (billed per hour). As of the time of publishing, the license cost is $0.30/hour in all Regions. Including licensing, Clara Parabricks is still significantly cheaper to use. For example, the all-up cost of running MuSE is $15.03 compared to the unaccelerated costs of >$37.\n\n\nFigure 5. Estimated cost to run NVIDIA Clara Parabricks accelerated somatic variant caller (green) versus baseline variant caller CPU (blue). Clara Parabricks provides cost-effective solution for WGS.\n\nSimilarly, the runtime, performance, and cost estimation numbers for the exome dataset are represented in Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure8.\n\n\nFigure 6: Runtime comparison of NVIDIA Clara Parabricks versus the baseline variant callers for WES dataset. Run 4 Clara Parabricks accelerated variant callers in less than 40 min. on 100x WES dataset.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: SNV variant calling performance of accelerated NVIDIA Clara Parabricks callers versus their baseline counterparts for Recall and Precision on WES dataset. Accelerated variant callers provided identical results in comparison to base line except Mutect2 where we achieved >99.99 F1 score.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Cost of running NVIDIA Clara Parabricks versus the baseline variant callers for WES dataset. Clara Parabricks provides 4-14x reduction in the WES variant analysis cost.\n\nConclusion\nThe Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) bioinformatics workflows for somatic variant calling using baseline callers are slow and have become the computational bottleneck as the sequencing throughput increases. Here, NVIDIA Clara Parabricks takes advantage of NVIDIA\u2019s GPU architecture and provides a comprehensive, fast, and cost-effective somatic variant analysis solution. Parabricks provides 4x to 56x acceleration compared to the baseline callers. Parabricks\u2019 somatic variant calling pipeline exhibits a huge advantage over the conventional baseline pipeline by providing a faster, scalable, reproducible, and cost-effective solution without compromising on the accuracy in comparison to standard pipelines. We will continue to expand the bioinformatics tools in Parabricks. NVIDIA provides detailed documentation on Parabricks at its website.

The site had previously been launched for tender last November at the same reserve price, which had closed on Jan 6 without a buyer.  See also: Lakepoint Condominium relaunched for collective sale at $640 mil Prior to this, Sixth Avenue Centre had also been put up for collective sale in 2018. An initial tender launch in January 2018 saw the site placed on the market at a guide price of $90.5 million, before subsequently being relaunched for tender a second time in July 2018 with a lower guide price of $86 million. Completed in the mid-1980s, Sixth Avenue Centre consists of seven shops and 18 apartments. It occupies a prominent corner plot of 15,009 sq ft at the junction of Bukit Timah Road and Sixth Avenue. It is a three-minute walk away from the Sixth Avenue MRT Station on the Downtown Line.    Map and overview of Sixth Avenue Centre (Source: EdgeProp LandLens) Under the URA Master Plan 2019, Sixth Avenue Centre is zoned for commercial and residential use. Based on the site\u2019s gross plot ratio of 3.0, it has a maximum allowable gross floor area of 45,028 sq ft, with up to 40% of the total GFA allowed for commercial use and the remaining 60% for residential use. (Find Singapore commercial properties with our commercial directory) The guide price of $85 million translates to a land rate of $1,861 psf per plot ratio (ppr), inclusive of the development charge payable to build up to a plot ratio of 3.0 as well as the bonus balcony space.  In 2018, the URA had given approval for the site\u2019s residential portion to be retained as serviced residences. The future developer of the site will also be required to amalgamate a small portion of remnant land at the splayed corner junction at Sixth Avenue. This extra state land, spanning an estimated 915 sq ft, is expected to reduce the average land cost to $1,788 psf ppr on the overall site, says Cushman & Wakefield, which is marketing the property. \u201cIn addition to its prime location within the affluent suburbia precincts of District 10, and coupled with a young population and high purchasing power, Sixth Avenue Centre presents a compelling opportunity for developers and investors to build and own an exclusive suburban boutique project,\u201d says Christina Sim, director of capital markets at Cushman & Wakefield.

Before moving out for security reasons, even President Halimah Yacob herself was living in a jumbo flat in Yishun! Now that the pandemic has raised the amount of time spent working from home and increased the need for personal space, bigger flats are looking even more attractive. In fact, space and privacy are in such high demand that more single millennials and unmarried couples are moving out of their families\u2019 homes, and the resale market is still booming in spite of the recent property cooling measures, according to the PropertyGuru Singapore Property Market Report Q1 2022.  Even as we transition into a post-pandemic world, the results of our Singapore Consumer Sentiment Study H1 2022 show that the preference for larger homes is likely to endure. With 4 in 10 Singaporeans preferring remote work (over a bigger bonus), we think the WFH arrangements are here to stay. For those who can afford them, HDB jumbo flats are one of the most value-for-money options, offering large living spaces at HDB prices. So let's dive in to better understand what are HDB jumbo flats and affordable options you can purchase. What Are HDB Jumbo Flats? Formed from the merger of two flats, jumbo HDB flats tend to be much bigger than your average 3-room and 4-room HDB flat, at about 147 to 199 sqm (1,582 to 2,142 square feet). To put things into context, a typical 3-room flat is about 68 sqm and a 4-room flat is about 90 sqm. This makes jumbo HDB flats particularly attractive for multi-generational families. As the HDB is not currently planning to build more jumbo flats, the only way to get your hands on one is to buy it on the HDB resale market. Alternatively, HDB\u2019s Conversion Scheme allows homeowners to purchase two compatible adjoining flats and combine them into a single unit.  According to a 2017 Straits Times article, jumbo flats were priced at about $650,000 to $950,000, but these days even far-flung jumbo flats can cost close to a million dollars. But guess what, there are still some affordable hidden gems on the resale market, and we\u2019ll prove it by finding some jumbo flats priced at $850,000 and below.

Greg Corke looks at how the RTX A4500 stacks up in real-time viz, GPU rendering and VR workflows\n\n\nWhen Nvidia launched the 20 GB Nvidia RTX A4500 professional workstation GPU in November 2021, it took us a bit by surprise. We didn\u2019t really see a need for a product to sit between the RTX A4000 (16 GB) and RTX A5000 (24 GB). The gap simply wasn\u2019t that big.\nBut these are no ordinary times. The ongoing global semiconductor shortage has meant supply of the RTX A4000 and RTX A5000 has been patchy to say the least. Since these \u2018Ampere\u2019 GPUs launched in Spring 2021, they have been very hard to get hold of. And some of the inflated prices we have seen online have been quite eye watering.\nThe RTX A4500 is a cut-down version of the RTX A5000. Its launch appears to have been driven largely by the silicon and components that Nvidia had at its disposal. In fact, at Nvidia\u2019s GTC event at the end of March, the company launched another new GPU, the Nvidia RTX A5500, a cut-down version of the RTX A6000.\nNvidia told DEVELOP3D that the A5500 not only gives customers a bit of a performance boost over the A5000, but improves the \u2018overall availability of supply\u2019. The company admits that it would have been limited if it was only producing the RTX A5000 all year long.\nWhat is the RTX A4500?\nWith a dual-slot PCIe form factor, the RTX A4500 looks identical to the RTX A5000 and it is much closer in specs than it is to the single-slot RTX A4000.\nCompared to the RTX A5000, it has 4 GB less memory, but features the same GA102 graphics processor, albeit with some cores disabled, a slightly lower clock speed and a slightly lower power draw (200 Watts vs 230 Watts via a single 8-pin PCIe power connector).\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nThe feature set of the RTX A4500 and A5000 is virtually identical \u2013 four DisplayPort 1.4a connectors, 3D stereo, and NVLink \u2014 so two A4500 GPUs can be physically connected to scale performance and double the memory to 40 GB in supported applications. This could be to boost 3D frame rates in pro viz applications like Autodesk VRED Professional, or to render large scenes, faster in GPU renderers like Chaos V-Ray.\nThe one main difference between the GPUs is that the RTX A4500 does not support Nvidia virtual GPU (vGPU) software. So, if you want to virtualise the graphics card to serve multiple users in a virtual workstation, you\u2019ll need the RTX A5000, A5500 or A6000.\n\nRTX A4500 \u2013 On test\nWe put the RTX A4500 through a series of real-world application benchmarks, for GPU rendering and real-time visualisation.\nAll tests were carried out using the Intel Core i9-12900K-based Scan 3XS GWP-ME A124C workstation at 4K (3,840 x 2,160) resolution using the latest 511.09 Nvidia driver.\nYou can read our full review of the workstation on page 57. See below for a summary of the specs.\n\u2022 Intel Core i9 12900K CPU\n\u2022 128 GB memory\n\u2022 2 TB Samsung 980 Pro NVMe SSD\n\u2022 Microsoft Windows 11 Pro 64-bit\nFor comparison, we tested an Nvidia RTX A4000 GPU in the same workstation. We did not have an Nvidia RTX A5000 in our possession, so took results from our June 2021 review . Back then, our test machine was different, a Scan 3XS GWP-ME A132R with an AMD Ryzen 5950X CPU, running Windows 10 Professional.\nUnreal Engine Audi car configurator\nWith the AMD Ryzen 5950X having a different architecture and lower instructions per clock (IPC), and the workstation running a different OS, there\u2019s a hint of an apples and pears comparison here. However, the results should still give a pretty good indication of relative performance.\nOne might expect the AMD CPU to bring down scores slightly in some of our realtime 3D tests. However, as most of these benchmarks are very GPU-limited, where the GPU is the bottleneck, rather than the CPU, we wouldn\u2019t expect the CPU to influence the results that much.\nIn our GPU rendering tests, as the role of the CPU is minimal, the comparison should be very precise.\nReal-time performance\nThere wasn\u2019t a huge performance difference between the RTX A4500 and RTX A5000 in our real-time 3D tests. With our automotive test model in Autodesk VRED Professional, for example, the RTX A5000 was between 1.75% and 3.10% faster than the RTX A4500, depending on the level of anti-aliasing applied.\nWe experienced similar in arch viz tool Enscape, with a difference of 2.85% when testing our large office scene. The RTX A5000 pulled ahead more in Unreal Engine, especially when real-time ray tracing was enabled on the Audi automotive model.\nThe gap between the RTX A4000 and RTX A4500 was much bigger. This isn\u2019t entirely surprising, as the RTX A4000 is a single-slot card, draws up to 140 W of power and features the lower spec GA104 processor. The RTX A4500 was around 20% to 25% faster than the RTX A4000 across the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU rendering\nIn our GPU rendering benchmarks, the lead of the RTX A5000 over the RTX A4500 was much bigger.\nIn the Chaos V-Ray RTX benchmark, for example, it was 9.5% faster, rising to 26% in KeyShot 10. This may be because these benchmarks use all three types of processing cores \u2013 CUDA, Tensor and RT (see box below).\nThe RTX A4500 was consistently faster than the RTX A4000, between 20% and 26% in most of our tests.\nYou can read more about our testing process in our June 2021 review of the Nvidia RTX A4000 and RTX A5000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIt\u2019s a very interesting time for professional workstation GPUs, and GPUs in general. While you might have your eye on a specific model in terms of features and price/performance, what you end up buying might be dictated more by what\u2019s available in the channel. UK workstation manufacturer Scan, for example, currently has a \u2018significant quantity\u2019 of RTX A4500s available for workstation builds, while the RTX A5000 remains in short supply.\nThe introduction of the RTX A4500 (and, last month, the RTX A5500) certainly gives customers options. If you\u2019re looking for a powerful viz-focused GPU with lots of memory, then the RTX A4500 and RTX A5000 both pack a real punch. The price differential isn\u2019t huge. And, with a little bit of luck, you may find one that fits your budget and workflows precisely.\n\nWhat are Nvidia RTX GPUS?\nNvidia RTX GPUs are professional graphics cards designed specifically for workstations. They are standard in most Dell Precision, HP Z, Fujitsu Celsius and Lenovo ThinkStation workstations, and are also offered in workstations from smaller manufacturers such as BOXX, Scan and Workstation Specialists.\nNvidia RTX GPUs tend to have more memory than their consumer \u2018GeForce RTX\u2019 counterparts, so they can handle larger datasets, both in terms of geometry and textures. For example, the topend Nvidia RTX A6000 features 48 GB of memory, while the mainstream Nvidia RTX A2000 comes in 6 GB and 12 GB variants. In the higher-end models, the memory includes Error Correcting Code (ECC) support to protect against crashes.\nThere\u2019s also a difference in software. With special professional graphics drivers, Nvidia RTX GPUs are certified for a range of pro applications and are tested by independent software vendors (ISVs) and the major workstation manufacturers.\n\nNvidia RTX graphics cards include three types of processing cores:\n\u2022 Nvidia \u2018Ampere\u2019 CUDA cores for general purpose processing;\n\u2022 3rd Gen Nvidia Tensor cores for AI and machine learning;\n\u2022 2nd Gen Nvidia RT cores that are dedicated to ray tracing.\nDifferent applications support these cores in different ways. Most CAD and BIM applications, for example, simply use the CUDA cores for rasterisation, to turn vector data into pixels (a raster image).\nOn the other hand, an increasing number of visualisation tools can use all three types of cores. Real-time arch viz software Enscape, for example, can use CUDA for rasterisation, RT cores to accelerate ray tracing calculations and Tensor cores for Nvidia Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS).\nDLSS allows scenes to be rendered in real time at lower resolutions and then deep learning-based upscaling techniques are used to output \u2018a clean and sharp high-resolution image\u2019. The aim is to boost 3D performance or cut render times.\nOther applications that can be accelerated by Nvidia\u2019s RT and Tensor cores include Chaos V-Ray, Chaos Vantage, Solidworks Visualize, Luxion KeyShot, Unity, Nvidia Omniverse, Unreal Engine, Autodesk VRED and others.\n\nScan 3XS GWP-ME A124C (Intel Core i9-12900K) Review\n\nRelated articles:Visualisation for SOLIDWORKS 2023: technical reportHololight Hub combines XR apps with streaming for new enterprise ecosystemSay goodbye to instruction manuals - new PTC Vuforia AR release recognises shapes instead of targetsReview: Delcam PowerShape 2015Nvidia RTX A5500 launches, along with new mobile GPUsKeyShot 9 to support GPU rendering through Nvidia RTX ray tracing and AI denoisingDomeble Symetri Student Awards launch for 2021Review: Autodesk Fusion 360 \n\n\n\nPrevious Post \n\nNext Post \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStay informed\nJoin the DEVELOP3D community\nNewsletter \u2022 FREE digital magazine \u2022 print magazine\nGo\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nLatest content \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nControlled Permeability added to AM parts by Dyndrite and Elementum3D\n\nMarch 13, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n3D printing the Nozzle office chair\n\nMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSiemens PAVE360 uses AMD GPUs to run on Microsoft Azure\n\nMarch 12, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWhy additive manufacturing needs AI\n\nMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nELM Mobility\u2019s special delivery\n\nMarch 17, 2025\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \u00a9 2008-2024 X3DMedia\r\n19 Leyden Street.

The stock exploded nearly 50% since the company announced a four-for-one stock split on May 21st, 2021. The rally has propelled NVIDIA\u2019s share price to an all-time high value that continues to climb.\nNow a series of significant upgrades is lifting the Nvidia stock price to the brink of another potential breakout. Can the chipmakers magical run continue? Let\u2019s take a look at the factors that will determine if that happens or not.\n\nNVIDIA Stock Price:\u00a0Can It Continue Breaking Its All-Time High Record?\nThe semiconductor manufacturing giant, Nvidia, is much more than just a chipmaker. The company has expanded into several hyper-growth industries such as:\n\nVirtual & augmented reality\nAutonomous vehicles\nScientific computing\nArtificial intelligence\nCryptocurrency\nRobotics\nAnd Gaming\n\nThe expansions into high-demand categories has allowed Nvidia stock value to soar, currently sitting at a market cap of nearly $656 billion. The company\u2019s stock price has investors relishing in the profits as Nvidia\u2019s stock price has climbed nearly 129% since it bottomed on March 8th, 2021, going from $115 to over $263 at the time of this writing.\nIt seems Nvidia\u2019s share price is immune to the recent bug that has plagued many tech stocks this year. It\u2019s on the border of breaking out into all-time high territory again.\nThe stock also has the support of Wall Street with a string of recent upgrades and positive reiterations. According to information from\u00a0Finviz.com, every analyst that has updated their analysis in 2021 either gave the stock either a) an upgrade or b) a reiteration with a price target increase.\nNasdaq analysts updated a 12-month price target for Nvidia stock. The new target would be a record high of $410 and a price target of $352. However, where does Nvidia stock stand after it called of the Arm merger?\nThe Collapse of the (ARM) Deal\nIn September of 2020,\u00a0Nvidia announced it was entering into an agreement with Softbank to purchase the U.K. software/ chipmaker Arm Ltd (NASDAQ: ARMH). The deal was initially proposed at a value of $40 billion. $21.5 billion being in common stock, and another $12 billion in cash. The rest of the total being performance-based.\nHowever, with Arm Ltd. being such a critical company in the technology space, helping to power some of the most innovative technology of our time, the proposed deal faced opposition across the board. Currently, the company\u2019s products are being used to power 90% of all mobile phones. Both Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Android \u2013 as well as other technologies such as smart T.V.s, tablets, and many laptops.\nFor this reason, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued late last year to block the merger. Among other things, the merger could be a catalyst for competition in emerging markets for self-driving car chips and new categories of networking chips.\nNvidia ended its pursuit of Arm after the lawsuit due to \u201csignificant regulatory challenges preventing the consummation of the transaction, despite good faith efforts by the parties.\u201d However, many analysts believe Nvidia stock is a buy even after the deal fell apart.\nNvidia Financial Outlook\nThe Arms deal isn\u2019t the only headline that has Nvidia stock shareholders on the edge of their seats. The company\u2019s latest financials\u00a0give a good representation of how well the company is performing. Here are a few of the major takeaways:\n\nNvidia\u2019s total revenue climbed to $7.64B for the latest quarter. This represents growth of 53% from the same time last year.\nNet income grew 106% year over year to a total of $3B.\nYou can trace the massive growth to increased demand for many of Nvidia\u2019s most popular products. Categories include gaming, data storage, and graphics cards.\nThe company\u2019s gaming segment was the leader in terms of revenue growth, experiencing a 37% increase YOY. The change can be attributed to higher consumer demand for the GeForce RTX 30 Series.\n\nThe company is in a unique position to take advantage of the future of technology with several exciting projects and partnerships, including:\nAutonomous Driving\u00a0\u2013 Nvidia is partnering with major automotive companies to supply software to power these vehicles. The chip-making company now has over $8 billion in backlog with companies like Mercedes Benz, Audi, Volvo, and NIO.\nGaming \u2013\u00a0The gaming industry has exploded in popularity in the past few years, and experts are\u00a0now predicting\u00a0the global gaming industry to be worth over $256 billion by 2025. Nvidia supplies next-level graphics cards that can optimize the playing experience for gamers.\nSmart Phones\u00a0\u2013\u00a0With Nvidia powering the great majority of smartphones, they can take advantage of the exponential growth in the smartphone market. In fact, by 2023,\u00a0smartphone shipments are expected\u00a0to reach 1.48 billion units.\nThe Future of Nvidia Stock Price\nIt seems everything is looking up for Nvidia and its shareholders. You may be asking yourself now, \u201cshould I invest in Nvidia stock?\u201d\nTo answer that question, there are a few things you should consider. First of all, the company does face stiff competition with well-established companies like AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), also developing the next generation of graphics cards to power the future.\nThe Nvidia share price has now reached all-time highs. When analyzing this stock, you will find the demand for Nvidia shares is still on the rise. But, this also means that you will also be paying a premium to purchase Nvidia shares as the P/E ratio is currently sitting just under 69.\nAlthough that may seem expensive right now, Nvidia stock price still has a lot of upside potential. Keep in mind the growth Nvidia has experienced and the innovative industries they are producing products for. If the company maintains its current pace of innovation, the sky is the limit for Nvidia stock price and its shareholders.\nFor the latest updates on Nvidia stock, crypto and other exciting investing opportunities, sign up for our free Manward Financial newsletter today!\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nAbout Pete Johnson\nPete Johnson is an experienced financial writer and content creator who specializes in equity research and derivatives.

This indicates a take-up rate of 26.6% out of a total of 616 units at the EC project located at Yishun Close. According to developer Sing Holdings, average price of units sold was said to be $1,302 psf, as 62% of the units were purchased under the deferred payment scheme and therefore priced 3% higher than the units purchased under the normal progressive scheme.  See also: March new home sales rebound by 20.7% m-o-m Three-bedroom units of 958 to 1,076 sq ft, made up 84.5% of the units purchased. Four-bedroom units of 1,313 to 1,389 sq ft accounted for 9.9% of the units, with five-bedroom units of 1,593 sq ft making up the balance 5.6%. In fact, it was the larger three-bedroom units that saw strong take-up rate, and nine out of the 14 five-bedroom units were snapped up over the weekend. \"Two-thirds of the buyers were HDB upgraders and the majority of the units sold were the larger units, which are clear indications of the desire for more space,\" says Mark Yip, CEO of Huttons Asia. When e-application closed on April 19, a total of 1,045 parties registered their interest. Balloting day (April 22) saw 364 cheques deposited into the ballot box. Hence, the 163 units sold works out to a conversion rate of 44.8%. Despite the strong interest in the project, one of the stumbling blocks was the mortgage servicing ratio (MSR), which applies only to HDB and EC buyers: It has been capped at 30% of gross monthly household income. \u201cEven though EC prices have increased by over 60% over the past five years -- from about $800 psf to $1,300 psf today, the MSR remains unchanged at 30%,\u201d says Ismail Gafoor, CEO of PropNex. \u201cThat was one of the major hurdles we encountered on the ground. We had expected the take-up for North Gaia to be stronger.\u201d    About 3,700 visitors thronged the sales gallery of North Gaia on the first weekend of preview, with another 2,000 visitors the following weekend (Photo: Sing Holdings)  About 3,700 people had visited the sales gallery the first weekend, and another 2,000 the previous weekend. However, they did not appear to be in a hurry to commit to a purchase, knowing that there are three more ECs in the pipeline between 3Q2022 to 1Q2023, namely at Tengah Garden, Tampines Street 62 and Bukit Batok West Avenue 8, according to property agencies.   Story continues \u201cBecause of the other opportunities that they have in other locations, some of the potential buyers may have been hesitant about committing to a purchase too quickly,\u201d adds PropNex\u2019s Gafoor.Homebuyers are more cautious as \u201cthey have only one shot\u201d at buying an EC, says Nicholas Mak, head of research & consultancy at ERA Realty Network. For ECs, developers have to set aside 70% of the units for first-time homebuyers at the initial launch. However, first-timers are eligible for HDB Built-to-Order (BTO) projects too. They may also be considering the upcoming BTO projects in May and August, in locations such as Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah, Ghim Moh, Queenstown and Toa Payoh, especially the prime location public housing flats (PLH), Mak points out.  Showflat of a three-bedroom unit at North Gaia (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)At North Gaia, about 70% of the buyers on launch day were second-timers or HDB upgraders, says Ken Low, managing partner of SRI. \"The initial take-up rate of 26.5% is respectable,\" he notes. \u201cIt is a good pace of sales for the developer as subsequent EC projects at Tengah, Tampines and Bukit Batok will potentially be launched at higher prices,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd North Gaia will be the most attractively priced EC project in 2022.\u201dERA's Mak agrees: \"Selling 26.5% of the units on the first day of launch is not too bad,\" notes. \"The developer has a runway of another 3.6 years to sell the remaining units.\"After all, there isn\u2019t much competition from existing EC projects and even suburban private condominium projects that are either substantially or fully sold, he adds. For instance, only six units remain unsold at the 496-unit EC project Parc Greenwich at Seletar Hills, which was launched last September. Meanwhile, the 413-unit Provence Residence EC at Canberra Crescent, launched last May, has sold its last two units, hence it's 100% sold to date. The 700-unit Parc Central Residences was fully sold within 12 months of its launch in January last year. Private condominiums such as the 1,410-unit The Florence Residences at Kovan which is already 95.5% sold and the 1,052-unit Affinity at Serangoon is 99% sold, while the 460-unit Dairy Farm Residences and 2,203-unit Treasure at Tampines are both fully sold.As at 1Q2022, unsold inventory of private homes totalled 14,362 units, according to URA data. The Core Central Region had the most unsold stock (5,781 units) followed by the Rest of Central Region with 4,635 units. In the Outside Central Region, unsold stock was 3,946 units at the end of 1Q2022 \u2013 the lowest of the three regions, says Mak. \u201cThe unsold stock is at a historical low,\u201d he adds.  Showflat of a four-bedroom penthouse at North Gaia (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)The latest government land sale (GLS) tender at Lentor Hills Road with a winning bid of $1,060 psf per plot ratio (psf ppr) points to a future where \u201claunches of suburban residential projects will be in the $2,000 psf range,\u201d remarks ERA\u2019s Mak.Given the December property cooling measures, homebuyers have become even more price sensitive, note property consultants. Is the 26.5% sales rate achieved at North Gaia a harbinger of the performance of the upcoming project launches?\u201cI still believe that developments in good locations, near public transport and amenities that are reasonably priced should perform well and see good take-up rates,\u201d says PropNex\u2019s Gafoor.Sing Holdings CEO Lee Sze Hao remains confident about the prospects for North Gaia: \u201cThis is a unique proposition for buyers in view of the limited supply currently, and we are confident that given some time, the project will be fully sold,\u201d he says.Check out the latest listings near North Gaia, Tampines, Bukit Batok, Parc Greenwich, Seletar Hills, Provence Residence, The Florence Residences, Affinity at Serangoon, Dairy Farm Residences, Treasure at TampinesSee Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) [UPDATE] March new home sales rebound by 20.7% m-o-m [UPDATE] North Gaia EC sees 3,700 visitors on preview weekend North Gaia to set trend for EC projects at average price of $1,250 to $1,280 psf En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

PropertyGuru   26 April 2022 10 min read            7 Cheapest Resale HDB Flats for Young Couples Under 300k (With Cost Breakdown!)   It\u2019s 2022 and HDB resale flats are more popular than ever, with prices going up, up and up. It\u2019s a trend that has been on the rise since the pandemic began over two years ago, and BTO flat construction delays emerged. Some couples cancelled their BTO flats. Others avoided the BTO application route altogether, going straight for resale HDB flats.  Thanks to these factors, the HDB resale market reported record growth in 2021 \u2013 a whopping 12.7% annual increase. In 2021, 259 of those transactions were million-dollar HDB resale flats. The good news is that in Q1 2022, price growth for HDB resale flats seems to be slowing down. HDB resale prices rose 2.3% quarter-on-quarter, (compared to 3.4% in Q4 2021); the number of transactions was around 6,500 (compared to 7,940 in Q4 2021). While resale flats are known to be more expensive than BTO flats, especially with the increased demand and prices, that\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t any good deals out there that are more affordable for young couples and the budget-conscious. Here are our top picks under $300,000. 7 HDB Resale Flats Under 300k All HDB resale flats listed in this guide were available at the time of writing.

If you hope to get a bank loan instead and need advice on planning how to finance your new HDB flat, our home loan advisors are just a click away. Now, let\u2019s get on with the seven HDB resale flats under $300,000: 3-Room Flat at 114 Ho Ching Road: $280,000    There are plenty of amenities in the west of Singapore, with a bustling business district in the heart of Jurong East and the development of the Jurong Lake District. This 3-room flat at 119 Ho Ching Road (directly translated to \u201criver scenery\u201d in Chinese, not a certain person\u2019s name btw) boasts two bedrooms, one utility room and one bathroom. What gives? Well, the remaining lease has about 48 years left so it\u2019s quite old (TOP in 1971). But old flats are known for their spacious and more efficient layout. While this flat is near to amenities and schools, those who want to travel frequently to town can find it kinda far.

Needless to say, there are plenty of amenities nearby, including a plethora of popular schools, markets, hawker centres and even the happening Upper Thomson cafe and supper stretch. Even the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park is close by.Completed in 1973, the flat has been through its fair share of years, but that\u2019s nothing a thorough renovation won\u2019t fix.

You\u2019ll be spoilt for choice with options such as a minimart, schools, eating houses and public transportation within walking distance all around.Of course, as with old flats, this unit TOP in 1965, which makes it as old as Singapore herself. Three MRT stations are within walking distance though: MacPherson, Tai Seng and Mattar, and if we recall correctly, the park connector is just at your doorstep.

But here\u2019s an affordable 3-room flat in that princely estate, at below $300k. This Stirling Road home is just 600m from Queenstown MRT station so homeowners will be close to all the amenities in the area.The flat is smaller, at 645 sq ft, with about 47 years left on the lease. However, the location is second-to-none, in the popular Queenstown neighbourhood.

Marsiling is also an upcoming location, as it is near to Woodlands, which has become a bustling estate thanks to the new Thomson-East Coast MRT line and proximity to the Causeway, which is now reopened.We also love that this unit is on a high floor with unblocked views. Probably the only deterrent is the age of the flat, as it TOP in 1976, which makes it 46 years old.

In addition, if you\u2019re a fan of the famous Toa Payoh dragon playground, this flat is really close to it. There are plenty of amenities around too, and public transport is a cinch in this neighbourhood.This flat TOP in 1969 and is located on a low floor. But for a home in Toa Payoh, this is well worth it.

The possibility of more generous CPF Housing Grants through schemes like the Proximity Housing Grant can also make the unit even more affordable.And due to their more efficient layout, older flats are typically more spacious than new ones of the same type, and some of these might also be recently renovated. You might even be able to score a unit that is in move-in condition.Related article: HDB Floor Plans Over the Years: How 3 Homeowners Have Adapted to ChangesLet\u2019s also talk about the location of these flats. We\u2019ve tried our best to scour flats from different parts of the island, but you\u2019ll generally notice that the more \u2018ulu\u2019 locations tend to yield flats that could be newer and larger with cheaper psf prices. But those in the older, mature neighbourhoods are indeed a steal, especially in the popular areas of Queenstown, Bukit Merah, Toa Payoh and other city-fringe and/or prime HDB estates.However, if you\u2019re planning to sell the property in the near future and hope to turn a profit, then you may want to think twice about the decaying lease.Another thing to think about is your (growing) family. Families with young children or couples who might want to settle down with two or more kiddos may need more space. So, staying put in a 3-room flat might not be so ideal. You probably want to consider getting your own BTO flat eventually as it\u2019s unlikely that these older flats will be around till the end of the lease (think: Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme, aka SERS).For more property news, resources and useful content like this article, check out PropertyGuru\u2019s guides section.

If there's a company that can pull it off, it's Nvidia, with its brilliant leader Jensen Huang. Undoubtedly, the total addressable market (TAM) for Nvidia is enormous. The innovative graphics-processing unit (GPU) maker has a front-row seat to video gaming, automotive tech, AI, and data center. Undoubtedly, a nice slice of each of the following markets could propel the company's market cap above the $1 trillion mark.  Still, it's Nvidia's Omniverse initiative that could be the key to unlocking next-level growth over the next decade once we move closer to the concept of the metaverse. However, although Nvidia is on the cutting edge of next-generation technology, I am neutral on the stock. It's not that I wasn't excited about Nvidia's investor day or the $1 trillion opportunities at hand. It's the valuation of the stock going into a higher-rate environment. The growth sell-off has been unforgiving thus far, and it may not be over. With a 22.7 times sales multiple, NVDA stock faces tremendous downside risk if the broader growth sell-off continues. For that reason, I'm in no rush to chase Nvidia stock to trillion-dollar market cap territory. It will come in due time, but it will surely be a rocky road to the level, with the growth trade starting to show its wobbly legs. Nvidia's Omniverse is the Answer to Meta's Metaverse Add the exciting Nvidia Omniverse effort into the equation, and the trillion-dollar aspirations are not at all far-fetched. Thanks to a timely name change, Meta Platforms (FB) has propelled the concept of the metaverse to the forefront. In recent months, though, the growth trade has faded, and the metaverse ambitions of Mark Zuckerberg have started to seem more far-fetched.  With interest rates on the rise, profitability matters more than exciting stories. Still, there's no denying the long-term potential in the metaverse. Arguably, Nvidia is one of the better-equipped companies to construct the metaverse, not Meta. Unlike Meta, Nvidia has been in the gaming business for a very long time, with its top-of-the-line hardware that helps gamers run their favorite titles. Not only does Nvidia's background give its Omniverse offering a greater chance at success, but it also lacks the questionable reputation that Facebook has. Further, early teases of Nvidia's Omniverse appear so much more exciting than the Meta presentation that revealed the firm's new name and focus.   Story Continues Simply put, Nvidia is a graphics power king, and it's this hardware edge that could allow it to transition consumers into virtual worlds, which will likely be gaming-centric.Nvidia Stock's Valuation Remains ExcessiveNvidia's Investor Day did not fail to impress this year. In many ways, its presentation is becoming more exciting than the likes of an Apple keynote (at least until the company has a chance to unveil the Apple Car or mixed-reality headset). The initial reaction was profoundly positive. Still, the stock has been shedding some of its recent gains.At the end of the day, valuation matters. As one of the priciest semi stocks out there, Nvidia stock could be one of the growth stocks to face amplified damage as the rate-driven valuation reset continues.Further, many industries Nvidia is pushing towards may not be tremendously profitable until many years down the road. Think nascent markets like AI and Omniverse. They're undoubtedly exciting, but it's unclear when next-generation AI and the metaverse will be ready for prime time.If sizeable profits from such awe-inspiring initiatives are closer to 2030 than 2022, the stock will undoubtedly take a hit, especially now that the Fed has shown signs of increased hawkishness.Wall Street's TakeTurning to Wall Street, NVDA stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 26 analyst ratings, there are 21 Buy recommendations and five Hold recommendations.The average Nvidia price target is $351.74, implying an upside of ~44%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $245 per share to a high of $410 per share. (See NVDA stock forecast on TipRanks)  The Bottom LineNvidia is such a great company with a visionary founder-led leader. Nvidia's TAM is huge and seems virtually unbounded, but the real risk to the stock at these valuations is what happens with the growth trade.The company itself will be firing on all cylinders, and I do not doubt that it will deliver. That alone may make the stock worth a hefty premium, but is ~23 times sales too hefty a premium? I'm not so sure.In any case, I'd take a raincheck on the name because the \"growth at any price\" trade seems all but done now that the Fed is so focused on inflation.\u200bTo find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks\u2019 Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks\u2019 equity insights.Read full Disclaimer & Disclosure  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories   We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now. \n\n\n  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

The deal was brokered by SRI.    The GCB at Olive Road purchased by Wee Hian Nam sits on a land area of 27,909 sq ft (Source: EdgeProp Inspector) A property title search shows that the buyer is Wee Hian Nam, one of the grandchildren of the late Wee Thiam Siew, a property tycoon and hotelier who had previously owned the 7th Storey Hotel at Rochor Road, Lion City Hotel and Hollywood Theatre at Tanjong Katong Road, which have all been sold and redeveloped.  One of the last remaining legacy assets held by the third generation of the Wee family are 25 pre-war semi-detached houses on Thiam Siew Avenue, named after their grandfather. The late Wee, who passed away in 1972, had lived in a mansion at 525 Dunman Road adjacent to the houses on Thiam Siew Avenue. In fact, he had carved out the land to build the semi-detached houses and the road that bears his name.    The houses along Thiam Siew Avenue, named after the eponymous property tycoon and hotelier (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Over the years, the semi-detached houses have been rented out by the family for rental income. The properties were held under two entities: Wee Thiam Siew & Co and Thiam Siew Avenue Investments. Wee Thiam Siew & Co has 20 shareholders, and Thiam Siew Avenue Investments, another five shareholders, bringing the total to 25. In the event of a sale of assets, all 25 shareholders will be the beneficiaries.  Last September, the family placed 22 of the semi-detached houses along Thiam Siew Avenue for collective sale, with Savills Singapore as the exclusive marketing agency. When combined, the two freehold sites on either side of Thiam Siew Avenue totalled 263,794 sq ft. The properties are located in prime District 15.

Including the $284 million in development charge and an estimated $39.3 million for 7% balcony space, the final price tag for the developers amounted to about $1.14 billion or a land rate of $1,440 psf per plot ratio. The joint-venture partners are said to have received planning permission for the development of an 820-unit, freehold condominium project on the site.

He therefore received not just a share of the proceeds from the company, but the full portion of the proceeds from the sale of the property at Thiam Siew Avenue.One could call Wee\u2019s purchase of the GCB at Olive Road \u201ccapital recycling\u201d. The GCB that now bears his name is an old double-storey bungalow, believed to be built sometime in the 1950s to 1960s. The house is expected to be torn down and redeveloped into a contemporary mansion.  The GCB purchased by Ian Ang, co-founder and CEO of Secretlab is just across the road from Wee's property on Olive Road (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)He is in good company. Across the road is the GCB purchased by Ian Ang, the co-founder and CEO of gaming chair company Secretlab. The 29-year-old had purchased the GCB for $36 million ($1,537 psf) in June last year. It was considered the highest psf price paid for a GCB on Olive Road.It looks like that record has been broken by Wee with his purchase of the GCB at $1,800 psf, which is now the highest transacted price on a psf basis along Olive Road. However, across the whole Caldecott Hill Estate, it is the fourth highest on a psf basis, surpassed only by three GCBs along Lornie Road that were sold at prices from $2,005 psf to $2,545 psf between January 2018 and November 2021.  Location of the GCB at Olive Road purchased by Ian Ang of Secretlab (Source: EdgeProp Inspector)In terms of absolute price, at $50.24 million, Wee\u2019s purchase is certainly the highest for a bungalow at Caldecott Hill Estate to date, based on caveats lodged with URA Realis.Check out the latest listings near Caldecott Hill Estate, Lornie RoadSee Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) Good Class Bungalow at Joan Road for sale at $48 mil [UPDATE] Bungalow plot at 5 Oxley Rise on the market for $300 mil Hong Fok joint CEO puts GCB at Nassim Road up for sale En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Joanne Poh   26 April 2022 6 min read            UOB Robo Advisor Singapore Review (2020) \u2014 Build Your Investment Portfolio with UOBAM Invest   Robo advisors are a trendy way to invest without actually having to do much work. Although rather late to the game, UOB\u2019s new product, UOBAM Invest, is one of the few local bank-owned robo advisors in Singapore and is definitely worth looking at. By the way, there are absolutely heaps of robo advisors in Singapore including plenty of non-bank ones like Syfe, Stashaway and Endowus. If you\u2019re considering this investment approach, we\u2019ve got some advice on using robo advisors for you. Just deposit your money, select your desired investment portfolio and the robo advisor will take care of the rest.  What is UOBAM Invest? UOB Asset Management (UOBAM) has jumped into the fray with UOBAM Invest, which is a mobile app designed for retail investors (ie. normal people like you and me).  The UOBAM Invest online portal was first introduced in 2018 for corporate investors, but with the introduction of the UOBAM Invest mobile app, you no longer need to be a company to grow your cash with them.   UOBAM Invest at a glance Minimum amount to invest$1 Fees0.8% per annum ($25,000 and below)0.6% per annum (Above $25,000) Types of portfoliosCustomised selection of equities like ETFs and REITs, and fixed income asset classes like money market assets, Government Securities Index, Investment Grade Credit and HighYield Credit Index Expected returnVaries according to your portfolio, risk profile, investment horizon and goals Fund your account throughPayNow, bank transfer, bill payment (for UOB account holders)  How does UOBAM Invest work? As with most robo advisors, you\u2019ll need to fill in a few things before the algorithm can recommend a portfolio. You\u2019ll need to input your financial goals, investment time frame and complete a risk assessment exercise in-app first. Based on this information, UOB\u2019s robo advisor app will recommend an investment portfolio tailored to your profile. You can adjust the parameters e.g. your risk appetite to customise it to your liking.  Finally, you then fund your portfolio either through a lump sum transfer via PayNow, FAST, or (if you have a UOB account) bill payment. You can also set up instructions for regular contributions. Maintenance like portfolio rebalancing takes place automatically, with no input needed from you, and the platform will alert you when you\u2019ve reached your pre-set investment goals. What are the UOBAM Invest commission fees? For commission fees, UOBAM Invest charges a flat 0.8% on investments up to $25,000, which is competitive against the other robo advisors. Here are the fees involved:   Story continues  Total investment Annual feeUS Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fees $25,000 and below0.8%0.00229% of the value sold Above $25,0000.6%0.00229% of the value sold *Based on prevailing SEC fee rates and is subject to change from time to time without notice. Please refer to the SEC website for latest updates.Is there anything unique about UOBAM Invest?As an investment platform, UOBAM Invest works pretty similarly to other robo advisors at first glance\u2026 but there are some subtle differences.Unlike some other robos, UOBAM Invest does not give you multiple portfolios to choose from. That\u2019s actually a good thing if you\u2019re trying to avoid bias in your decision-making (which is arguably the point of passive investing with a robo).UOBAM Invest also uses a \u201cglide-path\u201d model, which progressively shifts your money towards safer assets the closer you are to the end of your goal completion date, to ensure you don\u2019t risk everything just as you\u2019re about to achieve your goal. Finally, while some robo investors offer expected returns for their various portfolios, UOBAM Invest\u2019s more customised approach means that the long-term and medium-term expected returns vary from person to person. It takes into account unusual market shocks that are supposed to offer a more accurate estimate of your chances of success.UOBAM Invest vs DBS digiPortfolio Total investmentUOBAM InvestDBS digiPortfolio $25,000 and below0.8%0.75% Above $25,0000.6%0.75% At lower investment amounts, DBS digiPortfolio\u2019s management fees of 0.75% are more competitive than UOBAM Invest\u2019s, which charges 0.8% for amounts of $25,000 and below. If you\u2019re investing more than $25,000, UOBAM Invest gets a lot cheaper with their 0.6% fee.DBS digiPortfolio has a much higher barrier to entry, with a minimum investment amount of $1,000. UOB Robo Advisor\u2019s minimum investment amount is only $1.In terms of the actual investments, DBS digiPortfolio combines automation with human investment professionals, which sounds more comforting than just letting the algorithm do all the work. But it\u2019s less customisable from the user\u2019s point of view, so more experienced investors who want to be able to tweak their portfolios would benefit more from UOBAM Invest.Read our review of DBS digiPortfolio here.UOBAM Invest vs OCBC RoboInvest Total investmentUOBAM InvestOCBC RoboInvest $25,000 and below0.8%0.88% Above $25,0000.6%0.88% OCBC RoboInvest charges the highest fees of the three big local banks\u2019 robo advisors, at 0.88%, which is significantly higher than UOBAM\u2019s 0.6% to 0.8%.OCBC RoboInvest\u2019s minimum investment amount of US$100 ($137), while not stratospherically high, is still higher than UOBAM\u2019s negligible minimum investment amount of $1.OCBC offers 37 portfolios according to the types of markets or assets you wish to invest in, including China Growth, Precious Metals, Singapore Stable REITs and it\u2019s latest addition \u2013 the Metaverse.

The core consumer price index \u2014 which excludes private transport and accommodation costs \u2014 is projected to pick up in the coming months and peak in the third quarter, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said in its half-yearly macroeconomic review on Thursday (28 April).  One major factor is the recent surge in energy prices, which will filter through to electricity and gas tariffs in the third quarter, according to the report. Sharply higher global commodity prices and renewed supply disruptions as a result of both the Russia-Ukraine crisis and the regional pandemic situation are adding to pre-existing global inflationary pressures. Against this backdrop, consumer price inflation in Singapore is expected to increase and remain elevated for some time. Notably, the surge in global energy and agricultural commodity prices will raise domestic inflation for fuel, electricity and gas and non-cooked food, which will in turn feed into higher inflation for transport and food services over time. Underlying price pressures could ease towards the end of this year, on the assumption that global commodity prices stabilise and global supply constraints loosen to some extent, the central bank said. Higher food costs However, the higher level of global food prices will eventually be fully reflected in domestic food prices. Elevated global food prices are therefore expected to continue to exert pressure on Singapore\u2019s food inflation beyond 2022. Singapore's core inflation rose to a 10-year high of 2.9 per cent year-on-year in March, up from 2.2 per cent in February, driven by higher inflation for food and services, official data released on Monday showed. For the whole of 2022, MAS core inflation is forecasted to come in at 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent, up from the previous forecast range of two to three per cent. The headline, or overall inflation, which includes private transport and accommodation, is forecast at 4.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent for the year, up from an earlier range of 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent. This is due to a backlog of construction delays in residential projects pushing up home prices and elevated Certificate of Entitlement premiums and petrol prices.

Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

And ask they did, on a wide range of topic that covered everything from Nvidia's failed attempt to acquire ARM to the promises and dangers of the kinds of AI technologies that Nvidia is building. Along the way, he also discussed the possibility of Nvidia working with Intel's upcoming foundry services, how Nvidia both partners and competes with Intel, and the importance to businesses of making it easy for employees to work from home or from wherever they feel comfortable.\nHuang also told the press, and through them the entire IT industry, to not think of Nvidia as a GPU company, but as a computing platform company. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working across that entire stack\u2014we call it our four-layer stack\u2014so that we can reinvent computer science and computing for the next decade where machine learning and artificial intelligence and data-driven approaches are going to be central to almost everything we do,\u201d he said.\nHuang unplugged from the lights and cameras of a major industry event offers an in-depth look at Nvidia, the IT industry, and where both are going. Click through the slideshow to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia Is A Computing Platform Company, Not A GPU Company\nWe\u2019ve been working on several things over the last decade or so, and some really important things have happened. The way that computer science is done, the way that software is created, and what software can now do has fundamentally changed. The computers and the computer systems that we built in the past were developed largely for human software developers to write software. And the deployment of that software has evolved over the years to be augmented by artificial intelligence and machine learning.\nAnd so [Nvidia has] been working on a whole stack of new computing that starts from the chips to the systems, to the entire data center, across all of its software, the engines, if you will, the middleware, the SQL engines and such\u2014we call it Nvidia AI and Nvidia Omniverse\u2014and the type of tools and frameworks necessary to build these applications. We\u2019ve been working across that entire stack\u2014we call it our four-layer stack\u2014so that we can reinvent computer science and computing for the next decade where machine learning and artificial intelligence and data-driven approaches are going to be central to almost everything we do. And so yesterday we announced products across the full stack. And I think it\u2019s quite evident that Nvidia has evolved from a GPU chip company into a computing platform company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemote Work: Comfortable With Being A Digital Company\nNvidia has moved faster in the last couple years than potentially its last 10 years combined. And it\u2019s possible that we\u2019re very comfortable being a digital company. It\u2019s possible that we\u2019re quite comfortable working remotely and collaboratively across the whole planet. It\u2019s quite possible that we work better actually when we allow our employees to choose when they\u2019re most productive and let them optimize, let mature people optimize their work environment and their work timeframe and their work style around what best fits for them and their families. And so it\u2019s very possible that all of that is happening. It\u2019s also absolutely true that it has forced us to put a lot more energy into the virtual work that we do. For example, the work around Omniverse really went into light speed in the last couple of years because we needed it. Instead of being able to come into our labs to work on our robots, or go on to the streets to test our cars, we had to test them in virtual worlds, in digital twins. And we found that we could iterate our software just as well in digital twins, if not better. And we could have millions of digital twin cars, not just a fleet of a hundred. And so there are a lot of things that I think either one it\u2019s possible that the world doesn\u2019t have to get dressed and commute and go to work and commute. Maybe that\u2019s that this hybrid work approach is quite good. But it\u2019s definitely the case that forcing ourselves to be more digital than before, more virtual than before, has been a positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversifying To Meet Chip Supply Challenges\n[When] we started to experience challenges in the supply chain, the first thing that we did was we started to create diversity and redundancy, which is the first principle of resilience. And we realized we needed more resilience going forward. And so over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve built in diversity in the number of process nodes that we use. So we qualified a lot more process nodes. We\u2019re in more fabs than ever. We\u2019ve qualified more substrate vendors, more assembly partners, more system integration partners. We\u2019ve second sourced and qualified a whole bunch more external components. So we\u2019ve expanded our supply base probably four-fold in the last two years. And so that\u2019s one of the areas we\u2019ve dedicated ourselves, otherwise Nvidia\u2019s torrent growth rate wouldn\u2019t have been possible. And this year we\u2019re going to grow even more.\nAnd so I think that, when you\u2019re confronted with adversity and challenges, it\u2019s really important to go back to first principles and say to yourself: This is not likely going to be a once in a lifetime thing. What could we do to be more resilient? What can we do to diversify and expand our supply base?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact From The Falling Through Of Nvidia's Proposed ARM Acquisition\nARM is a one-of-a-kind asset. It\u2019s a one-of-a-kind company. You\u2019re not going to build another ARM. It took 35 years to build. You can build something else, but you won\u2019t build that. Do we need it as a company to succeed? Absolutely not. Would it have been wonderful to own such a thing? The answer is absolutely yes. And the reason for that is because, as company owners, you want to own great assets. You want to own great platforms. Of course, I\u2019m disappointed that we didn\u2019t get it through. But the result is that we built wonderful relationships with the entire management team of ARM, and they understood the vision our company has for the future of high performance computing, and they\u2019re excited about it.\nI think that naturally caused the roadmap of ARM to be much more aggressive in the direction of high performance computing, where I needed them to be. And so I think that the net result of it is inspired leadership for the future of high performance and the direction that it\u2019s important to Nvidia. It\u2019s also great for them because that\u2019s where the next opportunities are. Mobile devices are still going to be around, and they\u2019re going to do great. However, the next big opportunities are in these AI factories and cloud AIs and edge AIs. This way of developing software is so transformative, and we\u2019re just seeing the tip of the iceberg of it.\nAs relates to our internal developments, we got even more excited about ARM, and you could see how much we double down on the number of ARM chips that we have. The robotics ARM chips, we\u2019ve got several that are now in development. Orin is in production this month, and it\u2019s a home run for us. And so we\u2019re going to build a whole lot more in that direction. The reception of Grace has been incredible. I think we wanted to build a CPU that is very different than what\u2019s available today and solves a very new type of problem that we know exists out in the world of AI. And so we went and built Grace for that. And we surprise people with the idea that it\u2019s a superchip, not a collection of chiplets, but the connection of chip superchips and the benefits of doing that. You\u2019re going to see a lot more of that in that direction. So I think our technology innovation around ARM is turbo charged as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Being A Partner Or Competitor Of Intel As It Moves To Fabrication\nOur strategy is to expand our supply base with diversity and redundancy at every single layer: at the chip layer, at the substrate layer, at the assembly layer, at the system layer, at every single layer. We\u2019ve diversified the number of nodes. We\u2019ve diversified the number of foundries. And Intel is an excellent partner of ours. We qualify their CPUs for all of our accelerated computing platforms. When we pioneer new systems, like we just did with Omniverse computer\u2014we partnered with them to build the first generation of the Omniverse computers\u2014our engineers worked very closely together. They\u2019re interested in us using their foundries. We\u2019re very interested in exploring it.\nBeing a foundry at the caliber of a TSMC is not for the faint of heart. This is a change not just in process technology and investment of capital, but it\u2019s a change in culture from a product-oriented company, technology-oriented company to a product technology and service-oriented company. And it\u2019s not a service-oriented company as in bringing you a cup of coffee, but a service-oriented company as in really mimicking and dancing with your operations. TSMC dances with the operations of, what, 300 companies worldwide. And our own operations is quite an orchestra. And yet they dance with us. And then there\u2019s another orchestra that they dance with. And so the ability to dance with all of these different operations teams, supply chain teams, is not for faint of heart, and TSMC does it just beautifully.\nAnd so it\u2019s management, it\u2019s culture, it\u2019s core values. And they did that on top of technology and products. And so I\u2019m encouraged by the work that is done at Intel. I think that this is a direction they have to go. And we\u2019re interested in looking at the process technology. So I think our relationship with Intel is quite long. We work with them across a whole lot of different areas. Every single laptop, every single PC, every single server, every single supercomputer, we collaborate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaying Focused On Organic Growth\nNvidia is genetically organically grown. We prefer to build everything ourselves. Nvidia has so much technology, so much technical strength. And the world\u2019s greatest computer scientists are working here. And so we are organically built as a natural way of doing things. However, every so often something amazing comes out. A long time ago, the first large acquisition we made proportionally at the time was 3dfx. That was because 3dfx was amazing. The computer graphics engineers there, the computer graphic scientists there, are still working here. Many of them built the latest generation GPU. And so 3dfx was the first.\nThe next one that really you could highlight is Mellanox. It was a once in a lifetime thing. You\u2019re not going to build another Mellanox. The world is never going to have another Mellanox. It\u2019s not going to happen again. And so it\u2019s a company that has the combination of the incredible talent, the platform that they created, the ecosystem that they\u2019d built over the years that\u2019s integrated into the world, all of that. You\u2019re not going to recreate that. And then the next one: You\u2019re never going to build: another ARM. ...\nI think that I have great partnerships with the world\u2019s computer industry. And there are very few Mellanoxes, There are very few ARMs. And so the good thing is that we are so good at organic growth. Look at all the new ideas we have every year. That\u2019s our generic approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia Potential Relationship With Intel Foundry Services\nWith respect to Intel, foundry discussions take a long time. And it\u2019s not just about desire, but we have to align technology. The business models have to be aligned. The capacity has to be aligned. The operations process and the nature of the two companies have to be aligned. It takes a fair amount of time, and it takes a lot of deep, deep discussion. You know, we\u2019re not buying milk here. This is really about integration of supply chains. Our partnership with TSMC and particularly Samsung in the last several years is something that took years to cultivate. And so we are very open minded to considering Intel. And I\u2019m delighted by the efforts that they\u2019re making.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOff-the-shelf Vs. Custom Components\nOur preference is to use off-the-shelf. If somebody else is wanting to do something for me, I could save my engineering to go do something else. And so on balance we tried\u2014well, not on balance\u2014we always try not to not to do something that could be available somewhere else. And we encourage third parties, and we encourage our partners, to lean in the direction of building something that would be helpful to us so that we could just take it off the shelf. And I think over the last couple of years, ARM\u2019s roadmap has steered higher and higher performance, which I just love. It\u2019s fantastic. I can just use it.\nWhat makes [Nvidia\u2019s new ARM-based CPU] Grace special is the architecture of the system around Grace, and very importantly, the entire ecosystem above it. Grace is going to have predesigned systems that it could go into. And very importantly, Grace is going to have all of Nvidia software that it could instantly be able to benefit from. When we were working with Mellanox when they came on board, we ported all of the video software onto Mellanox and the benefits and the value to the customers are in \u2019X\u2019 factors. And so we\u2019re going to do the same thing with Grace. And so I think on balance, if we can take it off the shelf because they have the CPUs with the level of performance we need.\nAnd ARM builds excellent CPUs. The fact of the matter is, the engineering team is world class. However, anything that they prefer not to do, we are transparent with each other. And if we need to, we\u2019ll build our own and we\u2019ll do whatever it takes to build amazing CPUs. We have a very significant CPU design team, and world-class CPU architects. We could build whatever we need. So anyways, our posture is to let other people do it for us and differentiate upon that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel As A Competitor\nFirst of all, we\u2019ve been working closely with Intel, sharing with them our roadmap long before we share with the public for years. Intel has known our secrets for years. AMD has known our secrets for years. And we are sophisticated and mature enough to realize that we have to collaborate. We work closely with Broadcom, work closely with Marvell. We work closely with Analog devices, with TI (Texas Instruments). We work closely with everybody. Micron and Samsung, and, oh my goodness, the list goes on. We share roadmaps, of course under confidentiality and very selective channels of communications. And the industry has just learned how to work in that way. And so on the one hand we compete with many, many companies. We also partner deeply with them and rely on them. If not for AMD CPUs that are in DGX, we wouldn\u2019t be able to ship DGX. If not for Intel CPUs and all of the hyperscalers connected to our HGX, we wouldn\u2019t be able to ship HGX. If not for Intel\u2019s CPUs in our Omniverse computers that are coming up, we wouldn\u2019t be able to do the digital twin simulations that rely so deeply on the single thread performance that they\u2019re really good at. There are a lot of things that we do that are commingled that way. And that what I think makes Nvidia special is that over the years, we have built up a really diverse and robust and now quite an expanded-scale supply base. And that allows us to continue to grow quite aggressively.\nThe second thing is that we are a company like one that\u2019s never been built before where we have a core chip technology that is world-class at each one of their levels: world-class GPU technology, world-class networking technology, world-class CPU technology. And that\u2019s layered on top of systems that are quite unique. And then blueprints are shared with the rest of the industry, right from inside this company with software stacks that are engineered completely from this company. And one of the most important engines in the world, Nvidia AI, is utilized by 25,000 enterprise companies in the world and every single cloud in the world.\nI think that stack is quite unique to us. And so we\u2019re quite comfortable [and] work with our confidence in what we do. We\u2019re very comfortable working with collaborators, including Intel and others. It turns out that paranoia is just paranoia. There\u2019s nothing to be paranoid about. And it turns out people want to win, but nobody\u2019s trying to \u2019get ya.\u2019 And so we try to take the not-paranoid approach when we work with partners, and we try to rely on them, to let them know we\u2019re relying on them, trust them, let them know that we trust them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn The Potential For AI To Cause Damage\nFirst of all, when we\u2019re watching a movie, Iron Man is not real. And Yoda\u2019s not real. And the light sabers are not real. They\u2019re all deep fakes. And just about every single movie that we watch these days is really quite artificial. And yet we accept that because we know it\u2019s not true. We know because of the medium that the information that\u2019s presented to us is not intended to be news. It\u2019s intended to be entertainment. If we could apply this basic principle to all information, it would surely be great. I do recognize that unfortunately it crosses the line of what is information mistruths and outright lies. And that line is difficult to separate for a lot of people.\nI don\u2019t know that I have the answer for this. I don\u2019t know that artificial intelligence is necessary to activate the problem even further. However, just as AI has the ability to create fakes, AI has the ability to detect fakes. And we need to be much more rigorous in applying AI to detect fake news, detect fake facts, detect fake things. And so that\u2019s an area that a lot of computer scientists are working on. And I\u2019m optimistic that the tools that they come up with will be more rigorous in helping us decrease the amount of misinformation that consumers are unfortunately consuming today with little discretion. And so I\u2019m looking forward to that.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It builds on the GeForce GTX 1660 to take the power up a notch, yet, it offers that boost in performance while still staying in the budget range for graphics card that makes a card like this so attractive. Essentially, you don\u2019t have to spend much more for that extra bit of performance.Jump toPrice and availability\nFeatures and chipset\nPerformance\nShould I buy?\nAlso considerFinding that sweet spot of solid 1080p gaming for a reasonable price is not the easiest task for budget gamers. Most of the GPUs available these days are just too pricey. That\u2019s where the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super comes in.Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super at Amazon for $220.66With its improved speed and video memory compared to the original 1660, it\u2019s the perfect card for anyone building or taking their budget gaming PC to the next level, since the GTX 1660 Super stands somewhere between the GTX 1660 and GTX 1660 Ti in terms of performance and price.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti review: nearly perfect, but with one major flaw\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5080 review: nearly RTX 4090 performance for a whole lot less\n\n\n\nAs such, it\u2019s a welcome part of the Nvidia Turing line up, and considering what it offers in terms of overall value, it is still one of the best graphics cards for anyone on a tight hardware budget.If you're on the market for the best graphics card for 1080p gaming, you're going to want the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super. The original GTX 1660 was already one of the best cheap graphics cards out there for budget builders, and Nvidia basically made it better in every single way. The Nvidia Super series has been kind of hit and miss \u2013 with the RTX 2080 being a notable flop \u2013 but we can't recommend the GTX 1660 Super enough.\u00a0At the end of the day, 1080p is the most popular resolution for PC gaming, and graphics cards in this price range are where most people will end up spending their money. And even after the release of the AMD Radeon RX 5500, Nvidia still dominates this part of the landscape, and it's not hard to see why.\u00a0Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super: price and availabilityThe snazzy retail packaging for the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super (Image credit: Future)How much is it? MSRP listed at $229 (about \u00a3180, AU$330)When is it out? It was released in October 2019Where can you get it? You can buy it from retailers in the US, UK, and AustraliaThe Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super is available today, starting at $229 (about \u00a3180, AU$330). This puts the GTX 1660 Super above the original GTX 1660 by just $10 (about \u00a38, AU$15). But, with the faster GDDR6 memory, you're getting a significant boost in performance for that slight price increase.\u00a0Plus, at this price point it kind of pushes the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti out of relevance. You can get similar performance with the GTX 1660 Super, but for $50 (about \u00a340, AU$70) less. A few months ago, we would have recommended the GTX 1660 Ti without even giving it a second thought, but with the GTX 1660 Super, that card doesn't really have a reason to exist anymore.\u00a0Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super: features and chipsetHow the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super compares to competing cards (Image credit: Infogram; Future)Nvidia Turing architectureNearly double the memory speed of the GTX 1660No Ray Tracing or Tensor coresThe Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super is based on the same TU116 GPU as both the GTX 1660 and the GTX 1660 Ti, but has the same 1,408 CUDA cores as the original 1660. \u00a0The big difference over the original graphics card is the bump up to GDDR6 video memory, resulting in a boost in memory speed from 8Gbps to 14Gbps \u2013 that's just as fast as the VRAM in the massively powerful RTX 2080 Ti.\u00a0This bump up to GDDR6 goes a long way to bridging the gap between the GTX 1660 and the GTX 1660 Ti, but it doesn't quite go all the way.\u00a0And, it's also important to note that this GPU doesn't have the RT and Tensor cores that the RTX 20-series of Turing graphics cards have. This means that while you can technically enable ray tracing, it's going to turn whatever game you try to enable it on into a slideshow \u2013 more so than it does on any other graphics card. During our testing, we accidentally left ray tracing on in Metro Exodus, and even the menu was nigh-unusable (to find out why, check out our \"What is Ray Tracing\" primer on the subject).\u00a0Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super key specsGPU: Nvidia TU116\nStreaming multiprocessors: 22 (Turing)\nCUDA Cores: 1,408\nTensor cores: N/A\nRay tracing cores: N/A\nPower Draw (TGP): 125W\nBoost clock: 1,785MHz\nVRAM: 6GB GDDR6\nMemory Speed: 14Gbps\nInterface: PCIe 3.0 x16\nPower connector: 1 x 8-pinBut, really, at the end of the day you can't expect a graphics card in this weight class to compete with graphics cards that cost twice as much. The GTX 1660 doesn't have RT cores, nor does the GTX 1660 Ti, so it only makes sense for the GTX 1660 Super to be limited here. That honestly makes it all the more impressive that it's still among the best Nvidia GeForce graphics cards you can buy.One thing you should be aware of is that the ports are a bit limited on the GeForce GTX 1660 Super. We tested the EVGA GTX 1660 Super SC Ultra, and it's limited to DVI, HDMI and DisplayPort. This isn't exactly a graphics card that you're going to run 10 displays off of, but we would have liked to see Nvidia drop the DVI port and add in either a second HDMI or maybe even a USB-C port.\u00a0Finally, if you do pick this graphics card up, you will need external power to make it run, in this case an 8-pin PCIe power connector. This means that the GTX 1660 Super does draw 127.4W alone in the most taxing situations, so you should make sure you have at least a 500W power supply.Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super: performanceImage 1 of 6(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)Outstanding 1080p PerformanceCan't quite do 1440p gameplayMakes GTX 1660 Ti completely irrelevantFrankly, the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super is one hell of a graphics card, especially compared to its counterparts. In Time Spy, the GTX 1660 Super was about 5% slower than the GTX 1660 Ti that costs significantly more, and was a whopping 14% faster than the GTX 1660 that it essentially replaces. In Fire Strike, the difference was even more narrow \u2013 its just 2% slower than the GTX 1660 Ti.\u00a0These performance wins continued over into gaming, too. In Metro Exodus at 1080p, the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super averaged 41 frames per second (fps), compared to the 38 scored by the vanilla GTX 1660 and the 44 scored by the 1660 Ti. That might look like a marginal performance difference, but it still matters.\u00a0Image 1 of 7(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)In the less strenuous Middle Earth: Shadow of War, the GTX 1660 Super absolutely dominated, getting an average of 79 fps at 1080p with Ultra quality settings. We feel like this title is more representative of your average AAA game, so you can expect some killer performance in most of the games you throw at it. Games like Metro are few and far between, after all.Even at 1440p, the GTX 1660 Super can handle some heat, but some cracks do start to show. The graphics card does manage to get a respectable 54fps in Middle Earth: Shadow of War, but it absolutely fell apart in Metro: Exodus, only managing to scrape by with 32 fps. That is technically playable, but it's a bit low for playing games on PC, where 60fps is the name of the game. Though, you can lower some settings to get a more comfortable experience.The GTX 1660 Super is basically everything we could have asked it to be in terms of performance. It bridges the gap between the GTX 1660 and GTX 1660 Super beautifully. In fact, just looking at the raw performance numbers it kind of makes the GTX 1660 Ti obsolete. We're not sure that's what Nvidia was going for here, but that's 100% what happened.Should I buy an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super?The Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super is the budget option to beat. (Image credit: Future)Buy it if...You want 1080p gaming at 60 fps\nThis is the best 1080p graphics card going for the price.You don't want to upgrade too much hardware\nThe power draw on the GTX 1660 Super isn't light, but it's lighter than most other options out there, so you can get by with a less-than-500W PSU and PCIe 3.0 motherboard.You're on a budget\nIf you don't have a lot to spend, the GTX 1660 Super is a great way to spend a little moneyDon't buy it if...You want ray tracing or DLSS\nWithout ray tracing or tensor cores, this card is going to have to skip some of the latest gaming technology.You have room in your budget for a better card\nThe GTX 1660 Super is a great option for gamers on a tight budget, but if you're not counting every nickel to buy a graphics card, try to step up to the RTX or AMD RX 6000-series cards, if possible.You want to run lots of displays\nThe GTX 1660 Super only has DVI, HDMI, and DisplayPort input (one each), and no USB Type-C, so if you want to run lots of displays, this card won't be able to do it.Also considerNvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super\nIf you have some wiggle room in your wallet, the RTX 2060 Super is the next generation up from the GTX 1660 Super, but has a lot more to offer for not a whole lot more money.\nRead the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super reviewNvidia GeForce RTX 3050\nWe weren't all that fond of the RTX 3050 when it launched, and compared to the other lower-end Nvidia Ampere cards, it's not one that we'd recommend. But it's the cheapest Ampere card out there and it does offer better performance than the GTX 1660 Super (along with ray tracing and DLSS), so if you have the option to pick it up, it can't hurt.\nRead the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 reviewAMD Radeon RX 5500 XT\nWhile the Radeon RX 5500 XT isn't as capable as the GTX 1660 Super, it's a good match against the GTX 1660, it's definitely a good option if you want to go with an affordable alternative from Team Red. Finding one at MSRP might be a challenge though, as this card got hit with some serious price inflation during the chip shortage.\nRead the full AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT reviewFirst reviewed October 2019Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super: Price Comparison58 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $220.66View $259View $269View $329.99 $285View $999.99 $899.99ViewLow StockShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJackie ThomasSocial Links NavigationJackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN.

(PHOTO: Roslan RAHMAN /AFP)  \u00b7 ROSLAN RAHMAN via Getty Images By Andy Mukherjee (Bloomberg Opinion) \u2014 Corporate bosses could always count on Singapore\u2019s culture of obedience to herd small investors into lowball mergers or take-private deals. No longer. Shareholders are fighting back, with real estate investment trusts emerging as the battleground for activists to take on managers.  It\u2019s a welcome development. REITs pool investors\u2019 money and raise debt to own property. They pass on most of the rental revenue and gains on sales \u2014 after maintenance expenses, management fees, property levies and interest costs \u2014 as dividends. To the city\u2019s wealthy but aging population, these tax-efficient investment vehicles have an intuitive appeal. But Singapore\u2019s favourite asset class has a governance problem. By wielding outsize influence on the managers of trusts \u2014 which are often privately owned operations \u2014 REIT sponsors are able to push an agenda that may not always be in the best interests of minority investors. Yet, thanks to activists like Swiss value investor Jan Moermann, such manoeuvres are no longer guaranteed to win. In December 2020, Moermann\u2019s Quarz Capital Management Ltd. and Hong Kong-based Black Crane Capital persuaded shareholders to vote down the proposed all-stock merger of Sabana Shari\u2019ah Compliant Industrial REIT with ESR-REIT, a larger rival. ESR Cayman Ltd., a Hong Kong-based owner and developer of logistics assets, controls the manager of ESR-REIT while being the largest unit holder in Sabana REIT. The manager of Sabana, which owns warehouses and other industrial properties, had recommended to investors that they accept the offer even though it was 25% below the book value of their shares.  From South Korea to India, shareholder activism in Asia has tended to run into nationalist outrage-mongering. Singapore is different. While a questioning culture may be new to the island-state, openness to foreign money and ideas is ingrained. Which is why the first defeat of an undervalued Singapore REIT merger became a watershed, emboldening even local investors to adopt a somewhat more confrontational stance. After two trusts linked to Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings Pte. announced a S$4.2 billion tie-up last December, David Gerald, the president of the city\u2019s two-decade-old Securities Investors Association, shot off a press statement, asking the manager if unit holders of Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust wouldn\u2019t be better served by only considering a merger at an offer price above net asset value. Following Moermann\u2019s activism and Gerald\u2019s letter, Mapletree Commercial Trust \u2014 the acquirer \u2014 added a pure-cash option to the all-scrip and scrip-plus-cash menu, effectively sweetening its offer.   Story continues Going beyond special situations such as buyouts and mergers, activist investors are shining a light on the process by which a REIT manager in Singapore arrives at any financing decision, scrutinising it for its potential to add or destroy value. To that end, Moermann is once again engaged in a war of words with Donald Han, the chief executive officer of the manager of Sabana Industrial REIT. (It has dropped its Shari\u2019ah Compliant tag so it can own industrial properties that don\u2019t necessarily follow Islamic principles.)The manager wants shareholders to approve a dividend reinvestment plan, issuance of new shares, and appointment of Charlie Chan, a former Credit Suisse Group AG trader, as an independent director. Quarz, the second-largest investor in Sabana, says in a YouTube video that it has serious doubts about Chan\u2019s independence as he has had financial dealings with ESR Cayman, the REIT\u2019s controlling shareholder, in the past.Besides, according to Bloomberg data, Chan is the fifth-largest shareholder of Aims Apac REIT, a rival to Sabana in which ESR Cayman again owns the biggest stake. Han has responded by saying that Chan\u2019s dealings with ESR Cayman took place before it became a sponsor of Sabana. Chan told the Business Times that he\u2019s just a shareholder in Aims Apac, and not a \u201ckingmaker\u201d.Moermann\u2019s team is also asking shareholders to vote against the proposed equity dilution. As one of Singapore\u2019s more lightly leveraged REITs, Sabana can always raise additional debt. In an e-mail reply to my questions, Han said that while the trust has \u201csubstantial headroom\u201d to borrow, it's crucial to have more options available in order to act on new opportunities should they arise.So far, however, Quarz\u2019s advice to Sabana shareholders has been on the money: Since the merger fell through, the stock has given a total return of 44%, the third best among all Singapore REITs. And while the manager may be right about the need to scale up the trust, it won\u2019t hurt to improve its track record of extracting value from existing assets. Sabana sold a six-story data center for S$99.6 million in cash in January 2019. Two years and a renovation later, 9, Tai Seng Drive had won a certificate for environmental-friendliness and was valued by the new owner at S$280 million.Han says that data centers require high capital expenditure to develop and specialised expertise \u2014 which Sabana didn\u2019t have \u2014 to manage them. Additionally, a Singapore government moratorium on new data centers in 2019 altered the demand-supply situation, a development that the REIT manager couldn\u2019t possibly have foreseen. The sale proceeds were used, among other things, to add a new retail and F&B component to the trust\u2019s flagship technology park. However, Quarz says the per square foot cost of this enhancement was even higher than building a new mall on Orchard Road, Singapore\u2019s main shopping district.Whatever the outcome of the April 26 shareholder meeting, Quarz\u2019s advocacy has already led to an improvement in how intermediaries report the votes of investors in respect to the shares in their custody. The city\u2019s \u201cone proxy rule\u201d used to present a distorted picture of shareholders\u2019 intention by preventing banks and brokers from submitting two separate aggregate values of \u201cfor\u201d and \u201cagainst\u201d votes by their customers. The usual practice was to simply report the difference in the winning side\u2019s favour. Now that custodians have to supply both values in the proxy form, dissent in M&A situations has a fairer shot at success.Next year will mark the 10th anniversary of a penny-stock scandal that sapped the confidence of Singapore investors. Over the past decade, the stock market has seen daily turnover shrink at a compounded annual rate of 1%. REITs have been a rare bright spot, and shareholders are doing their bit to protect its sheen: The increasingly keen contests over everything from price to proxy suggests that the city-state\u2019s polite investors are no longer pushovers. But regulators have a role, too. Making REIT managers more accountable to all unit holders \u2014 and not just the sponsor \u2014 is the obvious next step.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

The idea is that instead of using your dumb 1500 watt space heater, why not swap in NVIDIA's smart heater which can (depending on your choice) either give you carbon zero or carbon negativity.\nNVIDIA tackles the wasted work problem with the Carbon Negative Heating Consortium\nNVIDIA starts with talking about the \"Wasted Work\" problem. Homes are heated either using gas or electric heaters (and rarely, heat pumps). Considering heat is the end product of pretty much all work done (computations) anyways, this is energy that could have been used to do valuable calculations before being wasted as heat. Based on the profitability rates of today's crypto, NVIDIA estimates that 1500 watts is sufficient to generate roughly $500 in profits (after accounting for your energy bill).\n\n\nNow let's talk about how this works. If you use a 1500W space heater for 8 hours per day per month, you will use roughly 360 KWH of electricity per month. The rate for CO2 production right now is roughly 0.85 pounds per KWH. This means you are contributing roughly 306 pounds in emissions per month. For those working with SI units, this is 163 KG of CO2 produced per month. Now it costs roughly $600 to remove (or sequester) 1 tonne of C02. In other words, NVIDIA's estimated $500 would be good enough to sequester 830 KGs per month. Now here is where NVIDIA gives users a choice, the heater will have two options: Carbon Zero and Carbon Negative.\nIn Carbon Zero mode, roughly 17% of the total proceeds will go to a corporation that will use that to sequester your entire CO2 contribution from the air. You can pocket the rest in an embedded cryptocurrency hardware wallet. In Carbon Negativity, you can set how much more you want to contribute to carbon removal - all the way up to 100%.\n\nNVIDIA's HEATFORCE Mark I is powered by not one but two Ada Lovelace GPUs. These GPUs have been specialized for cryptocurrency mining and will not have any display ports and also rock a very high clock rate. We are looking at close to 500 MH/s of cryptocurrency production at roughly 1400W consumed. The company has also bundled a 1500W solid state PSU with the space heater. As far as heating performance goes, the HEATFORCE Mark I is capable of quickly heating up rooms 17x17 meters in size. It is also equipped with a medical grade HEPA filter that will remove up to 99.99% viruses, bacteria and allergens from the air.\nThe \"smart\" features of the device are powered by NVIDIA's next-generation Grace SoC. It features Wifi 8 connectivity for uninterrupted pool-mining support and has an automatic temperature regulator (which is naturally a crypto hash rate regulator). It also contains PM2.5 and humidity sensors to calculate the US AQI of your room in real time. While we don't know the pricing yet, this is an incredibly good idea and hits a lot of points in one go. Not only are you getting a heating device which is actually using the energy before wasting it as heat, but you can actually contribute to removing CO2 from the environment. The medical-grade HEPA filter also means that you need to worry less about any pathogens or irritants in the air.\nYou can sign up for the NVIDIA pre-order waiting list over here.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPiper Sandler Sees 10x Increase In NVIDIA\u2019s GPU Capacity And A 35x Decrease In Model Inference Costs As Seeds For The Upcoming \u201cAI Wave 2\u201d\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n148\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n89\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nTesla Warns Trump Administration That Tariffs Could Make Its Production Costs Jump\n\n\n\n49\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Board Partners Silently Increase Prices Of Radeon RX 9070 Series; Base Models Priced At Up To $130 Higher\n\n\n\n34\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nM3 Ultra Runs DeepSeek R1 With 671 Billion Parameters Using 448GB Of Unified Memory, Delivering High Bandwidth Performance At Under 200W Power Consumption, With No Need For A Multi-GPU Setup\n\n\n\n33\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\n12V-2\u00d76 Power Connector Cooks At Over 150\u00b0C With A \u201cWater-Cooled\u201d NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090\n\n\n\n2316\nComments\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Releases Another Hotfix Driver to Resolve Black Screen Issues, Marking the Firm\u2019s Fifth Attempt to Address The Problem\n\n\n\n1300\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

In the past, they pioneered market-first plans such as a 36-month fixed rate plan and a plan offering free electricity on Sundays. And yes, they were also among the first to advertise heavily \u2013 including with MoneySmart. (This post is not sponsored.) So, do Geneco Singapore\u2019s electricity plans live up to the hype? Let\u2019s take an impartial look at their electricity plan offerings and find out which ones are best for who. Geneco electricity plans comparison  Geneco electricity planPrice per kWhContract duration Geneco Give Us A Try$0.29006 months Geneco Get It Fixed 12$0.290012 months Geneco Get It Fixed 24$0.290024 months  Geneco has 3 electricity plans, including a 6-month trial (Give Us A Try). The rest of the plans are Get It Fixed for 12 months or 24 months. By the way, all Geneco plans do not have hidden fees (e.g. admin fee, transmission loss charges), but there is a security deposit ranging from $50 to $220 required at the moment. There are fees, though, for early termination, late payment, autopay failure, etc. and these are all stated in each plan\u2019s factsheet. Geneco Get It Fixed \u2013 fixed price electricity plans Fixed price plans are the cheapest electricity plans on the market right now. As the name suggests, you\u2019ll be charged at a fixed rate per kWh for the entire duration of your contract. (In contrast, packages that are tied to the floating electricity tariff can get more or less expensive every quarter.) Geneco actually has 2 fixed price plans, and 1 trial plan:  Geneco electricity planPrice per kWhContract duration Geneco Give Us A Try$0.29006 months Geneco Get It Fixed 12$0.290012 months Geneco Get It Fixed 24$0.290024 months  Although Geneco has standardised their prices at $0.2900 per kWh for all plans, the Geneco Give Us A Try is their 6-month low-commitment plan for those who are worried about switching to a private electricity retailer.  After the contract period ends, your contract will be automatically renewed for another 6 months, but Geneco makes no promises on what the new rate will be. You\u2019ll just be notified of the new rate 10 days before your contract expires so you can decide whether to terminate your contract or not. For the other plans (Get It Fixed 12 or 24), Geneco offers a standard rate of $0.2900 per kWh. As of April 2022, this is not one of the lowest fixed rates on the market. Competitors such as Senoko\u2019s LifePower24 plan is going at $0.2680/kWh, and Keppel Electric\u2019s Fixed24 at $0.2890/kWh.   Story continues Geneco\u2019s Get It Fixed 36 has since been phased out.Geneco Get It Less \u2013 discount off tariff plan (ceased)The other major type of electricity plan that Geneco used to offer is a discount off the electricity tariff, which is set quarterly by the Energy Market Authority. (For more on electricity pricing, see this electricity retailer 101 article).Here were the rates when Geneco\u2019s discount off tariff plans still existed: Geneco electricity planPrice per kWhContract duration Geneco Get It Less 2422% off tariff = now 19.02\u00a224 months Called Get It Less 24, this is a 24-month contract where you\u2019ll be charged a standard discount of 22% off the current tariff (i.e. whatever SP is charging). The electricity tariff essentially a floating rate that can go up or down. It dipped slightly in April 2019, but it\u2019s really hard to predict if it\u2019ll go up or down since there are all kinds of global factors that come into play.For Q2 2019, the tariff is 24.39\u00a2 per kWh. If you opted for the Geneco discount off tariff plan, you pay 22% off this rate, which made your rate 19.02\u00a2 per kWh.This type of pricing is for those who like to play safe, because there\u2019s no chance of you \u201closing out\u201d if the tariff falls. Even if it rises, you\u2019ll still save quite a lot of money compared to going with SP. But, note that the discount of 22% off isn\u2019t the best on the market \u2013 there are other companies offering as much as 25% off back then in 2019.Geneco Get It Green \u2013 green electricity plan (ceased)Props to Geneco for offering a \u201cgreen\u201d option among its electricity plans. The Get It Green plan was a 12-month contract that costed a little more than Get It Less.Here was the price for Geneco\u2019s Get It Green when it still existed: Geneco electricity planPrice per kWhContract duration Geneco Get It Green20.33\u00a212 months With this plan, the electricity you used was supposedly be 100% carbon neutral. There wasn\u2019t much of an explanation on the site, but from reading the FAQ I gathered that Geneco supplied electricity in the same way, except it also bought carbon credits under the Verra programme to offset your consumption.Note, though, that this wasn\u2019t the cheapest 100% carbon neutral plan on the market. For example, ES Power also offered a 24-month green plan at a much cheaper rate of 18.45\u00a2 per kWh back then.Geneco Get Free Sundays \u2013 free electricity on Sundays (ceased)You might have seen the ads for this particular Geneco fixed rate plan that offers free electricity on Sundays in the past: Geneco electricity planPrice per kWhContract duration Geneco Get Free Sundays22.50\u00a2 from Mon to Sat24 months I\u2019m pretty sure that this one was mostly a marketing gimmick, because the rate of 22.50\u00a2 per kWh was so much higher than the standard rate (17.78\u00a2). I mean, how much can you realistically save?While it sounded pretty doable to spend all of Sunday doing energy-intensive chores like washing and drying clothes, meal prepping (assuming you use electricity for cooking), and even washing dishes (if you use a dishwasher), the problem is that the bulk of electricity consumption isn\u2019t the kind you can spread out. Think stuff like lights, air con, and shower water heaters.Also, note that you don\u2019t necessarily get your actual Sunday usage discounted off the bill with this plan. You need to obtain and install what\u2019s called an AMI meter at a \u201cnominal fee\u201d, otherwise, it\u2019ll just be based on a national estimate provided by the EMA.

UOB Malaysia today announced that it will appoint Ng Wei Wei as its first female Chief Executive Officer (CEO), effective May 1, 2022. She will succeed Wong Kim Choong (KC), who will relinquish the position after leading the Bank since 2012. Wong will take on a new role as Senior Adviser and will oversee the integration of Bank\u2019s and Citi\u2019s retail banking business, until his planned retirement.  Ng is a seasoned banker with broad experience and in-depth knowledge of the financial industry. In the earlier part of her career, from 2000 to 2006, she honed her banking skills and developed her core values at UOB Malaysia. Following various leadership roles at global financial institutions in Malaysia and Hong Kong, she returned to UOB Malaysia in 2019 as Managing Director and Country Head of Wholesale Banking, before assuming the role of Deputy CEO in 2021. She has been instrumental in growing UOB Malaysia\u2019s Wholesale Banking franchise, and advancing the Bank\u2019s strategic priorities including its Environment, Social and Governance, and innovation agenda, as well as supporting its customers to expand regionally by tapping on the Bank\u2019s connectivity, expertise and capabilities. Wee Ee Cheong, Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, UOB Group said, \u201cI would like to thank KC for his years of strong leadership and to congratulate Wei Wei on her appointment as CEO of UOB Malaysia. Wei Wei\u2019s appointment reflects our firm belief in the importance and benefits of diversity as we anticipate customer needs in an increasingly complex, changing and volatile environment.  \u201cKC retires with a track record of advancing the Bank\u2019s position in the areas of customer service, regional connectivity, innovation, and sustainability. I am confident that under Wei Wei\u2019s leadership, UOB Malaysia will continue to scale greater heights as we support our customers to seize opportunities locally and across the region.\u201d Under Wong\u2019s leadership, UOB Malaysia has grown steadily to its strongest position yet, as the largest foreign bank in the country today. He will continue to contribute to the Bank\u2019s growth though his role as Senior Adviser on the Citi consumer banking acquisition, one of the most significant corporate exercises for UOB in recent times, the UOB announcement says.

(PHOTO: YeoMama Batik)  \u00b7 YeoMama Batik SINGAPORE \u2014 It\u2019s been four years since the business took off, but Desleen Yeo still sheds tears of joy while standing at the entrance of YeoMama Batik\u2019s boutique \u2014 the fruit of the Yeo family\u2019s labour. The 31-year-old co-founder of YeoMama Batik told Yahoo Finance Singapore she is a \u201cvery emotional\u201d person who had tried her hand at multiple endeavours after graduation.  Yeo had worked as a piano teacher, a receptionist at a pole studio, a customer service officer at a bar in Sentosa, an events executive at an agency, a freelance presentation designer, and a henna tattoo artist. She even tried to sell her own line of polewear and bring karaoke booths to Singapore \u2014 both of which were ill-fated. This was before the batik life \u201cchose her\u201d, Yeo said. The seed of YeoMama Batik was first planted by Yeo\u2019s mama, who casually suggested selling batik clothing when Yeo \u2014 then unemployed \u2014\u00a0was stuck at home in the later half of 2017 due to an ankle surgery. Yeo, usually energetic and active, was so bored that she threw herself into the conception of YeoMama Batik with S$40,000 from her personal savings. What was \u201cfor fun\u201d soon turned into a full-fledged batik fashion line from fabrics sourced in Indonesia. Yeo would then have tailors make the clothes from designs from YeoMama Batik, including trendier styles such as A-line dresses, cheongsam maxi dresses and jumpsuits. She experiments with different styles to get a better sense of what her clients like.  The effort that goes each handmade piece is reflected in the price, which can range from a $68 top to a $368 cardigan. Under the guidance of her businessman father, Yeo first operated from a small store space behind a salon in January 2018, stocking batik clothing just ahead of Chinese New Year. Business was so brisk that the landlady soon \u201cchased\u201d YeoMama Batik out for disrupting the salon. Yeo then moved to a remote location at Jalan Pelikat, but that didn't stop the customers from coming. By 2019, YeoMama Batik had outgrown its space. The boutique then found a new home in Oxley Bizhub. YeoMama Batik now pulls in a stable five-figure revenue on a monthly basis, compared to a borderline five-figure revenue when it first began. A family business is fun but very annoying Working with family is \u201cfun\u201d but also \u201cvery annoying\u201d, Yeo said with a big laugh. \"I see my parents at home, I get nagged at at home and when I come to office I also get nagged\u2026 over here (my mother) can still come over and (pick on things),\u201d Yeo said. She mused, \u201cI guess it\u2019s a traditional upbringing where they have certain standards of how a daughter or a wife should be. They need to know how to clean the house, cook, but at the same time my dad as a businessman hopes I can run my own business. So it\u2019s like you want to juggle all of these and you want me to meet the expectation of a traditional wife so how do I balance? Sometimes you just snap.\u201d   Story continues The boutique\u2019s cleanliness was a sore point between Yeo and her mother, who would insist on cleaning everything.\u201cI feel like a business should feel like a business. Sometimes it feels like it\u2019s being handled too much like a home.\u201dApart from the occasional friction with her mother, Yeo\u2019s business approach also clashes with her father, who is more \u201ctraditional\u201d. While Yeo prioritises the intangible, \"feel-good factor\" of the business, her father is more focused on the business' tangible aspects.\u201cHis generation of doing business is a lot of \u2018I sell you buy\u2019. Our generation of doing business is you need to focus on customer loyalty, the customer service part of things and there\u2019s social media, there\u2019s engagement,\u201d Yeo said.Nevertheless, family is an integral part of the YeoMama Batik brand, with the brand\u2019s story featuring a quirky video with candid shots of Yeo\u2019s entire family \u2014her parents, two brothers and a grandmother, dressed in batik clothes (YeoMama Batik of course).Family also influences Yeo\u2019s business decisions. For the foreseeable future, Yeo, who married last year, plans to start a family. To prepare for the potential disruption at work, she has expanded the staff strength to 5 full-time workers so that they can manage the store even when she is away.Pandemic problemsLike other businesses, YeoMama Batik ran into its fair share of hiccups when the pandemic struck. Yeo was unable to fly to Indonesia to talk with the tailors. She also had to focus on digitalising her business as her boutique remained closed.Even more worrying was the drop in sales, as the partial lockdown put a stop to events resulting in a lack of demand for batik clothes.\u201cThe revenue was just barely covering (our salaries),\u201d quipped Yeo.Yeo had to completely change the production line-up so that she could stock casual clothing instead of dresses and other formal wear. She improvised by using cloths that would have been used for the dresses so that they did not have to sample new materials.But the pandemic was not without its silver lining. YeoMama Batik\u2019s activewear line, which was a flop when it debuted in September 2019, sold like hotcakes during the partial lockdown.Communication was also a challenge after Yeo took her interactions with her tailors online. The tailors were not fluent in English while Yeo\u2019s Bahasa Indonesia was rudimentary.She also had to contend with tailors falling sick, or being affected by floods. To deal with that, Yeo is always on the lookout for tailors to diversify her business.Even with all these obstacles, when asked if she had ever considered returning to a corporate job, Yeo responded with a resounding \u201cno\u201d.\u201cJust try lor\u201d was her candid advice to aspiring entrepreneurs. \u201cI just feel like there\u2019s nothing you can do wrong about it because every wrong thing will come out with a lesson learnt\u2026 You never try you never know,\u201d she said.Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingapore  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Machine learning is ushering in an era once imagined only in novels. It is the reason behind the wondrous technologies like almost flawless Google search results, self-driving cars, AI, robotics, and technology-based healthcare systems. In this article, we will compare the top 2 machine learning stocks- NVIDIA and Qualcomm.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is a visual computing company worldwide. It operates in two segments: Graphics and Compute & Networking. In comparison, QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM) develops and commercializes foundational technologies and products used in mobile devices and other wireless products. It operates through three segments: Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT); Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL); and Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI).The current stock price of NVIDIA is US$221.98, a 1.91% gain from the previous close, in comparison the current stock price of Qualcomm is US$141.05, a 1.24% gain from the previous close. Both companies are experiencing historic high market caps, as they surged in price almost consistently since the onset of the pandemic.The long-term opportunities for NVIDIA come from the ways its chips can be used by other tech companies and its current market position over competitors like Advanced Micro Devices. Not only is NVIDIA a GPU leader, but its chips are tapping into long-term growth trends in gaming, AI cloud computing, and 5G data centers. Qualcomm is banking on the next wave of cellular devices, 5G smartphones, as a potential catalyst for its business. While 5G could take a few years to fully take off, Qualcomm already has 110 5G agreements with smartphone makers and all of the major handset manufacturers for its 5G licensing.Front-end semiconductor production is expected to meet demand in the coming quarters, driven by substantial investments in the industry. QCOM and NVDA are well-positioned to benefit from the machine learning industry tailwinds.Machine learning stocksRelated StoriesNo stories found.\n\n\nFollow UsDisruptive Tech\u2304Artificial IntelligenceBig DataData ScienceProgrammingGadgets\u2304Best LaptopsBest SmartphonesBest SmartwatchBest in TabletsFinance\u2304CryptocurrencyStocksBlockchainFintechTrending\u2304Generative AILLMsChatGPTBitcoinEducation\u2304Top InstitutesTop CoursesTop Online ProgramsTop Companies\u00a9 Analytics Insight 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytics Insight\n www.analyticsinsight.net \nINSTALL APP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(PHOTO: REUTERS/Aly Song)  \u00b7 Aly Song / reuters By Zheping Huang (Bloomberg) \u2014 Tencent Holdings Ltd. doled out more than US$200 million apiece to two unidentified executives in 2021, even as it cut founder Pony Ma\u2019s compensation for a year in which Beijing\u2019s crackdown on the private sector walloped the internet giant\u2019s stock. The company said in its annual report that its two highest-paid individuals were not among the directors or most senior executives. One made about HK$1.599 billion, while another person made about HK$1.589 billion \u2014 the equivalent of US$204 million and US$203 million respectively. That would put the pair among the 20 most highly paid executives in the U.S., a roster led by Tesla Inc. founder Elon Musk and Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook.  The company didn\u2019t name the two executives. Tencent\u2019s most prominent talent includes Allen Zhang, hailed by the industry as the founder of the ubiquitous WeChat messaging service, and gaming business chief Mark Ren. Ma, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, took home a total of 44.1 million yuan last year, down 25% from the year before. The billionaire founder still holds more than 7% of the company, giving him a net worth of about US$39 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His closest lieutenant, President Martin Lau, earned 24% less than a year earlier or 323 million yuan, including a 32% decline in his bonus to 23 million yuan, according to the company\u2019s annual report. Tencent is among the technology giants that came under fire from China\u2019s regulators last year, as the government led a sweeping crackdown on what it deemed monopolistic practices and services contrary to Communist Party priorities. Beijing restricted the amount of time children could play online games and imposed new restrictions on online education, both critical to Tencent\u2019s operations.  Its shares dropped 19% during 2021, while rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. tumbled 49%. Tencent\u2019s stock has dropped another 16% through Thursday. For fiscal year ended in March 2021, Alibaba paid about US$46 million salaries and other cash benefits to its directors and executive officers, a 36% drop from a year earlier. But while growth is slowing for the industry, the most sought-after engineers and tech executives continue to command outsized salaries because of endemic talent shortages. Zhang, the progenitor of the messaging service that sits at the heart of Tencent\u2019s gaming and social media businesses, commands a cult-like following in China thanks to WeChat\u2019s explosive popularity. His colleague Ren is widely credited with helping establish the world\u2019s biggest game publishing empire, encompassing blockbuster names from League of Legends to Clash of Clans and with investments in studios like Supercell, Epic and Riot Games. The company didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.   Story continues Tencent also increased pay for its staff in general in 2021. Employee benefits expenses \u2014 which include wages, bonuses, share awards and medical costs \u2014 leapt 37% to 95.5 billion yuan.\u00a9 2022 Bloomberg L.P.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

The bungalow was previously the residence of the late property tycoon Cheong Eak Chong.  According to a title search, the property is now in the hands of seven of his sons, each with a one-seventh share. Three of the sons have links to Singapore-listed Hong Fok Corp. They are Cheong Kim Pong, former chairman and CEO of the firm; Cheong Pin Chuan, the current joint CEO; and former executive director Cheong Pin Seng. The other four sons are involved in Tian Teck Land, namely Cheong Hooi Hong, chairman and CEO of the firm; as well as Cheong Kheng Lim, Cheong Keng Hooi and Cheong Sim Lam, who are directors of the firm. The owners have engaged CBRE to put the site for sale by tender. There are two plots on the site: The double-storey bungalow and four outhouses that sit on a 117,230 sq ft elevated site, and the road bordering the site and the neighbouring Oxley Garden private condominium, which has a total area of 33,375 sq ft. When combined, the total area of the entire plot is 151,205 sq ft.    Map showing the two plots at 5 Oxley Rise, which includes the road access to the neighbouring Oxley Garden apartment blocks (Source: URA) Read more: Oxley Garden to be put up for en bloc sale at $200 mil, alongside bungalow at 5 Oxley Rise The property at 5 Oxley Rise had changed hands over the years and had been rebuilt many times over the years. The existing bungalow is said to have been constructed in the 1920s by Sir Manasseh Meyer, a Jewish businessman who also built the neighbouring Chesed-El Synagogue at 2 Oxley Rise.  Until two years ago, a family member had occupied the mansion, with its spacious balconies, wide windows and terracotta roof. Given its lofty perch, the bungalow commands \u201ca 360\u00b0 panoramic view of the city\u201d, according to Michael Tay, head of CBRE capital markets Singapore. The site is zoned for \u201cresidential, two-storey mixed-landed\u201d use. If the existing mansion is conserved, the URA will consider gazetting the site into a Good Class Bungalow (GCB) area. Based on the assumption, the developer is able to develop six new GCBs on the site with a minimum land area of 15,070 sq ft, estimates CBRE\u2019s Tay.    The existing mansion at 5 Oxley Rise, which if conserved, URA would consider gazetting the site as a Good Class Bungalow (GCB) area, and six new GCBs could be built on the site (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)   Story continues Alternatively, the site could also be redeveloped into a single large mansion or a mixed-use landed or strata landed development, subject to approval from the relevant authorities.\u201cPlum landed sites that are larger than 100,000 sq ft are typically tightly held and rarely put up for sale,\u201d Tay comments. \u201cAs such, this asset class has been proven to be resilient through the various market cycles.\u201dThe price tag, starting from $300 million, reflects a land rate of $1,984 psf, excluding development charge, which will vary depending on what the developer builds on the site.\u201cIf 5 Oxley Rise is zoned exclusively for GCB use, it would be the only one in the prime Oxley area, and will be coveted by many,\u201d observes Samuel Eyo, managing director of Lighthouse Property Consultants.  Location of 5 Oxley Rise (Source: EdgeProp Inspector)Some of the recent GCB transactions in the vicinity include 2 Cluny Hill, which changed hands for $63.7 million ($4,291 psf) in April 2021; 30 Nassim Road for $128.8 million ($4,005 psf) in March 2021; and 33 Nassim Road for $230 million ($2,721 psf) in mid-2019.Alternatively, an ultra-high net worth individual would want to conserve the existing mansion at 5 Oxley Rise as \"a party house\", and build a new \u201csuper bungalow\u201d for his own use, reckons Lighthouse\u2019s Eyo.The public tender for 5 Oxley Rise will close on June 8.Check out the latest listings near Cluny Hill, Nassim RoadSee Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) [UPDATE] GCB at Olive Road sold to grandson of late tycoon Wee Thiam Siew for $50.24 mil [UPDATE] Oxley Garden to be put up for en bloc sale at $200 mil, alongside bungalow at 5 Oxley Rise [UPDATE] Conservation bungalow at Mountbatten Road, now Sing Hoe Hotel, for sale at $27 mil  En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

Hatten Land has, on April 13, announced that it is rebranding its existing Elements Mall in Melaka, Malaysia, to Element X. The mall will be reconfigured into Southeast Asia\u2019s first large-scale integrated electronic sports (or Esports) experiential hub and Metaverse gateway. The hub will include a themed hotel, an Esports arena and pro-Esports facilities.  The mall is located along the straits waterfront and has a gross floor area (GFA) of 1.88 million sq ft of retail space across 13 floors. According to Hatten Land, it is in the advanced stages of discussions with various established partners in the Metaverse, Esports, mobile gaming and digital-related industries. Dato\u2019 Colin Tan, executive chairman and managing director of Hatten Land, says: \u201cWith its rapid growth and popularity, Esports is shaping up to be the new nexus of sports, media, and entertainment, selling out venues and drawing massive audiences for televised and online events.\u201d \u201cAt the same time, Element X can leverage on the Metaverse trend to create new frontiers and utility for lifestyles, communications and businesses ahead, creating the linkage between the physical world and the digital world,\u201d he adds. \u201cAs interest and attention continues to build for the Metaverse and Esports industry, we aim to build and expand the infrastructure necessary to deliver the best Metaverse and Esports experience possible for fans and professional players not just in Malaysia, but across the world.\u201d  Share placement At the same time, Hatten Land will be undertaking a share placement exercise to raise some $5.0 million. Under the placement agreements, Hatten Land will allot and issue a total of 121.95 million new ordinary shares at an issue price of 4.1 cents per share to 10 subscribers or placees. Some of those who have subscribed to the share placement exercise include Toh Soon Huat, Mock Pak Lum, Priscil Poh Ly-May and Samuel Ong Chee Ming (Wang Jiming). Toh is a full-time volunteer executive chairman of Sian Chay Medical Institution, while Mock is the managing partner of Tembusu Blockchain Fund I.

Loh is the founder and owner of Singapore-based design and build specialist P\u2019art 1 Design, while Ong is the founder of Excelgames Interactive, Asia Pacific\u2019s leading distributor of video gaming related products. The placement shares represent around 6.57% of the enlarged share capital, while the placement price represents a discount of 10% over the five-day volume weighted average price (VWAP) of 4.56 cents per share up to April 8.   Story continues \u201cWe are pleased to garner strong interest in our latest share placement exercise, which demonstrated the confidence that these prominent investors have in our growth ambitions with Asia\u2019s digital economy,\u201d says Dato\u2019 Tan.\u201cWith the new funds raised, we can further accelerate our digital roadmap that centres around creating new business value propositions and enhancing shareholder value,\u201d he adds.Shares in Hatten Land last traded at 4.5 cents before its trading halt on April 11.See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore Hatten Land signs agreement with new partner for crypto mining activities SMI Vantage to complete installation of 3,100 cryptocurrency mining machines in Southeast Asia by end-May 2022 Shares in Viking Offshore & Marine plunge 10.2% after rights cum warrants issue announcement and proposed name change Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

In layman terms, it is when stocks are trading at a \u201cdiscount\u201d. But where can we find such good deals? From time to time, companies may see their share prices fluctuate wildly due to a combination of external and internal factors.  Such occurrences represent opportunities for investors to purchase shares at lower valuations, thus offering a greater margin of safety. Even multi-billion dollar companies are not exempt from the volatility of the stock market. As long as their fundamentals remain intact, these companies can qualify as wise additions to your investment portfolio. Here are four such companies that are trading close to their 52-week lows. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: FB) Meta Platforms is a technology company that owns social media platforms Facebook and Instagram, and instant messaging service WhatsApp. Last October, the company rebranded itself as Meta to be more in line with its vision of building technology to connect people through the metaverse. The metaverse is a network of online virtual worlds that can be accessed from anywhere, and could change the way humans interact with one another over the internet. Investors are skeptical of Meta\u2019s new focus. In 2021 alone, the company posted an operating loss of over US$10 billion on its metaverse segment, which they refer to as Reality Labs. In addition, the company also posted its first ever fall in daily active users on Facebook in the fourth quarter of 2021, although the decrease from 1,930 million to 1,929 million was mild. At the time of writing, Meta is trading at a share price of US$180.95, almost at its 52-week low of US$179.50. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) Netflix is a leading entertainment services company that offers television series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a variety of genres and languages. The company recently hit the headlines after its shares plunged 35% in a single day, wiping out almost US$50 billion in market value. A dramatic reversal in subscriber growth was the main factor behind the decline. In its fiscal 2022 first quarter (1Q22) earnings report, the company posted a drop of 200,000 paid members compared to the previous quarter.  To make things worse, Netflix announced that it expected to lose another two million subscribers for 2Q22. The company has set out plans to address this slide. It will explore advertising by offering a lower-tier subscription service and crack down on account sharing to increase its subscriber numbers.   Story continues Netflix\u2019s current share price of US$198.40 is close to its 52-week low of US$198.28.PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL)PayPal is a global giant for online payments and money transfers.The company operates a wide range of financial products and services, including payments integration system Braintree, remittance service Xoom, and Venmo, a digital wallet.PayPal\u2019s share price suffered a dramatic fall of around 25% after reporting its FY2021 earnings.In the report, PayPal spooked investors after it downgraded its revenue growth guidance for 2022 to between 15% and 17%.Other external factors are also holding back PayPal\u2019s growth.Supply chain challenges and rising inflation are having a dampening effect on consumer spending, and are negatively impacting online payments.As it attempts to ride out these challenges, the company is pressing on with new partnerships and initiatives.It recently announced its involvement in the relaunch of Made, an online marketplace showcasing the works of fashion designers and creators.PayPal is currently trading at US$83.70, compared to a 52-week low of US$83.57.Upstart Holdings (NASDAQ: UPST)Upstart is an American financial technology company that aims to make borrowing more affordable to the masses.The company owns a lending software platform that is provided to banks as a cloud-based service.The platform uses artificial intelligence to assess risk levels for individual borrowers, helping banks to price loans more efficiently and reach a wider customer base.Upstart\u2019s share price has been on a rollercoaster ride in the past year.After reaching a peak of US$401.49 in October 2021, the company\u2019s shares have plunged 81.9% to a 52-week low of US$72.50, and currently trades at US$75.49.But the company has performed strongly despite these sharp swings in market value.In its fiscal year 2021, Upstart\u2019s revenue grew 264% to reach US$848.6 million, while net income surged 2,164% year on year, hitting US$135.4 million.To further accelerate its growth, the company recently launched a mobile-first online platform, Upstart Auto Retail, to capture opportunities in the automobile financing space.How do you decide if a growth stock is worth your money?

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

It\u2019s a good idea to think about how to deploy this money into investments, both to help you beat inflation as well as to build up a sturdy retirement fund. However, different investors will have different investment objectives.  Income investors may desire to own a portfolio of REITs for their passive income flow. But for myself, I prefer a healthy mix of blue-chip companies and smaller businesses that offer both stability, dividends, and some growth. If I had S$30,000 to spare, here are four stocks that I will deploy the funds into. Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd (SGX: S63) Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd, or STE, is a global technology, defence and engineering group serving clients in the aerospace, smart city, and public security sectors. The group reported a robust set of earnings for fiscal 2021 (FY2021), with revenue increasing by 7.5% year on year to S$7.7 billion. Net profit climbed by 9.3% year on year to S$570.5 million. A final dividend of S$0.10 was declared, bringing the total FY2021 dividend to S$0.15 per share, unchanged from last year. STE\u2019s trailing dividend yield stood at 3.7%.  The group continues to witness a recovery in its commercial aerospace business and reported a robust order book of S$19.3 billion at the end of 2021, a three-year high. STE plans to raise its FY2022 dividend to S$0.16 and has approved a policy to pay quarterly dividends of S$0.04 each, signalling confidence in its prospects. United Overseas Bank Ltd (SGX: U11) United Overseas Bank Ltd, or UOB, is one of Singapore\u2019s three large local banks. The lender reported a strong set of financial numbers for FY2021, with net profit hitting S$4 billion. Its loan book grew 10% year on year while fee income hit a record high of S$2.4 billion due to higher wealth management and loan-related activities. The bank\u2019s net interest income should benefit from rising interest rates as the US Federal Reserve engages in monetary tightening to curb runaway inflation. UOB is also poised to grow its franchise after its acquisition of Citigroup\u2019s (NYSE: C) consumer banking business in four countries \u2014 Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The bank paid out a total dividend of S$1.20 for FY2021, translating to a trailing dividend yield of 3.9% for its shares.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

The lender released its business update for fiscal 2022\u2019s first quarter (1Q2022) and reported a net profit of S$1.8 billion, its second-highest on record. DBS managed this performance despite growing macroeconomic headwinds such as slower global growth, higher inflation and supply chain disruptions brought about by the Russia-Ukraine war. Here are five highlights from the bank\u2019s latest results. A creditable financial performance Net interest income for 1Q2022 came in at S$2.19 billion, up 4% year on year from S$2.11 billion. However, net fee and commission income dipped by 7% year on year due to lower wealth management and investment banking fees. As a result, the bank\u2019s total income dipped 3% year on year to S$3.75 billion. Expenses rose 4% year on year to S$1.64 billion, and profit before allowances declined by 7% year on year to S$2.1 billion. DBS\u2019 cost to income ratio stood at 43.9%, higher than the prior quarter\u2019s 41.2% but significantly lower than the 50.7% chalked up in its previous quarter. Net profit fell by 10% year on year to S$1.8 billion. A rebound in net interest margin Rising interest rates have led to DBS reporting a reversal in the downtrend for net interest margin (NIM). NIM stood at 1.46% for 1Q2022, down slightly from the 1.49% reported a year ago. However, it was 0.03 percentage points higher than the 1.43% for 4Q2021 and represents a potential rebound with interest rates creeping up. At the same time, the bank also reported a healthy 8% year on year growth in its loan book to S$416.2 billion. The growth in its customer loans more than offset the slight weakening of NIM for the quarter, resulting in a 4% year on year increase in net interest income. Fee income moderates from a high Gross fee income, however, took a dip from S$1.09 billion in 1Q2021 to S$1.02 in the current quarter. The decline was led by a fall in investment banking and wealth management fees as markets turned volatile in 1Q2022. Back in 1Q2021, market conditions remained buoyant, thereby attracting higher levels of activity for both areas. Despite these declines, DBS saw loan-related fees and card fees increasing year on year, while transaction service fees also ticked upwards slightly. Continued write-back of provisions DBS made specific provisions of S$167 million for the quarter, 17% lower than the S$200 million set aside a year ago. The lender continued to write back general provisions worth S$112 million due to credit upgrades, a sign that the economic recovery is gaining pace.   Story continues The bank\u2019s general allowance reserve stood at S$3.75 billion, slightly above the requirement set by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.DBS\u2019 non-performing loans (NPL) ratio stood at 1.3%, unchanged with the previous quarter but down from the 1.5% reported in 1Q2021.A S$0.36 quarterly dividend declaredIn line with the good performance, DBS has declared a quarterly dividend of S$0.36 per share, unchanged on quarter on quarter basis.Compared to a year ago, interim dividend doubled year on year from S$0.18 as Singapore\u2019s central bank had lifted restrictions on dividend payments for the local banks in July last year.Annualised dividend per share for DBS stands at S$1.44, and its shares offer a trailing 12-month dividend yield of 4.4%.Get Smart: A cautious outlookDBS CEO Piyush Gupta sounded a cautious tone as he warned that slower growth and supply chain disruptions remained key risks to watch for.There was also lingering uncertainty related to COVID-19 as the world watches for potential variants of concern.However, the bank had stress-tested vulnerable sectors and countries and this revealed no material worries for now.He also assured us that China\u2019s lockdown will have no material impact on the bank.On the bright side, DBS\u2019 loan book was expected to grow further in the second quarter, with the first half of 2022 projected to grow by around 3% to 4% year on year.Fee income, however, could be further negatively impacted by market conditions.However, the bank flagged \u201csignificant\u201d earnings upside from a potentially faster pace of interest rate increases.Each 0.01 percentage point increase in interest rates would translate to around S$18 million to S$20 million of additional net interest income for DBS.Fintech is looking ready to take over the market by a huge margin.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

On April 7, Temasek, via a subsidiary Venezio, paid $1.63 million for 344,100 AEM shares, which works out to an average of $4.74 each.  This brings Temasek\u2019s total stake to just over 37.2 million shares, or 12.03%, up from 11.91% earlier. Separately, AEM bought back 26,900 shares on April 11, paying $4.7 each. This brings the total number of shares bought back under the current mandate to around 1.77 million. Temasek became AEM\u2019s largest shareholder following a placement announced last August where it paid $3.8477 each for 26.8 million new shares for a 9.5% stake. It has since increased its stake gradually with open market buying like that on April 7. Prior to this, on March 9, Temasek paid around $5.65 million for around 1.42 million shares, or around $4 each. AEM shares closed at $4.73, down 1.25% for the day, and down 9.73% year to date.

Here is what you should know plus an updated list \u2013 from the TV Database \u2013 of TV models with HDMI 2.1 VRR, AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync Compatible.\r\n\r\nWhat is VRR?A display with VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) can adjust its refresh rate in real-time to match the source. That would typically be a game console or a PC, but it could also be a video player. VRR is supported on PCs, Xbox One S/X and Xbox Series S/X, and Sony PlayStation 5 (after this week's update).\r\n\r\nThis is in contrast to a fixed refresh rate, which is the norm in TVs that have historically refreshed at 60 or 120Hz in North America (and other NTSC regions) and 50 or 100 Hz in Europe (and other PAL regions). Modern TVs can refresh at all of these fixed refresh rates \u2013 and sometimes other refresh rates \u2013 depending on the source signal.\r\n\r\nHowever, a game running on a game console or PC does not always have a fixed frame rate. Some games run at an 'unlocked' frame rate, which is what you need to enjoy the benefits of VRR. A specific game may render at 120fps in dialog scenes but drop to 50fps or lower in action sequences. Setting up the PC or game console to output in VRR over HDMI tells a compatible TV that it should also operate in VRR mode, i.e. adjust its refresh rate in real-time to match the source's output at any given time.\r\n\r\nVRR provides benefits such as elimination of 'tearing' (where the image briefly breaks into two segments), lower input lag (time between the received signal and the picture on the display), and smoother overall gameplay with reduced judder. VRR also makes it easier for game developers to move beyond 60fps in games, as even 70-80fps represents a noticeable improvement \u2013 without VRR game developers would have to jump to all the way to a fixed 100Hz or 120Hz output mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n Conventional v-sync (and fixed refresh rate) versus adaptive/variable sync. Illustration: Intel\r\nVRR mode in TVsUnfortunately, VRR is not without downsides today. On LED LCD TVs, zone dimming systems are either completely disabled or critically downgraded because zone dimming in general requires picture analysis which requires picture delay, and that only works with packaged media (movies, series etc.).\r\n\r\nIt effectively means that an advanced LCD TV in VRR mode is more or less reduced to a conventional non-zone dimming LCD TV with much lower contrast. Many LCD TVs are not fast enough \u2013 response time is too slow \u2013 to take full advantage of 60fps+ either.\r\n\r\nOLED TVs are better suited for VRR as they have far higher native contrast, much faster response time, and pixel-level luminance/color control, but VRR mode can still cause elevated blacks and flicker in low-frame rate game sequences due to how the picture circuit was originally optimized for 120Hz.\r\n\r\nAs a rule of thumb for the best VRR picture quality and experience, you want a given display to be reliant on as few 'patch work' solutions, i.e. zone dimming, as possible. That is because VRR mode reduces the display panel to a raw form. Our recommendation for VRR gaming is a self-emitting display technology, for example WOLED, QD-OLED or microLED.\r\n\r\n Also read: HDMI ARC (Audio Return Channel) and eARC explained\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that not many AV receivers or soundbars support VRR passthrough so you should aim to connect your PC or console directly to the TV's HDMI 2.1 port, and then use the TV's HDMI eARC output to pass the audio to your receiver/soundbar.\r\n\r\n\r\n Activating VRR on Xbox can raise blacks on both LCD and OLED TVs (LG GX in the photo). In Gears 5 you can use this scene from the first chapter: Activate/deactivate VRR on Xbox to see the difference. Photo: FlatpanelsHD\r\nThree VRR formatsIn the TV market, there are three flavors of VRR:\r\nHDMI 2.1 VRR\r\nAMD FreeSync\r\nNvidia G-Sync Compatible\r\n\r\nAMD and Nvidia's systems have worked for years on the DisplayPort standard. The new development is that they now also work over HDMI 2.1 (FRL) in up to 4K 120Hz. Enhancement systems such as LFC (Low Frame-rate Compensation) are source-dependant.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to take the frequency range into consideration. If a given TV model has a frequency range of 48-120Hz, it means that the panel can refresh only at 48Hz or higher (up to 120Hz). If a game drops to a frame rate of 46fps, for example, you will no longer get the full benefits of VRR. Confirmed frequency ranges for TV models can found in the table below.\r\n\r\n\r\nList: TVs with VRRNot all HDMI 2.1-equipped TVs support VRR. This list of compatible TV models pulls data from FlatpanelsHD's TV Database. It will update automatically as new TVs launch so you can bookmark it for future reference.

Since launch day there has been NVIDIA's official driver support via their proprietary graphics driver stack while to date the open-source support has been M.I.A.\r Last year the Nouveau support for Ampere in Linux 5.11 was just for kernel mode-setting in being able to drive an attached display at the proper resolution but without any hardware acceleration. As with prior generations of NVIDIA GPUs going back to the GTX 900 \"Maxwell\" series, the open-source driver support has been contingent upon NVIDIA publishing signed firmware images for these GPUs. Without the cryptographically signed firmware binaries, Nouveau isn't able to initialize the hardware for 3D acceleration due to the tighter controls NVIDIA baked into the hardware.\r Even with the signed firmware images, there are still complications around re-clocking the GPU to get off the rather low boot clock frequencies. Those complications around power management in the context of signed firmware images have meant the GTX 900 series and newer hasn't been able to operate with the open-source driver at its optimal clock frequencies... Thus to date the best open-source driver support remains with the GTX 700 \"Kepler\" and GTX 750 \"Maxwell1\" graphics cards that don't have these firmware restrictions.\r The news today is NVIDIA publishing the signed firmware images for Ampere GPUs. The GA102 / GA103 / GA104 / GA106 / GA107 GPUs now have the signed firmware images have now been made public.\r In turn this allows Nouveau (and any other open-source driver effort) to proceed in enabling 3D accelerated support for current RTX 30 \"Ampere\" GPUs. However, unless there is some magical breakthrough, it will still face the re-clocking limitations / power management struggles seen since the GTX 900 series. Additionally, Nouveau doesn't yet have any working Vulkan driver so the Nouveau open-source driver support remains rather bleak and of limited use with today's hardware and workloads.\r As of writing I haven't seen any Nouveau Ampere patches for accelerated support published, but should be soon especially with Red Hat's Ben Skeggs having already tested this signed firmware for NVIDIA and he is the Nouveau DRM maintainer and the one generally left working on this Nouveau kernel driver support.\r After a year and a half of waiting for the Ampere signed firmware to be published, we are now a few months out from the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series launch when this process repeats yet again -- unless there is a real shift in open-source strategy ahead. Unless you are still relying on a GeForce GTX 600/700 series GPU, the best Linux driver support on the NVIDIA side remains with their proprietary driver if concerned about performance, Vulkan, compute, and other functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n108 Comments \n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\nRelated News\nNVIDIA RTX Remix 1.0 Released With DXVK DLSS4 & Neural Radiance CacheThe New Rust-Written NVIDIA \"NOVA\" Driver Submitted Ahead Of Linux 6.15NVIDIA Is Finding Great Success With Vulkan Machine Learning - Competitive With CUDANVIDIA Vulkan Beta Driver Updated For Blackwell & New ExtensionsNVIDIA 570.124.04 Linux Driver Brings Additional FixesNVIDIA Publishes RTX Neural Texture Compression \"RTXNTC\" Beta\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

The card, which will be part of the RDNA 2 refresh GPU lineup, has been listed by an Australian retailer with pricing similar to NVIDIA's RTX 3090 Ti cards.\nAMD Radeon RX 6950 XT Graphics Card Is As Expensive As NVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti In Early Listings WIth Pricing of Up To $2400 US\nThe AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT graphics cards are expected to be announced soon and we are now seeing retailers listing them down. Gigabyte seems to be working on its own custom model, the RX 6950 XTGaming OC which has been listed for $3241.54 AUD or just slightly above $2400 USD. This pricing is very close to custom models of the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics card and a $1200-$1000 AUD difference between the custom RX 6900 XT models listed by the same retailer. Now since this is a preliminary listing, we will definitely be seeing much lower pricing as the new card gets close to street launch but for now, expect similar prices.\nRelated Story AMD Targets NVIDIA\u2019s Grace & Intel Granite Rapids Xeon CPUs With New 5th Gen EPYC Performance Showcase, Up To 2.75x Power Efficiency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nGigabyte Radeon RX 6950 XT is just as expensive as custom RTX 3090 Ti graphics cards. (Image Credits: Videocardz)\nThat's not all, Videocardz (Via Momomo_US) was able to obtain the full list of Gigabyte's Radeon RX 6x50 XT custom graphics cards that will be launching on the 10th of May. The lineup was submitted to the EEC and the full list can be seen in the table below:\n\n\n\nGigabyte RX 6x50XT Graphics Cards\n\n\nSegment\nRX 6950XT\nRX 6750XT\nRX 6650XT\n\n\nAORUS\nGV-R695XTAORUSX WB-16GD\nGV-R675XTAORUS E-12GD\nN/A\n\n\nGAMING\nGV-R695XTGAMING OC-16GD\nGV-R675XTGAMING OC-12GD\nGV-R665XTGAMING OC-8GD\n\n\nGV-R695XTGAMING-16GD\nGV-R675XTGAMING-12GD\nGV-R665XTGAMING-8GD\n\n\nEAGLE\nN/A\nN/A\nGV-R665XTEAGLE OC-8GD\n\n\nN/A\nN/A\nGV-R665XTEAGLE-8GD\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 6000 XT RDNA 2 Graphics Card Refresh\nThe AMD Navi 21, Navi 22, & Navi 33 GPUs are the ones that will be refreshed for the upcoming Radeon RX 6X50 XT lineup. The AMD Navi 21 GPU currently powers the Radeon RX 6900 XT, RX 6800 XT & RX 6800 while the Navi 22 GPU powers the RX 6700 XT and the Navi 23 GPU powers the RX 6600 XT & 6600 on the desktop platform. The graphics cards will be featuring 18 Gbps memory along with certain clock enhancements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nFrom the previous rumor, we came to know that these cards would also feature 18 Gbps GDDR6 memory dies. Currently, all cards except the upcoming RX 6500 XT & the flagship RX 6900 XT LC, feature 16 Gbps memory dies. The bump to 18 Gbps might offer higher bandwidth and increase performance by 2-5% but that doesn't indicate a huge difference with the refreshed series. There are obviously going to be some process enhancements incorporated in the new RDNA 2 refresh GPUs since we've heard rumors of the RX 6950 XT clocking over 2.5 GHz.\n\nIt would've been worthwhile if AMD gave its existing desktop GPUs the 6nm treatment & managed to get more performance efficiency out of them but that clearly isn't happening. It looks like this soft refresh will feature both reference 'midnight black' and custom model designs.\nThere would also be a small price difference and the TGP numbers are expected to go up slightly with the addition of the faster memory chips. These GPUs will likely compete with Intel's high-end ARC Alchemist GPUs that are launching in a few months while the Radeon RX 6950 XT flagship is clearly aimed at NVIDIA's RTX 3090 Ti graphics card which is one power-hungry insanity.\nThe following table shows all the RDNA 2 graphics cards that AMD is currently offering:\nAMD Radeon RX 6000 'RDNA 2' Desktop Graphics Card Lineup:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameGPU CodenameProcess NodeCompute Units / CoresMemory Capacity / BusMemory ClockTGPPrice (MSRP)Launch\n\n\n\n\nRadeon RX 6950 XTNavi 21 KXTX7nm80 / 512016 GB / 256-bit18 Gbps335W$1199 USMay 2022\n\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XT LCNavi 21 XTXH7nm80 / 512016 GB / 256-bit18 Gbps330W$1199 USJuly 2021\n\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XTXNavi 21 XTXH7nm80 / 512016 GB / 256-bit16 Gbps300W$999 USOctober 2020\n\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XTNavi 21 XTX7nm80 / 512016 GB / 256-bit16 Gbps300W$999 USOctober 2020\n\n\nRadeon RX 6800 XTNavi 21 XT7nm72 / 460816 GB / 256-bit16 Gbps300W$649 USOctober 2020\n\n\nRadeon RX 6800Navi 21 XL7nm60 / 384016 GB / 256-bit16 Gbps250W$579 USOctober 2020\n\n\nRadeon RX 6750 XTNavi 22 KXT7nm40 / 256012 GB / 192-bit18 Gbps250W$549 USMay 2022\n\n\nRadeon RX 6700 XTNavi 22 XT7nm40 / 256012 GB / 192-bit16 Gbps230W$479 USMarch 2021\n\n\nRadeon RX 6750 GRENavi 22 XT7nm40 / 256012 GB / 192-bit16 Gbps230W$289 USOctober 2023\n\n\nRadeon RX 6750 GRENavi 22 XL7nm36 / 230410 GB / 160-bit16 Gbps170W$269 US2023\n\n\nRadeon RX 6650 XTNavi 23 KXT7nm32 / 20488 GB / 128-bit18 Gbps176W$349 USMay  2022\n\n\nRadeon RX 6600 XTNavi 23 XT7nm32 / 20488 GB / 128-bit16 Gbps160W$379 USJuly 2021\n\n\nRadeon RX 6600Navi 23 XL7nm28 / 17928 GB / 128-bit14 Gbps132W$329 USOctober 2021\n\n\nRadeon RX 6500 XTNavi 24 XT6nm16 / 10244 GB / 64-bit16 Gbps107W$199 USJanuary 2022\n\n\nRadeon RX 6400Navi 24 XL6nm12 / 7684 GB / 64-bit16 Gbps53W$159 USJanuary 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you looking forward to the RDNA 2 Refreshed graphics cards from AMD?\n\n\n Yes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n No\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJP Morgan Believes AMD\u2019s AI GPU Business Would Grow By 60 Percent This Year, Highlights Oracle\u2019s Initial Order Of 30,000 MI355X GPUs\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n153\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n87\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n75\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales;

Underpinning this announcement is that the current infrastructure trend is to try matching GPU needs to servers in fixed configurations. With the Fungible DPUs, the goal is to flip this and deliver GPUs to servers in a manner similar to how NVMe storage is delivered with NVMeoF.\nFungible Adds NVIDIA GPU Orchestration to its DPUs\nAs part of the announcement, Fungible has its composer software to handle orchestation. The Fungible FC200 cards are used as high-speed DPUs. Judging by the pictures, the Fungible GPU server is a Supermicro JBOG chassis with Fungible DPUs that is used to get NVIDIA GPUs onto the fabric.\nFungible GPU Disaggregation Solution Components\nFungible is using its high-end FC200 DPUs for the host as well as for the uplink in the GPU server. The fabric connectivity is powered by 100GbE. That makes it easier to integrate for many organizations than using other fabrics like Infiniband.\nFungible GPU Connect Components\nOnce the GPUs are onboarded, onto the physical network, they can then be added to Fungible\u2019s cloud, also known as the FunCloud.\nFungible GPUs Screenshot\nHere we can see the GPUs in the Supermicro SYS-420GP-TNR chassis. We can also see which slots the GPUs are in and which servers they are attached to.\nFungible JBOG Screenshot\nOne can attach GPUs to servers. Here is a big point, the ratio can be more than 8:1. You will notice this screen says \u201cselect up to 55 GPUs to attach to server server-1\u201d. That is a key concept. One can attach greater numbers of GPUs than a server has PCIe slots.\nFungible Attach Up To 55 GPUs To A Server\nFungible also has a dashboard to see how all of these services tie together.\nFungible Fun Cloud With GPUs\nThe company has a number of benchmarks, all essentially showing little performance impact to putting the GPUs over the network via Fungible DPUs and the PCI vSwitch versus direct attach PCIe. Of course, at some point, the DPU solution is higher latency and also has less bandwidth than PCIe. If one attached 10 GPUs to a single DPU there would be less physical bandwidth to go around.\nFungible GPU Connect BERT 2x NVIDIA A10 Performance\nThis looks like a cool technology concept.\nFinal Words\nThis type of approach is not necessarily designed for maximum performance training. However, for many inferencing workloads, this makes sense. It provides a way to deliver composable GPUs over Ethernet using the Fungible DPU. Composability drives higher efficiency and utilization of resources.\nLooking through the screenshots, it would have been nice to see more types of accelerators and storage shown. If Fungible has a \u201cPCI vSwitch\u201d that is delivered via its DPUs, it would be nice to see the PCIe scale of this with FPGAs or other devices. We would also like to see the NVMeoF capabilities shown alongside the GPUs. A big reason to deploy DPUs is composability and that is not just for GPUs but also for storage (Fungible\u2019s first product) and other devices. We hope that comes soon.\nNote from the Editor\nPatrick the editor\u2019s note: Just a quick word on timing on this one since Cliff wrote it before we were briefed on AMD-Pensando. I had a discussion with Fungible last week, several days before the AMD Acquires Pensando for its DPU Future briefing and announcement happened. My feedback to the Fungible team was straightforward with this announcement. Announcing that Fungible has a DPU to pair with NVIDIA\u2019s DPUs is a tough road given NVIDIA has its own DPU (albeit, in many ways the current Fungible DPU has better features than its BlueField-2 contemporary.) Also, Intel has its own IPU-DPU solutions. My feedback was that Fungible needed to push cross-vendor in its orchestration. Fungible can use any PCIe device and turn it composable, and span larger physical data center footprints than current PCIe-based offerings. I just feel like for Fungible to be relevant, they need to push beyond just the NVIDIA market and get orchestration for other devices. Pensando was focused more on being a Nitro alternative and AMD\u2019s leadership likes to create platforms that are cross-vendor.\nSince the Pensando acquisition happened between this briefing and announcement, Fungible now is the big independent DPU player.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSDPUFungibleGPUNVIDIASupermicro \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleMicrosoft Azure Adds Ampere Altra Arm CPUsNext articleMLPerf Inference V2.0 Results Discussion Cliff RobinsonThey call me \"the STH news guy\" for a reason.  \n \nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n \n\nInside a 100G SR4 QSFP28 Module A Quick Teardown \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nBolt Graphics Zeus The New GPU Architecture with up to 2.25TB of Memory and 800GbE \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nIntel E830 for 25GbE to 200GbE and E610 for 10GbE and 2.5GbE NICs Launched \n\n  \n\n\nLEAVE A REPLY\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\n\n\nPlease enter your name here\n\n\n\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\n\n\n\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign me up for the STH newsletter! \n\n\u0394 \nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

The latest is that Nvidia's upcoming RTX 40 series of graphics cards will be built with TSMC's 4nm process node, giving the series a slight advantage over the 5nm process that AMD is expected to use for its next-gen RDNA3 GPUs.Moore's Law Is Dead (via wccftech) believes that Ada Lovelace will be built using TSMC's 4nm node. Talking about nodes can be confusing. It was thought that Nvidia would use a node referred to as 4N, which is a customized 5nm class process, however MLID specifically states '4nm'. He knows what he's talking about.Nvidia's workstation 'Hopper' architecture is a 4nm product, but that's a very high margin product, and Nvidia can easily recoup costs from sales to secure bleeding edge wafer starts.\u00a0We know Nvidia is paying a lot of money for access to TSMC's production, but is the asking price for 4nm too high for a lower margin GeForce card?\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNew details of TSMC's next-gen N2 chip tech aren't totally stellar but could provide a roadmap for new GPUs right through to 2031\n\n\n\n\nTSMC's next-gen 2nm silicon is reportedly on track for later this year but don't expect chips for PCs until 2027 and beyond\n\n\n\nConfused? So are we. Whether Ada Lovelace ends up being a 5nm or 4nm or 4N or whatever, the vast majority of consumers won't pay any attention. As long as their chosen card performs as they expect, the node in use won't matter.Notice I didn't mention PCIe 5.0 in my Lovelace Slides: https://t.co/n7sdIL1UkuSpeaking of \"4\", #NVIDIA Lovelace is indeed 4nm!\ud83e\udd20\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude0b More to say on the next Broken Silicon... https://t.co/jjJ1GSod0jApril 24, 2022Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest gaming motherboard: The right boards\nBest graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the restWhether this means Nvidia really will have a single nanometre advantage over AMD's competing products remains to be seen, but in the end, it might not make all that much difference. Rumours point towards Ada Lovelace being very power hungry, meaning Nvidia isn't using the slight power headroom advantage it might have enjoyed as it seeks maximum performance.There's also the possibility that AMD's chiplets design could utilize different nodes, making node comparisons a largely meaningless endeavor. Its cards are also expected to take a step up in power consumption.All will become clear in time. RTX-40 series cards are expected to launch sometime in the second half of 2022.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\nChris SzewczykSocial Links NavigationHardware WriterChris' gaming experiences go back to the mid-nineties when he conned his parents into buying an 'educational PC' that was conveniently overpowered to play Doom and Tie Fighter.

Source: SC Media, March 30, 2022.Microsoft Azure: Lapsus$ claims to have leaked the source code for Bing, Cortana, and other projects stolen from Microsoft's internal Azure DevOps server. Microsoft later confirmed a hack by Lapsus$. Sources: BleepingComputer and Microsoft, March 22, 2022.Nvidia: A cyberattack targeting\u00a0Nvidia allegedly involved the Lapsus$ ransomware gang. Attackers have since leaked some Nvidia company information online, but the cyberattack did not impact the company\u2019s operations and there\u2019s no evidence that ransomware was deployed on Nvidia\u2019s network, the chip maker has stated. Source: MSSP Alert, March 1, 2022.Okta: The identity and access management (IAM) software company is investigating an alleged data breach that may have been launched by Lapsus$. In a tweet, Okta CEO Todd McKinnon said their was no evidence of malicious activity beyond some activity detected in January 2022. Still, some observes expressed concern that Okta partners and customers could potentially suffer from a supply chain attack. Source: MSSP Alert, March 22, 2022.Samsung: The mobile device giant\u00a0confirmed a rumored data breach in which hackers stole some\u00a0Galaxy device source code. Still, Samsung stopped short of blaming the alleged culprit -- Lapsus$ -- for the breach. Source: MSSP Alert, March 7, 2022.T-Mobile: Lapsus$ breached T-Mobile multiple times in March 2022, stealing source code for a range of company projects. T-Mobile says no customer or government information was stolen in the intrusion. Source: KrebsOnSecurity, April 22, 2022.Lapsus$ surfaced in December 2021 and the group may be led by one or more teenagers, Bloomberg reports. The group's tactics differs from other threat groups\u2019 in that Lapsus$ \"eschews the typical exfiltrate-encrypt-extort playbook, instead concentrating on the data theft and extortion, and the gang has a flair for the dramatic in its demands,\" The CyberWire reports. How to Protect Against Lapsus$ Ransomware AttacksThe FBI\u2019s general guidance vs. ransomware attacks includes these 10 recommendations:Back-up critical data offline.Ensure copies of critical data are in the cloud or on an external hard drive or storage device.

Check back here, or directly with our partners, for great new options.\nGeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs deliver the ultimate performance for gamers and creators. They\u2019re powered by Ampere\u2014NVIDIA\u2019s 2nd gen RTX architecture\u2014with new RT Cores, Tensor Cores, and streaming multiprocessors for the most realistic ray-traced graphics and cutting-edge AI features.\nReaders will remember in August of 2021, we reported that the RTX 30 series of NVIDIA GeForce graphics cards were to be in limited supply until September due to pandemic regulations. The drop was significant, limiting the stock of cards to almost 50% less for manufacturers.\nBut 2022 has so far been positive. This month, ASUS lowered the prices on all RTX 30 series cards in an aggressive strategy to acquire sales and persuade customers to their brand above one of their competitors. Now, all other manufacturers will have the same chance to lower their prices, but nothing has shown in the market yet. In a recent notification from one of our tipsters, EVGA has listed their available RTX 30 series cards, and a large majority of the manufacturer's GPUs are still relatively expensive. In addition to that, prices of graphics cards currently fall around 20-25% over MSRP and continue to drop, hinting at normalization by mid of 2022 which would be prime time for the launch of the next-generation graphics cards.\nSource: NVIDIA\nWill other companies attempt to lower the price of graphics cards by NVIDIA while the series is still available? Or, will high costs still reign in the current GPU marketplace? No one can answer these questions yet, and we will need to see how the remainder of the next few months pan out.\n\nGrosse baisse de prix sur notre RTX 3080 Ti GAMING X TRIO 12G chez @TopAchat !! \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5@NVIDIAGeForceFR \nICI >> https://t.co/yGxg0Lc8kI pic.twitter.com/hMUKKlhyG1\n\u2014 MSI France (@msifrance) April 14, 2022\n\n\nEVGA GeForce RTX 30 Series - Restocked and Reloaded! https://t.co/JKjQlufiLG pic.twitter.com/N6xvZEyM1I\n\u2014 EVGA (@TEAMEVGA) April 14, 2022\n\n\nRestocked & Reloaded!

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphics card prices have continued to improve through April, reports 3D Center Germany in its Easter weekend roundup. Compared to three weeks ago, AMD GPU prices have declined 13% on average, while Nvidia GPUs have dipped by -6%. It is immediately evident that Nvidia's GPU price decline rate is slowing, as you can see in the graph below.(Image credit: 3D Center)The Nvidia graphics card pricing curve appears to be flattening in April. The source site says that it may be an indicator that \"the time of rapid price reductions is now over.\" However, these kinds of supply/demand pricing curves are not always smooth or so easily predictable.3D Center's previous figures showed both Nvidia and AMD GPUs were both ~25% over MSRPs at the end of March. This might have been enough to tempt some Nvidia fans who had sheltered from the storm over the preceding months. On the other side of the equation, the Nvidia GPU supply might have slowed for some reason or other in the last few weeks. Obviously, something is different in Nvidia-world and AMD-land, as after both being 25% over MSRP at the end of March, Nvidia GPUs are now 19% over MSRP, and AMD GPUs are now 12% over MSRP, on average.The source site is German and considers a host of online stores in the country to work out its average pricing and availability charts. The German market looks quite competitive as it charts nine eShops, and we know there will be graphics cards for sale elsewhere online, like at Amazon Germany or eBay Germany.One other note about the German results is that they don't include GeForce RTX 3090 Ti cards. These halo GPUs were launched and made available at list price almost immediately, without much in the way of supply problems. Moreover, the RTX 3080 12GB isn't included as it doesn't have an official MSRP.(Image credit: 3D Center)MSRP Isn't Low Enough, and Computex Is ComingGPU pricing would normally be 10 to 20% below MSRP at this point in the refresh cycle. We think that AMD will do a last quick refresh of its Radeon RX 6000 series before it builds up for the Radeon RX 7000 launch later in the year. Meanwhile, the recently launched GeForce RTX 3090 Ti looks like the conclusion of the Ampere family, with Ada Lovelace GPUs due in the autumn.With the next-gen graphics cards being pretty easy to wait for, this time in the GPU refresh cycle would normally only attract buyers with decent price cuts. However, if Nvidia's price decline doesn't change by the beginning of May, then its cards will end up 13% over MSRP by that time. Likewise, if AMD's price decline doesn't waver, the average price in early May will be at parity with MSRP.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Ethereum cryptocurrency valuations seem to have largely decoupled from GPU pricing, which is welcome to see. However, perhaps the best news PC component bargain hunters could see are some convincing leaks regarding the capabilities and pricing of the next-gen GPUs from all parties.Continuing to hold stocks of current-gen graphics cards gets ever riskier as people learn more about the appeal of Ada and RDNA3. Traditional trade show timelines suggest that we could learn quite a bit about the new graphics microarchitectures at Computex time (starts on Tuesday, May 24).US Graphics Card MarketThe above news looks at data from the German GPU market. We have our own monthly price watch, considering US pricing and availability once a month, the Tom's Hardware GPU Pricing Index. However, with the significant moves we observed last month, we also decided to add a mid-month update.Having a quick nose around the US graphics card market this Easter, it is notable that Newegg appeared to have stocks of every GPU we checked for.

There's a variety of cards in stock at MSRP or slightly below. These are the inflated, top-end MSRPs though. When the MSRP is $720 for an RTX 3070 that Nvidia sells for $500, we've still got a problem. AIB MSRPs were artificially pushed up and need to come down. Paying MSRP is a mistake (that's on top of buying outgoing generation cards right before the new ones come out).\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEximo\n\n\nbigdragon said:Same.

Paying MSRP is a mistake (that's on top of buying outgoing generation cards right before the new ones come out).\n\nWe aren't going to see the launch price again. Costs went up for memory, substrates/interposers, and probably every capacitor and resistor on those boards. Shipping costs also went up with fuel costs. And they likely still don't have a surplus of GPUs to play with, so it still makes sense to concentrate on the cards with the higher profit margins.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10tacle\n\n\n^^Pretty much this. We are fortunate to have GPUs back in stock at retail price. Yes, I paid $1,299 retail for my EVGA FTW3 Ultra edition 3080 Ti from NewEgg last August on the shuffle lottery purchase win, and I was lucky to get that for my new mostly MSFS build. To put things into perspective last year, I was on both NewEgg and Microcenter's shuffle program for five months last year just to win the option to pay retail for any three of these: the 3070, the 3080, and the 3080 Ti (with any brand preference). It took that long to win just a buying opportunity, and then some hours thinking it over having that GPU in my cart when I really just wanted the 3080 which in the same EVGA FTW3 trim was $400 less.\n\nAnd make no mistake the shortage was worse for Nvidia GPUs over AMD GPUs because the demand was not there for AMD cards. Case in point? The $1,399 Radeon RX 6900 XT 16GB was avialable all last year on NewEgg and other E-tailers except during a short blip mid-summer. I know that too because I helped a buddy build his MSFS rig around the same time for his son and advised him to get the Radeon as it was the only thing in stock at \"normal\" price. A similar thing is happening with Xbox X vs. Playstation 5 where you can get the XB all day but the PS5 is either not avaialble at retail price (and you have to get on Sony's waiting list) or you pay scalping prices on E-tailers and eBay.\n\nThings were so bad for so long that people needing a new build and wanting an Nvidia GPU were degraded to buying an inferior pre-built PC like from ABS on NewEgg just to get a high end or mid range GPU. I was about at that point. It is said people have short memories, and already I'm seeing comments out there from people still upset at high GPU prices even at retail price. Like Eximo said, that \"normal\" GPU price ship sailed long, and for a lot of reasons. The most expensive GPU I ever purchased was back in 2012 with the hot 2GB GTX 680 which retailed for $499 but after-market sold from like EVGA for $549 (mine was EVGA's Superclocked SC).\n\nThat's about $685 in today's US dollars. Now to put that GPU into performance perspective relative to today, a $650 8GB RTX 3060 that is available is about 5x as powerful. So when I see people saying the GPUs are just insanely more expensive these days, they are not taking into consideration the power increase for each generation over the previous one, even lower vs. higher tiers. Never mind the ever increased video game graphics demand and no increased monitor resolution and/or speed demands.\n\nEDIT: I just checked NewEgg and my GPU is out of stock again when it was available yesterday at $1299. So people are still snapping GPUs up at all tiers.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncryoburner\n\n\n3D Center's previous figures showed both Nvidia and AMD GPUs were both ~25% over MSRPs at the end of March.

Call me when one can get something like a 3060 Ti for close to $400, or a 3080 for close to $700, their actual MSRPs. The next generation of graphics cards should be launching later this year, so anything much over those prices could end up looking like a rather poor value within a matter of months. It's possible that the new cards might target higher price points from the start, though I expect they will at least offer somewhat more performance-per-dollar than the initial 30-series pricing, even if it's not by a lot.\n\nIt seems likely that Intel will aim for competitive prices, as they usually do when entering a new market, and even if they don't initially offer any products competing at the \"enthusiast level\", if they price their cards well below similar-performing cards from the competition, that should have an effect on the pricing of those other cards. And you can be sure that AMD and Nvidia are concerned about another major player entering the market, and will do what they can to prevent Intel from stealing too much market-share from them.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd0000h\n\n\n10tacle said:Now to put that GPU into performance perspective relative to today, a $650 8GB RTX 3060 that is available is about 5x as powerful.

CPUs today are 100-200x more powerful than yr2000, so what are you suggesting the price of CPUs should be today relative to then?

Then the retailers will say \"Well we're selling them at MSRP\" and we're supposed to be like 'Yeah MSRP awesome'.

The idea things cost more inline with how much better they are is a relatively new one and one I will be very happy when it stops happening.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbigdragon\n\n\nd0000h said:Yeah I'm a little worried the new cards are going to really stretch/increase the MSRPs based on what's happened over the last 2 years.

Else will have to wait a fair while before new cards price settle down over 9-12 months.Supply and demand works both ways. The current MSRPs for AIB cards assume that people are making $4 to $8 a day mining -- that's the thing that really pushed those MSRPs through the roof. Worse, artificial scarcity because of scalpers shoved resale prices sky high. Now, you're lucky to be making $2 a day on the same cards and supply is overwhelming the scalpers. Those MSRPs are going to get reacquainted with the console ecosystem if PC gamers continue to hold off on purchasing GPUs. A GPU that's delivering console-like graphics is not worth the ridiculous prices being demanded today.\n\nPrior to the RTX 30-series, GPUs used to sell for below MSRP with multiple games bundled in. It's time we stopped accepting the higher prices and waited for things to correct back down to sane levels. Why spend $900 on a 3070 when you can get a PS5 for $400? Makes zero sense. Prices have a lot further to drop. Increasing yields and removal of tariffs should be counteracting whatever nonsense companies want to groan about with the supply chains that are good enough to not fix for 2 years.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 17 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew undersea cable tech listens for sabotage \u2014 can be retrofitted to existing fiber optic lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm debuts new Snapdragon G handheld gaming PC chips to compete with Intel and AMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina to spend $55 billion on R&D in 2025 \u2014 Semiconductor, AI and quantum computing fields to benefit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBambu Lab Announces New Printer: H2D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotherboard dies after marathon 100-hour BIOS update process, vigil attended by thousands online\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD boasts its Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is up to 12.2x faster than Lunar Lake in AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreeware image editor GIMP 3.0 arrives after seven years of incubation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle's Gemini 2.0 Flash is reportedly capable of removing watermarks \u2014 Also found to generate AI celebrity photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi and ChatGPT bring AI conversations to your retro rotary phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI Afterburner update enables RTX 50 series owners to push their GDDR7 VRAM up to 36 GT/s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Although changes in climate occur naturally, during the last 200 years human activities have directly influenced the otherwise normal climate cycles in a very precise way: we are heating the world. Scientists can\u2019t warn policy-makers enough of the disaster we\u2019ll face in the coming decades if we don\u2019t act effectively and with extreme urgency.\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, alluded to this problem in his 2022 GTC Keynote. He mentioned that scientists believe we\u2019ll need a billion-X scale in computing power to \u201ceffectively simulate regional climate change.\u201d NVIDIA has developed three core technologies\u200a\u2014\u200aGPU-accelerated computations, physics-informed AI models, and AI supercomputers\u200a\u2014\u200awhich together can grant a million-X speed-up. Now, the company is embarked on a journey to tackle a crucial goal for climate science: Closing the gap towards that billion-X we need to take effective mitigation and adaptation strategies and save our planet from its impending future.\nNVIDIA million-X performance increase with GPU-accelerated AI models trained at the data center ... [+] scale.Nvidia\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s full-stack approach is the key: GPU-accelerated physics-informed AI models at the data center scale are our best chance at fulfilling the EU mandate to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. How do they plan to do it? With a digital twin of our planet.They\u2019re going to build the most powerful AI supercomputer designed for climate science: Earth-2. It\u2019ll be a physically-accurate, high-fidelity, and ultra high-resolution replica of Earth continuously running to predict climate and weather events at the regional and global scales.\n\nIn a Q&A with analysts, Jensen Huang said Earth-2 will be \u201cconstantly recalibrating against the earth \u2026 constantly refining its models \u2026 constantly making future predictions.\u201d And that\u2019s exactly what makes Earth\u2019s digital twin uniquely suited to take the challenge. Unlike traditional simulations, a digital twin is constantly synchronized with its real-world counterpart through detailed measurements. It\u2019s also extremely fast. As David Matthew Hall, a senior data scientist at NVIDIA puts it, Earth-2 can provide \u201cactionable feedback in actionable time.\u201d\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\n\u201cEconomists, biologists, scientists, companies in countries all over the world will be able to \u2026 simulate whether the dams that they\u2019re building in Venice are going to make a difference. Simulate \u2026 what\u2019s going to happen to the Mekong River in Southeast Asia. Simulate \u2026 what\u2019s going to change to the climate conditions in California,\u201d said Huang. \u201cEarth-2 will literally be Earth two.\u201d\nEarth-2 will be a digital twin of planet Earth with the goal to predict climate at ultra-high ... [+] resolutionNVIDIA\n\n\nThere are two essential technological pillars to build Earth-2: Modulus and Omniverse, NVIDIA\u2019s simulation engine. The virtual worlds people build into the Omniverse obey the laws of physics, can operate at vast scales, and are shareable\u200a\u2014\u200aallowing for simultaneous collaboration for scientists around the world. Omniverse allows for visualization and interactive exploration, but scientists also need an AI model to simulate and predict Earth\u2019s climate and weather.\nThat\u2019s what Modulus is for. It\u2019s a framework for developing physics-ML neural network models trained with terabytes of data. One such model can then become the surrogate for the digital twins. Modulus uses the Fourier neural operator framework to provide AI models with the ability to understand physics, establishing the basis to predict climate variations and atmospheric events fast and accurately.\nThe simulation and visualization power of the Omniverse in partnership with the accuracy of physics-informed AI models that Modulus develops, together with GPU-accelerated computation at the data center scale, makes NVIDIA exceptionally well posited to solve the problem of predicting normal and extreme weather and climatic events at an ultra-high resolution\u200a\u2014\u200aboth at regional and global scales.Omniverse serves as the nexus platform to combine AI libraries with Modulus to create Earth-2 ... [+] digital twinNVIDIA\n As a first step towards Earth-2, NVIDIA has revealed a weather forecasting digital twin: FourCastNet. It\u2019s a GPU-accelerated physics-ML model trained on 10TB of Earth ground-truth data to predict problematic atmospheric events such as hurricanes and atmospheric rivers. It\u2019s the first deep learning model that surpasses state-of-the-art numerical models (in particular, the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System) in precision and speed\u200a\u2014\u200aup to 5 orders of magnitude faster. In Huang\u2019s words, \u201cwhat takes a classical numerical simulation a year now takes minutes.\u201dFourCastNet is a weather digital twin that feeds on ground-truth data to predict problematic ... [+] atmospheric eventsNVIDIA\nLooking Ahead\nThis is just the beginning for Earth-2. NVIDIA is committed to helping the scientific community\u200a\u2014\u200aand, by extension, the whole of humanity\u200a\u2014\u200asolve one of the greatest, and most potentially existential challenges of our times. And just for you to put into perspective why so much effort is needed to solve climate change\u200a\u2014\u200aand why we shouldn\u2019t treat it as any other problem \u2014, I\u2019ll finish by repeating the words Jensen Huang wrote in 2021 about Earth-2: \u201cAll the technologies we\u2019ve invented up to this moment are needed to make Earth-2 possible. I can\u2019t imagine a greater or more important use.\u201d\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Disclosures: This article expresses the opinions of the author, and is not to be taken as advice to purchase from nor invest in the companies mentioned.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nA Japanese retailer has started taking pre-orders on Nvidia's next-generation\u00a0Hopper H100\u00a080GB compute accelerator for artificial intelligence and high-performance computing applications. The card will be available in the next several months and it looks like it will be considerably more expensive than Nvidia's current generation Ampere A100 80GB compute GPU.\u00a0GDep Advance, a retailer specializing in HPC and workstation systems, recently began taking pre-orders for Nvidia's H100 80GB AI and HPC PCI 5.0 compute card with passive cooling for servers. The board costs\u00a0\uffe54,745,950 ($36,405), which includes a\u00a0\uffe54,313,000 base price ($32,955), a\u00a0\uffe5431,300 ($3308) consumption tax (sales tax), and a \u00a51,650 ($13) delivery charge, according to the company (via\u00a0Hermitage Akihabara). The board will ship in the latter half of the year, though we are unsure as to exactly when this will be.\u00a0Nvidia's H100 PCIe 5.0 compute accelerator carries the company's latest GH100 compute GPU with 7296/14592 FP64/FP32 cores (see exact specifications below) that promises to deliver performance of up to 24 FP64 TFLOPS, 48 FP32 TFLOPS, 800 FP16 TFLOPS, and 1.6 INT8 TOPS. The board carries 80GB of HBM2E memory with a 5120-bit interface offering a bandwidth of around 2TB/s and has NVLink connectors (up to 600 GB/s) that allow to build systems with up to eight H100 GPUs. The card is rated for a 350W thermal design power (TDP).(Image credit: Tom's Hardware/Nvidia)Being at least two times faster than its A100 predecessor based on the Ampere architecture, Nvidia's H100 featuring the Hopper architecture looks to be considerably more expensive too. Today, an Nvidia A100 80GB card can be purchased for $13,224, whereas an Nvidia A100 40GB can cost as much as $27,113 at\u00a0CDW. About a year ago, an\u00a0A100\u00a040GB\u00a0PCIe card\u00a0was priced at\u00a0$15,849 ~ $27,113 depending on an exact reseller. By contrast an H100 80GB board due in the second half of the year is set to cost around $33,000 (at least in Japan).\u00a0We do not know whether Nvidia plans to increase list price of its H100 PCIe cards compared to A100 boards because customers get at least two times higher performance at a lower power. Meanwhile, we do know that initially Nvidia will ship its DGX H100 and DGX SuperPod systems containing SXM5 versions of GH100 GPUs as well as SXM5 boards to HPC vendors like Atos, Boxx, Dell, HP, and Lenovo.\u00a0Later on, the company will begin shipping its H100 PCIe cards to HPC vendors and only then those H100 PCIe boards will be available to smaller AI/HPC system integrators as well as value-added resellers. All of these companies are naturally more interested in shipping complete systems with H100 inside rather than selling only cards. Therefore, it is possible that initially H100 PCIe cards will be overpriced due to high demand, limited availability, and appetites of retailers.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware/Nvidia)Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nWorkstation\nHardware\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (1)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

At least the rumors so far seem to indicate far more normal specs for the rest of the RTX 4000 series, so there's still hope that gamers won't need a small power plant to power Team Green's next-generation GPUs. \nWith the RTX 3090 Ti graphics card, Nvidia squeezed the last bit of performance it could from the Ampere architecture by raising the power limit to 450 watts. Independent testing has also revealed the card is surprisingly efficient when the power limit is set to a more sane 300 watts.\nThe next-generation Ada Lovelace architecture is still shrouded in mystery, but that hasn't stopped the rumor mill from turning hints about what to expect. According to notorious Twitter leaker @kopite7kimi, Nvidia could be preparing a monster GPU that will dwarf the RTX 3090 Ti in many aspects.\nSpecifically, the company is said to be testing a full-fat AD102 GPU with a TGP of no less than 900 watts, higher clock speeds, and 48 gigabytes of GDDR6X memory. The test board reportedly comes with two PCIe 5.0 16-pin power connectors as opposed to the RTX 3090 Ti which comes with a single connector.\n\nThis could be the first Nvidia Titan product in years or simply an indication that transient loads and power spikes on engineering samples are too high to handle with just one 16-pin power connector. Leaked layouts for reference RTX 4000 series boards only include one of these, and are otherwise very similar to Ampere reference designs. The worst-case scenario is one where the ridiculous April Fools concept from a year ago will materialize into an actual product.\nKopite7kimi says the rest of the RTX 4000 series line-up will have similar TGP ratings to their Ampere predecessors. But more importantly, the RTX 4080 could come with 16 gigabytes of GDDR6X memory while the RTX 4070 will sport 12 gigabytes of GDDR6. These are only preliminary specs and thus subject to changes down the line, but it would be a welcome improvement over the RTX 3000 series. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Asus raises RTX 5090 and RX 9070 prices, making graphics cards even more expensive \n\n\n\n To the extreme: Super Flower's 2,800W PSU with four 12V-2x6 connectors retails for $899 \n\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 4000 series lineup is expected to break cover this fall and could be the first Nvidia GPUs that are designed with the help of AI. In the meantime, PSU manufacturers are getting ready for this new generation of power-hungry graphics cards. The only model we've seen in stock so far is the Gigabyte GP-UD1000GM at Newegg, with a price tag of $189.99.\n\n\n\n\n 34 comments\n \n318 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Defender misidentifies key driver, disrupting popular PC monitoring tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

This driver isn't based on the existing Nouveau driver but rather appears to be derived from their internal driver code-base with some copyright references going back to 90's.\r\n\nYesterday NVIDIA published a new Jetson L4T release providing the latest sample root file-system based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and using the Linux 5.10 kernel. Along with that is their public sources used for generating the build.\r\n\nNew to this code drop is a \"nvidia_kernel_display_driver_source\" and \"NVIDIA-kernel-module-source-TempVersion\" that wasn't found in their prior L4T sources for the board support package. This is also a different codebase from their existing \"nvgpu\" driver sources for prior Tegra driver integration work.\r\n\nThis NVIDIA kernel graphics/display driver is licensed under the MIT license. Notable is it is not based on the Nouveau existing open-source DRM/KMS driver sources with the only \"Nouveau\" hit in the code being around in reference to an error message.\r\n\nWhen looking at the code copyrights, the NVIDIA code on some of the files have copyrights noted going back as far as 1993. There are some files with copyrights going back to the late 90's and early 20's as more common. It does appear that this open-source kernel driver is derived in part at least from their long-standing proprietary kernel driver.\r\n\nThis open-source NVIDIA kernel driver in its current form amounts to around 270k lines of code and another 93.1k lines of comments and 60.5k blank lines spanning some 1,125 source files.\r\n\nBefore getting too excited, at least for now this kernel driver appears to be limited to their Tegra graphics hardware support. Trying to load this module for desktop NVIDIA graphics currently results in errors. But when looking at the driver sources, there are references to many desktop GPUs and others outside of the Tegra context...\r\n\nFor now no formal announcement has been made or communication from NVIDIA around their plans for this new open-source kernel driver. Going back to 2019 were signs of NVIDIA working on a new open-source GPU kernel driver so this might finally be it coming to pass.It will be great though if they are indeed working towards having an open-source NVIDIA kernel driver that will work across their range of supported hardware, similar to even the Radeon Software for Linux packaged driver with its proprietary \"PRO\" OpenGL/Vulkan driver options still using the open-source AMDGPU DRM/KMS driver. This would likely be the case on the NVIDIA side too that even if having a fully open-source Linux kernel driver they would likely stick to proprietary user-space OpenGL/Vulkan/CUDA components but with the option of possibly working with the Nouveau Mesa driver too. The new NVIDIA Jetson Linux release can be downloaded from developer.nvidia.com. We'll see what happens... Thanks to \"Longhorn\" for mentioning the new L4T update/driver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n52 Comments \n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\nRelated News\nNVIDIA RTX Remix 1.0 Released With DXVK DLSS4 & Neural Radiance CacheThe New Rust-Written NVIDIA \"NOVA\" Driver Submitted Ahead Of Linux 6.15NVIDIA Is Finding Great Success With Vulkan Machine Learning - Competitive With CUDANVIDIA Vulkan Beta Driver Updated For Blackwell & New ExtensionsNVIDIA 570.124.04 Linux Driver Brings Additional FixesNVIDIA Publishes RTX Neural Texture Compression \"RTXNTC\" Beta\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

(With a few obvious exceptions.) But Nvidia really wants to drive the point home: not only will new drivers improve overall graphics performance, they can dramatically improve the way that individual and specific games perform. These Game Ready Drivers are usually released at the launch of a new title. \nNvidia\u2019s latest video explains exactly how these customized drivers are prepared. It\u2019s obviously designed to show Nvidia in a good light, but in the process, it provides some insightful illumination into the process behind creating graphics drivers\u2014some of the most complex blobs of software installed on many PCs.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn short, Game Ready Drivers grant the game engine boosted performance by allowing portions of it to access the operating system\u2019s kernel, giving it more direct access to the GPU. This can boost framerate, reduce latency, offer more consistent minimum performance, and enhance stability. Nvidia tests over 4500 hardware configurations, ranging from the latest top-of-the-line components to hardware as old as 2012, with thousands of tests and millions of testing-hours per year. \nNvidia works with developers and publishers before the release of a game to make sure that the Game Ready Driver is ready for launch. Since 2014, the company has released over 150 Game Ready Driver packages with specific support for over 400 games, and the company makes a point of noting that every single one of those come with Microsoft\u2019s Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) certification\u2014something rival AMD can\u2019t claim. If there\u2019s a triple-A PC game on the horizon, there\u2019s a safe bet that Nvidia is prepping a Game Ready Driver for it. \n\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed learning about how graphics drivers work, be sure to check out Intel\u2019s 2020 video explaining how CPUs are made. Like Nvidia\u2019s primer above, it provides a great high-level overview of an ultra-complex technical process, using words you can actually understand.\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Michael Crider, Staff Writer, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael is a 10-year veteran of technology journalism, covering everything from Apple to ZTE.

While some of Genshin Impact's resources are notoriously difficult to attain at higher levels, there are a lot of little web events to help provide them here and there. Things like the daily check in page can really help to put a few more Mora and Primos in your pocket when you need them.Right now, Nvidia and Genshin Impact have joined forces to offer rewards to those using the Nvidia's GeForce Experience app. Any PC gamers with a somewhat recent Nvidia branded card probably are, or can at least download it and get started for free. Not that I'd necessarily recommend doing it for what's on offer.The amazing bounty in this complimentary GeForce bundle includes 20,000 Mora, four Mystic Enchantment Ores, and two Hero's Wit. If you don't play Genshin Impact it's impossible to know what this all means, but it truly is a pittance, and there are dozens of ways to earn these particular resources in-game with relatively little effort.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nThree lucky folks in India can win the dubious honour of buying an RTX 5080 GPU at Nvidia MSRP\n\n\n\n\nAfter a run of RTX 50-series launches with seemingly little availability and mega price tags, I'm left wondering 'is that it?'\n\n\n\nStill, free is free, so I loaded up the GeForce Experience on my PC to try to redeem the rewards. According to the information page on the Nvidia website, you not only need an Nvidia account and GeForce, but also have to opt into their rewards. I couldn't find an option that only lets you opt in for rewards, and instead had to tick one that would also send me notifications about game recommendations, which is less than ideal.NEW GEFORCE REWARD AVAILABLE NOW!\ud83d\udfe2 Sign into GeForce Experience\ud83d\udfe2 Access complimentary @GenshinImpact GeForce BundleAvailable on a first come first served basis so make sure your NVIDIA account is primed to receive RewardsLean more\ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/K0fo1yT0iV pic.twitter.com/Yzalw14J8oApril 26, 2022Your next machine(Image credit: Future)Best gaming PC: The top pre-built machines from the pros\nBest gaming laptop: Perfect notebooks for mobile gamingSwapping back to my Nvidia GeForce app and I don't have any rewards yet. Nvidia's site explains there should be a notification I can click on in app but that hasn't popped up, and I've rechecked my settings a few times now. In between logins, very slow loading pages on Nvidia's side, and a few other issues it's taken me about half an hour to attempt to redeem these rewards that I still haven't gotten. I could probably earn them in about three minutes in-game.\u00a0It's wild that a partnership between two huge companies essentially seems to be acting as a promotion of Nvidia's software and mailing lists while offering so little. Especially given how tricky it seems to even activate. Nvidia even states the number of bundles on offer is finite and may run out. Unless you're really dying for that Mora, this one doesn't even seem worth trying for.Hopefully something a little better will be available by the time the next banner runs around. For those who are pulling for the current new Cryo DPS Ayaka, as always I wish you luck, but I don't think this particular set of rewards will help much.

It joins the site's existing Pitzer and Owens compute clusters, and will triple the facility's capacity for AI, modeling and simulation, according to the Center.\nOSC has experienced growing demand for GPU resources over the past several years, according to the site's associate director Doug Johnson, and so Ascend will be its first computing cluster devoted entirely to providing intensive GPU-based processing capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"By establishing a cluster focused on analysis of very large datasets quickly, support for classes of AI/ML applications that can't run on our current systems, and simulations that require the fastest GPUs, OSC will better meet the needs of these clients while ensuring the prompt processing of requests for our existing clusters, Owens and Pitzer,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware for the new cluster comprises 24 Dell PowerEdge XE8545 server nodes, 4U rackmount systems with dual AMD Eypc 3rd-Gen processors. Each node will be configured with four Nvidia A100 80GB GPUs, and interconnected with Nvidia Quantum HDR 200Gbps networking.\nThe site is currently involved in two US National Science Foundation-funded projects designed to advance AI work. The first is the AI Institute for Intelligent Cyberinfrastructure with Computational Learning in the Environment (ICICLE), which is led by Ohio State University and aims to develop next generation cyberinfrastructure with a focus on making AI more accessible.\n\nAstroboffins rethink black hole theory after spotting tiny example with its own star buddy\nCan you compose memory across a HPC cluster?

The OSC said it will reveal a more detailed timeline for the Ascend launch and availability this summer. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                HPC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Supercomputer\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                HPC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Supercomputer\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Exascale\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Hadoop\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                Computer\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                POST A COMMENT\n        \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                HPC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Supercomputer\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                HPC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Supercomputer\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Exascale\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Hadoop\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                Computer\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDo you DARE?

That device is still among the most powerful media streamers you can get, even with its 32-bit limitations. The Shield TV Pro was refreshed at the same time, but it gets less attention because of the higher $200 price tag. That's a lot to pay for a streaming box in the era of $30 Fire TV Sticks and $50 Chromecasts, but this is a special device. It's not perfect by any means, but if you care about audio/video quality, the Shield Pro has no equal. \n\n\nNvidia Shield TV Pro\n\n9.00 / 10\nRead Reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    Read More Reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee on Amazon\n\n\nThe Nvidia Shield TV Pro is much more expensive than your average streaming media box, but it's also much more powerful.

The panels are a mix of glossy and textured. It's not quirky enough that it wouldn't seem out of place in your living room, but it does look distinctive up close. There is the pronounced glowing green line on the top, but you can dim it in the settings. The box (or wedge) can lay flat, or you can prop it up on its end with the Shield stand, which annoyingly is not included with the device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Around back, the Shield Pro has more connection options than other media streamers. There's a gigabit Ethernet port, an HDMI 2.0b, two USB-A 3.0 ports, and a power outlet that looks like a USB-C but isn't. The Shield Pro shows its age a bit with the lack of USB-C for either power or data, but I'm not going to scoff at two high-speed USB ports, even if they're USB-A. There's also a small cooling vent on the rear, which is necessary because the Shield is tuned to take advantage of its constant supply of power\u2014there's no chipset throttling here.\nNvidia has struggled to make a good remote for its streaming boxes, and it just can't quite get there. There's always something wrong, but I do like the 2019 remote more than the previous versions. It uses regular AA batteries, which is preferable for a remote control in my experience. I also like that the buttons are backlit and illuminate automatically when you pick up the remote. However, it's so sensitive that just setting something down on a table next to the remote will cause it to light up. I can't imagine that being good for battery life. I'm not a fan of the button layout, which has no rhyme or reason. The Netflix button is also too large and easy to trigger accidentally. I was initially feeling positive about the Toblerone-like shape, but it seems even better than the average remote at burrowing into my couch cushions. Like past Shield remotes, it has a microphone for voice commands. It can be a bit slow to wake up, though.\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, you don't get the Shield stand in the box, which you really should. This is also a BYOHDMI affair, which is not uncommon with media streamers. But... this is a $200 media streamer that supports a lot of advanced AV formats. Including a good HDMI cable would have been the right call. Alas, all you get is the Shield, the remote, and the proprietary power cable. \n                        Software and performance\n               \nThe Shield runs Android TV, which looks a lot more like Google TV these days, but that is actually just Android TV with a different skin. Yes, it's confusing, and it's not Nvidia's fault. You can blame Google, but Nvidia is doing the best it can under the circumstances, rolling out major OS updates to its Shield boxes for years after release. The 2019 Pro recently got an update to Android 11, but the change to the new home screen isn't a positive one. After saying it wouldn't show ads on the Android/Google TV home screen, Google started showing what I would consider \"ads\" almost immediately, and only some of them are labeled as such. The home screen is the worst part of the software experience, but luckily, you won't have to stare at it too much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Shield Pro has access to every streaming platform you could want by way of the Play Store, and I prefer the way Android TV manages apps (Google TV makes the Play Store strangely hard to access). Because the Shield supports every media format under the sun, it'll be able to play the best version of content on all these services, even 4K video with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. If you're a fan of cloud gaming, the Shield is optimized for GeForce Now. I've also used Stadia on it with acceptable results. The box does come with too many pre-installed streaming apps, and uninstalling apps is more tedious on a TV than on a phone or tablet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Support for high-end audio-video formats is a major strength for the Shield TV. Most online media streams with Dolby Digital sound, which plenty of devices can understand. The Shield is prepared for anything you throw at it, even uncompressed True HD Atmos, DTS Master Audio, and Dolby Digital Plus. I host Blu-ray rips on my Plex server, and the Shield is the only device I've found that reliably plays everything without transcoding. Heck, you can even run a Plex server on the Shield Pro. The only AV format that seems to have issues is Dolby Vision, which was new on the 2019 Shields. Unlike HDR10, Dolby Vision prescribes brightness profiles for every shot instead of using one for the whole movie. The Shield seems to lag behind adjusting the HDR profile on Dolby Vision content, which can make the brightness changes quite distracting. It doesn't happen on all DV content, so I'm not certain what the cause is.\nThe current Shield Pro runs the Tegra X1+ SoC, the original version of which was a real hot chip back in 2015. The move from 20nm to 16nm is the only significant improvement for the Tegra X1 line since its 2015 debut in the original Shield (current Qualcomm and Apple parts are 4-5nm). The Tegra X1+ in the Shield has eight CPU cores, but they're the relatively ancient Cortex A57 and A53. As far as a piece of AV equipment goes, this is a monstrously powerful chip with its Maxwell-based GPU and capable but aging CPUs. While the company has made a few newer Tegra models, they've all been development kits or automotive modules, so I'm not sure where Nvidia can go from here. Its age does show a bit at times\u2014apps might hiccup while loading, and multitasking is sluggish. On the other hand, you actually can multitask with the Shield. That's something most TV interfaces simply don't have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Nvidia's hardware does shine when it comes to AI upscaling. Nothing beats watching a high-bitrate 4K video, but Nvidia's AI upscaling gets surprisingly close. You always have to upscale sub-4K content to play on a 4K screen, but the Shield doesn't just blow up what's already there. It uses AI to fill in the gaps, sharpening detail to the point you almost can't tell the difference between a good 1080p source upscaled to 4K and a native 4K source. \n                        Should you buy it?\n               \nThe Nvidia Shield Pro isn't for most people. That's due in large part to the price tag, which isn't a good value unless you really need all this power. Even the cheaper Shield Tube is pushing it at $130. If you're using your TV's speakers or a cheap soundbar, and you stream all your media from YouTube or a free service like Tubi, the Shield Pro will be of limited usefulness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft: Google Chromecast, Right: Nvidia Shield TV Pro\n\n For people who really value audiovisual fidelity, the Shield stands alone in the market. It's a powerful piece of technology, even if Android TV is still a bit of a mess. It handles any media format I throw at it, and I can't fault Nvidia for the way it has consistently kept these devices updated. However, the current Tegra chip architecture is years old, and it may not be viable much longer. \n            Buy it if...\n    \n\n\n                                        You need a media streamer that supports every audiovisual format\n                        \n\n                                        You're a GeForce Now subscriber, and you want to game on your TV\n                        \n\n\n            Don't buy it if...\n    \n\n\n                                        You mostly watch free or low-quality streaming services\n                        \n\n                                        You couldn't care less about high-end audio and HDR formats\n                        \n\nFAQ\nQ: How does the Nvidia Shield TV compare to the Nvidia Shield TV Pro?\nNvidia's own base-model Shield TV ($130) supports almost all the same features, but it doesn't have a Plex server, and the 32-bit app limitation makes some high-bitrate content (like Blu-ray rips) unwatchable.\nQ: How does the Chromecast with Google TV compare to the Nvidia Shield TV Pro?\nThe Chromecast with Google TV is only $50, but it's much less powerful. The OS doesn't have as many features, and you won't be able to play uncompressed audio. The remote is also not very sturdy.\nQ: How does the Amazon Fire TV Cube compare to the Nvidia Shield TV Pro?\nAmazon's highest-end Fire TV Cube ($120) will handle all the same video formats, but its audio support is inferior to the Shield. You're also stuck with Amazon's app ecosystem, which is more sparse than the Play Store. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\nshield tv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support Android Police.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce Experience isn't just convenient, it's also a super powerful piece of software that can help make your life a whole lot easier. Having evolved substantially over the years, in this guide, we break down exactly how to download it, record gameplay and update your drivers - and it couldn't be easier!The companion application to the best Nvidia GeForce graphics cards, GeForce Experience lets you optimize your game settings, keep your drivers up to date and lets you quickly and easily share all your gaming highlights with friends and family.\u00a0Because the GeForce Experience is usually installed when you first download drivers for your Nvidia GPU, it's likely that you probably already have it on your computer, which is great as that's one less job to worry about. Next up, you want to make sure you know how to utilize it.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Experience is dead \u2013 replaced by the Nvidia App \u2013 and good riddance\n\n\n\n\nHow to optimize your gaming PC for 60fps performance\n\n\n\nWhen paired with the best gaming PC, GeForce Experience can add a lot of value, giving you access to a frame rate counter in the top left corner of your screen, providing you with a place to download new drivers when they come out and allowing to record your gameplay - basically the GeForce Experience can do it all.To help you get the most out of the GeForce Experience, you'll find everything you need below, including where to download it if your drivers didn't come with it. One thing to note before we begin though: this software only works with Nvidia GPUs, so if you have one of the best AMD graphics cards, you're sadly out of luck.\u00a0Downloading and installing GeForce Experience is super easy (Image credit: Nvidia)How to download GeForce ExperienceIf your graphics driver didn't come with Nvidia's GeForce Experience, don't worry: you can download it manually. All you have to do is go to the Nvidia GeForce Experience page, and click 'Download Now'.\u00a0Once it's done downloading, go ahead and run the GeForce Experience .exe file to start its installation. Once the program is installed, you'll either have to create an Nvidia account, or log in with your existing one. Luckily, you can sign in with either Facebook or Google to quickly setup that account if you don\u2019t have it.\u00a0Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.When done, a dialogue box will open up, prompting you to take a tour. If this is your first time with GeForce Experience, we highly recommend going through it so you can familiarize yourself with the software\u2019s many features. However, it isn't totally necessary. If you don\u2019t have the time, you can skip this part.\u00a0You can update your graphics drivers with GeForce Experience (Image credit: Nvidia)How to install graphics drivers with GeForce ExperienceOne of the best things about the GeForce Experience is that new graphics drivers are always only a couple of clicks away. Nvidia will put out new graphics drivers every couple of weeks for major game releases, so it\u2019s definitely a good idea to check in regularly to make sure your drivers are up to date.\u00a0With GeForce Experience, it's extremely easy to do this. Just open the program, click the 'Drivers' tab and click the \"check for updates\" button. Usually, GeForce Experience will automatically check for new updates, but it never hurts to take that extra step to check yourself.If your graphics driver is up to date, you'll see a message at the top of the screen that says so. If not, you'll see a message that mentions the latest driver with a big green 'Download' button next to it. All you need to do is click that and wait for the driver to download. Once the driver download has completed, two more buttons will appear: \"Express Installation\" and \"Custom Installation\". For most users, we recommend going with the \"Express Installation\".\u00a0Installing your driver will take a few minutes depending on your hardware, and you may need to restart your PC when it's done. After that, congratulations, you've updated your graphics card driver.Optimize your games with GeForce Experience (Image credit: Nvidia)How to optimize your games with GeForce ExperienceThe capability to download drivers on GeForce Experience is definitely enough for us to always have the program installed. However, if you need another reason, there's another marquee feature you\u2019ll definitely going to appreciate: game optimization. With GeForce Experience, you can optimize your games with a mere click of the button. This means that you can get the best balance of performance and visual quality without spending an hour toiling over graphics options.\u00a0The best part is that when you open GeForce Experience, it will scan your PC for installed PC games automatically, and new games will be added to your library. And, if you don't want to wait for the next time you open GeForce Experience, you also have the option to do a manual scan by clicking the three vertical dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting \"Scan for games\".\u00a0When the game you want to optimize is in your GeForce Experience game library, simply hover over it with your mouse and select \"Details\". \u00a0Here, you'll see all the in-game settings and their current value, along with the recommended value for each. If you want to quickly and easily optimize the game, just click the \"Optimize\" button. It will then automatically change all the settings to the values recommended by the software.You can further refine how these settings are optimized by clicking the little wrench icon and choosing your resolution, display mode, and the position on the slider between quality and performance.\u00a0If you just don't have time for any of this, you can simply click the three vertical dots in the top right corner of the library screen and select \"Optimize all games\" to get it all done automatically. Pretty nifty, isn\u2019t it?Record your gameplay with GeForce Experience (Image credit: Nvidia;Activision)How to use GeForce Experience to record your gameplayIf you want to record an entire gameplay walkthrough, or even just capture that killstreak you just achieved, GeForce Experience will get it done.\u00a0Once you're in-game, just hit the GeForce Experience hotkey \u2013 Alt+Z by default \u2013 and the GeForce Experience overlay will appear on screen. Once that's open, you'll see several options appear.\u00a0With Instant Replay, Nvidia ShadowPlay will record the last several minutes of gameplay when you hit a certain hotkey. You can open the settings to personalize Instant Replay, changing the amount of time captured, the quality of the video, resolution, frame rate and bitrate. We recommend leaving most of the settings the way they are, and only changing the amount of time recorded. If you want to save a clip of your gameplay, simply hit Alt+F10 by default, and it will save it to the gallery.\u00a0If you want to manually record your gameplay, you may do so with GeForce Experience, as well. Just click the record option in the GeForce Experience overlay, and you'll be able to start the recording. If you just want to use a hotkey without going into the overlay, you can do that too, by hitting Alt+F9 by default.\u00a0Finally, you can stream using GeForce Experience. You'll be able to broadcast your gameplay to Facebook, Twitch or YouTube. You can also customize your broadcast settings by clicking the 'Broadcast LIVE' button, and then hitting Settings. The settings aren't as comprehensive as something like OBS or XSplit, but GeForce Experience has the benefit of being extremely easy to use. Once you've configured your stream settings, you can start broadcasting by clicking 'Start' or hitting the hotkey Alt+F8.\u00a0And, of course, you can take screenshots with GeForce Experience. You can capture a simple screen grab with Alt+F1, but if you really want to take things to another level, you're going to want to use photo mode.\u00a0You can enter photo mode by hitting Alt+F1 or selecting the 'Photo mode' option in the GeForce Experience overlay. In this mode, you can add filters and even upscale your screenshot in a higher resolution using AI. That's not all, in certain games, you can use Nvidia Ansel technology to move the camera to capture the best image possible.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing How Tos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJackie ThomasSocial Links NavigationJackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN.

It\u2019s incredibly impressive, but also insanely taxing on hardware. Even the most souped-up gaming PC generally takes up to a 50 percent hit to framerates with ray tracing enabled, forcing players to layer on tech like super sampling to make up some of the difference. Naturally, Nvidia isn\u2019t accepting the status quo. Real-time path tracing is the next evolution in game lighting, and it looks incredibly promising. \nPath tracing is a more subtle evolution of ray tracing. It replaces separate, complex lighting computations for different effects with a single, unified algorithm, essentially boiling down the lighting of a 3D scene to a single huge equation filled with rays. It\u2019s a holistic approach, contrasted to conventional ray tracing that tracks the path of light from multiple sources and points of reflection or refraction, then blends those results with more traditional \u201cfaked\u201d rasterized lighting solutions, such as shadow mapping and screen space reflections. \n\n\nTo boil it down to the simplest terms possible: If ray tracing a scene is done with a collection of advanced geometry equations, then path tracing does the same thing with one huge physics equation. You can see a more practical breakdown of the tech, combining both ray tracing and path tracing, in the video below:  \n\n\n\nLike ray tracing, path tracing has been used in pretended 3D animation for decades, and is just now becoming accessible for real-time game animation. Nvidia is taking the lessons it\u2019s learned from the former and applying it to the latter, showing off the results at GTC last week. HotHardware breaks down the presentation, but you can see the natural light advantage of full-blown path tracing in the mogwai tiger demo. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tech is a long way from ready for full integration into real-time graphics, and even further from being ready for gameplay. While developers can play around with path tracing in Nvidia SDKs, it\u2019s currently too taxing on hardware for anything but the demo stage, or in inclusion in older, low-detail games like Minecraft and Quake II. Framerate and resolution issues abound, as does a \u201cnoise\u201d issue in the graphics, similar to high-ISO settings on a still camera. The algorithms governing the light simply need to get better. But when and if the technology matures, it has the potential for life-like lighting that beats anything available on the market today, with performance that isn\u2019t as taxing as ray tracing and similar tech. \n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Michael Crider, Staff Writer, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael is a 10-year veteran of technology journalism, covering everything from Apple to ZTE.

Nvidia is currently at the forefront of GPU manufacturing and artificial intelligence. Nvidia DLSS and OptiX are two of the popular AI technologies the company has developed recently. Additionally, the company is always in the process of developing applications that utilize its GPUs in the best possible manner. \nNvidia currently dominates the competition in terms of discreet GPU market share and gaming. According to Jon Peddie Research, Nvidia has 81 percent of the dGPU market share. Additionally, as per the Steam gaming hardware survey, 77.13 percent of PC gamers use Nvidia GPUs on the platform. This high demand for Nvidia GPUs rose through the roof during the pandemic due to a mixture of the supply chain, scalping and crypto mining issues. As a result, in 2021, Nvidia cards saw a 300 percent price hike in their street price and yet remained out of stock most of the time. Thankfully, Nvidia GPU prices have started to come down in recent months.\nRelated:\u00a0Nvidia's RTX 3090 Ti Costs $1999 And Is Available Now, If You Can Find One\nNvidia makes some of the best GPUs on the market. And they\u2019re now taking their chip design\u00a0capabilities to another level by incorporating machine learning features by using\u00a0its own GPUs. During an Nvidia GTC conference, the company's\u00a0chief scientist Bill Dally said, \"It\u2019s natural as an expert in AI that we would want to take that AI and use it to design better chips.\" So to design better GPUs, the development team at Nvidia is enhancing current-gen computer-enabled design tools with AI capabilities. It is primarily doing so in four major areas. \n                        Nvidia GPUs Work More Efficiently Than Humans\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first area involves mapping voltage drops to determine where the power is used in an Nvidia GPU. Dally\u00a0explained during the presentation that running it manually on CAD would take three hours, but with the help of an AI-powered GPU setup, the same can be\u00a0accomplished in around 18 minutes. The second area involves testing parasitics to check how a circuit design would perform, which is a frequentative process that AI handles. In the third area, an AI-powered GPU tests different layouts of the chips to determine the least congested design format. And lastly, GPUs are used to create new designs as well. Nvidia\u2019s NVCell technology uses Reinforcement Learning to work as an automatic standard cell layout generator. Dally explained that whenever technology\u00a0evolves, like the transition of the fabrication process\u00a0from 7nm to 5nm nodes, thousands of these cells have to be redesigned using \"a very complex set of design rules.\" Nvidia\u2019s NVCell can recreate 92 percent of the cell library with seemingly no error.\nFor reference, it would require a group of 10 people to work for over a year to port a new technology cell library. The same can be accomplished with the help of a few powerful Nvidia GPUs in a matter of days, explained Dally. Of course, human intervention is still required in all these areas, as futuristic as it sounds. However, the AI-enabled Nvidia GPUs help\u00a0the company massively save time and make a better-designed chip. In addition to GPUs, Nvidia might soon dip its toes in the CPU manufacturing business as well, but that\u2019s a story for another time.\nNext:\u00a0GeForce Now Leak Looks Like It's Predicting The Future\nSource: Nvidia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tFrom Season 4's Release Update Means It's Falling Victim To A Frustrating Streaming Trend\n\t\t\n\n\nFrom\n\nAn update surrounding From S4's release window confirms that it suffers from the same frustrating streaming trend that has weighed down other shows.\n\n\nPosts\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nDhruv Sharma\n\n\n31 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNetflix's Next Stephen King Adaptation Cujo Is Seeking Oscar-Nominated Director\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nRyan Northrup\n\n\n3 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t2025 Stephen King Adaptation Passes Global Box Office Milestone After Four Weekends In Theaters\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nHannah Gearan\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tGeorge Clooney Has One Of The Best Broadway Bios I\u2019ve Ever Seen\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nKaila Hale-Stern\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAnime Is Definitely Not Just For Kids, And These 10 Shows Prove It\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nCaitlin Chappell\n\n\n1 hour ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tFX's Snowfall Spinoff Is Moving Forward With Major Pilot Update, 2 Years After It Was Announced\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nBella Garcia\n\n\n3 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI Think the MCU Just Secretly Debuted Its Most Powerful Villain -

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has been quick to hop on the artificial intelligence bus\u4e00with many of its consumer facing technologies, such as Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and AI-accelerated denoising exemplifying that. However, it has also found many uses for AI in its silicon development process and, as Nvidia's chief scientist Bill Dally said in a GTC conference, even designing new hardware.Dally outlines a few use cases for AI in its own development process of the latest and greatest graphic cards (among other things), as noted by HPC Wire.\u00a0\"It\u2019s natural as an expert in AI that we would want to take that AI and use it to design better chips,\" Dally says.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\n'Neural Rendering' could be the new AI-powered sorcery in Nvidia's next-gen RTX 50-series GPUs\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 50-series and dev kit show that rasterization is old news and we're now firmly in the era of AI rendering\n\n\n\n\"We do this in a couple of different ways. The first and most obvious way is we can take existing computer-aided design tools that we have. For example, we have one that takes a map of where power is used in our GPUs, and predicts how far the voltage grid drops\u4e00what\u2019s called IR drop for current times resistance drop. Running this on a conventional CAD tool takes three hours.\"\"...what we\u2019d like to do instead is train an AI model to take the same data; we do this over a bunch of designs, and then we can basically feed in the power map. The inference time is just three seconds. Of course, it\u2019s 18 minutes if you include the time for feature extraction.\"...we\u2019re able to get very accurate power estimations much more quickly than with conventional tools and in a tiny fraction of the time,\" Dally continues.Dally mentions other ways AI can be handy for developing next-generation chips. One is in predicting parasitics, which are essentially unwanted elements in components or designs that could be inefficient or simply cause something to not work as intended. Rather than use human work hours to scope these out, it's possible to reduce the number of steps required in designing circuits by having an AI do it. Sort of like a digital parasitic sniffer dog.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Furthermore, Dally explains that crucial design choices in designing the layout of Nvidia's chips can be aided by AI. Think of this job as avoiding traffic jams with transistors and you'd probably not be that far off. AI may have a future ahead of it in simply pre-warning designers where these traffic jams may occur, which could save heaps of time in the long-run.Nvidia's latest Hopper H100 GPU. (Image credit: Nvidia)Perhaps the most interesting of all the use cases Dally explains is in automating standard cell migration. Okay, it doesn't sound all that interesting, but it actually is. Essentially, it's a way of automating the process of migrating a cell, like a fundamental building block of a computer chip, to a newer process node.So this is like an Atari video game, but it\u2019s a video game for fixing design rule errors in a standard cell.Bill Dally, Nvidia\"So each time we get a new technology, say we\u2019re moving from a seven nanometer technology to a five nanometer technology, we have a library of cells. A cell is something like an AND gate and OR gate, a full adder. We\u2019ve got actually many thousands of these cells that have to be redesigned in the new technology with a very complex set of design rules,\" Dally says.\"We basically do this using reinforcement learning to place the transistors. But then more importantly, after they\u2019re placed, there are usually a bunch of design rule errors, and it goes through almost like a video game. In fact, this is what reinforcement learning is good at. One of the great examples is using reinforcement learning for Atari video games. So this is like an Atari video game, but it\u2019s a video game for fixing design rule errors in a standard cell. By going through and fixing these design rule errors with reinforcement learning, we\u2019re able to basically complete the design of our standard cells.\"The tool Nvidia uses for this automated cell migration is called NVCell, and reportedly 92% of the cell library can be migrated using this tool with no errors. Then 12% of those cells were smaller than the human-designed cells.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest gaming motherboard: The right boards\nBest graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest\"This does two things for us. One is it\u2019s a huge labor saving. It\u2019s a group on the order of 10 people will take the better part of a year to port a new technology library. Now we can do it with a couple of GPUs running for a few days. Then the humans can work on those 8 percent of the cells that didn\u2019t get done automatically. And in many cases, we wind up with a better design as well. So it\u2019s labor savings and better than human design.\"So Nvidia's using AI accelerated by its own GPUs to accelerate its GPU development. Nice. And of course most of these developments will be useful in any form of chipmaking, not just GPUs.It's a clever use of time for Nvidia: developing these AI tools for its own development not only sees it speed up its own processes, it also allows it to better sell the benefits of AI to its customers, whom it provides GPUs to accelerate AI with. So I imagine Nvidia sees it as a win-win scenario.You can check out the full talk with Dally over on the Nvidia website, though you will need to sign up to Nvidia's Developer Program to do so.\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 review\n(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central)\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA and AMD are creators of the best graphics cards on the market, and it's no longer enough to simply ship a powerful card without a bunch of supporting features. Things like FidelityFX Super Resolution, Radeon Super Resolution, and Infinity Cache on AMD's side, or DLSS, DSR, and DLDSR on NVIDIA's side are starting to sound a lot alike, and I don't blame anyone for not paying close enough attention to keep them all separated.I already wrote an article explaining the differences between FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) and Radeon Super Resolution (RSR) on AMD's side. And it's now time to compare NVIDIA's new DLDSR \u2014 announced Jan. 14, 2022 \u2014 with existing DLSS and DSR technologies. Here's what you can expect if you're the proud owner of a modern NVIDIA GPU.What is NVIDIA DLSS?Senior Editor Rich Edmonds has an excellent article explaining fully both DLSS and ray tracing, and I also wrote a piece explaining how DLSS compares to AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution. There's a lot of information to digest in those articles, and I suggest reading them if you're looking for a deeper dive.Deep Learning Super Sampling, otherwise known as DLSS, is a new take on supersampling. It leverages artificial intelligence to boost frame rates while also boosting the visual fidelity of compatible games. Whereas DSR and DLDSR are downscaling techniques, DLSS is an upscaling technique.When a game is compatible with DLSS, what you're seeing on your screen is first broken down into supersampled \"perfect frames\" that are examined by NVIDIA's neural network. It starts at a lower resolution and focuses on anti-aliasing, then focuses on sharpening the frame by adding extra pixels. NVIDIA's AI looks at these high-res perfect frames, compares them with upcoming normal frames, and repeats the process throughout.DLSS ultimately makes your games look better while also taking some of the load off your GPU, upping frame rates at the same time. The rub here is that DLSS isn't available in all games, and it must be baked in by the developer. The list continues to grow, but it's still relatively small. You must also have an NVIDIA RTX 20- or 30-series GPU with dedicated Tensor cores for DLSS to work.What is NVIDIA DSR and DLDSR?NVIDIA's Dynamic Super Resolution, also known as DSR, was introduced alongside Maxwell GPUs about seven years ago, making it the most mature feature here. It allows for frames rendered in the GPU buffer to be a higher resolution (up to four times more) than your monitor, to then be filtered down to fit the screen. The higher resolution makes for a better image, which translates even when you're filtering down.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.DSR is handled at a driver level, and it's best used when your GPU has some performance overhead to play with. If your GPU is already working about as hard as it can to render frames at 1080p, making it render frames at 2K or 4K is going to cause a serious hit to frame rates. DSR works with all modern NVIDIA GPUs, and it can even be enabled alongside DLSS. You should be able to use DSR to some extent in most PC games, as there's not any special requirement to be baked in on the game's side (like with DLSS).Source: NVIDIA (Image credit: Source: NVIDIA)NVIDIA's Deep Learning Dynamic Super Resolution (DLDSR) is an upgrade to DSR, meant to make the process more efficient while resulting in the same end product. The method still renders frames at a higher resolution before shrinking them down to fit your monitor's resolution, but it leverages NVIDIA's potent AI and the Tensor cores in RTX GPUs to downscale images more efficiently.NVIDIA claims that 4x DSR (rendering the frames at a resolution four times higher than your monitor supports) is about the same as 2.25x DLDSR, making it almost twice as efficient. This is meant to take some of the load off of the GPU. Because DLDSR relies on Tensor cores \u2014 the same ones used for DLSS \u2014 it will only be available in NVIDIA RTX 20- and 30-series GPUs. If you don't have an RTX card, you can still use standard DSR in games.DLDSR will also work alongside DLSS, upscaling images before DLDSR kicks in for a higher resolution to be downscaled again. And like DSR, DLDSR is best used by those who have a GPU with some available performance overhead. You're still rendering frames at a higher resolution before downscaling them, and the hit to the GPU is the same.DLDSR, which is a driver-based feature, has been available since Jan. 14, 2022. Update your NVIDIA drivers if you'd like to test it out!

Both mobility GPUs are based on the Ampere GA107 GPU architecture and rock 2048 CUDA cores, 16 Raytracing cores, 64 Tensor cores, & a 64-bit bus interface. The RTX 2050 comes with a 4 GB 14 Gbps memory config while the MX570 features a 2 GB 12 Gbps config.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility PreviewWhile the core specs are the same, the GPU clocks vary significantly due to different TDPs. The RTX 2050 operates at up to 1477 MHz with a 30-45W TGP while the MX570 operates at up to 1155 MHz with a TGP of 15-25W. Now the NVIDIA GeForce MX570 in this particular benchmark was spotted within the HP Zhan 66 14-inch G5 laptop. This laptop rocks an Intel Core i5-1235U CPU & the said GeForce MX570 GPU. It is hard to tell what power limit was designated to the GPU within the HP laptop but it was operating at its max 1155 MHz clock so one could assume it was running at 20-25W.\nNVIDIA's GeForce MX570 has been tested within the Geekbench OpenCL Benchmark. (Image Credits: Benchleaks)\nNow compared to the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2050, the GeForce MX570 offers 97% performance of the faster GPU while featuring a lower clock speed and a TGP that's 10-25W lower. The benchmark performance scales with the configuration used but despite that, the MX570 should offer 90-95% performance of the RTX 2050.\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce MX570 OpenCL Benchmark\n\nOpenCL (Average)\n\n\n0100002000030000400005000060000\n\n\n\n\n\n0100002000030000400005000060000\n\n\n\n\n\nGTX 1660 Ti\n\n53.2k\n\n\nGTX 1080\n\n46.9k\n\n\nRTX 2050\n\n46k\n\n\nMX570\n\n44.6k\n\n\nGTX 1650 Ti\n\n43.6k\n\n\nMX550\n\n36.1k\n\n\nGTX 1060\n\n29.9k\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe performance demonstrated by the NVIDIA GeForce MX570 shows that it should be the better option if you are in the market for such a laptop. Although it operates at a lower clock speed, the GPU will offer almost similar performance while consuming lower power and will even come at a cheaper price point given there's no RTX-tax attached to it. It also retains the DLSS and RT features of the RTX products. The only major downside is that it has a 2 GB VRAM so that makes 2050 a slightly better option when considering an upgrade over an integrated GPU laptop.\n\n\n\nGPU NameRTX 3050RTX 2050MX570GTX 1650\n\n\n\n\nArchitectureAmpereAmpereAmpereTuring\n\n\nGPUGA107GA107GA107TU117\n\n\nCUDA Cores2048204820481024\n\n\nRT Cores161616N/A\n\n\nTensor Cores646464N/A\n\n\nMax Boost Clock1740 MHz1477 MHz1155 MHz1020 MHz\n\n\nMemory Configuration128-bit64-bit64-bit128-bit\n\n\nMemory Clock14 Gbps14 Gbps12 Gbps8 Gbps\n\n\nTGP35-80W30-45W15-25W15-30W\n\n\nLaunch DateJanuary 2021Spring 2022Spring 2022April 2019\n\n\n\nNews Sources: Benchleaks, Videocardz\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPiper Sandler Sees 10x Increase In NVIDIA\u2019s GPU Capacity And A 35x Decrease In Model Inference Costs As Seeds For The Upcoming \u201cAI Wave 2\u201d\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 & RTX 5060 Ti Specs Leaked: 5060 Ti Gets 4608 Cores & Up To 16 GB G7, 5050 Gets 2560 Cores & 8 GB G6, Both at 128-bit\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n155\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Board Partners Silently Increase Prices Of Radeon RX 9070 Series; Base Models Priced At Up To $130 Higher\n\n\n\n116\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nTesla Warns Trump Administration That Tariffs Could Make Its Production Costs Jump\n\n\n\n113\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n79\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nM3 Ultra Runs DeepSeek R1 With 671 Billion Parameters Using 448GB Of Unified Memory, Delivering High Bandwidth Performance At Under 200W Power Consumption, With No Need For A Multi-GPU Setup\n\n\n\n43\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\n12V-2\u00d76 Power Connector Cooks At Over 150\u00b0C With A \u201cWater-Cooled\u201d NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090\n\n\n\n2317\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor Retailer Reports Selling Over 5,000 Units of AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs on Launch Day, Working Quickly to Restore Inventory\n\n\n\n2093\nComments\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1526\nComments\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Releases Another Hotfix Driver to Resolve Black Screen Issues, Marking the Firm\u2019s Fifth Attempt to Address The Problem\n\n\n\n1300\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

So many of the best graphics cards are out of stock and have been for the better part of two years. So why, then, are we facing what sounds like the impending launch of NVIDIA's next big wave?More and more details keep trickling out about the RTX 40-series GPUs. First, we got details about their architecture, then we got a scoop indicating how big the launch lineup will be. All these details emerged amid a landscape devoid of actual purchasable GPUs, since a great many consumers still can't get their hands on the soon-to-be-last-gen RTX 30-series graphics cards. We spoke to experts to find out why new graphics cards make sense in a time when people may not even be able to buy old ones.The competitionSource: AMD (Image credit: Source: AMD)Despite the bizarre market conditions that computer components have endured since 2020, there is one constant that tech companies can expect: competition from rivals. That, according to Akshat Vaid, Vice President at Everest Group, is one of the key reasons NVIDIA's upcoming line may arrive before people have had a chance to gather the 30-series cards they've wanted for years.\"NVIDIA's closest competitor in this space, AMD, is launching its next-gen RDNA 3 GPUs, at 5nm node, towards the end of 2022. NVIDIA's RTX 40 series will be closest in performance to these new GPUs being launched by AMD,\" he said. \"NVIDIA almost has no choice but to launch these new GPUs to avoid falling behind in the market.\"Vaid also reiterated that a new line stepping into the limelight doesn't erase the previous line's relevancy. After all, with sky-high demand for GPUs, there will be people willing to pay top-dollar for the new products as well as less-than-top-dollar for the older cards that still pack a punch in modern computing.\"While the RTX 30 series fell short in market success due to stockouts and unaffordability, a large segment of users were willing to pay up to two times the price,\" Vaid said. \"The next gen GPUs will offer a two-time improvement in performance, so end consumers (especially the crypto mining segment) might not hesitate paying the premium for the new product line. In any case, the company is planning to produce RTX 40 series alongside the RTX 30 series cards.\"When will RTX GPUs be available?Source: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central)As experts have stated for some time now, there's a general consensus that consumer tech should see a return to normalcy \u2014 more or less \u2014 by the end of 2022. This is thanks in large part to giants like Intel and TSMC upping their output to try to catch up with demand. Vaid pointed to these items when mentioning how RTX 30-series cards aren't in as dire of a pricing situation as they were in 2021.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.It's not all good news, though. \"NVIDIA plans to tap TSMC's 5nm process technology for its RTX 40-series cards \u2014 the move by both NVIDIA and AMD to launch new GPUs that make use of this technology will start putting additional pressure on TSMC to expand capacity of its 5nm-enabled fabs and prioritize high-margin products,\" Vaid stated, highlighting one of the factors that may interrupt the process of getting consumers' appetites satiated.Alan Priestley, Gartner Research VP, mentioned similar points to Vaid, including how AMD and now Intel with its Arc line are putting pressure on NVIDIA to stay current. However, when it came to the per-wafer chip output angle, he expressed optimism without mention of the potential caveat Vaid addressed.\"Next-gen GPUs will no doubt use new process technology which will deliver more chips per wafer and hence increased availability,\" Priestley stated, noting that a new line with better production output capabilities could mitigate the current situation affecting NVIDIA's graphics cards.What will RTX 40-series GPUs cost?Source: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central)What with the wild ride the 30-series cards have had with regards to pricing, many are wondering what kind of damage the 40 series will do to wallets. Vaid and Priestley had similar thoughts on where NVIDIA may land when it comes to setting MSRPs for its latest cards.\"Given the upside of close to about two times in terms of performance that the RTX 40 series potentially provides, prices of the 40 series will be likely to reflect the tech upgrade,\" Vaid said. \"While inflated prices were an issue for the RTX 30 lifecycle, the market did witness a segment of gamers who were willing to pay much more than the MSRP for graphics cards such as the 3070, which could further incentivize NVIDIA to slightly increase the MSRP across the range of its RTX 40 series. While hard to put a range, we're expecting prices to be higher than the 30 series but competitive against AMD's RDNA 3 GPUs, which by all accounts, are expected to be launched earlier.\"It makes sense that even if pricing does see a spike compared to last-gen's offerings, competitive MSRPs are still going to be the trendsetting factor. And consumers' desperation for GPUs has proven a monetary force to be reckoned with, highlighting more reasons for the big graphics card producers to up their fees a bit across the board.\"We could anticipate new GPUs at similar price points to existing products but offering higher performance, as it's not clear that the market would support significantly higher price points \u2014 especially at the top of the price stack,\" Priestley stated. While there may be a bit of wiggle room for companies to up the price ceiling, that's not a greenlight for them to gouge by voluntarily engaging in the astronomical price hikes the 30 series saw at certain points across 2020 and 2021. Heck, some manufacturers are even making a show of reducing the prices of their GPUs, such as ASUS.We won't know anything as fact until NVIDIA and its partners start dropping hard figures, but for the time being, these guesstimates and hypotheses on availability optics and pricing possibilities should help you make your own tentative plans for your next rig upgrade.\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nNvidia\nHardware\nComputers Desktops\n\n\nRobert CarnevaleSocial Links NavigationRobert Carnevale is the News Editor for Windows Central.

While there has been great progress with iGPUs on-package with CPUs, the dGPU is still preferred in many applications. Today, we are going to take a look at the Lenovo ThinkStation P340 Tiny. The P340 Tiny is designed to be Lenovo\u2019s 1L workstation offering making it a bit more exciting than our average Project TinyMiniMicro mode. This unit has something unique beyond the GPU, and it may not be the best thing.\nProject TinyMiniMicro Lenovo ThinkStation P340 Tiny Video\nAs part of this project, we have video versions as well. Here is the video for this unit:\n\nThis article will have a bit more since there are some facts and concepts easier to convey using text rather than video. You can also see the full video series using this YouTube playlist. Our suggestion is to open the video in its own YouTube tab, window, or app and play it in the background to listen along.\nProject TinyMiniMicro Background\nIn Project TinyMiniMicro we are purchasing a large number of these devices from different sources. While a standard STH review is of a new product, these TMM nodes occasionally have specs that differ from what one would expect. We have now looked at dozens of these units, reviewing the majority of DDR4-equipped 1L PCs from Lenovo, HP, and Dell. This series is certainly fun.\nFor around $850, we received a node with an Intel Core i7-10700T CPU, an 16GB SODIMM for RAM, and a 512GB NVMe SSD. Our unit came with the NVIDIA Quadro P620 which is a lower-end PCIe GPU, but massive in the 1L PC space. We even got an embedded Windows 10 Pro license which would have cost us around $140 alone. Ours shipped with the default Lenovo added bloatware but a fresh Windows 10 Pro install fixes this. We also upgraded this unit to Windows 11 Pro.\nLenovo ThinkStation P340 Tiny Rear With Antenna\nWe also got WiFi 6 in the unit to round out networking. Clearly, though, the big feature is the GPU. One of the goals with purchasing a Core i7-10700T is that the CPU is two generations newer than the P330 Tiny\u2019s i7-8700T. Even two generations newer of a CPU still means that we have the same NVIDIA Quadro P620 GPU. This is also a small upgrade over the P320 Tiny\u2019s Quadro P600 we reviewed and that was another generation earlier.\nLenovo ThinkStation P340 Tiny Internal GPU And CPU Angle\nBefore we get too far in this, we should mention that this is both a nice system, but it is not currently our recommendation for many of our users asking about GPUs. The Quadro P620 is for using NVIDIA\u2019s validated drivers with software and for extra display outputs. The HP EliteDesk 805 G8 has a NVIDIA GTX 1660Ti 6GB. We have not reviewed that unit yet (but more on it tomorrow.) That unit is going to be a better option for those who ask \u201ccan I game?\u201d or \u201cwhat about AI?\u201d\nWe are going to go into the hardware overview, then into the key specs. We are then going to talk a bit about performance and power consumption before getting to our lessons learned from these units and our final words.\nLenovo ThinkStation P340 Tiny Hardware Overview\nThe chassis itself is a fairly standard design for the older ThinkCentre Tiny series. It measures 179 x 183 x 37mm (7.0 x 7.2 x 1.5in) which means it is around 1L like the other systems in this series.\nLenovo ThinkStation P340 Tiny Front\nThe front has a combo headset jack and two USB ports. The Type-A port is a USB 3.2 Gen2 10Gbps port while the USB-C is a Gen1 5Gbps port.\nWhat is also new is the faceplate. This is an updated design from Lenovo in this generation. Here is the P330 Tiny from our prior review.\nLenovo ThinkStation P330 Tiny Front\nOn the rear of the unit, a DisplayPort and a HDMI port standard in Lenovo\u2019s line. In our unit, the dual optional slot that we found on other Tiny units is instead replaced by four Mini DisplayPort outputs that are driven by the NVIDIA Quadro P620 (2GB) GPU. Lenovo also has options to replace this panel with either a NVIDIA Quadro P1000 (4GB) or a T1000 6GB GPU.\nLenovo ThinkStation P340 Tiny Rear Without Antenna\nWe also have four USB 3 Type-A ports. Some systems of this era used USB 2 ports, so this is a nice upgrade. Two of the ports are USB 3.2 Gen1 ports while the other two are Gen2 ports. Lenovo does a good job of actually labeling its 10Gbps ports. Not all vendors do that. There is also an Intel i219-LM 1GbE port and the WiFi antenna.\nSomething that we wanted to quickly note is that there is a big difference with this generation in terms of venting that goes beyond the faceplate. The top now has a vent that extends across. In the P320 Tiny we did not get a vent on top, so that unit could still be stacked. With the P330 Tiny, there was a smaller vent less than half this size.\nLenovo ThinkStation P340 Tiny Front Angle 3\nThis is for a machine with essentially the same GPU and a 35W TDP Core i7. The not so subtle secret is that the 35W TDP CPUs can use a lot more power in newer generations and so cooling needs are higher.\nLenovo ThinkStation P340 Tiny Top\nOpening the system is done via a single screw. Lenovo\u2019s design, unlike HP\u2019s for example, does not retain the screw on the chassis. The layout is more similar to the Lenovo ThinkCentre M90q Tiny with perhaps the biggest difference being due to the GPU.\nLenovo ThinkStation P340 Tiny Internal Overview 2\nThe CPU here is a 10th-generation Intel Core processor. Specifically, we have the Intel Core i7-10700T. We looked at the two previous generations also with the Core i7 parts so we wanted to keep things relatively similar.\nWe have what is more of a standard NVIDIA Quadro P620 2GB card. You can compare what we have here to our NVIDIA Quadro P620 Low Profile, Low Power Graphics Card Review. The major difference is that we have a custom rear I/O bracket. Still, this is not the more custom heat pipe we saw in other older Lenovo GPU systems.\nLenovo ThinkStation P340 Tiny Internal NVIDIA Quadro P620 2\nUnderneath the GPU these came with optional 802.11ac WiFi + Bluetooth combo cards from Intel or Realtek or a WiFi 6 (AX201) card from Intel. If you want WiFi, we always suggest getting pre-installed in these nodes.\nLenovo ThinkStation P340 Tiny Internal GPU And CPU Fan Assemblies\nLenovo\u2019s design we really like. Once the top cover is off, one can remove the bottom cover by simply sliding the cover off. Underneath, we find the memory and NVMe storage expansion.\nLenovo ThinkStation P340 Tiny Internal Bottom Overview\nOur unit came with a single 16GB DDR4 SODIMM. We always suggest getting a second DIMM for dual-channel memory bandwidth benefits. Lenovo has supported configurations for up to 2x 32GB for 64GB.\nLenovo ThinkStation P340 Tiny Internal Bottom SODIMM\nFor NVMe storage, there are dual M.2 drive slots. Also, the M.2 retention mechanism is a blue tool-less design we have seen Lenovo use for generations. After servicing a few dozen of these nodes, having everything tool-less is a major design win for us. This is a big difference between Lenovo\u2019s high-end Intel units and its AMD units. Lenovo positions AMD systems as lower-end, like the\u00a0Lenovo ThinkCentre M75q Tiny Gen2 so those systems only get a single M.2 slot.\nLenovo ThinkStation P340 Tiny Internal Bottom Dual M.2 Slots And SSD\nBefore closing the section, we just wanted to note that this unit supports vPro so long as it is configured to have the feature.\nLenovo ThinkStation P340 Tiny VPro\nThere are a number of configuration options in this system that we do not have. Lenovo specifically makes this unit highly configurable since it is its higher-end Tiny.\nNext, we are going to look at the performance and power consumption before getting to our final words.\n\n\n\n \n\n 1 2 3 4 REVIEW OVERVIEWDesign & Aesthetics9.1Performance9.0Feature Set9.2Value9.1SUMMARYIn our Lenovo ThinkStation P340 Tiny review, we see what this NVIDIA GPU powered 1L workstation offers and even one of its humorous features9.1OVERALL SCORE\n\n TAGSIntelLenovoNVIDIAQuadroTinyMiniMicro \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleTripp-Lite ISOBAR12ULTRA Quick Look 1U Surge Protector PDUNext articleHP EliteDesk Mini 2.5GbE Flex IO V2 NIC is Here Patrick Kennedyhttps://www.servethehome.comPatrick has been running STH since 2009 and covers a wide variety of SME, SMB, and SOHO IT topics.

Normally these come with 90W, depending on the display size, 22\u2033, 24\u2033: 90W & 27\u2033 come with 170W. \nTypically if the Power supply that comes with the Tiny is 135W or larger it\u2019s designed to replace the power supply that ships with the TIO. They both use the same \u201cSlim Tip\u201d rectangular power supply connectors.\n@PNWah01 If you look on Reddit\u2019s homelab area you will find that someone has put in an X710-DA4 into a Tiny.

This piece has actually been split into two based on our recent Ethernet SSDs Hands-on with the Kioxia EM6 NVMeoF SSD piece. In that piece, we looked at SSDs that did not require an x86 server. With this, we are going to show you another option for that that will hopefully start some discussion on the topic as we go through some of the basics of how this works. What we realized after the last piece is that it is a new enough concept where we could do a bit better of a job explaining how things are happening, and why. So we are splitting this into two. In this piece, we are going to use NVMe SSDs and ZFS to help folks understand exactly what is going on here and keep it as close to a NAS model as we possibly can before moving to a higher-level demo.\nVideo Version and Background\nHere is the video version where you can see the setup running, and likely some more screen capture here, and there is a voiceover.\n\nAs always, we suggest opening this in a separate tab, browser, or app for a better viewing experience.\nFor some background:\n\nWhat is a DPU?\nSTH NIC Continuum\nAWS Nitro\nAMD-Pensando DPU Deal\n\nThese mostly have videos as well but they explain what a DPU is, and why it is different from traditional NICs. The AWS Nitro was really the first to implement this and we recently discussed the market in the AMD-Pensando video.\nThe short version, however, is that a DPU is a processor that combines a few key characteristics. Among them are:\n\nHigh-speed networking connectivity (usually multiple 100Gbps-200Gbps interfaces in this generation)\nHigh-speed packet processing with specific acceleration and often programmable logic (P4/ P4-like is common)\nA CPU core complex (often Arm or MIPS based in this generation)\nMemory controllers (commonly DDR4 but we also see HBM and DDR5 support)\nAccelerators (often for crypto or storage offload)\nPCIe Gen4 lanes (run as either root or endpoints)\nSecurity and management features (offering a hardware root of trust as an example)\nRuns its own OS separate from a host system (commonly Linux, but the subject of\u00a0VMware Project Monterey ESXi on Arm\u00a0as another example)\n\nSTH Elements Of A DPU Q2 2021\nMost of the coverage with DPUs has been DPUs in traditional x86 systems. The vision for DPUs goes well beyond that, and we will touch on that later. Still, it is correct to think of a DPU as a standalone processor that can connect to a host server or devices via PCIe and network fabric.\nIn this piece, we are going to show what happens when you do not use a host server, and run the DPU as a standalone mini-server by creating a ZFS-based solution with the card.\nNVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU and Hardware Needed\nFor these are are using the NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU. Here is the overview slide.\nNVIDIA BlueField 2 DPU Overview\nThese are interesting because they are basically a ConnectX-6 NIC, a PCIe switch, and an Arm processor complex on the card.\nNVIDIA BlueField 2 DPU Block Diagram\nThe Arm CPU complex has 16GB of single-channel DDR4 memory. NVIDIA has 32GB versions, but we have not been able to get one. We can see the ConnnectX-6 NICs on the PCIe bus here. There is also eMMC storage that is running our Ubuntu 20.04 LTS OS.\nNVIDIA BlueField 2 DPU Lstopo\nThere are eight Arm Cortex-A72 cores with 1MB of L2 cache shared between two cores and a 6MB L3 cache.\nNVIDIA BlueField 2 DPU Lscpu Output\nHere is one of the BF2M516A cards that we have with dual 100GbE ports. We will note that these are the E-cores not the P or performance parts.\nNVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU 2x 100GbE\nIn the Building the Ultimate x86 and Arm Cluster-in-a-Box piece, we showed that each of these DPUs are individual nodes running their own OS leading to a really interesting little cluster.\n\nWe are exploiting that property by utilizing the cards in the AIC JBOX that we recently reviewed.\nAIC JBOX J5010 02 NVIDIA BlueField 2 DPU With Three SSDs 2\nThe AIC JBOX is a PCIe Gen4 chassis that has two Broadcom PCIe switches and is solely meant to connect PCIe devices, power them, and cool them. There is no x86 processor in the system, so we can use the BlueField-2 DPU as a PCIe root and then use NVMe SSDs in the chassis to connect to the BlueField-2 DPU.\nAIC JBOX J5010 02 NVIDIA BlueField 2 DPU With Three SSDs 1\nWith the hardware platform set, we are able to start setting up the system with ZFS.\n\n\n\n \n\n 1 2 3 \n\n TAGSAICBlueFieldBlueField-2DPUNVIDIA \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleIntel Earnings Q1 2022 NotesNext articleWhy We Use 100GbE Switches and QSFP28 to 4x SFP28 DACs for 25GbE Patrick Kennedyhttps://www.servethehome.comPatrick has been running STH since 2009 and covers a wide variety of SME, SMB, and SOHO IT topics.

Does nVidia have tools available to make their DPUs export storage to host servers via NVMe (or whatever) over PCIe?

It's a news story when AMD is valued at more than Intel, as much as it is when Nvidia skyrockets to new heights of Wall Street wealth. But when it gets down to who's bigger than who, the perceived value of a company doesn't equate to its actual size\u2014that comes down to how many people they employ, revenue streams, the breadth of what they create, and market share.Stellar financials are one thing, but people make the product; as Intel likes to say, \"The ingredient we begin with is sand. Everything else is value added by people.\" It's true, though, and while a great measure of success is the value attributed to a company, there's a lot more to say when it comes to the scope and size of a company.That's why I've dug into Intel, AMD, and Nvidia's financials, reports, and corporate documents to see how these three companies actually align in 2022. If you're purely a share price buff, you might be surprised. Though if you're a long-term PC gamer with one eye on hardware, you could probably make a bet right now as to which company is actually the biggest with decent odds of it being correct.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest winners and losers of 2024: Nvidia won over Wall Street but what hardware won PC Gamer's heart?\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft is Nvidia's biggest AI chip buyer of the year, and it's not even close. With ByteDance and Tencent coming out ahead of Zuck, Bezos, and Musk's outfits, too\n\n\n\nRound one: Employee count\u00a0IntelIntel had 110,600 employees as of December 2020, a figure provided by Intel in its 2020\u20132021 corporate responsibility report. Intel says roughly 90% of its staff are in technical positions. While we don't have a 2021\u20132022 report as of yet, I would guess that the number of employees, especially those in technical positions, may have increased under the leadership of Intel's current CEO, Pat Gelsinger. Gelsinger is himself an engineer, and has on numerous occasions championed technical expertise at Intel\u2014a number of notable ex-Intel employees returned when Gelsinger took over.AMDAMD totals 12,600+ employees, according to its 2020\u201321 corporate responsibility report, which offers us a pretty good ballpark figure to go off. Clearly, Intel's staff numbers far exceed that of AMD, though we're forgetting one thing: AMD closed on its Xilinx purchase in 2022; AMD gained around 5,000 employees, or just under, with that acquisition. That means AMD's total headcount will be at least 17,000, if not higher, in 2022.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.NvidiaWe're at the whims of Nvidia's strange corporate calendar for its headcount, meaning we're awaiting its full-year 2022 report in a few months\u2014Nvidia's financial year is a year ahead of everyone else, and it doesn't quite add up on a month-by-month basis, either.\u00a0For now, we have the 2021 report to go from, which says Nvidia has around 18,975 employees. It also recently expanded its headcount rapidly as the result of an acquisition\u2014Nvidia purchased Mellanox in mid-2020, and you can see the major jump in its total employees as a result. In Nvidia's FY20, it had 13,775 employees. By FY21, it has 18,975.Pat Gelsinger, Intel's CEO, in a famed bunny suit.

It raked-in $79 billion US dollars in its full-year 2021 period (which ends December 25, 2021), which was up just 1% on 2020's $77.9B figure. A humongous load of cash, no doubt about that. Of that figure, around $19.9B of it was net profit.AMDAMD does us a big favour by also running its full-year 2021 until December 25, 2021, meaning it's an apples to apples comparison with Intel for the period. AMD made $16.4B, which is near-enough five times less than Intel. Of that sum, $3.16B was profit. However, there is more to say on that. AMD's full-year results for 2021 were up an absurd 68% year-over-year. The company made $9.8B in 2020. At that rate of growth, AMD would be nearly neck-and-neck with Intel in three years' time.Whether AMD can keep up this incredible trajectory is another matter. It's a massive ask and the semiconductor biz is anything but consistent. That said, it's definitely looking up for team red as it stands today.NvidiaNvidia is a real Wall Street darling; its total market cap (its share value multiplied by its total outstanding shares) is by far the largest of the three at $614B (AMD sits at $166B and Intel at $193B). Though when you take a look at its actual revenue for a full-year period, it paints an entirely different picture.For Nvidia's fiscal year 2022\u2014roughly equivalent to AMD and Intel's full-year 2021, ending on January 30, 2021\u2014the company made $26.9B in revenue. That's up a stunning 61% year-over-year, beating full-year 2021's total of $16.7B. Of that sum, $9.75B was net profit, which shows Nvidia runs a tight ship and makes a lot of cash from a fairly lean operation.\u00a0Like AMD, Nvidia has gained tremendously over the past year, and both companies make Intel's 1% improvement during the period look rather paltry by comparison. Despite this, it is Intel that's far ahead in overall revenue.(Image credit: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Round three: Products\u00a0While PC gamers know Intel, AMD, and Nvidia for their PC hardware components\u2014namely GPUs or CPUs\u2014these companies don't entirely operate within the same exact space. For all the acquisitions and sub-divisions made by these three, it's not all that easy to draw a firm comparison between them without also looking into what products and services they provide.It's also worth noting that Intel has the facilities to produce its own chips, and that's a whole different ballgame to AMD and Nvidia. Both of which are fabless companies and reliant on the manufacturing capability of others to produce their chips. Of course, Intel does rely on other chipmakers, too\u2014we're largely talking about TSMC and Samsung here\u2014but maintains a large chip fabrication presence globally.I'm not going to list every product each company makes; I'd be here all year and it'd be wrong by the time I'd finished. Instead I'll give a rough idea of the purview of each of these companies and their main products.IntelCPUs - Server + clientGPUs - Intel Arc, Xe architecture, etc.Mobile - Intel 12th Gen mobile processorsSSDs - NAND Flash (until completion of purchase by SK Hynix)Memory - Optane (potentially on the chopping board, predicted to end up with a $529 million operating loss in 2021.)Automotive - MobileyeConnectivity - Killer, Intel Wi-Fi, Intel Ethernet, ThunderboltChipsetsFPGAsASICs - Blockscale, eASICManufacturing - IDM 2.0Software - OneAPI suite, Command Center, XeSS, etc.SupercomputersAMDCPU - Server + clientGPU - Radeon RDNA, CDNA, etc.Mobile - Ryzen 6000 mobile processorsSoftware - Adrenalin Software, FidelityFX suite, ROCm, Ryzen Master, etc.ChipsetsFPGAs, SoCs - XilinxSupercomputersNvidiaGPU - GeForce, Quadro, datacentreCPU - GraceMonitors - G-Sync modulesRobotics - JetsonAutomotive - Drive,\u00a0SupercomputersMedical devices - ClaraSoftware - CUDA, DLSS, GeForce Now, etc.Datacentre - Mellanox, DPUs, etc.\u00a0(Image credit: AMD)Round four: Market share\u00a0We can't necessarily compare all three companies in their market share, because, as we've just seen, they compete in many different categories. However, we can take a look at the market share of those products that matter most to PC gamers, namely CPU and GPU.\u00a0In terms of gaming market share, we can look to the Steam Hardware Survey for an idea. Just bear in mind that this isn't the ideal metric to draw firm conclusions from; more of a rough idea of general trends.Total CPU market share (Mercury Research - Q4, 2021)Intel: 74.4%AMD: 25.6%Gaming (Steam Hardware Survey - March 2022)Intel: 69.34%AMD: 30.66%Total dGPU market share (Jon Peddie Research - Q4 2021)AMD: 19%Nvidia: 81%Gaming (Steam Hardware Survey - March 2022)Intel: 8.52%AMD: 14.15%Nvidia: 77.13%Image 1 of 3Intel share price(Image credit: Google)AMD share price(Image credit: Google)Nvidia share price(Image credit: Google)Bonus round: Market cap\u00a0Alright, I know we said we wouldn't look at the world through this lens, but we are mostly suckers for cash money, ultimately. When it comes to share price, or the perceived value of a company by the public, the aforementioned dominance of Intel is far less pronounced. In fact, it's valued at less than a third of Nvidia.Market cap (as of April 2022)Intel: $193 billionAMD: $166 billion\u00a0Nvidia: $614 billionNvidia is clearly a company perceived to be more valuable than its competitors, though there are other factors to its success to consider. Share price valuation can fluctuate quite significantly due to events and circumstance that might not accurately reflect the real-life success or danger to a companies' prosperity. While an interesting factor, and no doubt one of significant import to shareholders that may hold the keys to a company's leadership, in the long-run we'll have to see whether Nvidia's share price dominance materialises as bigger numbers in its financial results, too.\u00a0(Image credit: Intel)The biggest of the three: Intel\u00a0It's not altogether surprising that Intel is so clearly the larger of the three companies. It pretty much built the computer chip as we know it today, and it's never ceased in manufacturing its own designs since those hazy days of chipmaking history. There's a legacy there, and that legacy is still worth its weight in gold. Or at least Olympic-size swimming pools of cash every quarter.However, Nvidia and AMD remain strong competition despite their overall size and revenue discrepancies; the public appears to be well aware of this too, judging by each company's market cap. Nvidia, especially, has been doing exceptionally well these past two years, and by at least the perception of its shareholders and the public would be considered the more successful of the three.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest gaming motherboard: The right boards\nBest graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the restI would guess that Intel's unique position among the three as the manufacturer of its own goods, and the recent interest from US and European leaders for that capability, will allow it to continue to lead the way in these key areas\u2014even though it might not seem that way today with its far slower yearly growth. In a world of supply chain constraints and interglobal competition for chips, Intel is uniquely positioned to deliver what the others can't, even if it hasn't appeared to materialise many gains in that department over the past half decade or more.Despite the competition, the future also looks at least partly co-operative for the big three. Intel's IDM strategy puts it at the centre of a cross-continent pledge to increase domestic chipmaking, and that would likely see Intel less at odds with Nvidia and AMD, and more closely working with them. It's not entirely unbelievable that we will one day see an AMD or Nvidia chip manufactured by Intel; though it would be quite odd to see all the same.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

It ran up to 5x faster than our previous generation Jetson AGX Xavier, while delivering an average of 2x better energy efficiency.\nNVIDIA Orin is available today in the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin developer kit for robotics and autonomous systems. More than 6,000 customers including Amazon Web Services, John Deere, Komatsu, Medtronic and Microsoft Azure use the NVIDIA Jetson platform for AI inference or other tasks.\nIt\u2019s also a key component of our NVIDIA Hyperion platform for autonomous vehicles. China\u2019s largest EV maker. BYD, is the latest automaker to announce it will use the Orin-based DRIVE Hyperion architecture for their next-generation automated EV fleets.\nOrin is also a key ingredient in NVIDIA Clara Holoscan for medical devices, a platform system makers and researchers are using to develop next generation AI instruments.\nSmall Module, Big Stack\nServers and devices with NVIDIA GPUs including Jetson AGX Orin were the only edge accelerators to run all six MLPerf benchmarks.\nWith its JetPack SDK, Orin runs the full NVIDIA AI platform, a software stack already proven in the data center and the cloud. And it\u2019s backed by a million developers using the NVIDIA Jetson platform.\nNVIDIA leads across the board in per-accelerator inference performance and is the only company to submit on all workloads.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Footnote: MLPerf v2.0 Inference Closed; Per-accelerator performance derived from the best MLPerf results for respective submissions using reported accelerator count in Data Center Offline and Server. Qualcomm AI 100: 2.0-130, Intel Xeon 8380 from MLPerf v.1.1 submission: 1.1-023 and 1.1-024, Intel Xeon 8380H 1.1-026, NVIDIA A30: 2.0-090, NVIDIA A100 (Arm): 2.0-077, NVIDIA A100 (X86): 2.0-094.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MLPerf name and logo are trademarks. See www.mlcommons.org for more information.\u200b\nNVIDIA and partners continue to show leading performance across all tests and scenarios in the latest MLPerf inference round.\nThe MLPerf benchmarks enjoy broad backing from organizations including Amazon, Arm, Baidu, Dell Technologies, Facebook, Google, Harvard, Intel, Lenovo, Microsoft, Stanford and the University of Toronto.\nMost Partners, Submissions\nThe NVIDIA AI platform again attracted the largest number of MLPerf submissions from the broadest ecosystem of partners.\nAzure followed up its solid December debut on MLPerf training tests with strong results in this round on AI inference, both using NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. Azure\u2019s ND96amsr_A100_v4 instance matched our highest performing eight-GPU submissions in nearly every inference test, demonstrating the power that\u2019s readily available from the public cloud.\nSystem makers ASUS and New H3C Information Technologies made their MLPerf debut in this round with submissions using the NVIDIA AI platform. They joined returning system makers Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Inspur Electronic Information, Lenovo, Nettrix, and Supermicro that submitted results on more than two dozen NVIDIA-Certified Systems.\nWhy MLPerf Matters\nOur partners participate in MLPerf because they know it\u2019s a valuable tool for customers evaluating AI platforms and vendors.\nMLPerf\u2019s diverse tests cover today\u2019s most popular AI workloads and scenarios. That gives users confidence the benchmarks will reflect performance they can expect across the spectrum of their jobs.\nSoftware Makes It Shine\nAll the software we used for our tests is available from the MLPerf repository.\nTwo key components that enabled our inference results \u2014 NVIDIA TensorRT for optimizing AI models and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server for deploying them efficiently \u2014 are available free on NGC, our catalog of GPU-optimized software.\nOrganizations around the world are embracing Triton, including cloud service providers such as Amazon and Microsoft.\nWe continuously fold all our optimizations into containers available on NGC. That way every user can get started putting AI into production with leading performance.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Embedded Computing | Inference | Jetson | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The new Voyager building, and more. That visit is all going into a video/ article that Alex is currently putting together. One insight that I thought needed its own piece was around NVIDIA Cedar. NVIDIA did not use the name during the GTC 2022 keynote, but this is a product OEMs can purchase from NVIDIA, and it is very interesting.\nNVIDIA Cedar Fever 1.6Tbps Modules Used in the DGX H100\nOne of the big changes in the A100 to H100 series is the switch to PCIe Gen5. With PCIe Gen5, there is enough bandwidth to transition from 200Gbps networking to 400Gbps networking. With the NVIDIA DGX H100, the company is taking a different approach with its networking, specifically, it is ditching its traditional PCIe cards in favor of modules called \u201cCedar\u201d.\nNVIDIA GTC 2022 H100 In DGX H100 Two ConnectX 7 Custom Modules With Stats\nEach Cedar module has four ConnectX-7 controllers onboard. Each provides 400Gbps of network bandwidth. There are also two of them in a DGX H100 for 2x Cedar Modules, 4x ConnectX-7 controllers per module, 400Gbps each = 3.2Tbps of fabric bandwidth. We did not find them on the ordering sheet, but the SKU sheet gives some sense of just how much bandwidth is required to run these controllers.\nNVIDIA ConnectX 7 SKUs April 2022\nIn the DGX H100, these Cedar modules have heatsinks designed to specifically cool the components while allowing airflow to the rest of the CPU and memory tray. These are then linked to the rear cages via flyover cabling that wraps around the CPUs and memory. In the rear, the DGX H100 can use direct attach copper cables (DACs), active optical cables, or standard optical modules.\nNVIDIA DGX H100 Cedar With Flyover Cables\nA quick note about the rendering. While this may look like Sapphire Rapids to many, I was told that NVIDIA has different motherboard designs for the DGX H100, and that the CPU has not been decided. I was also told that the CPU would be x86 so either Intel Sapphire Rapids or AMD Genoa, not Arm via Ampere\u2019s next-generation or NVIDIA Grace. Grace will be too late for this platform.\nIf you are wondering why not use BlueField-3 for the DGX H100, NVIDIA has that covered as well. In addition to the two Cedar modules with a combined 8x ConnectX-7 400Gbps controllers, there are two PCIe BlueField-3 controllers. Those two BlueField-3 controllers are used for tasks such as getting to storage and the user plane leaving the Cedar modules focused on the compute plane.\nFinal Words\nI asked NVIDIA why not just use standard PCIe or OCP form factor modules for the DGX H100. Using Cedar modules is largely due to space efficiency in the system since this is much more compact than adding 8x PCIe ConnectX-7 cards to the system. It also helps airflow in the DGX H100.\nNVIDIA Cedar At GTC 2022\nWhile the Cedar module may sound completely exotic, NVIDIA told me that it is \u201cbroadly available\u201d from the company\u2019s networking team for any vendor to use in systems. With the newer and next-generation of AI models the scale required is much larger and so having large amounts of bandwidth to the compute plane of AI systems is more important. That is why there are two Cedar modules in the system to provide a huge amount of bandwidth.\nPatrick With A Random Floating Black Box At NVIDIA HQ April 2022\nFor those wondering, I did not get to hold a Cedar module, but I may or may not have held two H100\u2019s including one that may or may not have been labeled the second to fail. There also may or may not be a H100 + Patrick selfie on my phone that I would be forbidden to post if it did exist. Instead, I can confirm that NVIDIA\u2019s newest building has two slick NVIDIA branded grills:\n\nSaw this smokin' hot @NVIDIA rig yesterday. \nBetween NVIDIA Voyager and Endeavor there were two Santa Maria style pits. They looked and smelled great! Check the branding! pic.twitter.com/eqJxzhNw1E\n\u2014 Patrick J Kennedy (@Patrick1Kennedy) April 8, 2022\n\nThe DGX H100 is real, but it seems like NVIDIA needs the rest of the ecosystem to catch up a bit before we see them. We expect a lot of really cool tech inside.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSCedarConnectX-7DGXH100HopperInfinibandNVIDIA \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleMikroTik CRS504-4XQ-IN A 4x 100GbE Switch at Under 45WNext articleFanless Intel J4125 4x i225 Virtualized Firewall Appliance Review Patrick Kennedyhttps://www.servethehome.comPatrick has been running STH since 2009 and covers a wide variety of SME, SMB, and SOHO IT topics.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 and AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT both launched in recent weeks with the aim of reasserting some sanity, and to an extent, they have: while they\u2019re not immune to bonkers inflation, they\u2019re still relatively affordable, with unusually plentiful stock available.\r\n\n\r\nWhich, though, is the better buy? Both are 1080p-focused cards on sale for \u00a3300 or less, both sit at the bottom of their respective GPU hierarchies (the RTX 30 series and Radeon RX 6000 series), and both support ray tracing, so let\u2019s break out the bar chart app and do some comparisons. \r\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 New PC Games For April 2022\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\r\nOnly one, of course, can be deserving of a spot on our best graphics cards list. If you haven\u2019t read the full reviews then I won\u2019t spoil which one it is, but here\u2019s a clue: it\u2019s an anagram of \u201cRTX 3005\u201d.\r\n\n\r\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3050 vs AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT: Price\r\n\n\r\nIf the RX 6500 XT has one thing going for it, it\u2019s a much clearer dedication to being a budget GPU \u2013 at least by the deeply out-of-whack standards of 2022 prices. The Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 6500 XT, the partner model I used for testing, also happens to be the lowest-priced model at \u00a3199 / $230 (a whole pound cheaper than it was yesterday!). That\u2019s not just cheaper than the thriftiest RTX 3050 variant, it\u2019s the least you have to pay for any current-generation GPU on the market.\r\n\n\r\nIndeed, the RTX 3050 starts from \u00a3270 / $325, with my test model \u2013 the MSI GeForce RTX 3050 Gaming X 8G \u2013 more like \u00a3380 / $339. The RX 6500 XT has more expensive partner cards too, but generally the RTX 3050 has been shunted much further from its original, \u00a3230 RRP. The RX 6500 XT, by contrast, can potentially be bought without getting gouged at all.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nIs anything over \u00a3150 stretching the definition of a \u201cbudget\u201d graphics card? Yes. Is there wiggle room because of the economic nightmare that\u2019s been engulfing PC hardware since 2020? Also yes. Like it or not, a return to the days of dirt-cheap but decently capable cards like the GTX 1050 Ti and Radeon RX 570 isn\u2019t coming any time soon. Mathematically, the RX 6500 XT is just the next closest thing.\r\n\n\r\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3050 vs AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT: 1080p benchmarks\r\n\n\r\nUnfortunately for the Radeon, being cheap and being good value aren\u2019t always the same thing, something that becomes apparent though its gaming performance. Alone, the RX 6500 XT\u2019s 1080p benchmark results look weak, with multiple games barely reaching 30fps on their highest graphical settings. Next to the RTX 3050, it\u2019s a massacre.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 of 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption          \n\n\n\n\n\nAttribution          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nAlright, it\u2019s close in Hitman 3\u2019s Dubai benchmark, and close-ish in Elden Ring. In everything else, the RTX 3050 wins, and not just by a couple of frames per second \u2013 by big enough margins that you can see the difference with the most disrobed of naked eyes. Forza Horizon 4 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, in particular, show how wide the speed gap can be.\r\n\nThe RPS test PC:\n\nCPU: Intel Core i5-11600K\nRAM: 16GB Corsair Vengeance LPX\nMotherboard: Asus TUF Gaming Z590-Plus WiFi\nPSU: Corsair RM850x\n\n\r\nOn average, the RTX 3050 was 37% faster than the RX 6500 XT in these tests. This might not sound all that superior when you\u2019d be paying at least 50% more for the RTX 3050, but remember that even small frame rate differences can be clearly visible at 60fps and below, where these GPUs mostly reside. That 37% difference therefore represents a very visible, tangible difference in smoothness.\r\n\n\r\nThe RX 6500 XT\u2019s pants performance is largely down to a lack of bandwidth. It has just 4GB of VRAM and can only use four PCIe lanes (of the mobo slot's available 16), while the RTX 3050 has 8GB of memory and supports eight PCIe lanes. And these results were recorded on a system that supports the PCIe 4.0 interface \u2013 when I tried the RX 6500 XT at PCIe 3.0 speeds, which most older motherboards will be limited to, frame rates dropped by as much as 50% in Metro Exodus. The RTX 3050 is naturally resistant to such drops as its own hardware isn\u2019t as short on bandwidth.\r\n\n\r\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3050 vs AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT: 1440p benchmarks\r\n\n\r\nAlthough neither of these graphics card really have 1440p in mind, it doesn\u2019t hurt to cover yourself, should you ever wish to one of the best gaming monitors with a higher resolution. One again supported by its burlier specs, the RTX 3050 extends its average performance lead to 57% at 1440p, while the RX 6500 XT is left unable to even reach playable frame rates in the Assassin\u2019s Creed series, Total War: Three Kingdoms, Watch Dogs and especially Metro Exodus.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 of 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption          \n\n\n\n\n\nAttribution          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nI don\u2019t think \u201cAh, but you could just lower the settings to reach 30fps\u201d is much of a defence for the RX 6500 XT either. The same settings tweaks would likely get these games closer to the 50-60fps range on the RTX 3050, which again, would be noticeably slicker than scraping by at 30fps. \r\n\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say more easygoing games will struggle as badly as Metro and Three Kingdoms do. Hitman 3 comes close to the 60fps mark (as well as the RTX 3050\u2019s 66fps), and 40fps in Horizon Zero Dawn isn\u2019t awful. For a more futureproofed card, though, the RTX 3050 is an obviously better choice.\r\n\n\r\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3050 vs AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT: Features\r\n\n\r\nBoth of these GPUs can deploy upscaling to improve performance. The RTX 3050 is the first Nvidia XX50 graphics card to support DLSS, while the RX 6500 XT can call upon FSR. FSR 2.0 is launching soon as well, though like the current FSR, Nvidia cards will also be able to use this in whichever games support it \u2013 cards including the RTX 3050.\r\n\n\r\nFSR is worth turning on when you\u2019re struggling, as seen in Horizon Zero Dawn, where the upscaler's Ultra Quality setting boosted the RX 6400 XT from a 40fps average at 1440p up to 50fps. DLSS is still a superior bit of tech, however, to the point where it can be worth paying more specifically for it. DLSS is capable of similarly impactful performance improvements, and because it uses a smarter form of temporal upscaling (as well as its own built-in anti-aliasing) than FSR, its upscaled results are pretty much always sharper-looking with finer detail reproduction. In some cases, DLSS on its highest quality setting can even look better than native resolution.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nDLSS also comes in extremely handy for offsetting the performance loss from ray tracing, which both GPUs support and invariably scarfs a load of frames per second in whichever games include it. In fairness, FSR can perform the same FPS damage limitation role, but with the RX 6500 XT specifically, there\u2019s so little power to begin with that enabling ray tracing is basically asking for trouble.\r\n\n\r\nThe RTX 3050 is much, much better equipped for the strain of RT effects. Since Metro Exodus supports DLSS but not FSR, I tested it with upscaling off, and at 1080p with Ultra setting and Ultra-quality ray tracing, the RTX 3050 averaged 36fps - while the RX 6500 XT only averaged 13fps. So, while both GPUs can technically put ray tracing on their features list, it\u2019s far, far more readily usable on the RTX 3050.\r\n\n\r\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3050 vs AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT: Conclusion\r\n\n\r\nI\u2019m aware of the irony in moaning about price inflation then immediately recommending the more expensive of two graphics cards. But when you look at just how much faster the RTX 3050 is at 1080p, how much better it adapts to 1440p, how much DLSS outperforms FSR, how much more comfortable it is with ray tracing\u2026 that extra money is worth it and then some. \r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nWith that advantage nullified, there\u2019s just not much else going for the RX 6500 XT. Efficiency? It is rated at a lower power usage of 107W, and only needs a 400W PSU, but then the RTX 3050\u2019s 550W requirement is hardly unreasonable even for a low-cost PC build. Thermals? This will vary from card to card anyway, and the Sapphire-made RX 6500 XT I used peaked around 61\u00b0c under load \u2013 an insignificant difference to my MSI RTX 3050, which hovered between 61\u00b0c and 63\u00b0c.\r\n\n\r\nOf these two, then, the RTX 3050 comes out the winner. As refreshing as it is to see a recent graphics card available at its true price, stretching a little further will secure you a markedly more accomplished pixel pusher.\nFor more GPU comparisons check out:\n\nNvidia GTX 1650 vs 1050 Ti\nNvidia GTX 1650 vs 1060\nNvidia GTX 1650 vs AMD RX 570\nNvidia GTX 1660 vs 1060\nNvidia GTX 1660 vs 1660 Super\nNvidia GTX 1660 vs 1660 Ti\nNvidia GTX 1660 Super vs 1060\nNvidia GTX 1660 Super vs 1660 Ti\nNvidia GTX 1660 Ti vs 1060\nNvidia GTX 1660 Ti vs 1070\nNvidia GTX 1660 Ti vs RTX 2060\nNvidia RTX 2060 vs GTX 1060\nNvidia RTX 2060 vs 2060 Super vs AMD RX 5700 vs RX 5700 XT\nNvidia RTX 2070 vs 2070 Super vs AMD RX 5700 XT\nNvidia RTX 2070 Super vs 2080 Super\nNvidia RTX 2080 vs GTX 1080\nNvidia RTX 2080 Ti vs GTX 1080 Ti\nNvidia RTX 3080 vs 2080 vs 2080 Super\nNvidia RTX 3060 Ti vs RTX 3070\nNvidia RTX 3070 vs 3080\nNvidia RTX 3080 vs 2080 Ti\nAMD RX 5600 XT vs RX 5700\nAMD RX 6800 vs RX 6800 XT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor.

It first took hold in large, well-resourced organizations before spreading over years to smaller organizations, professionals and consumers.\nSince the term \u201cAI\u201d was coined at Dartmouth University in 1956, people in this field have explored many approaches to solving the world\u2019s toughest problems. One of the most popular, deep learning, exploits data structures called neural networks that mirror how human brain cells operate.\nData scientists using deep learning configure a neural network with the parameters that work best for a particular problem, and then feed the AI up to millions of sample questions and answers. With each sample answer, the AI adjusts its neural weights until it can answer the questions on its own \u2014 even new ones it hasn\u2019t seen before.\nLearn more about the five waves of modern AI, determine which wave your organization is in and gear up for what comes next.\nThe Big Bang of AI\u00a0\nThe first wave of AI computing\u00a0was its \u201cbig bang,\u201d which started with the discovery of deep neural networks.\nThree fundamental factors fueled this explosion: academic breakthroughs in deep learning, the widespread availability of big data, and the novel application of GPUs to accelerate deep learning development and training.\nWhere computer scientists used to specify each AI instruction, algorithms can now write other algorithms, software can write software, and computers can learn on their own. This marked the beginning of the machine learning era.\nAnd over the last decade, deep learning has migrated from academia to commerce, carried by the next four waves of growth.\nThe Cloud\nThe first businesses to use AI were large tech companies with the scientific know-how and computing resources to adapt neural networks to benefit their customers. They did so using the cloud \u2014 the second wave of AI computing.\nGoogle, for example, applied deep learning to natural language processing to offer Google Translate. Facebook applied AI to identify consumer goods from images to make them shoppable. Through these types of cloud applications, Google, Amazon and Microsoft introduced many of AI\u2019s first real-world applications.\nSoon, these large tech companies created infrastructure-as-a-service platforms, unleashing the power of public clouds for enterprises and startups alike, and driving AI adoption further.\nNow, companies of all sizes rely on the cloud to get started with AI quickly and affordably. It offers an easy onramp for companies to deploy AI, allowing them to focus on developing and training models, instead of building underlying infrastructure.\nEnterprise AI\nAs tools are developed to make AI more accessible, large enterprises are embracing the technology to improve the quality, safety and efficiency of their workflows \u2014 and leading the third wave of AI computing. Data scientists in finance, healthcare, environmental services, retail, entertainment and other industries started training neural networks in their own data centers or the cloud.\nFor example, conversational AI chatbots enhance call centers, and fraud-detection AI monitors unusual activity in online marketplaces. Computer vision acts as a virtual assistant for mechanics, doctors and pilots, providing them with information to make more accurate decisions.\nWhile this wave of AI computing has widespread applications and garners headlines each week, it\u2019s just getting started. Companies are investing heavily in data scientists who can prepare data to train models and machine learning engineers who can create and automate AI training and deployment pipelines.\nThe Edge\nThe fourth wave pushes AI from the cloud or data center to the edge, to places like factories, hospitals, airports, stores, restaurants and power grids. The advent of 5G is furthering the ability for edge computing devices to be deployed and managed anywhere. It\u2019s created an explosive opportunity for AI to transform workplaces and for enterprises to realize the value of data from their end users.\nWith the adoption of IoT devices and advances in compute infrastructure, the proliferation of big data allows enterprises to create and train AI models to be deployed at the edge, where end users are located.\nThis wave requires machine learning engineers and data scientists to consider the design constraints of AI inference at the edge. Such limits include connectivity, storage, battery power, compute power and physical access for maintenance. Designs must also align with the needs of business owners, IT teams and security operations to better ensure the success of deployments.\nEdge AI is also in its early days, but already used across many industries. Computer vision monitors factory floors for safety infractions, scans medical images for anomalous growths and drives cars safely down the freeway. The potential for new applications is limitless.\nAutonomy\u00a0\nThe fifth wave of AI will be the rise of autonomy \u2014 the evolution of AI to the point where AI navigates mobile machinery without human intervention. Cars, trucks, ships, planes, drones and other robots will operate without human piloting. For this to unfold, the network connectivity of 5G, the power of accelerated computing, and continued innovation in the capabilities of neural networks are necessary.\nAutonomous AI is making headway, driven by the pandemic, global supply chain constraints and the related need for automation for efficiency in business processes. \nIncorporating domains of engineering beyond deep learning, autonomous AI requires machine learning engineers to collaborate with robotics engineers. Together, they work to fulfill the four pillars of a robotics system workflow: collecting and generating ground-truth data, creating the AI model, simulating with a digital twin and operating the robot in the real world.\nFor robotics, simulation capabilities are especially important in modeling and testing all possible corner cases to mitigate the safety risks of deploying robots in the real world.\nAutonomous machines also face novel challenges around deployment, management and security that require coordination across teams in engineering, operations, manufacturing, networking, security and compliance.\nGetting Started With AI\u00a0\nStarting with the big bang of AI, the industry has grown quickly and spawned further waves of computing, including cloud services, enterprise AI, edge AI and autonomous machines. These advancements are carrying AI from laboratories to living rooms, improving businesses and the daily lives of consumers.\nNVIDIA has spent decades building the computational products and software necessary to enable the AI ecosystem to drive these waves of growth. In addition to developing and implementing AI into the company, NVIDIA has helped countless enterprises, startups, factories, healthcare firms and more to adopt, implement and scale their own AI initiatives.\nWhether starting an initial AI project, transitioning a team into AI workloads or looking at infrastructure blueprints and expansions, set your AI projects up for success.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Data Center | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

That is likely a huge chunk of change, given that Nvidia brought in $10.6 billion in revenues for its datacenter business last year.\nSo let's get to the actual list of partners, some of which you may recognize for handling a variety of IT needs in the business world: Cambridge Computer, CDW Canada, Colfax, Deloitte Consulting, Future Tech, Insight Enterprises, Lambda, Mark III, PNY, Quantiphi and World Wide Technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're serving the largest customers in the world. They're serving, you can imagine, the largest cloud providers in the world, the largest healthcare providers in the world, the largest retailers in the world,\" said Weinstein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added that these partners also provide products and services to companies like Facebook, Walmart, and others that participate in Nvidia's twice-annual GTC event. \"Our partners are involved in every single one of those opportunities,\" Weinstein said.\nIf we're to use Nvidia's lingo, these are the winners of the 2021 Nvidia Partner Network Partner of the Year Awards and they're not solely chosen for selling large amounts of Nvidia's GPUs, systems and software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese partners are also investing a lot of their own money into building entire practices around Nvidia's products and related areas, which can mean hiring up and training employees, for instance, to build and manage AI systems and services, according to Weinstein, who said this is a primary factor in determining winners.\n\"There's an enormous amount of domain expertise that's required to serve data practitioners, data scientists, researchers, and obviously build a bridge between the IT organizations and the lines of business that are adopting these types of solutions,\" he said.\n\nNvidia outlines subscription-fueled journey to $1tr revenue\nNvidia DGX systems prone to side channel, covert attacks\nThe metaverse of fantasy worlds is itself still a fantasy\nNvidia releases $1,999, 8K-capable GeForce RTX 3090 Ti GPU\n\nWhile these partners have traditionally sold Nvidia hardware, many of them are starting to sell and manage the chip designer's software products, such as Nvidia Omniverse and Nvidia AI Enterprise, which the company has recently said are key to future revenue growth goals.\n\"We believe that our relationship and the trust between our customers and Nvidia will be because of our software,\" Weinstein said. \"Obviously, we'll provide world-class computing platforms, GPUs and networking, [plus Nvidia's upcoming Grace server CPUs]. But the material relationship between the world and Nvidia will be because of the software experience that they can have moving forward.\"\n\nThe AI key\n\nAnother important element of these partners is that they are actively collaborating with other vendors in the AI and accelerated computing space. We're thinking of companies like storage vendor NetApp, datacenter provider Equinix, virtualization giant VMware and a variety of server makers and cloud providers as examples of vendors that work with Nvidia.\n\"What we're realizing is with many large enterprise customers, multiple partners are involved in an AI accelerated computing opportunity,\" Weinstein said.\nIf you're wondering if these partners get anything from Nvidia for making such large investments into the chip designer's way of doing AI, they do. As part of the Nvidia Partner Network, partners can receive marketing dollars, rebates for products they sell, and other benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThankfully, Nvidia does not close off partners in the program from working with its rivals, according to Weinstein, which we were relieved to hear, given how the AI market is becoming more competitive thanks to companies like AMD, Intel, Graphcore, Cerebras Systems and other chip designers.\n\"It's an open ecosystem. We encourage them to deliver the appropriate solutions to their customers based on their business model,\" he said.\nAs for what Nvidia is actually recognizing these partners for, here's the overview:\n\nCambridge Computer - 2021 Americas Higher Education Partner of the Year\nCDW Canada - 2021 Canadian Partner of the Year\nColfax - 2021 Americas Networking Partner of the Year\nDeloitte Consulting - 2021 Americas Global Consulting Partner of the Year\nFuture Tech - 2021 Americas Public Sector Partner of the Year\nInsight Enterprises - 2021 Americas Software Partner of the Year\nLambda - 2021 Americas Solution Integration Partner of the Year\nMark III - 2021 Americas Rising Star Partner of the Year\nPNY - 2021 Americas Distribution Partner of the Year\nQuantiphi - 2021 Americas Service Delivery Partner of the Year\n\nOh, and World Wide Technology is apparently very special, because it won two awards: 2021 Americas AI Solution Provider of the Year and 2021 Americas Healthcare Partner of the Year. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                AI\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Datacenter\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                AI\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Datacenter\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Apple M1\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Disaster recovery\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Gemini\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Google AI\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPT-3\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPT-4\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Large Language Model\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Machine Learning\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                MCubed\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Neural Networks\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                NLP\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Open Compute Project\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                PUE\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Software defined data center\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Star Wars\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Tensor Processing Unit\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                TOPS\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                Alder Lake\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Hardware\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Self-driving Car\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                POST A COMMENT\n        \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                AI\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Datacenter\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                AI\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Datacenter\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Apple M1\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Disaster recovery\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Gemini\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Google AI\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPT-3\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPT-4\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Large Language Model\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Machine Learning\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                MCubed\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Neural Networks\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                NLP\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Open Compute Project\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                PUE\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Software defined data center\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Star Wars\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Tensor Processing Unit\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                TOPS\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                Alder Lake\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Hardware\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Self-driving Car\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNvidia won the AI training race, but inference is still anyone's game\n\nComment\u00a0When it's all abstracted by an API endpoint, do you even care what's behind the curtain?\n\nSystems12 Mar 2025 | 5\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAI bubble?

It\u2019s available in the most popular multiplayer and esports games, supported on GeForce graphics cards dating back to the 900 Series, and it takes only a single click to enable.\nThis month, the list of games has expanded to include Midnight Ghost Hunt, a new, critically acclaimed 4v4 multiplayer game. And to make the measurement of latency even easier, we\u2019ve added a new feature to GeForce Experience called NVIDIA Reflex Stats. Learn more below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex Now Available In Midnight Ghost Hunt\nPossess everyday objects as ghosts, and hunt them down as humans in Vaulted Sky Games\u2019 newPvP multiplayer game, Midnight Ghost Hunt. Lying in wait across a series of cursed locations, relentless spirits stalk the halls. Assigned to eliminate them are the Ghost Hunters, armed to the teeth with the ghoul-busting tech to banish them to another realm.

While doing so, scientists must avoid excessive pressure buildup caused by injecting CO2 into the rock, which can fracture geological formations and leak carbon into aquifers above the site, or even into the atmosphere.\nA new neural operator architecture named U-FNO simulates pressure levels during carbon storage in a fraction of a second while doubling accuracy on certain tasks, helping scientists find optimal injection rates and sites. It was unveiled this week in a study published in Advances in Water Resources, with co-authors from Stanford University, California Institute of Technology, Purdue University and NVIDIA.\nCarbon capture and storage is one of few methods that industries such as refining, cement and steel could use to decarbonize and achieve emission reduction goals. Over a hundred carbon capture and storage facilities are under construction worldwide.\nU-FNO will be used to accelerate carbon storage predictions for ExxonMobil, which funded the study.\n\u201cReservoir simulators are intensive computer models that engineers and scientists use to study multiphase flows and other complex physical phenomena in the subsurface geology of the earth,\u201d said James V. White, subsurface carbon storage manager at ExxonMobil. \u201cMachine learning techniques such as those used in this work provide a robust pathway to quantifying uncertainties in large-scale subsurface flow models such as carbon capture and sequestration and ultimately facilitate better decision-making.\u201d\nHow Carbon Storage Scientists Use Machine Learning\nScientists use carbon storage simulations to select the right injection sites and rates, control pressure buildup, maximize storage efficiency and ensure the injection activity doesn\u2019t fracture the rock formation. For a successful storage project, it\u2019s also important to understand the carbon dioxide plume \u2014 the spread of CO2 through the ground.\nTraditional simulators for carbon sequestration are time-consuming and computationally expensive. Machine learning models provide similar accuracy levels while dramatically shrinking the time and costs required.\nBased on the U-Net neural network and Fourier neural operator architecture, known as FNO, U-FNO provides more accurate predictions of gas saturation and pressure buildup. Compared to using a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network for the task, U-FNO is twice as accurate while requiring just a third of the training data.\n\u201cOur machine learning method for scientific modeling is fundamentally different from standard neural networks, where we typically work with images of a fixed resolution,\u201d said paper co-author Anima Anandkumar, director of machine learning research at NVIDIA and Bren professor in the Computing + Mathematical Sciences Department at Caltech. \u201cIn scientific modeling, we have varying resolutions depending on how and where we sample. Our model can generalize well across different resolutions without the need for re-training, achieving enormous speedups.\u201d\nTrained U-FNO models are available in a web application to provide real-time predictions for carbon storage projects.\n\u201cRecent innovations in AI, with techniques such as FNOs, can accelerate computations by orders of magnitude, taking an important step in helping scale carbon capture and storage technologies,\u201d said Ranveer Chandra, managing director of research for industry at Microsoft and collaborator on the Northern Lights initiative, a full-scale carbon capture and storage project in Norway. \u201cOur model-parallel FNO can scale to realistic 3D problem sizes using the distributed memory of many NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs.\u201d\nNovel Neural Operators Accelerate CO2 Storage Predictions\u00a0\nU-FNO enables scientists to simulate how pressure levels will build up and where CO2 will spread throughout the 30 years of injection. GPU acceleration with U-FNO makes it possible to run these 30-year simulations in a hundredth of a second on a single NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU, instead of 10 minutes using traditional methods.\nWith GPU-accelerated machine learning, researchers can now also rapidly simulate many injection locations. Without this tool, choosing sites is like a shot in the dark.\nThe U-FNO model focuses on modeling plume migration and pressure during the injection process \u2014 when there\u2019s the highest risk of overshooting the amount of CO2 injected. It was developed using NVIDIA A100 GPUs in the Sherlock computing cluster at Stanford.\n\u201cFor net zero to be achievable, we will need low-emission energy sources as well as\u00a0 negative-emissions technologies, such as carbon capture and storage,\u201d said Farah Hariri, a collaborator on U-FNO and technical lead on climate change mitigation projects for NVIDIA\u2019s Earth-2, which will be the world\u2019s first AI digital twin supercomputer. \u201cBy applying Fourier neural operators to carbon storage, we showed how AI can help accelerate the process of climate change mitigation. Earth-2 will leverage those techniques.\u201d\nRead more about U-FNO on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\nEarth-2 will use FNO-like models to tackle challenges in climate science and contribute to global climate change mitigation efforts.

But innovative startups worldwide are lighting the way, demonstrating how these daunting challenges can be better understood and addressed with AI.\nHere\u2019s how five \u2014 all among the 10,000+ members of NVIDIA Inception, a program designed to nurture cutting-edge startups \u2014 are looking out for the environment using NVIDIA-accelerated applications:\nBlue Sky Analytics Builds Cloud Platform for Climate Action\nIndia-based Blue Sky Analytics is building a geospatial intelligence platform that harnesses satellite data for environmental monitoring and climate risk assessment. The company provides developers with climate datasets to analyze air quality and estimate greenhouse gas emissions from fires\u00a0 \u2014 with additional datasets in the works to forecast future biomass fires and monitor water capacity in lakes, rivers and glacial melts.\nThe company uses cloud-based NVIDIA GPUs to power its work. It\u2019s a founding member of Climate TRACE, a global coalition led by Al Gore that aims to provide high-resolution global greenhouse gas emissions data in near real time. The startup leads Climate TRACE\u2019s work examining how land use and land cover change due to fires.\nRhions Lab Protects Wildlife With Computer Vision\nKenya-based Rhions Lab uses AI to tackle challenges to biodiversity, including human-wildlife conflict, poaching and illegal wildlife trafficking. The company is adopting NVIDIA Jetson Nano modules for AI at the edge to support its conservation projects.\nOne of the company\u2019s projects, Xoome, is an AI-powered camera trap that identifies wild animals, vehicles and civilians \u2014 sending alerts of poaching threats to on-duty wildlife rangers. Another initiative monitors beekeepers\u2019 colonies with a range of sensors that capture acoustic data, vibrations, temperature and humidity within beehives. The platform can help beekeepers monitor bee colony health and fend off threats from thieves, whether honey badgers or humans.\nTrueOcean Predicts Undersea Carbon Capture and Storage\nGerman startup TrueOcean analyzes global-scale maritime data to inform innovation around natural ocean carbon sinks, renewable energy and shipping route optimization. The company is using AI to predict and quantify carbon absorption and storage in seagrass meadows and subsea geology. This makes it possible to greatly increase the carbon storage potential of Earth\u2019s oceans.\nTrueOcean uses AI solutions, including federated learning accelerated on NVIDIA DGX A100 systems, to help scientists predict, monitor and manage these sequestration efforts.\nASTERRA Saves Water With GPU-Accelerated Leak Detection\nASTERRA, based in Israel, has developed AI models that analyze satellite images to answer critical questions around water infrastructure. It\u2019s equipping maintenance workers and engineers with the insights needed to find deficient water pipelines, assess underground moisture and locate leaks. The company uses NVIDIA GPUs through Amazon Web Services to develop and run its machine learning algorithms.\nSince deploying its leak detection solution in 2016, ASTERRA has helped the water industry identify tens of thousands of leaks, conserving billions of gallons of drinkable water each year. Stopping leaks prevents ground pollution, reduces water wastage and even saves power. The company estimates its solution has reduced the water industry\u2019s energy use by more than 420,000 megawatt hours since its launch.\nNeu.ro Launches Renewable Energy-Powered AI Cloud\nAnother way to make a difference is by decreasing the carbon footprint of training AI models.\nTo help address this challenge, San Francisco-based Inception startup Neu.ro launched an NVIDIA DGX A100-powered AI cloud that\u2019s powered entirely by geothermal and hydropower, with free-air cooling. Located in Iceland, the data center is being used for AI applications in telecommunications, retail, finance and healthcare.\nThe company has also developed a Green AI suite to help businesses monitor the environmental impact of AI projects, allowing developer teams to optimize compute usage to balance performance with carbon footprint.\nLearn more about how GPU technology drives applications with social impact, including environmental projects. AI, data science and HPC startups can apply to join NVIDIA Inception.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Aerospace | Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Inception | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The full-size luxury sedan is the first production vehicle built on the NIO Adam supercomputer, powered by four NVIDIA DRIVE Orin systems-on-a-chip (SoCs).\nThe production launch of its flagship sedan follows a blockbuster year for NIO. In 2021, the EV maker delivered 91,429 vehicles, more than quadrupling sales from 2019.\nThe software-defined ET7 bounds past current model capabilities, boasting more than 620 miles of battery range and an impressive 0-to-60 mph in under 4 seconds.\nWith the DRIVE Orin-powered Adam, the ET7\u2019s centralized, high-performance compute architecture powers advanced AI features and allows continuous over-the-air upgrades. As a result, the intelligent vehicle redefines the customer experience, with an AI-enhanced cockpit and point-to-point autonomous driving capabilities.\nSensors on the bottom of the sleek ET7 detect the road surface in real time so the vehicle can automatically adjust the suspension, creating a smoother, more luxurious ride.\nThe opulent interior and immersive augmented reality digital cockpit inside the sedan interact with the driver through voice recognition and driver monitoring. The sedan comes standard with over 100 configurations for comfort, safety and smart technologies.\nPeak Performance\nThe ET7 outperforms in both drive quality and AI compute.\nThe NIO Adam supercomputer is one of the most powerful platforms to run in a vehicle, achieving more than 1,000 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of performance.\n\nAt its core is DRIVE Orin, the world\u2019s most advanced autonomous vehicle processor. It delivers up to 254 TOPS to simultaneously run a high number of deep neural networks and applications while achieving systematic safety standards such as ISO 26262 ASIL-D.\nBy integrating multiple DRIVE Orin SoCs, Adam meets the diversity and redundancies necessary for safe autonomous operation.\nOn the Horizon\nFollowing the start of ET7 deliveries, NIO is slated to launch a mid-sized performance sedan, the ET5 \u2014 also built on the Adam supercomputer \u2014 in September.\nNIO plans to enter global markets with the ET7 in Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Netherlands later this year. With a goal of bringing one of the most advanced AI platforms to more customers, NIO intends to have vehicle offerings in 25 countries and regions by 2025.\nWith the ET7 now entering the market, customers can enjoy a software-defined experience that\u2019s as fast as it is luxurious.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Researchers unearthed trends in Hubble data on 25 of them using a supercomputer with NVIDIA GPUs.\t\t\t\n\n\nApril 25, 2022 by Rick Merritt \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  A paper released today describes in the greatest detail to date the atmospheres on distant planets.\nSeeking the origins of what\u2019s in and beyond the Milky Way, researchers surveyed 25 exoplanets, bodies that orbit stars far beyond our solar system. Specifically, they studied hot Jupiters, the largest and thus easiest to detect exoplanets, many sweltering at temperatures over 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.\nTheir analysis of these torrid atmospheres used high performance computing with NVIDIA GPUs to advance understanding of all planets, including our own.\nHot Jupiters Shine New Lights\nHot Jupiters \u201coffer an incredible opportunity to study physics in environmental conditions nearly impossible to reproduce on Earth,\u201d said Quentin Changeat, lead author of the paper and a research fellow at University College London (UCL).\nBy analyzing trends across a large group of exoplanets, they shine new light on big questions.\n\u201cThis work can help make better models of how the Earth and other planets came to be,\u201d said Ahmed F. Al-Refaie, a co-author of the paper and head of numerical methods at the UCL Centre for Space Exochemistry Data.\nParsing Hubble\u2019s Big Data\nThey used the most data ever employed in a survey of exoplanets \u2014 1,000 hours of archival observations, mainly from the Hubble Space Telescope.\nThe hardest and, for Changeat, the most fascinating part of the process was determining what small set of models to run in a consistent way against data from all 25 exoplanets to get the most reliable and revealing results.\n\u201cThere was an amazing period of exploration \u2014 I was finding all kinds of sometimes weird solutions \u2014 but it was really fast to get the answers using NVIDIA GPUs,\u201d he said.\nMillions of Calculations\nTheir overall results required heady math. Each of about 20 models had to run 250,000 times for all 25 exoplanets.\nThey used the Wilkes3 supercomputer at the University of Cambridge, which packs 320 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs on an NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand network.\n\u201cI expected the A100s might be double the performance of V100s and P100s I used previously, but honestly it was like an order of magnitude difference,\u201d said Al-Refaie.\nOrders of Magnitude Gains\nA single A100 GPU gave a 200x performance boost compared to a CPU.\nPacking 32 processes on each GPU, the team got the equivalent of a 6,400x speedup compared to a CPU. Each node on Wilkes3 delivered with its four A100s the equivalent of up to 25,600 CPU cores, he said.\nThe speedups are high because their application is amazingly parallel. It simulates on GPUs how hundreds of thousands of light wavelengths would travel through an exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere\nOn A100s, their models complete in minutes work that would require weeks on CPUs.\nThe GPUs ran the complex physics models so fast that their bottleneck became a CPU-based system handling a much simpler task of determining statistically where to explore next.\n\u201cIt was a little funny, and somewhat astounding, that simulating the atmosphere was not the hard part \u2014 that gave us an ability to really see what was in the data,\u201d he said.\nA Wealth of Software\nAl-Refaie employed CUDA profilers to optimize jobs, PyCUDA to optimize the team\u2019s code and cuBlas to speed up some math routines.\n\u201cWith all the NVIDIA software available, there\u2019s a wealth of things you can exploit, so the team is starting to spit out papers quickly now because we have the right tools,\u201d he said.\nThey will need all the help they can get, as the work is poised to get much more challenging.\nGetting a Better Telescope\nThe James Webb Space Telescope comes online in June. Unlike Hubble and all previous instruments, it\u2019s specifically geared to observe exoplanets.\nThe team is already developing ways to work at higher resolutions to accommodate the expected data. For example, instead of using one-dimensional models, they will use two- or three-dimensional ones and account for more parameters like changes over time.\n\u201cIf a planet has a storm, for example, we may not be able to see it with current data, but with the next generation data, we think we will,\u201d said Changeat.\nExploring HPC+AI\nThe rising tide of data opens a door to apply deep learning, something the group\u2019s AI experts are exploring.\nIt\u2019s an exciting time, said Changeat, who\u2019s joining the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore as an ESA fellow to work directly with experts and engineers there.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really fun working with experts from many fields. We had space observers, data analysts, machine-learning and software experts on this team \u2014 that\u2019s what made this paper possible,\u201d Changeat said.\nLearn more about the paper here.\nImage at top courtesy of ESA/Hubble, N.

These were all simulated in a true-to-reality virtual world by nearly two dozen NVIDIA artists and freelancers across the globe using NVIDIA Omniverse, a 3D design collaboration and world simulation platform.\nThe final scene \u2014 consisting of over 22 million triangles, 350 unique textured models and 3,000 4K-resolution texture maps \u2014 welcomes viewers into a virtual ramen shop featured in last month\u2019s GTC keynote address by NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nThe mouth-watering demo was created to highlight the NVIDIA RTX-powered real-time rendering and physics simulation capabilities of Omniverse, which scales performance and speed when running on multiple GPUs.\nIt\u2019s a feast for the eyes, as all of the demo\u2019s parts are physically accurate and photorealistic, from the kitchen appliances and order slips; to the shoyu ramen and chashu pork; to the stains on the pots and pans.\n\u201cOur team members were hungry just looking at the renders,\u201d said Andrew Averkin, senior art manager and lead environment artist at NVIDIA, in a GTC session offering a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the Omniverse ramen shop.\nThe session \u2014 presented by Averkin and Gabriele Leone, senior art director at NVIDIA \u2014 is now available on demand.\nGathering the Ingredients for Reference\nThe team\u2019s first step was to gather the artistic ingredients: visual references on which to base the 3D models and props for the scene.\nAn NVIDIA artist traveled to a real ramen restaurant in Tokyo and collected over 2,000 high-resolution reference images and videos, each capturing aspects from the kitchen\u2019s distinct areas for cooking, cleaning, food preparation and storage.\nThen, props artists modeled and textured 3D assets for all of the shop\u2019s items, from the stoves and fridges to gas pipes and power plugs. Even the nutrition labels on bottled drinks and the buttons for the ticket machine from which visitors order meals were precisely replicated.\nDrinks in a fridge at the virtual ramen shop, made using Omniverse Create, Adobe Substance 3D Painter, Autodesk 3ds Max, Blender, Maxon Cinema 4D, and RizomUV.\nIn just two months, NVIDIA artists across the world modeled 350 unique props for the scene, using a range of design software including Autodesk Maya, Autodesk 3ds Max, Blender, Maxon Cinema 4D and Zbrush. Omniverse Connectors and Pixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description format enabled the models to be seamlessly brought into the Omniverse Create app.\n\u201cThe best way to think about Omniverse Create is to consider it a world-building tool,\u201d Leone said. \u201cIt works with Omniverse Connectors, which allow artists to use whichever third-party apps they\u2019re familiar with and connect their work seamlessly in Omniverse \u2014 taking creativity and experimentation to new levels.\u201d\nAdding Lighting and Texture Garnishes\u00a0\nArtists then used Adobe Substance Painter to texture the materials. To make the props look used on a daily basis, the team whipped up details like dents on wooden counters, stickers peeling off appliances and sauce stains on pots.\n\u201cSome of our artists went as far as cooking some of the recipes themselves and taking references of their own pots to get a good idea of how sauce or burn stains might accumulate,\u201d Averkin said.\nOmniverse\u2019s simulation capabilities enable light to reflect off of glass and other materials with true-to-reality physical accuracy. Plus, real-time photorealistic lighting rendered in 4K resolution created an orange warmth inside the cozy virtual shop, contrasting the rainy atmosphere that can be seen through the windows.\nArtists used Omniverse Flow, a fluid simulation Omniverse Extension for smoke and fire, to bring the restaurant\u2019s burning stoves and steaming plates to life. SideFX Houdini software helped to animate the boiling water, which was eventually brought into the virtual kitchen using an Omniverse Connector.\nBroth boils in the virtual kitchen using visual effects offered by Houdini software.\nAnd Omniverse Create\u2019s camera animation feature allowed the artists to capture the final path-traced scene in real time, exactly as observed through the viewport.\nPhotorealistic lighting illuminates the virtual ramen shop, enabled by NVIDIA RTX-based ray tracing and path tracing.\nLearn more about Omniverse by watching additional GTC sessions on demand \u2014 featuring visionaries from the Omniverse team, Adobe, Autodesk, Epic Games, Pixar, Unity and Walt Disney Studios.\nJoin In on the Creation\nCreators across the world can download NVIDIA Omniverse for free, and enterprise teams can use the platform for their 3D projects.\nJoin the #MadeInMachinima contest, running through June 27, for a chance to win the latest NVIDIA Studio laptop.\nConnect your workflows to Omniverse with software from Adobe, Autodesk, Epic Games, Maxon, Reallusion and more.\nFollow Omniverse on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and Medium for additional resources and inspiration.

Adapted from Frank Herbert\u2019s 1965 novel of the same name, Dune tells the story of Paul Atreides, a heroic character whose family travels to the dangerous planet of Arrakis.\nTo bring the story to life, now seven-time Academy Award-winning studio DNEG used a blend of practical and visual effects, creating spectacular graphics that capture the dystopian worlds of Dune.\nThe film\u2019s production visual effects supervisor, Paul Lambert, said that his focus was on seamlessly augmenting or enhancing what was already accomplished with the beautiful production design and cinematography \u2014 grounding the visual effects in reality. DNEG contributed to 28 sequences and over 1,000 VFX shots in the film, and the artists worked from multiple locations using NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstations.\nA Mix of Sand and Simulations\nSand, inevitably, was going to play a major part in Dune, and 18 tons of it were used to make the film. But the VFX team also digitally replicated every aspect of it to perfectly blend simulated sand into the shots.\n\u201cOne of the things we came up against early on was getting that essence of scale,\u201d said Paul Salvini, global CTO of DNEG. \u201cIn simulations, each grain of sand is literally the size of a pixel, which means we needed huge volumes of sand, and that turned into petabytes of data.\u201d\nAll imagery courtesy of DNEG.\nBeyond replicating the look and feel of sand, the team needed to realistically capture its movement. This became even more challenging when it came to finding a way to depict massive sandworms moving through the desert.\nThe artists spent months building, modeling and sculpting the creature into shape. They took inspiration from baleen whales \u2014 months of research revealed that when a colossal object moves through sand, the environment around it behaves like water, similar to how a whale moves through the ocean.\nDNEG then simulated each sand particle to see how it would cascade off a sandworm, or how the dunes would ripple as the creature moved around. For the latter, the practical effects team created a sand-displacement effect by placing a vibrating metal plate under real sand, and the VFX team expanded it to simulate the effect on a much larger scale.\n\u201cIt\u2019s tricky to do, because it\u2019s super complex and computationally expensive to figure out how one grain of sand is connected to another grain \u2014 and have all of this act on a massive scale,\u201d said Salvini. \u201cIt was an iterative process, and it takes a long time to actually simulate all of these particles.\u201d\nDNEG used a combination of Dell Precision workstations and Dell PowerEdge R740 servers with NVIDIA RTX and server GPUs to iterate quickly and make changes, ensuring the simulations with the sandworm looked realistic.\nTo add more realism to the creature, the artists looked to the bristly teeth of baleen whales. The VFX team modeled different versions of the teeth and used a scattering system in the Houdini app, which allowed them to populate the worm\u2019s mouth at render time.\nUsing Isotropix Clarisse and NVIDIA RTX, DNEG artists rendered graphics in hours instead of days. This allowed them to receive feedback on the visuals nearly instantly. It also helped increase their number of iterations, enabling final shots and high-quality images at a much quicker pace.\n\nEnhancing Production Workflows With Virtualization\nDNEG was one of the first studios to implement NVIDIA virtual GPUs at scale with NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation software. NVIDIA RTX-powered virtual workstations deliver incredible flexibility, allowing DNEG to adjust the number of users on a particular server based on the current workload.\nVirtual machines are also cost effective. As newer GPUs and expanded software packages enter the data center, DNEG can deploy these to its users to maintain optimal performance for each artist.\n\u201cTo give our artists more compute power, we can easily increase NVIDIA vGPU profile sizes and reduce the number of users we put on each server,\u201d said Daire Byrne, global head of systems at DNEG. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to replace any equipment to keep working with maximum performance.\u201d\nAnd because creators can securely log into RTX-powered virtual workstations from anywhere in the world, DNEG artists can work remotely, while still maintaining high productivity.\n\u201cEvery show we get is different from the last, and NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstations let us scale the memory and performance characteristics up or down to meet the needs of our artists,\u201d said Byrne.\n\nLiving in the Future of Virtual Worlds\nDNEG continues its pioneering work with NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise as the studio looks to the future of connected, collaborative workflows.\n\u201cThe virtual world is where filmmaking is going,\u201d said Salvini. \u201cWe now have advanced tools and technologies that are capable of delivering photorealistic virtual environments and digital characters, allowing us to create incredible, beautiful stylized worlds.\u201d\nWith the shift toward real-time technology and more seamless, collaborative content creation pipelines, DNEG sees greater opportunities to interact with the filmmakers and art teams across the globe. This will allow for many more iterations to accomplish artistic goals in a fraction of the time.\nDNEG uses Omniverse Enterprise with Dell Precision workstations with NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs, and Dell PowerEdge R7525 servers with NVIDIA A40 GPUs.\nLearn more about how DNEG is transforming global film production workflows in the studio\u2019s GTC session, now available on demand.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: Media and Entertainment | NVIDIA RTX | Simulation and Design | Virtualization \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It landed FDA clearance last month, one of the first to get such a go-ahead for dentistry AI.\nThe approval paves the way for its use in clinics across the United States.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a first of its kind for dentistry,\u201d said Ophir Tanz, co-founder and CEO of Pearl. \u201cBut we also have similar regulatory approvals across 50 countries globally.\u201d\nPearl\u2019s software platform, available in the cloud as a service, enables dentists to run real-time screening of X-rays. Dentists can then review the AI findings and share them with patients to facilitate informed dentist-patient discussions about diagnosis and treatment planning.\nBehind the scenes, NVIDIA GPU-driven convolutional neural networks developed by Pearl can spot not just tooth decay but many other dental issues, like cracked crowns and root abscess requiring a root canal.\nPearl\u2019s AI offers dentist results. The startup\u2019s FDA application showed that on average Pearl AI was capable of spotting 36 percent more pathologies and other dental issues than an average dentist. \u201cAnd that\u2019s important because in dentistry it\u2019s extremely common and routine to miss a pathology,\u201d said Tanz.\nThe company\u2019s products include its Practice Intelligence, which enables dental practices to run AI on patient data to discover missed diagnoses and treatment opportunities. Pearl Protect can help screen for dental insurance fraud, waste and abuse, while Claims Review offers automated claims examination.\nPearl, founded in 2019, is a member of the NVIDIA Inception startup program, which provided it access to Deep Learning Institute courses, NVIDIA Developer Forums and technical workshops.\nHatching Dental AI\nThe son of a dentist, Tanz has a mouthful of a founding tale. The entrepreneur decided to pursue AI for dental radiology after talking shop on a visit with his dentist. A partner at the practice liked the idea so much he jumped on board as a co-founder.\n\nPearl co-founders Cambron Carter, Kyle Stanley and Ophir Tanz (left to right)\nTanz, who founded tech unicorn GumGum for AI to analyze images, video and text for better contextual advertising, was joined by GumGum colleague Cambron Carter, now CTO and co-founder at Pearl. Dentist Kyle Stanley, co-founder and chief clinical officer, rounds out the trio with clinical experience.\nPearl\u2019s founders targeted a host of conditions commonly addressed in dental clinics. They labeled more than a million images to help train their proprietary CNN models, running on NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs in the cloud, to identify issues. Before that they had prototyped on local NVIDIA-powered workstations.\nInference is done on cloud-based GPUs, where Pearl\u2019s system synchronizes with the dentist\u2019s real-time and historial radiology data. \u201cThe dental vertical is still undergoing a transition to the cloud, and now we\u2019re bringing them AI in the cloud \u2014 we represent a wave of technology that will propel the field of dentistry into the future,\u201d said Carter.\nGetting FDA approval wasn\u2019t easy, he said. It required completing an expansive clinical trial. Pearl submitted four studies, each involving thousands of X-rays and over 80 expert dentists and radiologists.\nGetting Second Opinion for Diagnosis\nPearl offers dentists a product called Second Opinion to aid in the detection of disease in radiography. Second Opinion can identify dozens of conditions to help validate dentist\u2019s findings, according to Tanz.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only company in the world that is able to diagnose pathology and detect disease in an AI-driven manner in the dental practice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re driving a much more comprehensive diagnosis, and it\u2019s a diagnostic aid for general practitioners.\u201d\nSecond Opinion is taking root in clinics. Sage Dental, which has more than 60 offices across the East Coast, is a customer. Dental 365 is a customer with more than 60 offices in the region as well.\n\u201cSecond Opinion is an extremely important tool for the future of dentistry,\u201d said Cindy Roark, chief clinical officer at Sage. \u201cDentistry has needed consistency for a very long time. Diagnosis is highly variable, and variability leads to confusion and distrust from patients.\u201d\nBoosting Doctor-Patient Rapport\u00a0\nDentists review X-rays while patients are in the chair, pointing out any issues as they go. Even for experienced dentists, making sense of the grayscale imagery that forms the basis of most treatment plans can be challenging \u2014 only compounded by the many demands on their attention throughout a busy day juggling patients.\nFor patients, comprehending the indistinct gradations in X-rays that separate healthy tooth structures from unhealthy ones is even harder.\n\nBut with AI-aided images, dentists are able to present areas of concern outlined by simple, digestible bounding boxes. This ensures that their treatment plans have a sound basis, while providing patients with a much clearer picture of what exactly is going on in their X-rays.\n\u201cYou\u2019re able to have a highly visual sort of discussion and paint a visual narrative for patients so that they really start to understand what is going on in their mouth,\u201d said Dr. Stanley.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | GPU | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Pensando technology competes with the digital processing units (DPU) Intel and Nvidia make for smartNICs.\nEnterprises like Pensando customer Goldman Sachs use smartNICs with processors that can offload telemetry, security, storage and networking services from a server's CPU. The architecture dedicates more CPU power to run applications that drive an enterprise's business.\nAlso, the architecture provides software-defined centralized control of the services. That is \"hugely important for ensuring operational efficiency,\" said Bob Laliberte, a senior analyst with Enterprise Strategy Group.\nAMD is a longtime provider of server CPUs, so the acquisition could help Pensando accelerate growth in its core business and allow it to pursue a much larger customer base across more markets, Pensando CEO Prem Jain said in a statement.\nThe Pensando packet processor uses an ARM core to control and supervise packet paths while allowing smartNIC manufacturers to use the specialized P4 programming language to tailor the data plane for customers' use cases.\n\n\n\nThe Pensando DSC-100 Distributed Services Card delivers software-defined services for public and private clouds.\n \n\n\n\n\nIntel started pursuing a similar technique with the 2019 acquisition of Barefoot Networks, a chipmaker for switches. Nvidia's smartNIC technology is the programmable BlueField DPU. The company has partnered with VMware to deliver its ESXi hypervisor on BlueField.\nDistributing services in smartNICs to boost application performance started with public cloud providers like AWS and Microsoft Azure. AMD, Intel and Nvidia want to work with enterprises that plan to mimic the architecture in their private clouds.\n\"What you get with the likes of Pensando is a building block that alters the way people have traditionally built infrastructure for 30 years,\" Ashish Nadkarni, group vice president at IDC's infrastructure practice, said.\nPensando, Intel and Nvidia each approach DPUs from a different perspective, Nadkarni said. Pensando, founded by former Cisco CEO John Chambers, leans toward networking, Nvidia artificial intelligence, and Intel machine learning and real-time network telemetry.\n\n\n\n   What you get with the likes of Pensando is a building block that alters the way people have traditionally built infrastructure for 30 years.\n  \n\nAshish NadkarniGroup vice president, IDC\n  \n\n\n\nThe \"low-hanging fruit\" for enterprises today is to use smartNICs to gather and analyze telemetry to measure what's happening in a network, said Silvano Gai, a Pensando Systems fellow and author of Building a Future-Proof Cloud Infrastructure from Pearson, in a recent interview.\nAnother useful purpose with low overhead is distributing network taps, which are external monitoring devices that mirror traffic between two network nodes, according to Gai. Tap-makers design them, so they don't impede production traffic flow.\nWith Pensando, AMD has the option of offering a distributed services platform that enterprises can deploy with minimal disruption to their data center servers, ESG's Laliberte said.\nLast year, Aruba, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company, launched the CX 10000 Series of top-of-rack switches, including the Pensando platform. The hardware delivers distributed networking and security services without replacing servers or adding smartNICs.\nAs a result, the option isn't disruptive to existing data centers because \"you're not going in and ripping open a server,\" Laliberte said.\nEnterprise Strategy Group is a division of TechTarget.\nAntone Gonsalves is the news director for the Networking Media Group. He has deep and wide experience in tech journalism. Since the mid-1990s, he has worked for UBM's\u00a0InformationWeek, TechWeb and\u00a0Computer Reseller News. He has also written for Ziff Davis'\u00a0PC Week, IDG's CSOonline and IBTMedia's CruxialCIO, and rounded all of that out by covering startups for Bloomberg News. He started his journalism career at United Press International, working as a reporter and editor in California, Texas, Kansas and Florida.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRelated Resources\n\n\nAutomating AWS Cloud Infrastructure with Itential\n\u2013Talk\n\n\nIPv6 Enhanced Innovation: the IPv6-Only Future in the 5G, IoT & Cloud Era, 2/2\n\u2013Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDig Deeper on Cloud and data center networking\n\n\n\nWhat is Nvidia?\n\n\n\n\nBy: Gavin\u00a0Wright\n\n\n\n\nCisco launches Smart Switches with AMD DPUs for security\n\n\n\n\nBy: Antone\u00a0Gonsalves\n\n\n\n\nIntel, AMD form x86 group in effort to combat Arm\n\n\n\n\nBy: Adam\u00a0Armstrong\n\n\n\n\nAMD acquires ZT Systems for $5B to take on Nvidia in AI race\n\n\n\n\nBy: Antone\u00a0Gonsalves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored News\n\n\nFlexible IT: When Performance and Security Can\u2019t Be Compromised\n\u2013Dell Technologies\n\n\nHow AI and the Data Center Streamlines Business Processes\n\u2013HPE & Intel\n\n\nThe Future of Private AI: How Industries Take Advantage of AI\n\u2013Equinix\n\nSee More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRelated Content\n\n\nAMD (Advanced Micro Devices)\n\u2013 Search IT Operations\n\n\nIntel's data center strategy rests on accelerator ...\n\u2013 Search Networking\n\n\nAMD acquires ZT Systems for $5B to take on Nvidia in ...\n\u2013 Search Data Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest TechTarget resources\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUnified Communications\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMobile Computing\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Center\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIT Channel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Unified Communications\n\n\n\n\nCisco makes Webex AI updates widely available\nThe Cisco AI Assistant in Webex Contact Center and the Webex AI Agent for self-service customer support are now generally ...\n\n\n\nMicrosoft takes Teams Phone to Dynamics 365 Contact Center\nMicrosoft's updates for Teams Phone include Dynamics 365 Contact Center integration and Copilot features to improve customer ...\n\n\n\nZoom advances AI Companion with agentic AI\nZoom's AI Companion improvements include automated tasks, better action item detection and real-time note taking.

Epic\u2019s Fortnite bathes its environments in ray-traced sunlight, simulating how light bounces in the real world. And artists at Lucasfilm revolutionized virtual production techniques in The Mandalorian, using synchronized NVIDIA RTX GPUs to drive pixels on LED walls that act as photoreal backdrops.\nIn the eight years since Epic Games launched Unreal Engine 4, graphics has evolved at an unprecedented rate. UE4\u2019s advances in world-building, animation, lighting and simulation enabled creators to bring to life environments only hinted at in the past.\nIn that same time, NVIDIA produced the optimal GPUs, libraries and APIs for supporting the new features the engine introduced. Tens of thousands of developers have enjoyed the benefits of pairing Unreal Engine with NVIDIA technology. That support continues with today\u2019s debut of Unreal Engine 5.\nEpic and NVIDIA: Building the Future of Graphics\nFrom the launch of the GeForce GTX 680 in 2012 to the recent release of the RTX 30 Series, NVIDIA has supported UE4 developers in their quest to stay on the bleeding edge of technology.\nAt Game Developers Conference 2013, Epic showed off what Unreal Engine 4 could do on a single GTX 680 with their \u201cInfiltrator\u201d demo. The big rendering advances in that demo were a physically-based rendering pipeline, a groundbreaking temporal anti-aliasing solution, and a lighting solution that mixed the best of precomputed and dynamic lighting. It would be one of many times Unreal Engine and NVIDIA raised the bar.\n\nIn 2015, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang appeared as a surprise guest at an Epic Games event to announce the GTX TITAN X. Onstage, Tim Sweeney was given the very first GTX TITAN X off the production line. It\u2019s a moment in tech history that\u2019s still discussed today.\n\nAt GDC 2018, the development community got their first look at real-time ray tracing running in UE4 with the reveal of \u201cReflections,\u201d a Star Wars short video. The results were so convincing you\u2019d have been forgiven for thinking the clip was pulled directly out of a J.J. Abrams movie.\nTextured area lights, ray-traced area light shadows, reflections, and cinematic depth of field all combined to create a sequence that redefined what was possible with real-time graphics. It was shown on a NVIDIA DGX workstation powered by four Volta architecture GPUs.\nLater in the year at GamesCom, that same demo was shown running on one consumer-grade GeForce RTX graphics card, thanks to the Turing architecture\u2019s RT Cores, which greatly accelerate ray-tracing performance.\n\nIn 2019, Unreal Engine debuted a short called \u201cTroll\u201d (from Goodbye Kansas and Deep Forest Films), running on a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. It showed what could be done with complex soft shadows and reflections. The short broke ground by rendering convincing human faces in real time, capturing a broad range of emotional states.\n\nEpic and NVIDIA sponsored three installments in the DXR Spotlight Contest, which showed that even one-person teams could achieve remarkable results with DXR, Unreal Engine 4 and NVIDIA GeForce RTX.\nOne standout was \u201cAttack from Outer Space,\u201d a video demo developed solely by artist Christian Hecht.\n\nToday, Epic debuts Unreal Engine 5. This launch introduces Nanite and Lumen, which enables developers to create games and apps that contain massive amounts of geometric detail with fully dynamic global illumination.\nNanite enables film-quality source art consisting of billions of polygons to be directly imported into Unreal Engine \u2014 all while maintaining a real-time frame rate and without sacrificing fidelity.\nWith Lumen, developers can create more dynamic scenes where indirect lighting adapts on the fly, such as changing the sun angle with the time of day, turning on a flashlight or opening an exterior door. Lumen removes the need for authoring lightmap UVs, waiting for lightmaps to bake or placing reflection captures, which results in crucial time savings in the development process.\nNVIDIA is supporting Unreal Engine 5 with plugins for key technologies, including Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), NVIDIA Reflex and RTX Global Illumination.\nDLSS taps into the power of a deep learning neural network to boost frame rates and generate beautiful, sharp images. Reflex aligns CPU work to complete just in time for the GPU to start processing, minimizing latency and improving system responsiveness. RTX Global illumination computes multibounce indirect lighting without bake times, light leaks or expensive per-frame costs.\nYou can see DLSS and Reflex in action on Unreal Engine 5 by playing Epic\u2019s Fortnite on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX-powered PC.\nNVIDIA Ominiverse is the ideal companion to the next generation of Unreal Engine. The platform enables artists and developers to connect their 3D design tools for more collaborative workflows, build their own tools for 3D worlds, and use NVIDIA AI technologies. The Unreal Engine Connector enables creators and developers to achieve live-sync workflows between Omniverse and Unreal Engine. This connector will supercharge any game developer\u2019s art pipeline.\nLearn more about NVIDIA technologies for Unreal Engine 5.\n\n\nCategories: GamingTags: GeForce | NVIDIA RTX | Ray Tracing | Rendering | TITAN | Turing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Just a couple of weeks ago, the price of an Nvidia RTX 3080 dropped by 35 percent overnight. It was a momentous occasion for PC gamers looking to get their hands on one of the latest graphics cards. Now, though, it looks like those prices are set to continue dropping as the 3000 series nears the end of its lifespan.Read: Xbox Games with Gold: Every free game Microsoft is giving away in April 2022Nvidia RTX 3080 prices are almost normal againImage source: NvidiaOver the past month, the price of Nvidia and AMD graphics cards has dropped exponentially. 3DCenter reports that prices for both AMD and Nvidia cards are now just 25 percent above their list price. This is a massive change from the exaggerated prices that the latest GPUs have experienced over the past couple of years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25 percent above the list price might still seem steep to some. However, when compared with 3DCenter\u2019s previous street price reports, Nvidia and AMD cards were both selling for over 80 percent above list price back in December. To see such a drop in Nvidia RTX 3080 prices, as well as prices for other GPUs, is good news for those still interested in buying an Ampere/RDNA2 graphics card. However, it is likely the prices will continue to drop. Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there.

GPU prices will likely continue to fallImage source: NvidiaIn our previous reporting on GPU prices, we noted the market was still far from normal. And that prices dropping wasn\u2019t necessarily an indication of worldwide drops. However, that appears to be the case now.Still, while prices are getting closed to the manufacturer\u2019s list price, that still does not symbolize a return to normalcy. Yes, it\u2019s good news that Nvidia RTX prices are dropping. And some manufacturers like ASUS are even pushing those drops at the highest level.However, as 3DCenter notes, those price drops have not brought an influx of new buyers thus far. As such, it seems that many may be waiting to hear more about Nvidia and AMD\u2019s plans for the next generation. Even then, there are Intel\u2019s GPU plans for new buyers to take into account, too. Finally, there\u2019s the matter of stores even having these cards in stock in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, with the current state of the marketplace and supply lines, it may be a while before you can take advantage of these price drops.\n\nMore Gaming coverage:\u00a0For more Gaming news, visit our\u00a0Gaming hub here\n\n\n\nThis article talks about:\n\n\n\t\t\t\tnvidia\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJoshua Hawkins\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWriter\n\n\n\nJosh Hawkins has been writing for over a decade, covering science, gaming, and tech culture.

Schmidt COLLEGE OF ARTS AND LETTERS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Thursdays - NVIDIA selects Daniel Bolojan for the Academic Hardware Grant Program \nThursday, Apr 14, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage caption: The developed deep learning networks allow for blending of semantic representations to be performed between architectural and non-architectural domains, resulting in coherent domain transfers that provide novel architectural expressions.\nNVIDIA selects Assistant Professor Daniel Bolojan\u2019 s project \u201cLatent Morphologies\u201d for the Academic Hardware Grant Program. Daniel Bolojan is an Assistant Professor at the School of Architecture FAU, where he specializes in artificial intelligence (AI) and computational design. He is one of the leading voices in the implementation of deep learning strategies in architecture and the architectural design process. \u00a0The selected project \u201cLatent Morphologies\u201d introduces first-generation architecture students to the potential disruptive paradigm change driven by the adoption of Creative AI models in architecture, as well\u00a0as how these can manifest in novel machine-machine or human-machine interaction protocols.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than viewing artificial intelligence as a closed cycle of \u201cinput-output,\u201d the project investigates the potential of logical continuity in AI-driven design workflows that both challenge and augment designer\u2019s agency, by looking at a series of complementary deep learning models and developing nested generative design processes.\u00a0 NVIDIA is the leading manufacturer of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs), which are powering the Deep Learning revolution. The NVIDIA Academic Hardware Program advances artificial intelligence and data science by providing researchers and educators with industry-leading hardware and software through partnership with academic institutions worldwide. The program aims to advance education and research by: (1) Providing world-class computing resources to enable groundbreaking, innovative, and one-of-a-kind academic research projects. (2) Providing educators with a hands-on platform for teaching students of any discipline about artificial intelligence, deep learning, and data science. Applicants had required to \u201cdemonstrate a thorough understanding of how to leverage NVIDIA technology to accelerate research and significantly impact a project\u2019s success.\u201d\n\n(printable version)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRELATED\n\n\nResearch Thursdays - Qiaozhen Liu\u2019s Article on Nonprofits\u2019 Overhead Spending is Getting NoticedResearch Thursdays - Novel by Emanuele Pettener is Set in VeniceResearch Thursdays - Alejandra Aguilar Dornelles, Ph.D., received the Marielle Franco Prize \n\n\u00a0\n\nARCHIVE\n\n\n\nMarch 2025February 2025January 2025December 2024November 2024October 2024September 2024August 2024July 2024June 2024May 2024April 2024March 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlorida Atlantic University\n777 Glades Road\nBoca Raton, FL 33431\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampuses\n\n\nBoca Raton\nDania Beach\nDavie\nFort Lauderdale\nHarbor Branch\nJupiter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\nAcademic Calendar\nEmployment Opportunities\nProgram Search\nParking\nReport a Concern\nTranscripts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nContact Us\nDirectory\nEmergency & Safety\nFAU Schools\nMedia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial\n\n\n\n\nfacebook\n\n\n\n\n\ntwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nyoutube\n\n\n\n\n\ninstagram\n\n\n\n\n\nlinkedin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Programs\nRequest Info\nVisit Our Campuses\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are experiencing difficulty accessing information on the Florida Atlantic University website due to a disability, visit the website accessibility page.\nFlorida Atlantic University embodies a culture of strategic and collaborative community engagement that results in mutual benefit to the institution and the diverse internal and external communities that it serves.\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nRegulations & Policies\nConsumer Information\nGet Help\nSite Index\nStudent Accessibility\nPublic Records\n\n\n 2025 Florida Atlantic University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 "

Though it's been mere weeks since the launch of the most powerful and likely the last card in the range, the RTX 3090 Ti, enthusiast attention is looking ahead to the future RTX 40 series.A new tweet from reliable hardware leaker kopite7kimi claims the high end AD102 GPU has entered the testing phase. This is the GPU that's expected to power the likes of the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 (assuming that's the naming scheme Nvidia goes with).If the card has indeed entered testing, then that's a great sign the development is well advanced. Barring any unforeseen consequences, the design of the GPU is likely finalized, meaning that working cards and drivers are in-house. That doesn't mean the release is imminent, though. Driver development takes time. There are all kinds of checks and milestones to pass before a driver can be considered release-ready.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nRTX 5090 prototype GPU with 24,576 cores reportedly leaks hinting at possible 800 W 5090 Ti or Titan monster\n\n\n\n\nNvidia announces the RTX 50-series, led by the $1,999 RTX 5090 with 'twice the performance of the 4090'\n\n\n\nIt's a good sign, though.

AD102 has started testing. https://t.co/yziVJE8eFpApril 19, 2022Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest gaming motherboard: The right boards\nBest graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the restThere have been quite a few leaks about Nvidia's next gen Ada Lovelace GPUs, at least the flagship chip anyway. The safest bet of all is that the cards will include 12+4 pin PCIe 5.0 power connectors which can deliver up to 600W. Add to that persistent rumours that the high-end cards will use all of that 600W, if not more, \u00a0suggests Nvidia is going for performance at all costs.The range is expected to be built using a customized TSMC 5nm node. That's a big jump from the 8nm Samsung node used by the RTX 30 Ampere series of cards. Normally that would lead to improved power efficiency if all else was equal, but when you add in the higher power budget, increased transistor density, higher shader count, higher clocks and architectural improvements, then we should be looking at a rather dramatic performance uplift. Well, hopefully. We'll have to wait a while to see real game benchmarks.The cards are likely to make use of 24Gbps GDDR6X memory, which by itself will consume a not insignificant amount of power. Previous leaks suggest up to 18432 shaders compared to the 10752 of the 3090 Ti. We can also expect increases in RT and tensor cores leading to improved ray tracing and AI capabilities. In short, the high-end Ada Lovelace cards are shaping up to be monsters in every aspect.

But if the cards are indeed in testing, then a release sometime in the second half of 2022 is looking like a safer and safer bet.

He developed a love of extreme overclocking that destroyed his savings despite the cheaper hardware on offer via his job at a PC store. To afford more LN2 he began moonlighting as a reviewer for VR-Zone before jumping the fence to work for MSI Australia. Since then, he's gone back to journalism, enthusiastically reviewing the latest and greatest components for PC & Tech Authority, PC Powerplay and currently Australian Personal Computer magazine and PC Gamer.

Visual art can now be created anywhere, anytime.\nBut being creative is still challenging and time-consuming. NVIDIA is making artistic workflows easier and faster by giving creators tools that enable them to remain in their flow state.\nThat\u2019s what NVIDIA Studio is \u2014 an ecosystem of creative app optimizations, GPU-accelerated features and AI-powered apps, powered by NVIDIA RTX GPUs and backed by world-class Studio Drivers.\nOur new \u2018In the NVIDIA Studio,\u2019 blog series celebrates creativity everywhere by spotlighting 3D animators, video editors, photographers and more, every week. We\u2019ll showcase their inspirational and thought-provoking work, and detail how creators are using NVIDIA GPUs to go from concept to completion, faster than ever.\nThe series kicks off with 3D artist Jasmin Habezai-Fekri. Check out her work below, created with Unreal Engine, Adobe Substance 3D and Blender, accelerated by her GeForce RTX 2070 GPU.\nHabezai-Fekri Dreams in 3D\n\u2018Old Forgotten Library\u2019 and \u2018Shiba Statue\u2019 highlight Habezai-Fekri\u2019s use of vivid colors.\nBased in Germany, Habezai-Fekri works in gaming as a 3D environment artist, making props and environments with hand-painted and stylized physically based rendering textures. She revels in creating fantasy and nature-themed scenes, accentuated by big, bold colors.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/studio-ins-jasmin-habezai-fekri-full-landscape-loop.mp4\n\u00a0\nHabezai-Fekri\u2019s passion is creating artwork with whimsical charm, piquing the interest of her audiences while creating a sense of immersion, rounding out her unique flair.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/studio-ins-jasmin-habezai-fekri-bird-house-final-loop.mp4\n\u00a0\nOne such piece is Bird House \u2014 a creative fusion of styles and imagination.\nWith this piece, Habezai-Fekri was learning the ins and outs of using Unreal Engine, while trying to replicate \u201csomething very 2D-esque in a 3D space, giving it all a very painterly yet next-gen feeling.\u201d Through iteration, she developed her foundational skills and found that having a set art direction and visual style gave it her own signature.\nProp development for \u2018Bird House.\u2019\nHabezai-Fekri uses Blender software for modeling and employs Zbrush for her highpoly sculpts to help bring stylized details into textures and models. The fine details are critical for invoking the real-life emotions she hopes to cultivate. \u201cCreating immersiveness is a huge aspect for me when making my art,\u201d Habezai-Fekri said.\nHand-painted, stylized wood textures and details in \u2018Bird House.\u2019\nLooking closer reveals Habezai-Fekri\u2019s personal touches in the textures in Bird House \u2014 she hand-painted them in Adobe Substance 3D Painter. RTX GPU-accelerated light and ambient occlusion in Substance 3D helps speed up her process by outputting new textures in mere seconds.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/studio-ins-jasmin-habezai-fekri-bird-house-close-up-loop.mp4\n\u00a0\n\u201cHaving a hand-painted pass on my textures really enhances the assets and lets me channel that artistic side throughout a heavily technical process,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn our industry, with new tools being released so frequently, it\u2019s inevitable to constantly learn and expand your skill set. Being open to that from the start really helps to be more receptive to it.\u201d\n\nHabezai-Fekri\u2019s work often uses vivid colors. To make it look inviting and friendly, she purposely saturates colors, even if the subject matter is not colorful by nature.\nHabezai-Fekri also finds inspiration in trying new tools and workflows, particularly when she sees other artists and creatives doing amazing work.\nBy partnering with creative app developers, the NVIDIA Studio ecosystem regularly gives Habezai-Fekri new tools that help her create faster. For example, RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in Blender\u2019s viewport enables her to enjoy interactive, photorealistic rendering in real time.\n\nRTX GPUs also deliver rendering speeds up to 2.5x faster with Blender Cycles 3.0. This means a lot less waiting and a lot more creating.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2020-10-01-13-40-29.mp4\n\u00a0\nEverything comes together for Habezai-Fekri with the application of final textures and colors in Unreal Engine. NVIDIA RTX GPUs feature advanced capabilities like DLSS, which enhances interactivity of the viewport in Unreal Engine by using AI to upscale frames rendered at lower resolution, while still retaining detail.\n\nHabezai-Fekri works for Airship Syndicate. Previously, she has been an artist at Square Enix and ArtStation. View her work on ArtStation, including a new learning course providing project insights.\nNVIDIA Studio Resources\nHabezai-Fekri is one of the artists spotlighted in the latest Studio Standouts video, \u201cStunning Art From Incredible Women Artists.\u201d\n\nSee more amazing digital art in the video from Yulia Sokolova, Nourhan Ishmai, Ecem Okumus and Laura Escoin.\n\nLearn more about texturing in Substance 3D Painter by exploring artist and Adobe Creative Director Vladimir Petkovic\u2019s series, \u201cFrom Texturing to Final Render in Adobe Substance Painter.\u201d\nJoin the growing number of 3D artists collaborating around the globe in real time, and working in multiple apps simultaneously, with NVIDIA Omniverse.\nCheck back In the NVIDIA Studio every week to discover new featured artists, creative tips and tricks, and the latest NVIDIA Studio news.

Moore08 Apr 20224 min readSamuel K. Moore is IEEE Spectrum\u2019s semiconductor editor.Nvidia recently introduced Hopper, its next-generation GPU architecture.\n        Nvidia\n    Transformers, the type of neural network behind OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 and other big natural-language processors, are quickly becoming some of the most important in industry, and they are likely to spread to other\u2014perhaps all\u2014areas of AI. Nvidia\u2019s new Hopper H100 is proof that the leading maker of chips for accelerating AI is a believer. Among the many architectural changes that distinguish the H100 from its predecessor, the A100, is a \u201ctransformer engine.\u201d Not a distinct part of the new hardware exactly, it\u2019s a way of dynamically changing the precision of the calculations in the cores to speed up the training of transformer neural networks.\u201cOne of the big trends in AI is the emergence of transformers,\u201d says Dave Salvator, senior product manager for AI inference and cloud at Nvidia. Transformers quickly took over language AI, because their networks pay \u201cattention\u201d to multiple sentences, enabling them to grasp context and antecedents. (The T in the benchmark language model BERT stands for \u201ctransformer\u201d as it does in the occasionally insulting\u00a0GPT-3.) \u201cWe are trending very quickly toward trillion parameter models\u201d  \u2014Dave Salvator, NvidiaBut more recently, researchers have been seeing an advantage to applying that same sense of attention to vision and other models dominated by convolutional neural networks. Salvator notes that more than two-thirds of papers about neural networks in the last two years dealt with transformers or their derivatives. \u201cThe number of challenges transformers can take on continues to grow,\u201d he says.However, transformers are among the biggest neural-network models in terms of the number of parameters involved. And they are growing much faster than other models. \u201cWe are trending very quickly toward trillion-parameter models,\u201d says Salvator. Nvidia\u2019s  analysis shows the training needs of transformer models growing 275-fold every two years, while the trend for all other models is 8-fold growth every two years. Bigger models need more computational resources especially for training, but also for operating in real time as they often need to do. Nvidia developed the transformer engine to help keep up.The computational needs of transformers are growing more rapidly than those of other forms of AI. Those are growing really fast, too, of course.NVIDIAThe transformer engine is really software combined with new hardware capabilities in Hopper\u2019s tensor cores. These are the units dedicated to carrying out machine learning\u2019s bread-and-butter calculation\u2014matrix multiply and accumulate. Hopper has tensor cores capable of computing with floating-point numbers of a variety of precision\u2014from 64-bit down to 8-bit. The A100\u2019s cores were designed for floating-point numbers only as short as 16 bits. But the trend in AI computing has been toward developing neural nets that lean on the lowest precision that will still yield an accurate result. The smaller formats compute faster and more efficiently, and they require less memory and memory bandwidth. The addition of 8-bit floating-point units in the H100 leads to a significant speedup\u2014double the throughput compared to its 16-bit units.The transformer engine\u2019s secret sauce is its ability to dynamically choose what precision is needed for each layer in the neural network at each step in training a neural network. The least-precise units, the 8-bit floating point, can speed through their computations, but then produce 16-bit or 32-bit sums for the next layer if that\u2019s the precision needed there. The Hopper goes a step further, though. Its 8-bit floating-point units can do their matrix math with either of two forms of 8-bit numbers.To understand why that\u2019s helpful, you might need a quick lesson in the structure of floating-point numbers. This format represents numbers using some of the bits for the exponent, some for the mantissa, and one for the sign. The more bits you have representing the exponent, the greater the range of numbers you can express. The more bits in the mantissa, the greater the precision of those numbers. The standard 16-bit floating-point format (IEEE 754-2008) demands 5 bits of exponent and 10 bits of mantissa, along with the sign bit. Seeking to reduce data-storage requirements and speed machine learning, makers of AI accelerators recently adopted bfloat-16, which trades three bits of mantissa for an added exponent, giving it the same range as a 32-bit number.Nvidia has taken that trade-off further. \u201cOne of the unique things we found when you get to [8-bit] is that there really isn\u2019t a one size fits all format that we were confident would work,\u201d says Jonah Alben, Nvidia\u2019s senior vice president of GPU engineering. So Hopper\u2019s 8-bit units can work with either 5 bits of exponent and two of mantissa (E5M2) when range is important or 4 bits of exponent and three of mantissa (E4M3) when precision is key. The transformer engine orchestrates what\u2019s needed on the fly to speed training. We \u201cembody our experience testing transformers into this so that it knows how to make the right decisions,\u201d says Alben.In practice, this usually means using different types of floating-point formats for the different parts of a training task. Generally, training a neural network involves exposing it to lots of data (forward inferencing), measuring how bad the network is at doing its task on that data, and then adjusting the network parameters, layer-by-layer backwards through the network to improve it (back propagation). Wash, rinse, repeat. Generally, back propagation needs greater precision, so the E4M3 format might be favored there, while the inferencing (forward) step favors the E5M2\u2019s range.Nvidia is not alone in pursuing this approach. At the IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Computer Architecture in 2021, IBM researchers presented an accelerator called RaPiD that used the E5M2/E4M3 scheme for training, as well. A system of four such chips delivered training speedups between 10 and 100 percent, depending on the neural network involved.Nvidia\u2019s Hopper will be available in the third quarter of 2022.This story was corrected on 14 April to give the proper format for E5M2.From Your Site ArticlesNvidia Co-founders Remember Their Startup Roller Coaster Ride ... \u203aNvidia Chip Takes Deep Learning to the Extremes - IEEE Spectrum \u203aNvidia\u2019s CTO on the Future of High-Performance Computing - IEEE Spectrum \u203aGPT-4 Ups The Ante In The AI Arms Race - IEEE Spectrum \u203aThe Secret to Nvidia's AI Success - IEEE Spectrum \u203aNvidia Unveils Blackwell, Its Next GPU - IEEE Spectrum \u203aNvidia AI: Challengers Are Coming for Nvidia\u2019s Crown - IEEE Spectrum \u203aRelated Articles Around the WebList of Nvidia graphics processing units - Wikipedia \u203aNVIDIA Hopper GPU Architecture Accelerates Dynamic ... \u203aartificial intelligencegpt-3nvidiatransformersmachine learningSamuel K.

But at the same time, it can be tuned to become an efficiency monster in the high-end graphics card segment.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Graphics Card Tuned To 300W TDP, Offers Higher Efficiency & Faster Gaming Performance Than AMD 6900 XT\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti has a reference TGP of 450W and most custom models are close to or over 500W. The graphics card is supplemented such high amounts of power through the new PCIe Gen 5 16-pin connector which is to accommodate TGP requirements of future graphics cards that would consume up to 600 Watts of power.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostWhile the graphics card is a power-hungry beast, it can be tuned to become an efficient monster too. As tested by Igor Wallossek from Igor's Lab, the graphics card can be limited to a 300W power limit, a 37% drop in its TGP rating. This testing was done using the MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Ti SUPRIM X graphics card which features a 480W TGP. It is one of the bulkiest graphics cards ever made. The testing was concluded not only with a reduced power limit but also with an adjusted VR Curve which is carried over from the RTX A6000. The RTX A6000 is another card that features the full-fat GA102 GPU core but has reduced core and memory clocks.\nFor testing, a total of 10 games were tested at 4K resolution. The power-limited GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics card was not only compared to the fully unlocked RTX 3090 Ti but other NVIDIA & AMD graphics cards too. The results are very interesting.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti '300W Power Limit' Gaming Benchmarks (Image Credits: Igor's Lab):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nAt 4K, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti with a power limit of 300W offers almost the same gaming performance as the RTX 3080 Ti while featuring a 50W lower limit. The card also ends up a tad bit faster than the AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT too. But these are just the power limits, the actual power consumption is a whole different story.\nIn terms of power consumption, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti consumes 6W lower power than the Radeon RX 6800 XT while being 16% faster on average. The Radeon RX 6900 XT consumes 50W higher power while the 3080 Ti consumes 100W more power. The full 3090 Ti consumes around 150 Watt more power while offering just 12% more performance. This makes the RTX 3090 Ti the most valuable high-end graphics card in terms of average watts per frame provided to end-users.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti '300W Power Limit' Power Consumption (Image Credits: Igor's Lab):\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti '300W Power Limit' Watt/FPS (Image Credits: Igor's Lab):\n\nNow enthusiasts don't buy a graphics card such as the RTX 3090 Ti or RX 6900 XT to throttle them down from their base specifications. They do so to utilize all the extra juice that they can get out of it. This demonstration isn't a practical use case but it does show that NVIDIA and its partners went all out with power and cooling designs to extract everything out of the Ampere GA102 GPU core to remain on top of the game. It is good for efficiency demonstrations but other than that, the testing is only good for demonstration purposes.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n154\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n103\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nA Mac Studio Cluster Of Four Units, All Featuring Apple\u2019s Latest M3 Ultra, Consume Less Than Half The Power Of A Network Switch When Running At Idle\n\n\n\n70\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n37\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1480\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1157\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

At least to gamers, the RTX 3090 made little sense since there was no need to have a massive 24GB VRAM buffer, and despite Nvidia's best efforts, 8K gaming just isn't a thing.\nUnfortunately though, \"boring and rather pointless\" would be a good way to summarize the entire graphics card segment over the past year and a half, and you can probably include the word \"hopeless\" in there as well.\nSince release and for months on end, even pointless products like the RTX 3090 were nearly impossible to find, unless you were willing to pay scalper prices of ~$3,000 for the fastest GPUs on the market. Thankfully, pricing has started to drop, though in most cases it's still inflated.\n\nYou can now get an RTX 3090 starting at $1,900, which is still 30% over MSRP, but well down on the $3,000+ prices we were faced with not that long ago.\nThe original RTX 3080 is currently selling for $1,100 though, meaning you're paying over 70% more for a 3090, for what amounts to 10-15% more performance at 4K.\nYou may want to argue that the RTX 3090 isn't \"pointless\" considering it's the most affordable graphics card with a 24GB VRAM buffer. Again, that's worthless to gamers, but for certain production workloads, the big memory buffer could be a godsend, so there's that.\n\nBut what about a GeForce RTX 3090 Ti? Would a Ti version packing 2.5% more cores clocked 10% higher with 8% more memory bandwidth be useful to anyone? I guess that depends on the price. But, of course, it's not replacing the original version at $1,500.\nThis isn't a refresh where you get a small boost at the same price point before the next generation arrives, rather this is what we'd call a \"milking.\" A small performance bump for a big price hike, a hike that sees the MSRP hit $2,000.\n\nApart from a few extra cores, the 3090 Ti is just an overclocked 3090 with a ludicrously high power rating of 450 watts, nearly a 30% increase over the original 3090. Is that dumb? Surely sounds like it, but to be sure let's first take a look at the three RTX 3090 Ti boards we have on hand and then on to the benchmarks.\nThe Cards: Asus, MSI and Gainward\nStarting with the Asus TUF Gaming OC, the RTX 3090 version was already very large, but the 3090 Ti is even bigger, weighing 1677 grams which isn't that crazy, but the dimensions are quite something measuring 325mm long, 150mm tall, and a whopping 63mm wide making this a 3-slot graphics card.\nExternally, it looks like any other 30-series TUF Gaming graphics card. There are three 100mm fans wrapped in an aluminium shroud and on the backside you get a full size aluminium backplate. The stainless steel I/O bracket features three DisplayPort outputs and two HDMI outputs.\n\nGetting down to the PCB we find a PCIe 5.0 16-pin power connector and since no power supplies support this connector (at least none you can buy right now), the 3090 Ti cards come with an adapter that feeds three 8-pin PCIe cables into the PCIe 5.0 16-pin power connector.\nThis is basically the same 12-pin connector featured on the Nvidia Founders Edition models, just with four extra 'sense' pins.\nThe biggest upgrade for all 3090 Ti graphics cards is arguably the memory. Capacity has not changed from the original, so it's still 24GB, but memory density and frequency has improved, upgrading the memory modules capacity from 1GB to 2GB, meaning there are just 12 modules and they're all on the front side of the PCB. This will significantly improve memory cooling performance.\n\nThat also means the backplate is just extracting heat from the rear PCB, and not a dozen GDDR6X chips. Asus has still included plenty of thermal pads on the backplate though, using it as a heat spreader.\nThe heatsink is massive as you'd expect and Asus has gone with a nickel plated copper base for extracting heat from the GPU and some of GDDR6X memory, which is a bit of an odd choice for the memory.\n\nInstead most of the memory chips are connected to an aluminum plate which won't be as efficient at extracting heat. Overall a very good looking card with an excellent mounting method for connecting with the PCB.\nWhen put to the test, installed inside the Corsair Obsidian 500D in a 21C room, the TUF Gaming peaked at 79C for the hot spot with a peak memory temperature of 78C. The fans spun at 2400 RPM and the cores typically clocked at 1.99 GHz out of the box.\n\nWe also tested the MSI RTX 3090 Ti Suprim X and this thing is a beast. It's without question the biggest graphics card we've ever come across taking up 4 slots with a weight of 2145 grams. It measures 305mm long and stands 140mm tall, but at 71mm wide, it takes up 4 slots which is complete madness.\nThere are three 95mm fans encased in a bonkers-looking fan shroud and at the rear is an nice looking backplate that has a lot going on. There's brushed aluminium, LED backlit logos, vents and a neat little black skirt a the end. Oddly though despite the massive I/O bracket which takes up 3-slots, MSI has only included three DisplayPort and a single HDMI output, so one less HDMI port that you get with the Asus model.\n\nWhere the Suprim X appears to be in a league of its own is cooling. Whereas the TUF Gaming was a combination of heatsink fins and aluminium brackets, the Suprim X is pretty much all fins. There's 8 nickel-plated heatpipes that extend through the fin stacks. Then connecting the GPU and GDDR6X memory to the heatsink is a large nickel-plated base, making contact with all 12 memory modules.\nWhen put to the test installed inside the Corsair Obsidian 500D in a 21C room, the Suprim X peaked at 88C for the hot spot with a peak memory temperature of 82C. It's worth noting that the fans spun at just 1700 RPM, so the Suprim X was virtually silent. The cores also typically clocked at 1.99 GHz out of the box.\n\nWe only received the Gainward RTX 3090 Ti Phantom GS the day before our review was going live, which is why we didn't include any results in our graphs. But we did have time to install it and run it for an hour for a temperature analysis.\nThis is another triple-slot design with three 90mm fans embedded in a plastic shroud. It's a cool looking design with some black anodized pipes that run end to end. Around the back is a full-size backplate with some air vents cut outs towards the end. This is quite a large section of the backplate as the PCB is very short.\nGainward has managed to cram their premium RTX 3090 Ti graphics card onto a 205mm long PCB which is impressive given the card itself is 310mm long. This means there is quite a large section of the card that allows air to pass through it and this should help quite a lot with cooling performance.\n\nLike MSI, Gainward has gone with a single HDMI output and three DisplayPort outputs and of course there is a single 16-pin PCIe 5.0 power connector. Now, the Phantom GS is quite heavy at 1837 grams thanks to a large triple-slot cooler packing eight heatpipes and a large copper base. Gainward has been generous with the thermal pads and there's a good amount of them also found on the backplate, so overall a solid looking 3090 Ti.\nWhen put to the test inside the Obsidian 500D case in a 21C room, the Phantom GS peaked at 84C for the hot spot with a peak memory temperature of 76C. These temperatures were achieved with a fan speed of 1850 RPM, so in terms of cooling performance the Phantom GS is similar to the massive MSI model. The cores also typically clocked at 2 GHz.\nGaming Benchmarks\nFor this review we've tested 12 games at 1080p, 1440p and 4K. We'll mostly focus on the 4K data, but you can see the performance summary for all resolutions further down below.\nAll benchmarks were run using our Ryzen 9 5950X test system configured with 32GB of dual-rank, dual-channel DDR4-3200 CL14 memory. Resizable Bar was not enabled as we see this as more of a platform feature that isn't suitable for individual GPU tests, or at least right now it doesn't accurately represent how Radeon and GeForce GPUs compare on older systems.\n\nStarting with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, we see that both the Asus and MSI 3090 Ti models we have on hand were good for 69 fps on average, making them just 3% faster than the original RTX 3090, as well as the Radeon RX 6900 XT.\n\nNext we have Far Cry 6 and here the new 3090 Ti models are just 5% faster than the RTX 3090 Founders Edition, or just 2.5% faster than the Suprim X version of the standard 3090. So we're still looking at mid to low single digit gains for the new Ti model.\n\nWatch Dogs Legion also shows a minor 5% increase over a stock 3090, or 3% over the Suprim X version as both the MSI and Asus 3090 Ti cards rendered 66 fps on average, an impressive 4K result for sure, but hardly earth shattering.\n\nThe margins grow a little in Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Here the 3090 Ti Suprim X was 11% faster than the 3090 FE card, and 8% faster than the Suprim X version. As far as the apples to apples comparisons go, the 3090 Ti is up to 8% faster than the 3090. Pretty uninspiring gains so far.\n\nAt face value, the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege results look more promising with larger margins, but that's mostly down to the fact that we're playing with much larger numbers here.\nStill, the Suprim X 3090 Ti was 3.5% faster than the Asus TUF Gaming OC model, though it was only 9% faster than the older Suprim X version of the original 3090.\n\nF1 2021 sees an 8% margin from the 3090 Suprim X to the 3090 Ti version, and that seems as good as it gets for the 3090 Ti. I should also note that the Radeon GPUs look quite weak here as ray tracing is enabled by default and therefore we test with this feature enabled.\n\nNo surprises found in Horizon Zero Dawn, the 3090 Ti was 5% faster than comparable 3090 models, rendering 98 fps on average.\n\nDoom Eternal was no challenge for the 3090 Ti, though the same was also true of the 3090 and here the Suprim X models are separated by a mere 4% margin.\n\nThe 3090 Ti Suprim X was 11% faster than the 3090 Suprim X, our biggest margin yet. Clearly, this game is enjoying the higher clocked cores and memory. We're not sure you'll notice going from 123 fps to 138 fps at 4K, but you'll probably notice the $500+ missing from your wallet.\n\nMoving on, there's little to see in Death Stranding, here the Suprim X models are separated by just a 6% margin.\n\nHitman 3 risks a little excitement with a 9% margin favoring the 3090 Ti Suprim X over the 3090 model, almost double digits there.\n\nFinally, we have Cyberpunk 2077 with a 10% performance boost over the Suprim X 3090. Sadly, we couldn't hit 60 fps in our test using the second highest quality settings. Maybe next-gen hardware will achieve that at 4K.\nPerformance Summary\n1080p, 1440p and 4K\nBased on the tests we ran, it sounds like the 3090 Ti is up to 10% faster than the original 3090 at 4K. Let's now also see how the 12 game average data looks for 1440p and 1080p gaming performance.\nStarting at 1080p, you can see that despite using the Ryzen 9 5950X with low latency memory, we're still largely CPU bound at this lower resolution with average frame rates in excess of 200 fps. There's probably not much point comparing the 3090 and 3090 Ti here.\n\n\nFor those of you targeting 1440p with ultra-like quality settings, the 3090 Ti appears to be on average 4% faster than equivalent 3090 models, seen when comparing the MSI Suprim X cards.\n\nThen at 4K we're looking at a 7% performance improvement when comparing the MSI Suprim X models, which is rather underwhelming.\nThe 3090 Ti was 20% faster than the 6900 XT, but we are talking about a stock 6900 XT. You could probably halve that margin with a good overclocker. In summary, the 3090 Ti wasn't even 10% faster than the original 3090, but the MSRP has been jacked up by 33%.\nPower Usage\nThe graphics board power rating was increased by almost 30% to 450 watts and that saw total system usage rise by an insane 18% to 702 watts with the Suprim X, up from just shy of 600 watts with the original 3090.\nThat's a horrible increase for just 7% more performance on average.\n\nWhat We Learned\nWe can already sense Nvidia fans asking \"what about ray tracing & DLSS?, why haven't you talked about those?\" The reason is that the 3090 Ti will be no different than the 3090. Tack on a few percentage points, and you have the 3090 Ti, there's nothing truly new here.\nAnd that's the problem with the RTX 3090 Ti in a nutshell. It's pretty much the same GPU that was launched 18 months ago, but arriving way later to the party. Despite that, it costs 33% more for ~10% more performance on the best of scenarios, while sucking down ~30% more power. In my opinion, the 3090 Ti defines modern overclocking for gamers: hot, loud, expensive, and ultimately pointless.\n\nThe original RTX 3090 makes far more sense and it's quite something when a new Ti model makes the original dumb offering look all smart and sensible. But that's exactly what the 3090 Ti has done. It's made me look back at the 3090 and say, well, you weren't that bad after all. But then I remember it's just 14% faster than the RTX 3080 with a 114% increase in MSRP, so I just get confused with all the silliness.\nSpeaking of silly... the Nvidia review guide for the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti is truly something. Nvidia claims that the point of comparison for the 3090 Ti is the Titan RTX. You know, that $2,500 Turing GPU released in late 2018, almost 4 years ago now. Perhaps if the RTX 3090 with 24GB of VRAM didn't exist you could make that argument, but it's been around for well over a year now.\n\nNvidia has also doubled down on pushing the 8K gaming angle. But why? No one bought it the first time (besides a few paid reviews). 8K gaming is not a thing for a few reasons... starting with, where are the 8K gaming monitors they are promoting this for?\nAnd I quote... \"The RTX 3090 Ti lets you play, capture, and watch your games in brilliant 8K HDR with DLSS Ultra Performance mode for 8K gaming.\" But, of course, DLSS Ultra Performance mode isn't 8K gaming. 8K gaming would be 8K gaming, not a scaled up version using DLSS.\n\nPutting that aside for a second, the fact remains that when using dialed down quality settings in Cyberpunk 2077, with ray tracing disabled, the 3090 Ti couldn't achieve 60 fps at 4K, so we don't think it's 8K ready with any level of DLSS support.\nI will now quote myself, \"if you're a PC gamer, the RTX 3090 (Ti) doesn't really make much sense.\" Had the new RTX 3090 Ti slotted into the original 3090's price point perhaps it'd have made for an okay release, not amazing 18 months down the track, but not horrible either.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6800 XT on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6700 XT on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 69\n\n\n Got something to say?

Where once Lovelace was pegged as little more than a mild Ampere refresh, it is now being suggested that it's far more than that, and closer to a whole new GPU architecture.Is this more evidence that AMD's upcoming RDNA 3 GPUs are worrying Jen-Hsun and co? That's certainly the intimation from tweaker @kopite7kimi, which seems to be suggesting that while it was once a refresh, it is not anymore. If the \"the current AD102 is NOT the original AD102\" then something has made Nvidia change tack.I must clarify that the current AD102 is NOT the original AD102. Ada Lovelace is no longer a simple Ampere refresh, although it was like this in the beginning.April 29, 2022Yeah, you can tell that we're getting ever-closer to a GPU battle royale as the rumour mill is aggressively grinding away at leak after leak from a few key Twitter accounts. We're betting on new high-end graphics cards, from both AMD and Nvidia, to land in our rigs towards the end of the year, and the closer we get to launch this is only going to ramp up.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nAMD's 'official' performance figures for RDNA 4 leak out early, with the RX 9070 XT claimed to be 42% faster than the RX 7900 GRE at 4K\n\n\n\n\nIf the AMD RX 9070 XT is as beefy as these leaked specs and benchmark makes out, low Nvidia 50-series stocks might not matter\n\n\n\nBut it's providing us with some interesting potential insights insights, and if nothing else some interesting things to consider as we head into what could be one of the closest battles for GPU dominance we've ever seen. And maybe even one where AMD could conceivably pull a Ryzen and come out on top.And the potential for the rumours about RDNA 3 to actually translate into a dominant GPU architecture for once could be the reason that we're hearing about Nvidia testing an AD102-based graphics card that chugs down some 900W of juice. Similarly, why it might have chosen to pull a little more in from Hopper than maybe it was planning to for Lovelace.Screen queens(Image credit: Future)Best gaming monitor: Pixel-perfect panels for your PC\nBest high refresh rate monitor: Screaming quick screens\nBest 4K monitor for gaming: When only high-res will do\nBest 4K TV for gaming: Big-screen 4K PC gamingHowever it shakes out, we're looking at a rubber meets the road moment when RDNA 3 and Lovelace come face-to-face, or chip-to-chip, where two very different architectural design choices will come into close contact.\u00a0Nvidia is piling along with a monolithic chip approach, packing as much N4 silicon as it can possibly manage into a GPU you could conceivably call a consumer chip. While AMD is going rogue, aiming to make the leap to GPU chiplets pay off for its graphics card division in the same way that it did when Ryzen adopted the chiplet approach.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.One is brute force, the other advanced, lean, and efficient.

How games respond to GPU chiplets is going to be fascinating, and potentially one of the pain points when it comes to testing them later this year.Nvidia, however, will be hoping AMD pulls a Bulldozer rather than a Ryzen.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nRDNA\nRyzen\n\n\nDave JamesSocial Links NavigationEditor-in-Chief, HardwareDave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the Colecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!).

It's now the fastest graphics card we've tested, but we're nearing the launch window for next-gen GPUs. That, plus the high price and power draw make this card a highly questionable choice.

It now reigns as the king of graphics cards, surpassing its 3090 predecessor by up to 10% \u2014 provided you're testing at 4K. But that performance comes at a cost, and not just in terms of dollars. The RTX 3090 Ti also takes the crown as the single most power hungry GPU we've ever tested (not including dual-GPU solutions like the 2014-era Titan Z), pushing the limits of how much juice a graphics card can guzzle.\n\nIf all you want is the fastest GPU possible, efficiency be damned, this is now the best graphics card and the top solution in our GPU benchmarks hierarchy. But much like sports car enthusiasts might look at a Ferrari or Lamborghini with no intention of buying one, most PC gamers will want to stick with the RTX 3080 or RTX 3080 Ti and give this a pass.\n\nSimilar to the recent RTX 3080 12GB, Nvidia chose not to sample reviewers directly for the RTX 3090 Ti. It suggested reaching out to the AIC (add-in card) partners, and Asus supplied us with its RTX 3090 Ti TUF Gaming OC. Perhaps part of the reason Nvidia didn't sample is because board partner models will generally perform better thanks to factory overclocks, and might even run quieter due to larger coolers. Here's a look at the specs for the various cards that at least plausibly compete with the 3090 Ti.\u00a0Swipe to scroll horizontallyGPU SpecificationsGraphics CardRTX 3090 Ti AsusRTX 3090 TiRTX 3090RTX 3080 TiRTX 3080RX 6900 XTArchitectureGA102GA102GA102GA102GA102Navi 21Process TechnologySamsung 8NSamsung 8NSamsung 8NSamsung 8NSamsung 8NTSMC N7Transistors (Billion)28.328.328.328.328.326.8Die size (mm^2)628.4628.4628.4628.4628.4519SMs / CUs848482806880GPU Cores1075210752104961024087045120Tensor Cores336336328320272N/ART Cores848482806880Boost Clock (MHz)1950 (OC mode)18601695166517102250VRAM Speed (Gbps)212119.5191916VRAM (GB)242424121016VRAM Bus Width384384384384320256ROPs11211211211296128TMUs336336328320272320TFLOPS FP32 (Boost)41.94035.634.129.823TFLOPS FP16 (Tensor)168 (335)160 (320)142 (285)136 (273)119 (238)N/ART TFLOPS81.978.169.566.658.1N/ABandwidth (GBps)10081008936912760512TDP (watts)480450350350320300Launch DateMar 2022Mar 2022Sep 2020Jun 2021Sep 2020Dec 2020MSRP$2,099 $1,999 $1,499 $1,199 $699 $999 Online Price$2,149 $2,008 $1,919 $1,299 $969 $1,149 The RTX 3090 Ti represents the culmination of Nvidia's Ampere architecture, featuring the now fully enabled GA102 GPU. That's the same GPU in the 3090, 3080 Ti, and both variants of the 3080, just with two extra SMs compared to the GeForce RTX 3090 that launched way back in September of 2020. 19 months later, we're getting a minor boost to core counts, a modest boost to clock speeds \u2014 on both the GPU and the GDDR6X memory \u2014 and a rather large kick in the pants to the price and power consumption.\n\nThat last bit is sort of interesting. We recently reported on some testing by Igor's Lab where he limited the 3090 Ti to 300W. It dropped performance down to the level of the RTX 3080 Ti, but with lower power than the RTX 3080 and even AMD's RX 6800 XT (using non-reference cards). Nvidia has effectively gone about as far as possible to the right on the voltage, power, and frequency curve, eking out the last few ounces of performance. Then Asus takes that just a bit further and squeezes another 90MHz out of the chip.\n\nWe do have to wonder how much of the power goes to the GDDR6X memory, which is notorious for using power and generating heat. Nvidia has switched to 16Gb modules rated at 21Gbps for the 3090 Ti, so the memory can all be on one side of the PCB and thus benefits from improved cooling \u2014 and we saw that in our testing as well, with the Asus card never getting above 100C on the GDDR6X, regardless of workload. We even overclocked the memory to 23Gbps and still stayed under 100C while running a mining test \u2014 but only managed 124 MH/s sustained for Ethereum, which is just 2 MH/s higher than a good RTX 3090, despite the difference in memory speed.\n\nOn paper, the RTX 3090 Ti is 12% faster than the 3090 on compute and has 8% more memory bandwidth. Running in OC mode (not the default Gaming mode), Asus tacks on 5% in core clocks, meaning in theory the card could be up to 18% faster than the reference RTX 3090. In practice, it will be quite a bit less than that, as we'll see soon.Asus GeForce RTX 3090 Ti TUF Gaming OCImage 1 of 13(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Asus provided its GeForce RTX 3090 Ti TUF Gaming OC for this review, a large card that includes the relatively common (for an extreme GPU) triple fans, and occupies 3.2 slots. It's not quite as chunky as the RTX 3090 Ti Founders Edition, which is slightly thinner but weighs 2189g (or at least, that's what the 3090 FE weighed) and measures 313x138x57 mm. The Asus card tips the scale at 'only' 1676g, practically a featherweight! But it measures 326x104x63mm. It's a physically impressive card, which is a bit of a given considering the silicon and its cooling needs.\n\nThe packaging is equally imposing, with a long box that consists of a sheath over a slightly unusual interior box that has chopped-off corners. It looks somewhat cool, but it was actually quite difficult to open. For something that's just going to end up on a shelf or recycling center, Asus probably could have stuck with a traditional box.\n\nThe Asus RTX 3090 Ti TUF includes three DisplayPort 1.4 and two HDMI 2.1 outputs, which is slightly unusual as most cards these days only include up to four outputs. The IO bracket is still only two slots wide, which seems a bit odd considering the card more than occupies three slots. A wider bracket would have provided a bit of extra support, and unlike EVGA's GPU leash, Asus doesn't include anything extra in the package to deal with card sag.\n\nPower comes via the new PCIe 5.0 16-pin connector, which is compatible with Nvidia's 12-pin connector as well. Included in the package is an adapter that takes three 8-pin inputs to drive the 12-pin output, providing a theoretical (in spec) power delivery of up to 450W, plus another 75W from the PCIe slot. While we don't typically disassemble GPUs, it's worth noting that Asus has a dedicated VRAM heatsink that's designed to help wick heat away from the memory. As we'll see later, it definitely works, and memory temperatures weren't an issue during testing.\n\nUnlike Asus' higher tier ROG Strix line, the amount of RGB lighting on the TUF Gaming is relatively subdued. Only the small trapezoidal TUF logo on the top of the card lights up \u2014 there's no lighting on the fans or the rest of the shroud. Those who like a lot of bling will probably want to look at other alternatives, but if you prefer a more subdued look, the TUF Gaming performs well and has everything you could want.Test Setup for GeForce RTX 3090 Ti(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)TOM'S HARDWARE 2022 GPU TEST PCIntel Core i9-12900K\nMSI Pro Z690-A WiFi DDR4\nCorsair 2x16GB DDR4-3600 CL16\nCrucial P5 Plus 2TB\nCooler Master MWE 1250 V2 Gold\nCooler Master PL360 Flux\nCooler Master HAF500\nWindows 11 Pro 64-bit\u00a0Our GPU test PC and gaming suite was updated in early 2022. We're now using a Core i9-12900K processor, MSI Pro Z690-A DDR4 WiFi motherboard, and DDR4-3600 memory (with XMP enabled). We also upgraded to Windows 11 to ensure we get the most out of Alder Lake. You can see the rest of the hardware in the boxout.\n\nOur gaming tests consist of a \"standard\" suite of eight games without ray tracing enabled (even if the game supports it), and a separate \"ray tracing\" suite of six games that all use multiple RT effects. For this review, we'll be testing at 4K, 1440p, and 1080p at \"ultra\" settings \u2014 which generally means maxed out settings, except without SSAA if that's an option. We also enable DLSS Quality mode in the games that support it, which includes all of the ray-tracing suite and three of the games in the standard suite.\n\nBesides the gaming tests, we also have a collection of professional and content creation benchmarks that can leverage the GPU. We're using SPECviewperf 2020 v3, Blender 3.10, OTOY Octane, and Vray. Those last three all focus on 3D rendering and support Nvidia's RTX GPUs; only Blender 3.10 currently provides GPU rendering acceleration on AMD's RX 6000 cards. SPECviewperf consists of a suite of professional applications, including CAD/CAM, medical and 3D rendering.Asus GeForce RTX 3090 Ti: 4K Gaming PerformanceImage 1 of 9(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)This is currently the fastest and most expensive graphics card, so 4K ultra makes sense \u2014 and Nvidia even pushes 8K gaming as an option, though that will generally require DLSS support to get to reasonable framerates. We can't test 8K, as we don't have an 8K monitor, but the 4K results should at least give you an idea of what to expect when you try to render four times as many pixels.\n\nKeeping in mind that we're dealing with a factory overclocked card compared to a bunch of reference clocked models, we're still pleasantly surprised to see a solid 10% performance uplift overall, when comparing the Asus RTX 3090 Ti TUF Gaming OC against the RTX 3090 Founders Edition. That might not seem like much, considering the $500 (theoretical) increase in price, but let's just point to the 3090 and 3080 Ti: $300 more in that case only gets you 3.4% more performance on average. Another interesting comparison of course is the RTX 3080 Ti against the original 3080 10GB, where $500 extra also bought 10% more performance. Against the RTX 3080, which remains our pick for the best graphics card, even when priced closer to $1,000 than its official $699 MSRP, the RTX 3090 Ti delivers 25% better performance overall.\n\nLet's also not count AMD out. While there's no question the RTX 3090 Ti is faster than AMD's RX 6900 XT, it's only an 18% gap in our standard test suite on average. That's in the best-case scenario for the Nvidia GPU, testing at 4K ultra. There are even games like Forza Horizon 5 where the 6900 XT still comes out ahead, albeit by a slim 4% margin. Generally speaking, Nvidia can win via brute force, but it's using about 50% more power and costs about twice as much as AMD's top offering.\n\nNvidia also likes to promote DLSS, not just as a solution for games with ray tracing, but for any game. Using the Quality mode, which at 4K looks very nearly the same as native, let's check out the three games that support DLSS. Horizon Zero Dawn performance improves by 30%, Watch Dogs Legion gets a 35% boost\u2026 and Red Dead Redemption 2 only gets a 15% improvement. Not all game engines are created equal, and apparently the way DLSS was shoehorned into RDR2 \u2014 over 18 months after launch, no less \u2014 proves this point. The gains are even less at lower resolutions.Image 1 of 7(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Flipping over to our ray tracing test suite, the DLSS story changes completely. DLSS might be a nice extra on a card like the Asus RTX 3090 Ti in traditional games, but if you want to run maxed out ray traced settings, it becomes absolutely necessary at 4K. The 3090 Ti barely manages to squeak past the 30 fps mark at native, and half of the games fell well short of that mark. Turn on DLSS and performance nearly doubles, from 32 fps to 60 fps.\n\nWe don't have DLSS results for all of the cards in our charts, just because they start to get very crowded, so we'll just focus on the native performance for the remaining comparisons. It's interesting to see the Asus 3090 Ti outpace the reference RTX 3090 by 14% overall, which is close to the theoretical maximum. The Asus card has a 1950MHz boost clock in OC mode, whereas the RTX 3090 Founders Edition has a 1695MHz boost clock, giving a maximum difference of 15%.\n\nWhile a 14% gap might not seem like much, again look at the other cards. The 3090 is only 3% faster than the 3080 Ti, which is 16% faster than the 3080 10GB card. Note also that the overclocked MSI 3080 12GB is 12% faster than the 3080 Founders Edition, nearly matching the 3080 Ti, so memory bandwidth is certainly a big factor in overall performance at 4K. The Asus 3090 Ti still only beats the RTX 3080 by 37%, so it's very much a case of diminishing returns. Meanwhile, it's 88% faster than AMD's best \u2014 and 250% faster if we enable DLSS.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how much uptake there is for AMD's FSR 2.0 once it releases to the public in the next couple of months. It will also be interesting to see if AMD starts equipping its future GPUs with matrix hardware (i.e. tensor cores), which is something Intel is doing as well with its Arc graphics cards. Considering Intel's XeSS is more of a direct competitor to DLSS, and it will also work on non-Intel GPUs, perhaps AMD will join Intel in combating DLSS in the future. It sure would be nice if we could have one universal solution for upscaling that all three companies could get behind, but I'll eat my GPU hat if that happens.Asus GeForce RTX 3090 Ti: 1440p Gaming PerformanceImage 1 of 9(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Dropping down to 1440p, the advantage of the 3090 Ti relative to the competition shrinks a bit. It's now only 7% faster than the vanilla RTX 3090, 20% faster than the RTX 3080 10GB, and 6% faster than the RX 6900 XT. Without a faster CPU providing data to the graphics cards, we're already starting to see CPU bottlenecks \u2014 Far Cry 6, Flight Simulator, and Horizon Zero Dawn are clearly running out of steam.\n\nDLSS quality mode further proves that point. The overhead associated with DLSS means it only boosts performance a small amount in some cases. Watch Dogs Legion still got a 17% uplift, but performance in Horizon Zero Dawn and Red Dead Redemption 2 only went up about 7%. Buying a card like the RTX 3090 Ti for traditional games, even at maxed out settings, doesn't make a lot of sense unless you have a 4K or perhaps ultrawide 1440p monitor.Image 1 of 7(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)But, if you're really into ray tracing effects and the most demanding games around, native 1440p can very much make use of a faster GPU. The Asus 3090 Ti still beat the vanilla 3090 by 13% on average, for example. It was also 30% faster than the 3080 10GB, and 75% faster than AMD's RX 6900 XT \u2014 and again, enabling DLSS pays huge dividends, improving the Asus card's results by 60% overall.\n\nLooking at the individual charts, the Asus 3090 Ti just barely breaks 60 fps on average in our six DXR games, but it falls below 50 fps in three of the games. With DLSS enabled, all six games are comfortably above the 60 fps mark, and if you have a high refresh rate G-Sync (or G-Sync Compatible) display, you can get a very smooth gaming experience.\n\nBut who are we kidding? This card is very much overkill for most gamers. You'll be better off waiting for the next generation GPUs later this year rather than plunking down two grand on just a graphics card now.Asus GeForce RTX 3090 Ti: 1080p Gaming PerformanceImage 1 of 9(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Okay, we see you rolling your eyes over there. Yes, 1080p gaming on an RTX 3090 Ti represents a very imbalanced workload. It's still 5% faster than the old RTX 3090, but you could get most of that with a factory overclocked 3090 card 18 months ago. For nearly triple the theoretical price, the RTX 3090 Ti is only about 15% faster than the RTX 3080 at 1080p. It's also basically tied with the RX 6900 XT, which now claims wins in half of the games in our test suite.\n\nNot surprisingly, DLSS can't do much here either. The best result was in Red Dead Redemption 2, where performance improved by 4%. Not that you really need DLSS at 1080p with this sort of GPU, but CPU bottlenecks are very present in nearly all of the games. Flight Simulator is particularly bad, with performance that's only slightly higher than at 1440p, meaning it's almost entirely CPU limited.Image 1 of 14(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Our DXR test suite still proves pretty demanding, however. All of the games can break 60 fps and then some, but the 3090 Ti still averaged 11% higher performance than the reference RTX 3090, and 27% better performance than the RTX 3080. AMD's RX 6900 XT still trails by 40%, and it can't even average 60 fps in four of the six games we tested. Turn on DLSS and the Nvidia advantage grows even more.\n\nBased on what we know of the hardware, AMD's ray accelerators are about half as fast as the RT cores in Nvidia's Ampere GPUs. It's actually even worse than that, considering AMD's GPU clocks at over 2.3GHz in testing, while the Asus 3090 Ti sits closer to 2GHz. So 84 RT cores against 80 ray accelerators, and even at 1080p ultra the Nvidia GPU is 66% faster on average.\n\nIt's also interesting to look at Nvidia's previous generation Turing GPUs, though. The RTX 2080 Ti has 68 RT cores running at around 1.7GHz, and it's still within striking distance of AMD's RX 6900 XT. The 2080 Ti was faster in Cyberpunk 2077 and Minecraft, while AMD's card came out ahead in the other games. How much will AMD improve RT performance with RDNA3, and will Nvidia also find new ways to improve performance with Ada? We'll find out later this year.Asus GeForce RTX 3090 Ti: Professional and Content Creation PerformanceGPUs aren't just for gaming, they can be used for professional workloads, AI training and inferencing, and more. We're looking to expand some of our GPU testing, particularly for extreme GPUs like the RTX 3090 Ti. For now, we have a few 3D rendering applications that leverage ray tracing hardware, plus the SPECviewperf 2020 v3 test suite. We'll start there.Image 1 of 9(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)SPECviewperf 2020 consists of eight different benchmarks. We've also included an \"overall\" chart that uses the geometric mean of the eight results to generate an aggregate score. Note that this is not an official score, but it gives equal weight to the individual tests and provides a high level overview of performance. Few professionals use all of these programs, however, so it's generally more important to look at the results for the applications you plan to use.\n\nWhat's immediately interesting is just how far ahead of the other GPUs the Titan RTX sits. That's because Nvidia provides some driver level enhancements to its Titan cards, and despite the Titan-esque price the RTX 3090 Ti doesn't get the same treatment. Flipping through the individual test results, it's mostly thanks to a massive lead in the snx-04 (Siemens NX) test that the Titan RTX gets the overall lead, though it also ranks first in the catia-06 and creo-03 tests.\n\nThe RTX 3090 Ti does nab several victories as well, claiming top marks in 3dsmax-07, energy-03, maya-06, and solidworks-07. AMD's GPUs meanwhile deliver mixed results. They're in the bottom half of the 3dsmax, catia, creo, and maya charts, but the RX 6900 XT takes second place in the energy test suite, gets the top result in medical-03, and the AMD cards are over three times as fast as the GeForce cards in snx-04 \u2014 only the Titan RTX beats them, by another 4X factor.Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Next up, Blender is a popular rendering application that has been used to make full-length films. We're using the latest Blender Benchmark, which uses Blender 3.10 and three tests. Blender 3.10 includes the new Cycles X engine that leverages ray tracing hardware on both AMD and Nvidia GPUs.\n\nAs with the DXR gaming test suite, AMD's GPUs fall far behind Nvidia's offerings when it comes to RT hardware, at least as evidenced by Blender. Overall, the RTX 3090 Ti delivers over three times the performance of the RX 6900 XT.\u00a0We also uncovered a bug with AMD's current drivers, where having PCIe Resizable BAR enabled caused a massive hit to Blender 3.10 rendering performance. That should be corrected in a future driver release, but if you're using Blender on an AMD GPU right now, you'll want to disable ReBAR in the BIOS.Image 1 of 7(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)OTOY Octane is another popular rendering engine, but unlike Blender, it doesn't have support for AMD's RX 6000 series GPUs. As such, we've limited our charts to Nvidia GPUs, where the RTX 3090 Ti unsurprisingly takes the top spot, delivering 6% higher performance than the standard RTX 3090. Most likely, these rendering applications depend more on memory bandwidth than GPU compute, which is why all three end up being around 6% faster with the 3090 Ti.\n\nNvidia also notes that there are rendering workloads that the RTX 3090 Ti (and 3090 and Titan RTX) can handle that simply fail on GPUs that don't have as much VRAM. This is true, and it's why true professional GPUs like the Nvidia RTX A6000 come with a whopping 48GB of VRAM. Comparative benchmarks however become meaningless when you can't even run the test on most graphics cards.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Like Octane, Chaos V-ray also lacks support for AMD's GPUs at present, so we've only tested the Nvidia RTX cards. Also like Octane, it has an older CUDA rendering path as well as support for a newer RTX path that leverages Nvidia's RT cores. The RTX mode boosts performance by about 30% on the newer Ampere GPUs, while the Titan RTX ran 40% faster.\n\n[Note: We're still looking for a good AI / machine learning benchmark, \"good\" meaning it's easy to run, preferably on Windows systems, and that the results are relevant. We don't want something that only works on Nvidia GPUs, or AMD GPUs, or that requires tensor cores. Ideally, it will use tensor cores if available (Nvidia RTX and Intel Arc), or GPU cores if not (GTX GPUs and AMD's current consumer lineup). If you have any suggestions, please contact me \u2014 DM me in the forums, or send me an email. Thanks!]Asus GeForce RTX 3090 Ti: Power, Temps, Noise, Etc.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Up to now, we've talked about performance and hinted that power use might be just a bit high. Now's the time for the rubber to meet the road as we check out real-world power consumption, using our Powenetics testing hardware and software. We capture in-line GPU power consumption by collecting data while looping Metro Exodus at 1440p ultra as well as while running the FurMark stress test at 1600x900. Our test PC for power testing remains the same old Core i9-9900K as we've used previously, to keep results consistent. We tested the Asus card in all three of its standard modes: Default (Gaming), OC, and Silent. These modes can be selected in Asus' GPU Tweak II utility.Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)So, this is interesting. Starting with the Metro Exodus results, we're probably running into CPU bottlenecks. Peak power use was \"only\" 438W, in both the default mode as well as in OC model. Silent mode did drop power use a bit, but unfortunately it looks like we may need to update our testing methodology for cards like this.\n\nFlipping over to FurMark, at least we got some separation, and this likely tracks closer with the limits imposed by the card's firmware. In the default mode, we saw average power use of nearly 470W, the OC mode bumped that up to over 490W, and the Silent mode dropped the card to just over 440W. That's now the highest power use we've seen from a GPU in recent years without end-user overclocking, by about 80W. Perhaps there are some custom RTX 3090 or RX 6900 XT cards that came close to this level, but we didn't get those in for testing.\n\nThese results aren't particularly surprising. More GPU cores at much higher clocks, with higher clocked GDDR6X memory all combine to substantially increase power consumption. I used to think the early rumors of 600W RTX 4090 cards later this year were ludicrous. Now such talk feels more like a sense of inevitability.Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Even in the \"slowest\" Silent profile, average clocks during our Metro testing were at 2GHz, and the OC mode boosted that up to 2074MHz. We've seen much higher core clocks from AMD's RX 6000 GPUs, but they're architected to run at higher speeds and tend not to be quite so power hungry. If the move from the 3090's 1850MHz to the 3090 Ti's 2074MHz needs 75W more power, just imagine how much juice a 2.5GHz Ampere GPU would need! Or don't \u2014 we'll probably find out with Ada, though.\n\nClock speeds in FurMark were quite a bit slower, as expected. Unlike in a game, FurMark puts a major load on the GPU and tends to use more power per clock than just about any other workload. Clocks averaged just over 1.6GHz \u00a0here, with the OC profile, 1.44GHz with the default Gaming profile, and dropped to 1.23GHz in Silent mode.Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Asus does a great job at keeping the 3090 Ti GPU cool, with average temperatures of 65C in all three of the performance profiles while running Metro. FurMark as usual pushed things a bit harder, but only up to 67C in the OC mode. Fan speeds basically followed temperatures. In both the gaming and FurMark tests, there was only a 100 RPM difference between the Silent and OC modes.\n\nWe measured noise levels at 10cm using an SPL (sound pressure level) meter as well. The SPL was aimed right at the GPU fans in order to minimize the impact of other fans like those on the CPU cooler. The noise floor of our test environment and equipment measures 33 dB(A). Because we used a gaming workload for noise testing, there was less of a difference between the modes. After about 15 minutes, the Silent mode stabilized at around 48.9 dB(A), while the Gaming and OC modes were just a hair louder at 49.1 dB(A). GPU Tweak II reported fan speed of 74%, which means there wasn't a ton of headroom available, but noise and temperature levels were overall very good.Asus GeForce RTX 3090 Ti: Hail to the King(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)There are many ways of looking at the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti. It's a prosumer content creation card that's only moderately faster than its predecessor, at an even higher price. It's also the fastest graphics card for gaming currently available, still at an obscenely high price. One thing it's not is a full Titan RTX replacement, and we can only guess that Nvidia had too many people buying comparatively inexpensive Titan cards and opting out of the former Quadro and current A-series lineups that can cost twice as much.\n\nThere's no question of whether the RTX 3090 Ti represents a good value. In terms of FPS per dollar spent, out of the 57 graphics cards we've tested in our GPU benchmarks hierarchy, the RTX 3090 Ti ranks 56th \u2014 only the Radeon VII represents a worse value. At the same time, we need to put things in perspective. If you're the type who has the money and wants the fastest hardware possible, the RTX 3090 Ti does improve performance by about 10% over the RTX 3090, which still goes for $1,900 at the time of writing. Again, not that you should buy such a GPU, but by that metric you could argue it's worth the extra $100.\n\nThe real concern with the RTX 3090 Ti isn't its performance or price, however, it's the fact that it comes so late to the Ampere party. The RTX 3090 was released in September 2020, 19 months ago, and all indications are that we'll get the next-generation Ada GPUs this coming September. We have no idea how much they'll cost, but there's effectively zero chance that a hypothetical RTX 4090 won't be faster than the RTX 3090 Ti \u2014 and it might even cost less.\n\nIf Nvidia keeps with its recent pattern of GPU launches, though, an RTX 4090 should be the least of your worries. We'll probably also get an RTX 4080 that delivers 30\u201340% more performance than the RTX 3090 Ti with a price of $999 or less. There's also the fact that GPU prices are trending down this year, finally, and have dropped over 35% since the start of the year. We expect that trend to continue, and there are even reports that AMD and Nvidia are both entering a state of oversupply.\n\nHowever you look at things, splurging on a short-lived king of the hill doesn't make a lot of sense to us. But if you're flush with cash, or you do the sort of work where upgrading to a $2,000 graphics card that's only 5\u201310% faster than your current card will pay for itself in a few months, this is the card to get. Buyer's remorse might kick in once the next generation parts arrive, but you can then sell off the 3090 Ti (at a loss) and upgrade again, ensuring you stay on top of the GPU pecking order.MORE:\u00a0Best Graphics CardsMORE:\u00a0GPU Benchmarks and HierarchyMORE:\u00a0All Graphics ContentAsus GeForce RTX 3090 Ti: Price Comparison No price informationCheck Amazon No price informationCheck WalmartWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nasus\nGeForce RTX 3090\nTitan\nGeForce\nrtx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (7)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

I'm sure streamers will hawk the 3090 Ti like crazy since they all get one for free.\n\nIf any \"average gamers\" purchase one of these things, I'd be genuinely curious as to why.

With ultra quality settings for the most part I am barely able to maintain 60FPS on the ground or at low level. In clouds or more dense metro area scenery it can drop to 45-50FPS. But there are deeper extended terrain/tree quality and dense building/dense cloud settings that make a difference as well and that's where I'm at. Another 10FPS would help get that solid 60FPS smoothness when panning around the cockpit. However, I'm sure not going to sell my original bought $1,399USD card (bought last summer on a NewEgg shuffle) to spend $3K minus whatever I could get that 3080 Ti for. Let's see what the 4-series comes up with, which based on Nvidia's history should first be the 4080 then the 4070 and lower tiers before the top dog 4080 Ti and follow up 4090 and 4090 Ti. That is of course assuming that world stability does not get worse.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPEnns\n\n\nThere, I fixed the click-bait title for you:\n\n Asus GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Review: Witness the Power Draw!!\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 7 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeydous NJ98-CP V2 HE Review: Dedicated calculators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicron 4600 2TB SSD Review: The New Baseline in SSDs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogitech G Pro X Superlight 2 Dex Review: A very close second\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASRock PG-1600G Phantom Gaming power supply review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID-Cooling FX 360 INF Pink Review: Stylishly pink, but loud in more ways than one\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewSonic XG2536 25-inch FHD IPS 280 Hz gaming monitor review: Incredibly quick and value priced\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWD Black SN7100 SSD Review: The power efficiency king, with caveats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D Review: Stunning gaming performance meets top-tier productivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacBook Air (M4, 2025) review: Blue skies ahead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple Mac Studio (Early 2025) Review: Renewed vigor with M4 Max and M3 Ultra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

You\u2019ll be wanting a bonafide PC for this new mod, though, as it adds some GPU-intensive but rather lovely ray tracing to Doom\u2019s first three episodes. There\u2019s DLSS support too!\n\nWhereas Quake II RTX was partly an official Nvidia effort, this is a  proper indie mod, freely available on GitHub from its creator sultim-t. Hark, a trailer:\n\n\n\nDoom Classic: RAY TRACED - Trailer\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\nAw, isn\u2019t that nice. The mod originally launched on April 1st, but it\u2019s no joke, and has already received a couple of updates to smooth out some issues and tone down the heavy bloom you can see in the trailer. There is one catch, besides only the first three episodes being included: right now ray tracing only works on Nvidia graphics cards. Granted, even our own best graphics cards list is a bit of a GeForce-fest at the moment, but keep in mind that AMD Radeon cards aren\u2019t currently compatible even if they can handle ray tracing in other, much more modern games.\nThere were mumblings all the way back in 2019, when Quake II RTX launched, that Nvidia\u2019s Lightspeed Studios would begin a side hustle in ray traced remasters of other old classics. Such results never materialised, though, with Lightspeed Studios focusing on the likes of Minecraft RTX and games for the Android-based Nvidia Shield, along with chipping on the Nintendo Switch ports of Portal and Portal 2.\nIn this particular case, it\u2019s been the long-active Doom modding community that\u2019s stepped in instead. All the necessary files and installation instructions are, again, on GitHub; note that to have DLSS help offset the performance cost of ray tracing, you\u2019ll need to download and add the .dll file separately.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            Before you brush your teeth tonight, remember to install Doom on your electric toothbrush\n          \n\n\n\n            The next weird device to run Doom?

He has over a decade\u2019s experience in testing/writing about tech and games, something you can probably tell from his hairline.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nView comments (22)    \n\n\nIn this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoom\n\n\nXbox 360, \n            Nintendo GBA, \n            PC, \n            Nintendo Switch\n\n\n  Follow\n \n\n\n\n\nRelated topics\n\nDLSS\nRay Tracing\n\n\n\n\n\n        Rock Paper Shotgun is better when you sign in\n      \n\n        Sign in and join us on our journey to discover strange and compelling PC games.\n      \n\n\n\n\nSign in with Google\n\n\nSign in with Facebook\n\n\nSign in with Twitter\n\n\nSign in with Reddit\n\n\n\nSign in with email    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest On Doom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Doom mod is made from Id Software's abandoned and rejected ideas                    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoom At 30: The developers of your favourite boomer shooters share their favourite things about Doom                    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoom At 30: Siren is a great intro to the hellish world of Doom total conversions                    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoom At 30: MyHouse.wad is an extraordinary mod that asks, \"What if Doom was an ultra creepy horror game?\"                    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoom At 30: The evolution of Doom through its first levels                    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoom At 30: Does 1993's Doom still hold up for a first-time player today?

So, naturally, folks looking for a top-tier future-proof graphics card will be looking at competition from AMD before they drop north of a couple of thousand dollars. Thankfully, Team Red has an enthusiast-class GPU that\u00a0challenges Nvidia's best, and it goes by the name AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT. AMD's offering has an MSRP of $999, but the partners like MSI and Sapphire hawk their custom versions for around $1,300 via online and offline outlets. \nAMD, as usual, is undercutting its rival in terms of pricing, but there are a few aspects worth keeping in mind before going with either choice. Starting with the areas where the AMD GPU reigns supreme, the Radeon RX 6900 XT offers a boost GPU frequency of 2250 MHz, while its Nvidia rival can only reach 1860 MHz, and the same applies for base frequency figures as well. In addition, the AMD flagship also draws in 300W of power and can run on an 850W power supply unit, while the RTX 3090 Ti has a 450W requirement.\nRelated:\u00a0Watch Nvidia's New AI Turn 2D Photos Into A 3D Scene\nBut there are a few critical areas where the RTX 3090 Ti leaves its AMD competitor far behind. The top-tier Nvidia graphics card pushes the raw performance to 40 teraflops, while the Radeon RX 6900 XT only musters up to 23.04 teraflops of computing power. Nvidia's flagship comes armed with 24GB of GDDR6X memory ticking at 21 Gbps and offering a peak bandwidth of over 1000 Gbps. AMD's Radeon RX 6900 XT offers 16GB of GDDR6 memory with a lower 16 Gbps output and half the memory bandwidth of its Nvidia rival at 512 Gbps. The memory bus width is another key parameter where the Nvidia option proves to be a better value. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti\u00a0has\u00a0a 384-bit memory interface, while AMD's crown-jewel employs the 256-bit memory interface. \n                        Again, It Comes Down To Price And Power Dynamics\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComing to the core specs, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti packs in 10,752 CUDA cores. Interestingly, Nvidia is shifting away from the dual 8-pin connector seen on the standard GeForce RTX 3090 in favor of a PCI 5.0-ready 16-pin power connector. And then there's support for the whole slate of proprietary Nvidia solutions such as DLSS, Resizable Bar, ShadowPlay, Omniverse, G-Sync and Reflex, among others. But availability remains an issue, especially in times of an industry-wide shortage and scalpers spoiling it for everyone. The only place to buy a Founders Edition RTX 3090 Ti, Best Buy, has an out-of-stock status. Zotac has the Extreme Holo Edition available, but the brand's online store is selling it at a $100 markup.\nOver on AMD's side, the Radeon RX 6900 XT packs 80 compute units and an equal number of ray accelerators. Just like Nvidia, AMD also sells its enthusiast-class GPU with a serving of in-house technologies such as AMD Fidelity FX, Radeon Image Sharpening, FreeSync, Radeon Anti-Lag and Radeon Boost, to name a few. The AMD flagship is significantly more affordable than Nvidia's, but the RTX 3090 Ti offers more memory that is also faster and more performance teraflops to go with it. It is hard to judge the winner here without credible third-party benchmark comparisons. But really, all one has to think about is if that additional firepower and suite of features on Nvidia's flagship are worth the extra few hundred dollars.\nNext:\u00a0M1 Ultra Vs.

Likewise, employees can profit from a liberal representative stock buy program, and Nvidia has focused on pay equality since 2015. Attributable to acquisitions made in 2021, the orientation pay hole enlarged, and the advancement rate for Black workers dropped compared with 2020. The organization has noticed the issue and promises to amend the two cases.\n\nAlong with creating the graphics card, NVIDIA excels in the company's focus on accelerated computing \u2014 an evergrowing type of computing at the crossroads of graphics, high-performance computing, and artificial intelligence\u2014 transforming healthcare and manufacturing, transportation, and much more.\nSource: Fortune\n\u00a0\n\nNVIDIA employs upwards of 9,440 U.S.-based employees in its company. In the recent surveys compiled by Fortune, a staggering 95% of employees agree that the company is a great place to work. The study shows that 97% are proud to be company employees and would not be embarrassed to say so. A large percentage (96%) feel that NVIDIA would only let go or lay off any of their employees as a final option. The management has shown to be not only ethical but honest with each of their staff members, and 95% of employees feel that NVIDIA does a significant amount for the community and would also do what it takes to complete their tasks.\nSource: Fortune\nThe most significant percentage of employees that stay with the company is 34%.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I write about disruptive companies, technologies and usage models.Follow AuthorApr 07, 2022, 08:38pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 2 years old.The Drive Atlan SoC. NVIDIA\nIn my 2021 coverage of NVIDIA's GTC, I said that I hoped to be in person again at GTC 2022, but it was another year of virtual attendance. Two weeks ago, NVIDIA held its annual GTC Event, and the company made fourteen new product, service, or customer announcements.\n\n\nI have covered some of NVIDIA's GTC 2022 on Twitter per my conversation with CEO Jensen Huang and in the Six Five Podcast with Futurum Research\u2019s Daniel Newman. In this coverage, I want to mainly cover the automotive announcements. Let's jump right in.\n\nNVIDIA Drive Hyperion 9\n\nThe DRIVE Hyperion 9 Platform is NVIDIA's next-generation software-defined autonomous platform for automated and autonomous vehicles. NVIDIA Drive Hyperion 9 is said it improve in compute power and sensor redundancy. For autonomous platforms, compute power and sensor redundancy go hand-in-hand.\n\n\nThe more computing power of a system, the better and faster an autonomous vehicle is able to make its driving decision. NVIDIA says DRIVE Hyperion 9 will have double the performance of the current DRIVE Orin-based architecture in the same power envelope. The DRIVE Atlan SoC leverages NVIDIA's Grace GPU architecture, Arm CPU cores, and deep learning and computer vision accelerators which are important to the redundancy of the platform. In my coverage of the last-generation Hyperion 8 platform, NVIDIA left some headroom for AI computing within the DRIVE Atlan SoC for Level 4 autonomous driving. I believe I was right on that, and with double the performance over the last generation, it is more than capable of level 4 autonomous driving.\nNVIDIA calls the DRIVE Hyperion the vehicle's \u201cnervous system\u201d and DRIVE Orin as the brain. It sometimes blows my mind to think that the brain is a critical nervous system component, but accurate. I think NVIDIA and every big player in the autonomous vehicle space should see its respective AV platform as what it is replacing, the brain and the senses. While I sometimes think I have double the brain performance of some drivers on the road, it is difficult to imagine that NVIDIA has managed to double the performance of its DRIVE Hyperion 9 platform. It is to NVIDIA's advantage to have a full vertical stack within its AI, automotive, robotics, safety, and Datacenters technologies. That is the name of the game in this space right now. It\u2019s no longer to throw a bag of parts over the wall like NXP does and call it a day. Platforms matter.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\nThe sensors of a Lucid vehicle. Source NVIDIANVIDIA\n\nI have said before that the more redundancy of a system, the easier it is for the brains of these platforms to make a decision. To go back to the nervous system analogy, just as the brain is important for the driver in processing the sensory data to make a decision, having two eyes, a vestibular (balance) system, and even a sense of touch. If Spiderman is driving, wouldn't he be a better driver than the average person with his Spidey senses? Joking aside, the more cameras and sensors of a vehicle, the more data to process and the more data to process, the better a vehicle's decision. NVIDIA says DRIVE Atlan can process more sensor data, including imaging radar, enhanced cameras with higher frame rates, two additional side lidar, and improved undercarriage sensing with a better camera and ultrasonic placement. That brings the total sensing count to 14 cameras, nine radars, three LIdars, 20 ultrasonics, three in-cabin cameras, and one radar for interior occupant sensing. That is a lot of sensors, and the ability of the Atlan SoC to process all that data and make it a safe and calculated driving decision is a feat of its own.\n\n\nNVIDIA DRIVE Map\nNVIDIA announced a multimodal mapping platform for Level 3 and Level 4 autonomous driving. Mapping is another important component of autonomous driving, considering AV platforms need a specific level of infrastructure and presuppositions for the road. An AV cannot follow the rules of the road if it does not already know the rules of the road, and having a map with layers of data lays the foundation for that data.\nNVIDIA says DRIVE Map contains multiple localization layers of data for use with the camera, radar, and lidar modalities and says the AI driver can localize to each layer of the map independently. Each layer is useful for different information; the camera layer is best for seeing lane dividers, road markings, traffic lights, signs, and poles; the radar layer is useful in poor road conditions and at night; the lidar is useful for building a 3-dimensional representation of the world at a 5cm resolution.\nThis type of mapping data tacks on an extra layer of redundancy that I did not even think about and is something that, like human drivers, we do without thinking. Imagine that time you were driving to work (back when everyone drove to work), and the road on your main route was under construction. You were aware that your main route adds extra minutes to your commute from a previous time driving on that route, so you decided to take a different route. In the same way, NVIDIA DRIVE Map provides extra presuppositional information to the AI driver that is then updated and enhanced with the vehicle's own redundancy. The example I gave from the human experience was within the boundaries of which route to take, but I believe this redundancy is most applicable to the vehicle's safety. I see it as an opportunity for the AI driver to make driving decisions with the map information it already has to then be updated and changed if need be by new data, making the decision-making process more efficient and safer.DRIVE Map lidar localization layer. NVIDIA\nNVIDIA says DRIVE Map is built with two engines\u2014a ground truth survey map engine consisting of survey vehicles and a crowdsourced map engine consisting of potentially millions of passenger vehicles. The ground truth engine is based on the DeepMap survey engine and should lay the groundwork for DRIVE Map with centimeter-level accuracy, while the crowdsourced map engine offers the scalability and updates needed to expand the map.\nNot only is DRIVE Map useful for AV on the road, but also for AV deployment as an Earth-scale digital twin built within Omniverse. The Drive Map data is stored and loaded within Omniverse, where automated content generation tools create a drivable simulation. This simulation environment opens developers to test and create scenarios within an accurate digital world for testing and validation before putting it into the real world. I believe NVIDIA's digital twin could become a powerful tool for developers and carmakers in ensuring the safety of a vehicle to the public.\nPartnerships\nNVIDIA also announced partnerships with BYD and Lucid Group to adopt NVIDIA DRIVE for their next-generation EV fleets. BYD is the world's second-largest EV maker in China. EV is becoming more and more popular every year, and with many automakers making EV climate pledges, it is disrupting the industry. EV and AV go almost hand-in-hand, and I believe NVIDIA's DRIVE Hyperion platform and a tremendous asset to automakers transitioning towards AV.\nLucid Group launched its first vehicle this past year, winning Motor Trend\u2019s 2022 Car of the Year. Lucid Groups plans on using NVIDIA DRIVE as the center of its DreamDrive Pro platform. Although Lucid Group is one of the new players in the automotive space, I believe its testimony as a newcomer EV-only model further solidifies the position of NVIDIA's DRIVE platform as a leader in AV for EV.\nAlongside these partnerships, NVIDIA announced the start of production of its NVIDIA Drive Orin AV computer. DRIVE Orin has been adopted by over 25 vehicle makers across a slate of EVs, robotaxis, shuttles and trucks. NVIDIA also says its total automotive design win pipeline as increased from $8 billion to $11 billion over the next six years. I know very well how much time, effort, and R&D NVIDIA has put in its automotive plays and these results are big wins for NVIDIA. It shows that NVIDIA\u2019s automotive plays are the real deal.\nWrapping up\nThe NVIDIA Drive Hyperion 9 platform looks very promising, considering NVIDIA was able to double the performance of the last generation while increasing the processing of sensory data. It is important to understand that these platforms are replacing the most powerful computer ever made\u2014the human brain. Although I do not believe man can outdo God in creating the most powerful computer in the world, I believe in the future, these platforms will replace human drivers with a redundant number of sensors and a map.\nNVIDIA DRIVE Map looks promising, and I believe it could play an important role in the safety and efficiency of AVs. NVIDIA digital twin could also become a powerful tool for developers and carmakers in ensuring the safety of a vehicle to the public before ever driving off the car lot. Seeing major players like BYD and Lucid adopting these platforms gets me excited about the next couple of years as we see fully autonomous electric vehicles hitting the road within the next few years.\nNote: Moor Insights & Strategy co-op Jacob Freyman contributed to this article.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Moor Insights & Strategy, like all research and analyst firms, provides or has provided paid research, analysis, advising, or consulting to many high-tech companies in the industry, including 8x8, Advanced Micro Devices, Amazon, Applied Micro, ARM, Aruba Networks, AT&T, AWS, A-10 Strategies, Bitfusion, Blaize, Box, Broadcom, Calix, Cisco Systems, Clear Software, Cloudera, Clumio, Cognitive Systems, CompuCom, Dell, Dell EMC, Dell Technologies, Diablo Technologies, Digital Optics, Dreamchain, Echelon, Ericsson, Extreme Networks, Flex, Foxconn, Frame (now VMware), Fujitsu, Gen Z Consortium, Glue Networks, GlobalFoundries, Google (Nest-Revolve), Google Cloud, HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Honeywell, Huawei Technologies, IBM, Ion VR, Inseego, Infosys, Intel, Interdigital, Jabil Circuit, Konica Minolta, Lattice Semiconductor, Lenovo, Linux Foundation, MapBox, Marvell, Mavenir, Marseille Inc, Mayfair Equity, Meraki (Cisco), Mesophere, Microsoft, Mojo Networks, National Instruments, NetApp, Nightwatch, NOKIA (Alcatel-Lucent), Nortek, Novumind, NVIDIA, Nuvia, ON Semiconductor, ONUG, OpenStack Foundation, Oracle, Poly, Panasas, Peraso, Pexip, Pixelworks, Plume Design, Poly, Portworx, Pure Storage, Qualcomm, Rackspace, Rambus, Rayvolt E-Bikes, Red Hat, Residio, Samsung Electronics, SAP, SAS, Scale Computing, Schneider Electric, Silver Peak, SONY, Springpath, Spirent, Splunk, Sprint, Stratus Technologies, Symantec, Synaptics, Syniverse, Synopsys, Tanium, TE Connectivity, TensTorrent, Tobii Technology, T-Mobile, Twitter, Unity Technologies, UiPath, Verizon Communications, Vidyo, VMware, Wave Computing, Wellsmith, Xilinx, Zebra, Zededa, and Zoho which may be cited in blogs and research.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Actually, you likely heard it before that, but with the advent of Microsoft's DirectX Ray-Tracing and NVIDIA's RTX branding, ray-tracing has hit the mainstream.\n\n\r\nThe original concept of \"ray-tracing\" for 3D images actually dates all the way back to the 16th century, but the first description of the idea in computer graphics was created in 1969. That earliest algorithm was very basic and only an approximation. Ray-tracing went through various evolutions over the years until, in 1986, Jim Kajiya presented a paper called \"The rendering equation and its use in computer graphics.\" In just seven pages, Kajiya described a way to mathematically compute the physical properties of light, and it was this revelation that transformed 3D rendering.\n\n\n\n\nKajiya described his method as \"path tracing.\" It can be considered an evolution of simple ray tracing. Getting good quality out of a path tracer requires casting billions of rays. Until relatively recently, it was considered to be a completely impractical approach for real-time rendering, but it has been used in films and other offline-rendered computer graphics for over 15 years.\n\n\r\nThe advantage of path tracing is that it is a \"unified\" rendering algorithm. This means that you don't have to compute separate lighting effects like ambient occlusion, reflections, soft shadows, and so on. All lighting is done through the path tracing algorithm. This has its disadvantages, too, particularly when trying to compute path tracing on modern GPUs that are largely optimized for traditional rasterization workloads, but it is overall a huge net gain for image quality and for artists.\n\n\nDoing full path-tracing in real-time isn't completely novel; that's how Quake II RTX works, in fact. A decade ago, the Otoy Brigade team was doing software-based path-tracing. Both of these approaches make a lot of compromises, though. Brigade has limitations on the light interactions it can model, while Quake II RTX only includes very simple scenes with basic geometry and performs a maximum of two bounces per ray with just a couple of lights in each scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nWell, NVIDIA wants full-quality cinematic path-tracing in real-time, and at GTC 2022, the company showed off something very close to that. By mixing its RTXGI and RTXDI SDKs into a customized \"research renderer\", NVIDIA's graphics scientists have been able to achieve results that can be fairly-well described as \"incredible.\"\n\n\r\nThese are scenes with up to three billion triangles that are fully path-traced\u2014no rasterization\u2014being rendered at \"interactive\" frame rates despite the renderer using up to thirty bounces per ray. Some of these example scenes have as many as five-hundred thousand \"mesh lights,\" essentially individual polygons that are light sources. While these scenes don't necessarily look photographic, they're an entire grade above anything that you'll see in a video game in 2022.\n\n\n\n\nReal-Time Path Tracing In Action - Credit: NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\r\nThere aren't a lot of caveats with this technique, either. It's not like Euclideon's \"unlimited detail\" renderer from nearly a decade ago that was voxel-based and completely unsuited for games. This renderer uses standard 3D models, and fully supports animated meshes, physics, and post-processing effects, just like any other standard 3D renderer.\n\n\r\nOne way to do something faster is to work harder, but arguably a much smarter way is to reduce the amount of work you need to do. Much like with DLSS, NVIDIA's approach to accelerating path tracing has been one of approximation. Of course, it relies heavily on de-noising; the image below illustrates the effect of NVIDIA's advanced denoising filter with an evocative before-and-after comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\r\nYou aren't likely to see scenes of this complexity in games any time soon\u2014most of these scenes are barely scraping 30 FPS on a GeForce RTX 3090\u2014but these rendering techniques are already available to developers with the full-source RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI) and RTX Global Illumination (RTXGI) SDKs. Folks working in Unreal Engine can also grab binary plug-ins for that toolkit.\n\n\r\nNVIDIA's researchers are also quick to admit that there's more to be done before this path-tracer can completely replace rasterized renderers. Because much of the optimization is based on discarding the most difficult work, very difficult scenes are still slow and ugly. Likewise, certain effects, like volumetrics, play hell with the algorithms. You can see in the image below how the fog looks stippled and noisy.\n\n\n\n\n\r\nIf you have PowerPoint\u2014and you'll need the real thing, Google Docs barfs on the file\u2014you can head to NVIDIA's site and download the full 660 megabyte presentation to see the videos for yourself, but if you don't, you can check out smaller, compressed versions on Green Team researcher Aaron Lefohn's Twitter.\u00a0You can also check this NVIDIA blog post to learn more about path tracing in general.\nYou can also check this NVIDIA blog post to learn more about path tracing in general.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, games, ray tracing, (nasdaq:nvda), path tracing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

For many of us, it cleared up a misconception we did not know we had and highlighted a new service, called NVIDIA OVX, which is also part of NVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse cloud.\u00a0\nNVIDIA OVX is a new server designed to facilitate the creation and maintenance of digital twins. The misconception is that once created, a digital twin is done \u2014 when in fact, creating the digital twin is only the smallest part of the effort. Assuring it remains a twin is critical to its anticipated use and viability for simulation.\nLet me break it down for you:\nDigital twins\nA digital twin is different from a twin in the biological world. In biological terms, identical twins start to diverge as they develop and are born. They are different people. You could not ask one a question and expect them to reliably reflect what the other would say.\nBut digital twins must remain twins throughout their useful lives. Otherwise, they instead cease to be digital twins and instead become a representation of the past. Granted, historic representations also have a use, but they cannot be used as digital twins anymore or ever probably.\nYou do not have to have digital twins in the metaverse, either. For example, a metaverse representation of a video game might have no connection to reality at all or use a past representation of what was a digital twin to make for more realistic game play.\u00a0\nBut the metaverse that will use digital twins is designed to simulate the real world.\nWhy digital twins need to remain connected\nIf you are running a simulation, you need the virtual world to be as close to the real world as possible. For instance, if you are testing an autonomous car and the representation of the world you are testing in has no relation to the world it will operate in, you\u2019ll likely introduce errors you won\u2019t catch until the autonomous car is on the road. That process could be deadly.\nLooking at robots, particularly large-scale autonomous robots, a simulation based on an old floor plan will result in, at best, confusion and breakdowns when walls, stairs, and other major elements are not where the robot expects them to be. Something as simple as an electrical wire or conduit on the floor that the robot\u2019s sensors do not see could trouble the robot and result in an injury. In addition, given that when a robot has a problem, you\u2019ll want to use the mirror image universe to both analyze the problem and correct it. If that universe is materially different from the real world, your conclusions and fix may make the problem worse not better. Because you are dealing with what is effectively a corrupted digital twin \u2014 not because the twin was changed, but because the real world is no longer represented by it.\u00a0\nIn fact, with digital twins, the twin can become corrupted when the real world is changed, and the digital twin is not. You do not have to corrupt the twin to break the model, you just must break its connection to reality.\nSee more: NVIDIA\u2019s Isaac Sim: Preparing for the Coming Age Of Robotics\nOVX\nThe OVX servers and their related Omniverse cloud instances are designed to not only help you create an initial digital twin, but to help link it to sensors in the real world that will keep them connected. This means they must be able to handle massive amounts of different kinds of input, apply that data to the rendering of the digital twin, and do all that in real-time. So the twin never ceases to be a twin and the resulting simulations can accurately predict future events and be used effectively to train autonomous machines.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis is hardware that was specifically created to scale performance to a point where large-scale simulations can take advantage of these ever more accurate representations of the real world and so you can instrument the twin effectively to gain insight on its reality-based counterpart. Depending on the need, OVX servers can be configured into a pod of eight to 16 servers or into a super pod made up of a potentially unlimited number of pods.\u00a0\nTwins in the metaverse\nAs we enter the metaverse age, it is critical we understand that when developing the metaverse for simulation, we create digital twins that remain digital twins. If we don\u2019t, the simulations will fail and the result, be it autonomous robots, cars, or aircraft, will be problems that are not identified in simulation and are instead identified after a potentially catastrophic failure.\u00a0\nAssuring digital twins remain accurate requires a very different kind of server, such as OVX, which NVIDIA announced at their GTC event and can be combined into pods or super pods. The result, as this technology advances, is a reality-adjacent digital twin metaverse and a far more capable resulting simulation environment.\u00a0\nWhile we clearly are not there yet, the OVX server is a major stepping stone toward our simulated future.\u00a0\nSee more: AWS Introducing IoT TwinMaker\n\n\nPrevious articleBest Data Governance Tools & SoftwareNext articleMicrosoft Windows 11\u2019s Use of AI\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Subscribe to Data Insider                \n\n                    Learn the latest news and best practices about data science, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, data security, and more.                \n\n\n\n\n                        Email Address\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.                        \n\n\n\n                    Subscribe                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar articles\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nApplications\n8 Best Data Analytics Tools: Gain Data-Driven Advantage In 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nApplications\nCommon Data Visualization Examples: Transform Numbers into Narratives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBig Data\nWhat is Data Management?

Prices for third-party cards are slowly falling, and now have reached within \u00a3100 of the \u00a3549 UK RRP - an important milestone for GPUs that cost \u00a31000 or more at the beginning of the year. \nThe cheapest RTX 3070 Ti model we've found is a Zotac RTX 3070 Ti Trinity at Ebuyer, who are asking \u00a3649 with a despatch date of April 26th(tomorrow!). If you want the cheapest model that's in stock right now, then that'll be the Inno3D RTX 3070 Ti X3 at Overclockers for \u00a310 more. Either way, you'll be left with a performant graphics card that requires only a modest 750W PSU, less than Nvidia's higher-end GPUs and much less than the company's next-gen products rumoured to arrive towards the end of this year. \n\nGet the Zotac RTX 3070 Ti Trinity for \u00a3649\nGet the Inno3D RTX 3070 Ti X3 for \u00a3659\nThere are other, fancier RTX 3070 Ti versions available but I personally wouldn't spend much more to get them - ultimately, in-game performance is going to be determined by the GPU inside rather than whatever manufacturers bolt on outside. Better designs with thicker coolers, more effective fans and so on will let the card operate at a lower noise level, but unless you're into extreme overclocking the difference in actual in-game frame-rate will be neglible. Both Zotac and Inno3D are good budget brands that deliver sanely designed graphics cards at a reasonable price, so that's enough for me.  \nBeyond 'is this particular model of GPU any good?', the next pertinent question is 'is this GPU any good?' The answer is a little complicated. After all, the RTX 3070 Ti wasn't the best value graphics card when it was released, with the original RTX 3070 beating it out in terms of performance per pound spent, at UK RRP. However, that only applies when the graphics cards are actually available to order at their UK RRP. As it stands, the cheapest RTX 3070 cards in stock are more expensive than their RTX 3070 Ti counterparts - so you may as well have the extra performance from the Ti model! \nTo quickly sum up the differences between the two cards, the 3070 Ti is built around a fully-enabled GA104 die, while the 3070 uses a cut-back model with fewer CUDA cores and a lower clock speed. The 3070 Ti also comes with faster GDDR6X memory, rated at 608GB/s versus 448GB/s on the vanilla 3070. Finally, the 3070 Ti is given a power budget of 290W (on the reference design), compared to 220W on the standard 3070. That allows for better performance, but also a bit more heat production. The Ti is definitely the better choice if both cards are at the same price, but its frame-rate advantage is usually between five and 10 percent in the games I've tested. \nOf course, it's still way faster than a 10-series or 20-series Nvidia card (or AMD's RX 500-series and Vega GPUs), so you'll likely still be very happy with its performance overall - especially at 1080p and 1440p where the 3070 Ti should be capable of playing AAA titles at high settings for years to come. \nAnyway, this post is getting long, so I'll wrap up for now! Let me know if you have any questions, and stay tuned for more deals in the near future.

This Virtual Studio is being made available for a two-week free trial for any interested creative team.\n\n\n\nBy Dan Sarto | Monday, April 18, 2022 at 7:58amIn 3D, Business, CG, Digital Media, Films, People, Technology, Visual Effects | VFXWorld | Geographic Region: All\n\n\n\n \nIf there\u2019s one key factor affecting the way that animated features and VFX-heavy films are being made, it\u2019s the creation of technology in response to the need for remote production. Even before the global pandemic, advances in technology and cloud computing were allowing animation and VFX teams to increasingly perform their work from non-centralized locations. However, it is entirely accepted that there are certain aspects of production that really benefit from in-person interaction. For example, having a team together to be able to look at moving footage on a 40-foot screen is critical for achieving the necessary level of realism.\nThe ideal studio will blend remote and in-person production methodologies, and benefit from the capabilities that were created in response to the need to work from home. The technological breakthroughs that enabled remote production will have a significant impact on traditional VFX production even after people begin to return to the office.\nAmong those who are convinced of the production-changing nature of virtual infrastructure are Ray Feeney and Prashant Buyyala. Feeney, a five-time Academy Award winner and founder of RFX Inc \u2013 the entertainment industry\u2019s leading independent solutions provider \u2013 has been pioneering engineering solutions for the industry for more than four decades. Buyyala, a prominent animation and VFX executive and entrepreneur, has spent the last 25 years building and managing a global network of production studios for companies like DreamWorks Animation and Rhythm & Hues.\nNow, RFX, in partnership with NVIDIA and Supermicro, is at the forefront of those working to design and implement the latest remote-production technologies. Feeney and Buyyala are convinced that their new production platform offering \u2013 RFX\u2019s Virtual Studio, integrating NVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse\u2122 Enterprise with standard tools like Autodesk Maya, 3ds Max, and Epic Games\u2019 Unreal Engine, all powered by Supermicro workstations and servers \u2013 will be a core component of this next phase of production.\nThe Virtual Studio environment that RFX has designed leverages these new technologies to improve production collaboration, even when the artists are together in a traditional facility. In fact, Feeney and Buyyala are so confident about the benefits of RFX Virtual Studio that they\u2019re offering customers a free trial specifically designed to highlight the advantages of their remote production model.\n \nWhat prospective users need to understand, Feeney emphasizes, is that the only way to get a true idea of what the new systems have to offer is through hands-on experience in a production context.\n\u201cA lot of people have downloaded the NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 trial, which is free for a single user,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut the problem is you don't necessarily see the benefit without undertaking shared collaborative work in a real production environment using complex production assets and workflows.\u201d\nOK, fair enough. But, even if a company is gung-ho about road-testing NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 Enterprise, setting up the test system properly can be a daunting proposition, potentially requiring additional hardware, as well as the expertise to integrate and configure the necessary components, with no guarantee that it would be worth all of the effort and expense at the end of the day. Which is what led Feeney and Buyyala to come up with the idea of providing studios and groups of artists with a turn-key complete Virtual Studio that is easily initiated, minimally disruptive, and fully configured with the NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 Enterprise production platform. RFX is providing a free trial of the Virtual Studio to allow M&E organizations an opportunity to give Omniverse\u2122 Enterprise a spin \u2013 on their own project, with their own assets \u2013 and see what the discussion is all about.\n\u201cAnytime there's a new transformational technology that needs to be introduced and evaluated at an animation or visual effects studio, there are many different challenges,\u201d says Buyyala. \u201cA lot of times you need next-generation hardware with a specific type of GPU, or you need more powerful CPUs, so you have to buy or rent equipment for the evaluation. Then typically a pipeline has to be set up and configured in a way that is compatible with the rest of the studio. The third thing is you have to identify the right artists and give them easy access to the new systems in order to get their honest feedback. Of course, this last part is more challenging than it used to be.\u201d\nHe continues, \u201cSo what we are proposing to customers is, first, we will spin up a Virtual Studio infrastructure powered by state-of-the-art Supermicro workstations and servers incorporating the latest NVIDIA RTX\u2122 GPUs. This hardware has been specifically optimized to provide a useful evaluation experience with NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 Enterprise. Secondly, we're going to provide the Virtual Studio environment with all the best practices that set up critical components like security and SSO authentication, as well as collaboration servers, caching services, and everything else that's needed to make sure that NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 Enterprise works smoothly. Third, the fact that the solution is a remote Virtual Studio means that it can easily and securely be accessed by the appropriate artists, regardless of whether they are still at home or back in the facility.\u201d\n \nSupermicro is a natural fit as a solution provider for NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 Enterprise deployments. With an in-depth understanding of architecting such platforms, Supermicro can match a team's use case to right-sized solutions, saving energy and reducing the total cost of ownership. According to Bob Pette, Vice President, Professional Visualization at NVIDIA, \u201cSupermicro's success in Omniverse\u2122 Enterprise deployments, ranging from small design teams to large, geographically distributed project teams, caught our attention.\u201d\nWhile both Buyyala and Feeney are clearly evangelists for the new Virtual Studio paradigm, and they are confident that RFX can improve the efficiency and productivity of most animation or VFX production houses, they also recognize that each studio is different, and they can\u2019t prescribe or predict exactly how the technology will be used.\n\u201cEvery studio has their own unique workflow,\u201d says Buyyala. \u201cEven though they're all using similar tools, they use them in slightly different ways. And what has always amazed me is the creativity of the individual artists \u2013 how they're able to do things that the technologists never even conceived. So instead of us trying to tell a customer, \u2018This is how this tool should be used\u2019 or \u2018This is how it's going to make your life better,\u2019 our goal is to make it available to them, make it simple and easy to use, and trust that they can figure out how it can help them in their specific scenario.\u201d\nFor more information and to sign up for a two-week free trial of RFX Virtual Studio, visit https://rfxvi.com/nvidia-omniverse.\n \n \nDan Sarto is Publisher and Editor-in-Chief of Animation World Network.\n\n\n\n\n Tags\u00a0\n\nRFX Virtual Studio is Here\nnvidia\nRFX\nRFX Inc\nSupermicro\nRay Feeney\nPrashant Buyyala\nBob Pette\nRFX Virtual Studio\nTechnology\nNVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise\nOmniverse Enterprise\nNVIDIA RTX GPUs\nNVIDIA RTX\nAutodesk Maya\n3ds Max\nEpic Games\nUnreal Engine\nvirtual production\nremote-production technologies\nM&E\nMedia & Entertainment\n3D\nCGI\nCG\ncg animation\nVFX\nVisual Effects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n More From VFXWorld:Next PostFuseFX Goes Inside a Post-Civil War Manhattan in \u2018DMZ\u2019Previous PostW\u0113t\u0101 FX Brings Its Special Brand of Visual Magic to \u2018The Batman\u2019 \n Related Content\u00a0\n\nGTC Reveals Underscore Critical Expansion of NVIDIA Omniverse in M&E\nHow NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise Impacts Remote Animation and VFX Workflows\nNVIDIA Announces Omniverse Cloud for Connecting Designers and Creators\nNVIDIA Releases Free Version of Omniverse for Individual Creators and Artists\nNVIDIA GTC Workshop Highlights Advances in 3D Material Manipulation with Omniverse\nNVIDIA Reveals Omniverse Avatar Platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the discussion thread. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n\n\nLatest AWN Must Reads\n\n\n\n\n  Candi Milo and Eric Bauza Talk \u2018The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie\u2019  \n\n  Nathan Crowley Goes Big and Practical on \u2018Wicked\u2019 Production Design  \n\n\n\n    See More \u00bb  \n\n \n\n\n\nTop Headline News\n\n\n\n\n  Animatriz Studio Presents \u2018Ballad for Raposo Ten\u00f3rio\u2019  \n\n  Story Critters, Toon Pocket Announce Strategic Partnership  \n\n  PBS Kids to Debut \u2018Acoustic Rooster\u2019 Universe  \n\n  JALI Research, Partners to Unveil \u2019Anim Revolution\u2019 at GDC 2025  \n\n  VIZ Media Announces \u2018Kingdom\u2019 Trailer, English Debut  \n\n  Rookie Awards 2025 Announces Call For Entries Date  \n\n  \u2018Percy Jackson,\u2019 \u2018Orion and the Dark\u2019 Win Big at 3rd Annual Children\u2019s & Family Emmy Awards  \n\n  Disney+ Picks Up \u2018Percy Jackson And The Olympians\u2019 for Season 3  \n\n\n\n    See More \u00bb  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCareer Connections\n\n Assistant/Associate Professor - Animation - Tenure Track Kansas City Art Institute\n Creative Designer Grainger\n Part-Time Graphic Designer I Lone Star College\n Professor, Animation & Game Art Collin College\n Oliver Wyman - Senior Lead Graphic/Motion Designer Marsh & McLennan Companies\n Arity - Graphic Design Intern Allstate Insurance Company\n Graphic Design Intern Confidential\n ACD Graphic Design Supervisor Mastercard\nSee More \u00bb \n\n\n\nRecent Comments\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nElsewhere on AWN\n\n\n\n  \n \n \n Nominations Announced for the 97th Academy Awards \n\n \n \n 2025 Kidscreen Awards Winners Announced \n\n \n \n \u2018The Wild Robot,\u2019 \u2018Arcane\u2019 Dominate at 52nd Annual Annie Awards \n\n \n \n \u2018The Wild Robot,\u2019 \u2018Dune: Part Two,\u2019 \u2018Wicked,\u2019 and \u2018X-Men \u201997\u2019 Win Critics Choice Awards \n\n \n \n \u2018Dune: Part Two,\u2019 \u2018The Wild Robot\u2019 Take Top Honors at 15th Annual Lumiere Awards \n\n \n \n 2024 VIEW Awards Announced \n\n \n \n \u2018Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, 'Dune: Part Two,\u2019 and \u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019 Lead 52nd Saturn Awards \n\n \n \n 14 Scientific & Technical Achievements to be Honored at Academy Sci-Tech Awards \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimation World Network\n\nContact Us | About Us | Terms Of ServicePrivacy Policy Media Kit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow AWN\n\nVisit AWN on Twitter\nVisit AWN on Facebook\nVisit AWN on Instagram\nVisit AWN on Youtube\nVisit AWN on FlipBoard\nVisit AWN on Bluesky\nVisit AWN on Threads\nSubscribe to AWN\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Animation Flash Email Newsletter\nStay Up to Date \u2013 Sign Up Now\n\nHave News or a Story to Pitch Us?\nSend Us Your Tip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2025 AWN, Inc.

A team of scientists has used GPU-accelerated deep learning to show how color can be brought to night-vision systems.\u00a0\nIn a paper\u00a0published this week in the journal PLOS One, a team of researchers at the University of California, Irvine led by Professor Pierre Baldi and Dr. Andrew Browne, describes how they reconstructed color images of photos of faces using an infrared camera.\u00a0\nThe study is a step toward predicting and reconstructing what humans would see using cameras that collect light using imperceptible near-infrared illumination.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe study\u2019s authors explain that humans see light in the so-called \u201cvisible spectrum,\u201d or light with wavelengths of between 400 and 700 nanometers.\nTypical night vision systems rely on cameras that collect infrared light outside this spectrum that we can\u2019t see.\u00a0\nInformation gathered by these cameras is then transposed to a display that shows a monochromatic representation of what the infrared camera detects, the researchers explain.\nThe team at UC Irvine developed an imaging algorithm that relies on deep learning to predict what humans would see using light captured by an infrared camera.\nResearchers at the University of California, Irvine, aimed to use deep learning to predict visible spectrum images using infrared illumination alone. Source: Browne, et al.\nIn other words, they\u2019re able to digitally render a scene for humans using cameras operating in what, to humans, would be complete \u201cdarkness.\u201d\u00a0\nTo do this, the researchers used a monochromatic camera sensitive to visible and near-infrared light to acquire an image dataset of printed images of faces.\u00a0\nThese images were gathered under multispectral illumination spanning standard visible red, green, blue and infrared wavelengths.\u00a0\nThe researchers then optimized a\u00a0convolutional neural network\u00a0with a U-Net-like architecture \u2014 a specialized convolutional neural network first developed for biomedical\u00a0image segmentation\u00a0at the Computer Science Department of the\u00a0University of Freiburg\u00a0\u2014 to predict visible spectrum images from near-infrared images.\nOn the left, visible spectrum ground truth image composed of red, green and blue input images. On the right, predicted reconstructions for UNet-GAN, UNet and linear regression using three infrared input images. Source: Browne, et al.\nThe system was trained using NVIDIA GPUs and 140 images of human faces for training, 40 for validation and 20 for testing.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe result: the team successfully recreated color portraits of people taken by an infrared camera in darkened rooms. In other words, they created systems that could \u201csee\u201d color images in the dark.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo be sure, these systems aren\u2019t yet ready for general purpose use. These systems would need to be trained to predict the color of different kinds of objects \u2014 such as flowers or faces.\nNevertheless, the study could one day lead to night vision systems able to see color, just as we do in daylight, or allow scientists to study biological samples sensitive to visible light.\nFeatured image source: Browne, et al.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Research \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nvidia GeForce social media team in China has released an updated performance hierarchy video. It's an informative but brief watch, which helps make some sense of the diverse mix of GeForce graphics cards from RTX and GTX designations, with Ampere and Turing architectures, and from the GTX 16, RTX 20 and RTX 30 families. Perhaps the most jarring message from the green team is that it sees the new GeForce RTX 3050 as a member of its bottom tier of graphics cards, while the old RTX 2060 sits smugly in a category alongside the RTX 2080 / Super, RTX 2070 / Super, and RTX 3060 / Ti graphics cards.(Image credit: Nvidia China)In the video, Nvidia shows the comparative performance of the broad mix of Ampere and Turing CPUs currently sold worldwide. It also says what types of games, graphics quality settings, and resolutions each of its GPUs targets in 2022. Of course, the video is in Chinese, but we have translated all the important bits, so you can grasp the meanings of the annotations that pop up alongside the 'performance ladder'.(Image credit: Nvidia China)Starting from the top of the Nvidia performance ladder, if you are aiming for the \"ultimate experience\" at high resolutions (typically 4K) you will want to buy a GeForce RTX 3080 10GB or better. Nvidia has crowded a lot of cards into this expensive category and it doesn't provide any clear reason why you would splash out on anything better than the cheapest of the five GPUs listed here.\n\nMeanwhile, for 1440p ultimate quality and smooth gameplay in modern AAA games, Nvidia recommends a GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, RTX 3070, or an RTX 2080 Ti. Compared to the packed field for 4K gaming, this is a somewhat limited choice but contains the last gen champ, the RTX 2080 Ti.(Image credit: Nvidia China)For 1080p gaming in AAA titles with raytracing turned on, the slide includes options from Ampere and Turing generations. The range of performance is very broad, and it's somewhat strange to see the RTX 2080 Super and RTX 2060 6GB on the same page while the RTX 3050 apparently doesn't make the cut. Nvidia doesn't explain any benefits of picks from higher up the ladder, but at 1080p some of these GPUs will be able to achieve very high frame rates with ultra quality and RTX effects while others like the RTX 2060 will struggle at times.(Image credit: Nvidia China)On the bottom rung of the ladder we get the entry level gaming tier, headed up by the GeForce RTX 3050. The text mentions RTX gaming effects, but the Ampere card is the only one that supports such effects in hardware.\n\nIt's a little sad to see that the Ampere RTX 3050 isn't able to outpace a Turing 2060. Things are a little off-balance here, as the RTX 3060 is claimed to beat the RTX 2070, and the RTX 3060 Ti is ahead of the RTX 2080 Super in the Nvidia performance ladder. Nvidia has cut the generational performance uplifts where gamers would appreciate it most, in the cheap seats.\n\nExcept, these seats aren't even that cheap. The RTX 2060 back in the day dropped below $300 in pricing on a regular basis. Right now, you can find RTX 2060 cards starting at $390, compared to the RTX 3050 starting at $350. Typical eBay prices peg the RTX 2060 at $326 versus $382, however. Considering even Nvidia admits the RTX 2060 is faster, the choice isn't so clear cut. It's a shame the supposed $250 starting price of the 3050 is yet to materialize.\n\nOverall, Nvidia put some thought and effort into creating this hierarchy showing how it sees things. There aren't a lot of clear details on performance, however. For that, and for comparisons with AMD's hardware, you'll want to check out our own GPU Benchmarks and Hierarchy 2022. Not only does it include all of the recent GPUs, but we have charts and performance results going as far back as the GTX 780 and R9 390, the former of which launched clear back in 2013.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (20)\n\n\n\nMark TysonSocial Links NavigationNews EditorMark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

The beyond-MSRP situation appears to be well on its way to sorting itself out as long as there isn't another industry-wide supply disruption to fudge things up again.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaradjgne\n\n\nWhat that video/nvidia doesn't say is the % difference. For all anyone knows the 2060 is only averaging 1% better than a 3050, which in reality makes them the same card and fits perfectly with nvidia's drop 10 next gen numbering scheme. Same applies to the 3060/2070 which bump heads consistently or close enough to be margin of error.\n\nMy personal opinion is the 3050 is better than the 2060, uses better DLSS, better RTX, at gives a better 1080p gaming experience, regardless of a couple fps difference I can't see or tell exist in anything except a benchmark.\n\nFor general gaming, and all intents and purposes, a 1070, 1660ti, 2060 and 3050 all land in the same place\u00b1, the fps differences being so minor as to not realistically mean anything. \n\nMaking that hierarchy chart useless to anyone but a benchmark chaser. Imho.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntennis2\n\n\nNot sure who hasn't seen review of the 3050, but...\n\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwatzupken\n\n\nI think there are already a lot of reviews out there, whether written or on videos, that shows that the RTX 3050 is generally behind the RTX 2060. The only time it can catch up with the RTX 2060 is when that extra 2GB VRAM is used. But the fact is that it is generally not that far off from the RTX 2060. So if given a choice of RTX 2060 6GB vs RTX 3050 8GB, I feel the 3050 may still be a viable option as long as it is cheaper to make up for the performance loss.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwaltari\n\n\nYou are comparing wrong products. Price range wise 3050 is like what, 1660Ti? Its like comparing 2060 and 3080\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaradjgne\n\n\n$389.99 for Asus Dual 3050 ,130w\n$389.98 for Gigabyte 2060 Gaming X, 215w\n\nAccording to PCPartPicker.com as of this reply. \n\nConsidering the measly 3-5 fps difference, which honestly is margin of error % and close enough that an OC aftermarket version could easily tie the difference, the 3050 8Gb and 2060 6Gb are the same, except one has lowered power consumption which could be a benefit.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrenz496\n\n\nisn't that review already show this? and we know 3050 based on GA106 will be slower than RTX2060 even before the card officially being launch.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 20 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Flower\u2019s beastly 2800W power supply lands at $899 \u2014 enough juice to power a couple of RTX 5090 GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei's Microsoft Windows license for PCs expires this month, company launching PCs with Harmony OS: Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 50-series GPU scalping extends to system integrators \u2014 over $3,000 for a RTX 5090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO gets a $1 million salary plus $68 million in bonuses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNES consoles appear to run faster with age \u2014 APU frequency increased by up to 182 Hz after 35 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech giants call Trump tariffs 'big headache' \u2014 Foxconn CEO teases increased production in US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe week in chip news: Intel gets a new CEO, China chip smuggling, AMD dominates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi Pico powers $75 PicoCalc portable programming handheld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel's new CEO warns employees about 'tough decisions', but Wall Street cheers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI skips RDNA 4 and will not manufacture AMD Radeon 9000-series GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Worries over macroeconomic headwinds such as inflation are weighing on the stock market right now, and one analyst also sees evidence that consumer demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) is slipping.\nBaird analyst Tristan Gerra recently downgraded Nvidia over signs that selling prices for GPUs are starting to fall.\u00a0Online retailer Newegg\u00a0is currently showing discounted prices for Nvidia's more expensive GeForce RTX GPUs, and if these lower prices reflect lower demand, that could spell lower revenue for Nvidia's gaming segment, which provided nearly half of the company's sales in its fiscal 2022 (which ended in January).\u00a0\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nStill, that lower stock price already factors in the possibility of lower growth. Plus, Nvidia estimates its long-term opportunity in gaming at $100 billion, or four times its annual revenue.\u00a0So, should you buy the dip, or wait?\nWeighing the pros and cons\nHistorically, demand for Nvidia's chips hasn't gone up in a straight line; it fluctuated depending on end-market demand. We saw this in 2018 when a pause in data center spending caused a decline in revenue for Nvidia's data center segment, which contributed to a sharp decline in the stock price.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia's gaming revenue has grown at a compound annual rate of 25% over the last five years, thanks to an 11% annualized increase in unit sales and a 13% annualized increase in average selling prices. Because about half of its top-line growth came from its ability to raise product prices, Nvidia would be vulnerable if the supply-and-demand balance tips the other way and it has to reduce prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nChipmakers have been benefiting from a shortage of chips since the pandemic began. Gaming GPUs from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have been relatively scarce at retail unless one was willing to pay nosebleed prices. The combination of supply shortages and high demand is great for manufacturers' bottom lines, but investors shouldn't expect Nvidia to continue doubling its profits year over year as it did in its fiscal fourth quarter.\u00a0\n\nNVDA data by YCharts.\nOn the flip side, if the supply shortages start to ease this year, that could still be good news for Nvidia. Selling prices for certain GPU models increased between 150% to 200% above normal levels. This kept many gamers from buying new GPUs last year. Assuming prices come back to normal, there should be plenty of pent-up demand. Nvidia estimates that only 30% of its installed base of users have upgraded to new GPUs that use the latest technology.\u00a0\nMoreover, Nvidia expects GPU selling prices to continue trending upward over the long term. An estimated 3.2 billion people globally now play video games. While only a fraction of them are PC gamers -- and thus Nvidia's target gaming business customers -- that massive number suggests there should be no shortage of demand for gaming GPUs over the long term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the stock a buy?\nEven after the pullback in Nvidia's stock, it still trades at an expensive price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 48, which is twice the P/E of the average stock in the S&P 500 index. Investors shouldn't buy these shares expecting a big return over the next year. It's impossible to know what waits around the corner for Nvidia. If the company experiences a disappointing quarter, the stock could plunge further. It looks particularly vulnerable to any potential bad news given that it still has a relatively high P/E.\nHowever, if the stock falls much further, I would put my Warren Buffett hat on and consider scooping up a bargain. Nvidia has enormous opportunities across gaming, cloud computing, metaverse, and other advanced computing applications. This tech stock is not done hitting new highs over the long term.\n\n\n\nJohn Ballard has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.
