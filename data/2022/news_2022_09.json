Nvidia stock split: Will the NVDA share price recover post-split highs?    \n By\n Ryan Hogg\n  Edited by  Jekaterina Drozdovica   14:07, 6 September 2022              Will the NVDA share price recover post-split highs? \u2013 Photo: Srafapress/hutterstock \nSince Nvidia split its stock in July of last year, the tech company\u2019s share price has been through the ringer. The stock rallied after the Nvidia stock split announcement, followed by further bullishness, before a bear market ravaged the stock through 2022.\u00a0How did the NVDA stock split affect the company\u2019s share price, and what\u2019s next for the stock in a volatile bear market?   1m 5m 15m 30m 1h 4h 1d 1w   \nWhat is a stock split?A stock split involves a dilution of shares by a predetermined amount. For example splitting the stock in two, thus cutting the price of a single share in a company by half. Investors holding this stock will see their number of shares increase by the proportion of the split. The value of their holding is unaffected.The Nvidia stock split was by no means unique. Major companies have engaged in similar stock splits, including Amazon\u2019s 20-for-1 split announced in June, and Google\u2019s split by the same amount in August.While stock splits don\u2019t alter the market capitalisation of a company, they can spark optimism among investors.\u00a0Firstly, stock splits can be intended to induce a short-term bullish drive in a stock, as lower prices per share may make investing in the company more attractive to retail investors, increasing liquidityAs retail trading has abounded, the accessibility of equities has become an increasingly important factor in driving the decision for a stock split. A typical retail investor works with a small portfolio, with the average Robinhood (HOOD) account amounting to $4,000.This can make the inclusion of more expensive equities difficult, limiting their wriggle room for diversification. A split can welcome these investors into the fold when they had previously viewed the cost of holding a share as prohibitive.\u00a0\u00a0Other motivations can also drive the decision. When Tesla (TSLA) announced its latest 3-for-1 stock split in June, the company said the move would help with \u201cattracting and retaining excellent talent\u201d by helping employees better manage their equity in the EV maker.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   What is your sentiment on NVDA?   116.12      Bullish  or   Bearish     Vote to see Traders sentiment!

The company popularised the use of graphics processing units (GPUs), and makes most of its money from them.The firm\u2019s biggest business segment is gaming, where its GPUs are most popularly put to use. Nvidia made nearly a third of its revenue from gaming in the last quarter.Its main competitors are the likes of Broadcom (AVGO), Taiwan Semiconductor Company (TSM) and Intel (INTC), to name a few.The company debuted on the Nasdaq stock exchange through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) on 22 January 1999 at $12 a share, around the time of the dotcom boom.\u00a0It endured a relatively inconspicuous period of muted growth for most of the next two decades, before it began to rally through 2017 and 2018 following strong earnings in early 2017 that drove optimism in the stock, helping it establish new, higher resistance.\u00a0Nvidia stock split analysis\u00a0The Nvidia stock split history has involved a total of five splits, with four occurring between 2000 and 2007.\u00a0       TSLA   225.89 Price   -4.500% 1D Chg, %    Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n                   Swap short:    Swap long:       Long position overnight fee -0.0234%   Short position overnight fee 0.0012%   Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC)   Spread 0.17     Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n           NVDA   116.12 Price   -2.630% 1D Chg, %    Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n                   Swap short:    Swap long:       Long position overnight fee -0.0234%   Short position overnight fee 0.0012%   Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC)   Spread 0.12     Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n           COIN   182.28 Price   -3.210% 1D Chg, %    Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n                   Swap short:    Swap long:       Long position overnight fee -0.0234%   Short position overnight fee 0.0012%   Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC)   Spread 0.27     Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n           MSTR   283.00 Price   -2.840% 1D Chg, %    Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n                   Swap short:    Swap long:       Long position overnight fee -0.0234%   Short position overnight fee 0.0012%   Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC)   Spread 0.36     Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n       The company enacted a 4-for-1 stock split in July last year, in an apparent attempt to jump-start the Nvidia stock price following a period of stagnation which had lasted since October 2020.\u00a0\u201cThe stock split is intended to make stock ownership more accessible to investors and employees, thus increasing liquidity in the stock. The trading price of the company\u2019s common stock has appreciated significantly in recent years,\u201d Nvidia said at the time.The US chipmaker added that, similar to Tesla, the move was also intended to improve employees\u2019 ability to manage their equity, noting:\u201cThe company believes that the stock price appreciation and the associated reduction in the number of shares of stock provided in equity grants has reduced the perceived attractiveness of employee equity awards, as well as limited an employee\u2019s ability to hold and retain equity on a post-tax basis.\u201dThe split appears to have helped in inspiring a short-term surge in the Nvidia stock price. Between the announcement of the Nvidia stock split on 21 May 2021 and the date that the new price would begin trading on 20 July 2021, Nvidia\u2019s value appreciated by more than 28% as investors jumped into the stock in anticipation of a post-split retail investor rally.\u00a0The day after the Nvidia stock split date, Nvidia\u2019s value rose a further 4.29%, rising by another 6.5% by 5 August 2021. The surge in October and November of 2021 was driven more by a combination of wider tech bullishness and the announcement by Meta to drive up spending, benefitting Nvidia\u2019s GPUs. By this point, the benefits of the stock split had likely petered out.The stock peaked at $333.76 on 29 November 2021, but has been falling since.In 2022, Nvidia stock news has been negative, as the stock has lost more than half its value year-to-date. This has owed more to deep investor pessimism on a semiconductor sector that previously benefited from low supply and high demand.There are signs for optimism, though, like legendary investor Cathie Wood doubling down on the stock in her ARK Innovation ETF.More headwinds ahead according to analystsAnalyst assessments suggest any benefits from the NVDA stock split have now been expended, and while on the whole the stock appears popular, there are new headwinds ahead.\u201cNvidia has seen a dramatic reduction in demand for its GPUs related to its gaming segment. While there might be some weakening of demand in gaming, the real driver is most likely Bitcoin mining which has seen a plunge in profitability forcing many Bitcoin miners to end operations and flood the market with used GPUs causing prices to tumble,\u201d Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote in a note.\u201cThe lower GPU prices are forcing Nvidia to write down its inventory by $1.3bn. Shares opened 8% lower but have recovered half the losses as the company says the long-term gross margin profile is intact.\u201dMeanwhile, production restrictions on the AI chips could be a problem for chipmakers like Nvidia, according to Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s senior investment and markets analyst Susannah Streeter.\u201cThe new rules will affect Nvidia\u2019s exports of A100 and H100 chips, which are designed to speed up machine learning tasks,\u201d Streeter wrote on 1 August.\u00a0\u201cThis could hardly come at a worse time for Nvidia given that the last quarter was already highly challenging due to supply chain snarl ups and slowing demand for gaming consoles. Its artificial intelligence prowess is considered to be the engine for future growth at the company, which is why these strict new rules come as a severe blow.\u201d\u00a0In a note shared with Capital.com, Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson added that the news may hinder Nvidia stock.\u00a0\u201cThis news represents another potential near-term setback for NVDA following recent disruptions to its gaming revenues (as inventories in that market normalize) and with its data center business already growing at reduced rates (due in large part to slowing spend in China),\u201d Bryson wrote on 1 September.\u201cHaving said this, even in a worst case scenario (assuming revenues are lost forever and no export licenses are granted by the US) the rate of growth for NVDA's AI business shouldn't change (i.e. this action is unlikely to disrupt growth rates outside of China) even if NVDA's TAM (Total Addressable Market) is affected by the loss of the China market.\u201dBased on a collection of 34 analysts\u2019 ratings compiled by MarketBeat, as of 6 September, Nvidia was in a bullish position, with 24 analysts rating the stock as a\u00a0 \u2018buy\u201d\u2019 and only one as a\u00a0 \u2018sell\u2019. The stock had an average upside of 60.36% for an Nvidia stock price target of $218.85, with targets ranging from $133 to $320.Note that analysts\u2019 predictions can be wrong.

The difference between trading assets and CFDsThe main difference between CFD trading and trading assets, such as commodities and stocks, is that you don\u2019t own the underlying asset when you trade on a CFD.You can still benefit if the market moves in your favour, or make a loss if it moves against you. However, with traditional trading you enter a contract to exchange the legal ownership of the individual shares or the commodities for money, and you own this until you sell it again.CFDs are leveraged products, which means that you only need to deposit a percentage of the full value of the CFD trade in order to open a position. But with traditional trading, you buy the assets for the full amount. In the UK, there is no stamp duty on CFD trading, but there is when you buy stocks, for example.CFDs attract overnight costs to hold the trades (unless you use 1-1 leverage), which makes them more suited to short-term trading opportunities. Stocks and commodities are more normally bought and held for longer.

DRIVE Thor with MIG support for graphics and compute uniquely enables IVI and advanced driver-assistance systems to run domain isolation, which allows concurrent time-critical processes to run without interruption. Available for automakers\u2019 2025 models, it will accelerate production roadmaps by bringing higher performance and advanced features to market in the same timeline.\n\u201cAdvances in accelerated computing and AI are moving at lightspeed,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cDRIVE Thor is the superhero of centralized compute, with lightning-fast performance to deliver continuously upgradable, safe and secure software-defined supercomputers on wheels.\u201d\nSignaling the transportation industry\u2019s support for this new supercomputing architecture, Geely-owned automaker ZEEKR announced it will integrate DRIVE Thor on its centralized vehicle computer for its next-generation intelligent electric vehicles, starting production in early 2025.\nZEEKR CEO An Conghui said: \u201cZEEKR users demand a luxury experience that includes the latest technology and safety features. NVIDIA DRIVE Thor will support our mission of providing cutting-edge technology that fulfills the needs of our customers and ensures ZEEKR remains at the forefront of tomorrow\u2019s innovations.\u201d\nDRIVE Thor supports multi-domain computing, isolating functions for automated driving and IVI. Typically, dozens of electric control units are distributed throughout a vehicle to power individual functions. With DRIVE Thor, manufacturers can efficiently consolidate many functions on a single system-on-a-chip (SoC), which eases supply constraints and simplifies vehicle-design development, resulting in significantly lower cost, less weight and fewer cables.\nDRIVE Thor is the first AV platform to incorporate an inference transformer engine, a new component of the Tensor Cores within NVIDIA GPUs. With this engine, DRIVE Thor can accelerate inference performance of transformer deep neural networks by up to 9x, which is paramount for supporting the massive and complex AI workloads associated with self driving.\nAnother advantage of DRIVE Thor is its 8-bit floating point (FP8) capability. Typically, developers lose neural-network accuracy when moving from 32-bit FP data to 8-bit integer format. DRIVE Thor features 2,000 teraflops of FP8 precision, allowing the transition to 8-bit without sacrificing accuracy.\nThe new superchip also uses the latest NVLink\u00ae-C2C chip interconnect technology, while running multiple operating systems. The advantage of the NVLink-C2C is its ability to share, schedule and distribute work across the link with minimal overhead. This equips automakers with the compute headroom and flexibility to build software-defined vehicles that are continuously upgradeable through secure, over-the-air software updates.\n\u201cThe shift to software-defined vehicles with centralized electronic architectures is accelerating, driving a need for more powerful and more energy-efficient compute platforms,\u201d said Sam Abuelsamid, principal research analyst at Guidehouse Insights. \u201cThe virtualization, high-speed data transfer and massive processing performance of NVIDIA DRIVE Thor can enable safer vehicles, better user experiences and potential new revenue streams.\u201d\nDRIVE Thor is designed for the highest levels of functional safety. NVIDIA has invested more than 15,000 engineering years into safety across its full stack. NVIDIA is the only company with a unified safety approach across its entire system, from the data center to the fleet. Safety is incorporated into every step of the company\u2019s development process \u2014 including design, production and vehicle operation.\nThe DRIVE Thor SoC and AGX board are developed to comply with ISO 26262 standards. The software stack is designed for both ISO 26262 and ASPICE compliance. The Thor SoC and software are also designed and produced in alignment with ISO 21434, which provides the pathway for compliance with regulatory security such as UNECE Regulation 155.\nDRIVE Thor replaces NVIDIA DRIVE Atlan\u2122 and will be the follow-on to DRIVE Orin\u2122, which is currently in production and delivers 254 TOPS of performance.\nBroad Industry Support for DRIVE Thor\nRead more (pdf) from transportation leaders who are enthusiastic about DRIVE Thor.\nExisting DRIVE Orin customers can take advantage of the platform\u2019s scalable architecture to easily transition current development efforts to DRIVE Thor. Developers can reap the benefits of their software investments across multiple product generations as they design for future production roadmaps.\nWatch the NVIDIA GTC keynote address, in which Huang announced NVIDIA DRIVE Thor and other key automotive developments with IVI, mapping, simulation and more.

Read on\u2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Anushka Dutta Sep 27, 2022  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular Stories\n\n\u2022 Has the Next Bear Market Already Arrived?\n\u2022 How Low Will Stocks Go?\n\u2022 Why is Stock Market Outlook So Uncertain?\n\u2022 Trump or the Fed More Important to Stock Investors?\n\u2022 Investors in \u201cWait and See\u201d Mode\nView All Top stories\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPopular chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) received restrictions on exports of two of its top chips to China. However, Chief Executive Jensen Huang still expects a large market for its data center chips in China. But the export regulation of its A100 and H100 chips could affect up to $400 million in sales in its current fiscal quarter.\nMoreover, famed investor Jim Cramer, who had been a strong proponent of NVDA for a long time, has recently turned bearish on the company\u2019s stock following its Ethereum venture.\nHe stated, \u201cThey haven\u2019t been able to make the transition yet to artificial intelligence, virtual reality, machine learning. We\u2019re just not there yet. So, we have the high-tech stuff not there yet producing earnings and the lower stuff being hurt by this Ethereum transfer.\u201d\nThe stock has declined 44.6% over the past year and 58.4% year-to-date to close its last trading session at $122.28. It is down 21.5% over the past month.\n\n\nHere are the factors that could affect NVDA\u2019s performance in the near term:\nBleak Bottom Line\nFor the fiscal second quarter that ended July 31, NVDA\u2019s revenue increased 3% year-over-year to $6.70 billion. However, non-GAAP net income decreased 50.7% from the prior-year quarter to $1.29 billion. Non-GAAP net income per share declined 51% from the same period the prior year to $0.51.\nStretched Valuations\n10 STOCKS TO SELL NOW!In terms of its forward EV/Sales, NVDA is trading at 11.30x, 375.5% higher than the industry average of 2.38x. The stock\u2019s forward EV/EBITDA multiple of 49.12 is 322.1% higher than the industry average of 11.64. In terms of its forward Price/Sales, NVDA is trading at 11.49x, 368.1% higher than the industry average of 2.46x.\nUnfavorable Analyst Expectations\nThe consensus EPS estimates of $0.71 and $0.79 for the quarters ending October 2022 and January 2023 indicate 39.3% and 40.2% year-over-year decreases. Street EPS estimate for the current fiscal year (ending in 2023) of $3.37 reflects a decline of 24.1% from the prior year.\nThe consensus revenue of $6.21 billion for the quarter ending January 2023 indicates an 18.7% year-over-year decline.\n\n\nPOWR Ratings Reflect Bleak Prospects\nNVDA\u2019s POWR Ratings reflect this bleak outlook. The stock has an overall rating of D, equating to Sell in our proprietary rating system. The POWR Ratings are calculated by considering 118 different factors, with each factor weighted to an optimal degree.\nNVDA has a Growth and Value grade of D in sync with its bleak bottom line growth and high valuations. The stock has a Stability grade of D, consistent with its five-year monthly beta of 1.69.\nIn the 92-stock Semiconductor & Wireless Chip industry, it is ranked #77.\nClick here to see the additional POWR Ratings for NVDA (Momentum, Sentiment, and Quality).\nView all the top stocks in the Semiconductor & Wireless Chip industry here.\nBottom Line\nThe export regulations on NVDA\u2019s fastest chips could hurt the company\u2019s top line. Moreover, its bottom-line decline in the last reported quarter is concerning. With analysts bearish on the company\u2019s prospects, its stock might be best avoided.\nHow Does NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Stack Up Against its Peers?\nWhile NVDA has an overall POWR Rating of D, one might consider looking at its industry peers, STMicroelectronics N.V. (STM) and Advantest Corporation (ATEYY), which have an overall A (Strong Buy) rating, and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and MaxLinear, Inc. (MXL), which have an overall B (Buy) rating.\nWant More Great Investing Ideas?3 Stocks to DOUBLE This Year\nNVDA shares were trading at $123.42 per share on Tuesday afternoon, up $1.14 (+0.93%).

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), NVIDIA disclosed that the U.S. government informed it on Aug 26 about imposing a new licensing requirement, effective immediately, for its A100, A100X and forthcoming H100 integrated circuit sales in China and Russia. The government has also banned NVIDIA from exporting DGX or any other systems that incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.  The new licensing requirements will also be implied on any future chip designs developed by NVIDIA that have a threshold greater than or equivalent to A100. Additionally, any systems developed in the future incorporating the aforementioned types and thresholds will also fall under export restrictions. With the new licensing requirements, the U.S. government intends to \u201caddress the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a \u2018military end use\u2019 or \u2018military end user\u2019 in China and Russia,\u201d per NVDA in the SEC filing. NVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus NVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote Export Restrictions to Hurt NVIDIA\u2019s Sales NVIDIA\u2019s A100 and H100 are its highest-performance chips used in data centers for AI, data analytics and computing applications. Though the company does not sell products to customers in Russia, the new licensing requirements are going to significantly hurt its data center chip sales in China. The newly imposed restrictions are likely to impact the company\u2019s ability to support the existing customers of A100 as well as complete the development of H100 timely. This could also require NVIDIA to transition some of its operations outside China.  The restrictions are expected to hamper NVIDIA\u2019s business in China from where the company is expecting to generate $400 million in revenues from the sale of the aforementioned chips in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The company warned that it may lose revenues if Chinese firms decide not to buy alternative NVIDIA products. The latest restriction is a new blow to NVIDIA, which is already being hurt by the weakening demand for its chips used in gaming products. Last week, the company reported revenues of $6.7 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, way lower than its May 2022 forecast of $8.10 billion (+/-2%), due to weaker sales across its Gaming and Data Center business segments.   Story Continues NVIDIA\u2019s Gaming segment revenues plunged 33% year over year due to a lower sell-in of Gaming products, reflecting reduced channel partner sales due to macroeconomic headwinds. Although Data Center revenues jumped 61% year over year, the company stated that sales were below expectations due to ongoing supply-chain disruptions and lower sales to China\u2019s hyperscale customers, who are affected by economic conditions.Considering the current business environment, the company issued dim revenue guidance for the third quarter, wherein it expects to generate $5.9 billion (+/- 2%) in sales, approximately 17% lower than the year-ago quarter\u2019s revenues. Looking at the latest U.S. government\u2019s restriction on chip sales to China, the company is highly probable to report third-quarter revenues way lower than its August 2022 guidance.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderNVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

It's Complicated\n\n\n  \n      By Timothy Green\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Sep 3, 2022 at 8:50AM\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia could lose as much as $400 million in sales to China due to new export requirements on its data center chips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than $7 billion in revenue came from China last year, but much of that was from board partners and not necessarily end users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Nvidia facing an oversupply of graphics cards and the potential for export restrictions to escalate further, the stock is far from a screaming bargain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$2.9T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-2.84%)\u00a0-$3.40\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$116.13\n\n\nPrice as of March 18, 2025, 3:33 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe way Nvidia's gaming business works makes it hard to tell how important Chinese end users are.\n\nGraphics chip company Nvidia\u00a0(NVDA -2.84%) is dealing with a glut of gaming graphics cards following a multiyear period of shortages, sky-high demand, and soaring prices. Thankfully, the company's data center business, which includes high-powered graphics chips used to accelerate artificial intelligence (AI) and other number-crunching workloads, is still performing well.\nNvidia already slashed its guidance to account for weak gaming demand, but now the company sees a potential $400 million hit to its data center segment. On Wednesday, the company disclosed that the U.S. government had imposed a new license requirement on exports to China, Hong Kong, and Russia of its high-powered A100 and H100 data center GPUs. The intent is to keep these ultra-powerful chips out of the hands of the Chinese military.\n\nHow important is China to Nvidia?\nWhile the new export restrictions only affect certain data center GPUs, it's worth asking how much revenue Nvidia generates from China across all its segments. Answering that question is harder than it seems. In the gaming segment, Nvidia relies on its partners to assemble and sell graphics cards to end users.\nIn fiscal 2022, which ended on Jan. 30, Nvidia reported $7.1 billion of revenue attributable to China and Hong Kong. Another $8.5 billion of revenue was attributable to Taiwan, which isn't part of these export restrictions but is nonetheless embroiled in the rising tensions between the U.S. and China. Total revenue was $26.9 billion for the year.\nThese numbers don't give any indication of where Nvidia's GPUs actually end up. In the gaming business, Nvidia sells its chips to its board partners, who then sell completed graphics cards to end users. Many of those partners are based in China and Taiwan, which explains the outsized revenue contribution from those areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the goal of the U.S. government is to stunt China's AI efforts, it's not hard to imagine this situation getting a whole lot worse for Nvidia. The export restrictions cover only some of Nvidia's powerful data center chips, but the company's gaming graphics cards are also capable of accelerating AI workloads. Of course, Nvidia's gaming GPUs aren't as powerful, and they're not tuned specifically for that purpose. But they're still very capable.\nIf export restrictions were ever applied to powerful gaming GPUs as well -- perhaps an unlikely scenario -- it would cause all sorts of problems for Nvidia. Board partners wouldn't be able to get graphics chips, so it would affect sales in regions beyond China.\nShould you buy on the bad news?\nNvidia stock has been slumping for nearly a year, and this export news isn't helping. Shares of Nvidia were down more than 7% on Thursday as investors reacted to the escalation in trade tensions between the U.S. and China.\nIs Nvidia now a bargain? I wouldn't be so sure. The semiconductor industry is cyclical, and Nvidia is in the bad part of the cycle right now. There's too much supply and too little demand, which means that Nvidia is being forced to slash prices to move inventory. Net income crashed 72% year over year in the second quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe situation will eventually improve, but there's probably no going back to the pandemic-era frenzy around graphics cards. Based on the current stock price, Nvidia trades for around 40 times forward earnings. Considering that the oversupply of gaming GPUs could go on for a while and that the Chinese export situation could potentially escalate, that valuation doesn't seem like a clear-cut bargain to me.\n\n\n\nTimothy Green has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

CNMC Goldmine will begin the commercial production of base metals with the official opening of its flotation plant on Sept 11. The opening was officiated by YAB Ustaz Dato\u2019 Bentara Kanan Haji Ahmad Bin Yakob, the Chief Minister of Malaysia\u2019s Kelantan state.  The plant, which was built at a cost of RM20 million ($6.2 million), will enable the group to produce lead and zinc concentrate for sale, adding to the group\u2019s gold mining portfolio. It had already begun the trial production of lead and zinc in June, a month after its construction was completed. The plant is designed to process some 550 tonnes of base-metal ore a day at full capacity. The new plant is located at the group\u2019s flagship Sokor gold mine in Kelantan. According to independent mining advisory firm Datamine Australia, Sokor had an estimated 135,290 tonnes of unmined lead and 143,510 tonnes of unmined zinc as at Dec 31, 2021. The estimates were nearly triple the estimates of 46,300 tonnes and 48,550 tonnes of unmined lead and zinc, respectively, reported in the year before. In addition, Sokor had about 5.73 million ounces of unmined silver as at Dec 31, 2021, 70% higher than the 3.37 million ounces of unmined silver the year before. \u201cThe official opening of this flotation plant marks a new chapter of growth for us. Having been producing and selling gold for more than 10 years, we can now add lead and zinc concentrate to our portfolio. This is expected to give us additional streams of income even as we continue to expand our gold operations,\u201d says Chris Lim, CEO of CNMC Goldmine. As at 11.01am, shares in CNMC Goldmine are trading flat at 19.5 cents.

Moderating the chat is Rich Karlgaard, Futurist and Editor-at-Large, Forbes Media. (PHOTO: Forbes Global CEO Conference)   SINGAPORE \u2013 \"You know, I don't go into a job thinking right away about what my legacy will be.\" To laughs from the audience \u2013 C-level executives gathered for the Forbes Global CEO Conference gala dinner \u2013 Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong was responding to a question about what he thought his legacy may be as the next prime minister.  The two-day Forbes conference, held at the Ritz Carlton from 26-27 September, has drawn about 400 international business leaders to Singapore. \"If there's one thing I believe in, it is that every leader has a different style... and that whatever that approach is, it has to be suited to the circumstances and needs of society, or the organisation of that time,\" Wong, who is also Finance Minister, said on Monday (26 September). \"I believe that I'm here not just to lead but also to serve, and I see myself very much as a servant leader, doing my best to serve Singapore and Singaporeans.\" \"We want to build a Singapore that lasts and endures, and thrives, for generations to come. And that's what I hope to do,\" Wong said during the chat, which was moderated by Rich Karlgaard, Futurist and Editor-at-Large, Forbes Media.

It's quite clear that we have settled the succession issue in our team... I'm honoured by the choice.\" He added, \"The Prime Minister has said that he would like it to be sooner and he never fails to remind me that this is something that's on his mind. But I have also said that we will do it at a time when we are ready... We will let Singaporeans know in due course.\" Growing tensions Wong also spoke about the growing tension between the US and China, and that how it, coupled with the Ukraine invasion and disruptions to energy and food supplies, there is a sense that \"we are entering a new era in the global order\". Despite these challenging times, \"we (Singapore) can continue to be a bastion for stability, opportunities and innovation\". Still, Singapore is worried, Wong said. \"The US-China relationship is the most consequential relationship to the world, and it shapes the tone of global affairs,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, relations are worsening and we can see that happening day by day, and the countries are divided on many issues... so, we do worry.\"   Story continues Singapore, he said, has been \"encouraging both sides to keep open lines of communication, especially and including at the highest levels\".Not choosing sidesHe stressed later, when asked again about US-China tensions, this time in the South China Sea, that for Singapore it is not \"an exercise to choose sides\".\"This is an exercise for us to be very clear what Singapore's interests are and continue to uphold Singapore's interests and the interests of Singaporeans,\" Wong said. \"So, for example, as a small open country, it is in our interest to maintain a rules-based multilateral system. It is in our interest for freedom of navigation and to uphold the law of the seas.\"He added that when there are issues that pertain to the country's national interests, \"we will speak up and... we will do our best to secure our interests in different areas\".\"Doing so from time to time may mean that our position coincides more with the US position. On other occasions, it may mean our decision coincides with a Chinese position, but it is not about taking sides,\" Wong said. \"It is simply about securing what is good and right for Singapore.\"Follow us on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter.

The so-called good class bungalows are being offered for S$5,200 per square foot of land, above the S$4,291 per square foot all-time-high sale price set in 2021 by Stamped.io startup founder Tommy Ong, the report said. They are being sold by Cuscaden Peak Investments.  Good class bungalows are the pinnacle of residential property in the city-state, often out of reach for all but the wealthiest Singaporeans and valued in part for their rarity. The three for sale were renovated in 2015, the report said. Family offices and ultra-rich, newly minted Singapore citizens have already scheduled viewings for the properties, said William Wong, founder of the appointed agent Realstar Premier. The deadline for potential bidders to submit offers is Nov. 3. Cuscaden Peak Investments is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cuscaden Peak Pte., a consortium led by billionaire hotelier Ong Beng Seng that owns property assets from student accommodation to nursing homes. A Cuscaden spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately reply to requests for comment from Bloomberg News. Each of the two-storey bungalows sits on a 15,000 square-foot (1,400 square-meter) plot of land, with built-up areas of around 7,000 square feet including five bedrooms and a swimming pool. \u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.

That\u2019s what I thought after seeing the news of transport giant ComfortDelgro Corporation Limited (SGX: C52), or CDG, being replaced on the Straits Times Index (SGX: ^STI), by Emperador Inc (SGX: EMI). The switch will take effect on September 19th. Unsurprisingly, many friends who are shareholders of CDG texted me in confusion as they assumed the worst.First of all, this replacement on the bellwether index is not a direct result of deteriorating business fundamentals.  Secondly, some of you may be wondering, what is this Emperador and what does the company do? You can find out more about the liquor giant here. As the Straits Times Index, or STI, tracks the performance of the 30 largest and most liquid companies, it is not surprising for CDG to be rotated out during this quarterly review. From the chart below, CDG is the company with the smallest market capitalisation among the other constituent companies.    Source: Compiled market cap from sginvestors.io as at 6 September 2022 That said, it\u2019s still business as usual for CDG. The following are four reasons why this blue-chip remains a darling. 1. Still a blue-chip A blue-chip is a company that has a large market capitalisation (in the billions), a strong reputation or brand, and is backed by consistent earnings and cash flows from its operation. CDG is a land transport giant that commands a fleet size of about 35,000 buses, taxis and rental vehicles. It is also Singapore\u2019s largest taxi operator with a 60% market share. CDG, through its wholly owned subsidiary VICOM (SGX: WJP), is also Singapore\u2019s largest vehicle inspection company with 35 inspection lanes across seven centres. As you can see from the revenue and profit charts below, CDG looks like it is slowly recovering from the pandemic-driven dent in fiscal year 2020 (FY2020).    Source: compiled from Moomoo data broker, CDG financial statements In its fiscal 2022\u2019s first half (1H2022) earnings, revenue was up 6.7% year on year to S$1.9 billion, while net profit rose 30.4% year on year to S$118.7 million. It is noteworthy that 1H2022 revenue is already more than 50% of the full year revenue seen in FY2020 and FY2021. With more countries adopting the \u201cliving with covid\u201d theme and relaxing their policies (e.g. Singapore\u2019s indoor mask removal policy), CDG\u2019s business units are expected to benefit from more ridership-related contributions. 2. High dividend payout ratio In FY2021, CDG nearly tripled its dividend to S$0.042 from FY2020\u2019s S$0.0143. For 1H2022, CDG declared an interim dividend of S$0.0285, a 35.7% year on year increase from that of S$0.021 in 1H2021.   Story continues Apart from that, a special dividend of S$0.0141 was also declared, bringing the total dividend announced in 1H2022 to S$0.0426.The special dividend was a direct result of the exceptional gain on the disposal of its Alperton property in London.CDG has a consistent dividend payout policy to pay out at least 50% of its profits. The interim dividend declared this time round for 1H2022 represents a 70% payout ratio.Combining the dividends of 1H2022, and coupling it with last year\u2019s final dividend of S$0.021, the trailing 12-month dividend stood at S$0.0636.At a unit price of S$1.38, CDG shares have a trailing dividend yield of 4.6%.3. Strong and diverse businessesTaxi services aside, CDG\u2019s other businesses range from public transportation and inspection and testing services to automotive engineering services and car rental and leasing.  Source: CDG\u2019s 1H2022 earnings release, segmental revenueThese businesses are sizable and important enough to contribute to CDG\u2019s top line.Geographically, although Singapore contributes to the bulk of its revenue, CDG also has a healthy spread of revenue contribution from overseas.In 1H2022, 42.6% of its total revenue came from the UK/Ireland, Australia, China, Vietnam and Malaysia.4. New business drivers\u00a0Lastly, CDG has been putting resources and effort into creating new drivers for its business.CDG plans to drive growth in four business segments; namely rail, electrification, logistics, and non-emergency medical transportation.CDG has been active in the acquisitions space from the later part of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022.These moves are strategically in line with how CDG builds strong business moats.A great example is where CDG acquired a 90% stake in Ming Chuan Transportation Pte Ltd to strengthen its medical transport segment.This deal would cement CDG as the largest wheelchair transport service provider in Singapore, a smart bet that would pay off as Singapore\u2019s population ages.Get Smart: Focus on the businessBeing replaced on the STI is not all doom and gloom, especially when your business has multiple competitive moats and can perform consistently well even during bad times.I can sleep soundly at night knowing that CDG is a consistent performer and can deliver the growth that I expect as a shareholder in the future.In our special FREE report, Top 9 Dividend Stocks for 2022 \u2013 and 3 Tactical Shifts to Maximise Your Profits, we\u2019re revealing 3 special categories of stocks that are poised to deliver maximum growth in 2022 and beyond.Our safe-harbour stocks are a set of blue-chip companies that have been able to hold their own and deliver steady dividends.

The deal is part of Sembcorp Industries' strategy to shift to green energy generation, the company said in a filing to the Singapore Stock Exchange.  Sembcorp Energy, one of the largest power producers in India, operates two coal-fired power plants totalling 2.64 gigawatts, servicing nearly 2.5 million households. Sembcorp said the sale, priced at book value via its wholly owned subsidiary Sembcorp Utilities Pte Ltd, would result in Tanweer Infrastructure - part of a consortium led by Oman Investment Corporation and an Omani pension fund - becoming Sembcorp Energy's sole shareholder. Speaking at a media briefing on Monday, Sembcorp's Chief Financial Officer Eugene Cheng said there is a lack of liquidity for financing coal-related assets in the current market. Tanweer Infrastructure will finance the purchase via a deferred payment note provided by SCU, the company said. Sembcorp's executives said at the briefing that the sale would not mean the company's exit in India, and that it would invest more in the market and elsewhere. Indian local newspaper Mint reported in August that Sembcorp was bidding for Indian clean energy platform Vector Green Energy. Sembcorp's President and Chief Executive Wong Kim Yin declined to comment on the Vector acquisition, but said the group was \"constantly on the lookout for new assets\". The Sembcorp Energy India sale is subject to Sembcorp shareholders' approval in November and is expected to be completed six months later if regulatory clearance is obtained. HSBC's Singapore branch is the sole advisor to the sale, Sembcorp said.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

While we could not answer all questions, we found the most common ones and our experts responded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 40 Series\nQ: What makes the GeForce RTX 4080 16 GB and 12 GB graphics cards keep the same \u201c4080\u201d name if they have completely different amounts of CUDA cores and are different chips? \nLink\nThe GeForce RTX 4080 16GB and 12GB naming is similar to the naming of two versions of RTX 3080 that we had last generation, and others before that. There is an RTX 4080 configuration with a 16GB frame buffer, and a different configuration with a 12GB frame buffer. One product name, two configurations.\nThe 4080 12GB is an incredible GPU, with performance exceeding our previous generation flagship, the RTX 3090 Ti and 3x the performance of RTX 3080 Ti with support for DLSS 3, so we believe it\u2019s a great 80-class GPU. We know many gamers may want a premium option so the RTX 4080 16GB comes with more memory and even more performance. The two versions will be clearly identified on packaging, product details, and retail so gamers and creators can easily choose the best GPU for themselves.\nQ: How does the RTX 40 Series perform compared to the 30 series if DLSS frame generation isn't turned on?\nLink\nYou can find more performance information here.\nThis chart has DLSS turned on when supported, but there are some games like Division 2 and Assassin's Creed Valhalla in the chart that don\u2019t have DLSS, so you can see performance compared to our fastest RTX 30 Series GPU without DLSS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: There's been a great deal of content on the visual and gaming stuff, but I'm more interested in the CUDA capabilities. The number of cores is down against the corresponding RTX 30xx models, but the supported capabilities are upgraded. How much faster/better/more efficient are the CUDA cores on the RTX 40xx in existing workflows?\nLink\nCUDA application workflows can be more diverse than gaming. In general, the significant core clock increase means that the shader horsepower is greatly increased generation on generation, ranging from 30% to 120%. CUDA applications that have more challenging memory access patterns can also benefit from the larger L2 cache. For creator workflows, the GeForce RTX 40 Series is up to 2x faster in offline rendering apps - like Blender or V-Ray, and paired with DLSS 3 it\u2019s up to 4x faster in real-time rendering apps - like Omniverse, Unreal, or Unity. This is all while drawing equal or less power than the previous generation.\nQ: What kind of power adapters are required for GeForce RTX 4090 & RTX 4080 (16GB) & RTX 4080 (12GB)?\u00a0\nThe RTX 4090 uses the new PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable. We expect PSUs with this connector to be available in October. However the 4090 will come with a power adapter that allows you to use a power supply with your existing 8-pin PCIe connectors.\nThe RTX 4080 also uses a PCIe Gen5 power connector and also ships with a power adapter that supports PCIe 8-pin connectors.\nPlease note, the existing 12 pin cables and adapters from the RTX 30 Series generation are not compatible with RTX 40 Series graphics cards.\nQ: Why isn\u2019t DisplayPort 2.0 listed on the spec sheet?\nLink\nThe current DisplayPort 1.4 standard already supports 8K at 60Hz. Support for DisplayPort 2.0 in consumer gaming displays are still a ways away in the future.\nQ: Can someone explain these performance claims in how they relate to gaming? 2-4x faster seems unprecedented. Usually from generation to generation GPU's see a 30-50% increase in performance. Is the claim being made that these cards will at *minimum* double the performance for gaming?\nLink\nThe RTX 4090 achieves up to 2-4x performance through a combination of software and hardware enhancements. We\u2019ve upgraded all three RTX processors - Shader Cores, RT Cores and Tensor Cores. Combined with our new DLSS 3 AI frame generation technology the RTX 4090 delivers up to 2x performance in the latest games and creative applications vs. RTX 3090 Ti. When looking at next generation content that puts a higher workload on the GPU we see up to 4x performance gains. These are not minimum performance gains - they are the gains you can expect to see on the more computationally intensive games and applications.\nYou can find more performance information here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 3\nQ: Will DLSS 2.X continue to be improved and supported in future titles?\u00a0\nLink\nDLSS 3 consists of 3 technologies \u2013 DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution (a.k.a. DLSS 2), and NVIDIA Reflex.\nDLSS Frame Generation uses RTX 40 Series high-speed Optical Flow Accelerator to calculate the motion flow that is used for the AI network, then executes the network on 4th Generation Tensor Cores. Support for previous GPU architectures would require further innovation and optimization for the optical flow algorithm and AI model.\u00a0\nDLSS Super Resolution and NVIDIA Reflex will of course remain supported on prior generation hardware, so current GeForce\u00a0gamers and creators will benefit from games integrating DLSS 3. We continue to research and train the AI for DLSS Super Resolution and will provide model updates for all RTX customers as we have been doing since DLSS\u2019s initial release.\n\n\n\nDLSS 3 Sub-Feature \nGPU Hardware Support \n\n\nDLSS Frame Generation \nGeForce RTX 40 Series GPU \n\n\nDLSS Super Resolution (a.k.a. DLSS 2) \nGeForce RTX 20/30/40 Series GPU \n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex \nGeForce 900 Series and newer GPU \n\n\n\nQ: DLSS 3.0 looks great and is really impressive on a technical level. Do the improvements in DLSS 3.0 vs 2.0 require engine level updates? Or can DLSS 3.0 be implemented easily in games that already support DLSS 2.0 without much development effort?\nLink\nDLSS 3 is designed for fast and easy integration. It is already becoming one of our most rapidly adopted technologies with over 35 games and apps coming soon. The first games arrive in October.\nDLSS 3 leverages the same integration points as DLSS 2 and NVIDIA Reflex, making upgrades from these existing SDKs easy via a DLSS 3 Streamline plugin.\nDLSS 3 is also coming to the world\u2019s most popular game engines, including Unity, Unreal Engine, and Frostbite Engine, making it simple for games based on these engines to switch DLSS 3 on.\nQ: How does optical flow fit into the model? If DLSS 2 is spatial reconstruction of the next frame, does it mean we have temporal reconstruction multiple frames ahead? Also, does it enable you to get lower than 25% of the pixels rendered (DLSS performance mode)?\nLink\nThere are two AI models in DLSS 3 - DLSS Super Resolution (aka DLSS 2) and DLSS Frame Generation. DLSS Super Resolution boosts frame rate by rendering fewer pixels and then using AI to construct a sharp, higher resolution image. DLSS Frame Generation analyzes sequential frames and motion data from the new Optical Flow Accelerator in GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs to create additional high quality frames, boosting performance while maintaining great image quality and responsiveness. When DLSS 3 is enabled, the first frame is reconstructed by DLSS Super Resolution, and the following frame by DLSS Frame Generation. In total, DLSS 3 enables you to reconstruct 7/8s of the total displayed pixels.

Can we expect other similar projects in the future?\nLink\nWe are glad you like Portal with RTX!\u00a0NVIDIA RTX Remix is the modding platform used to develop Portal with RTX and will be available as a free toolkit for the community to remaster similar games - or to continue to build on Portal with RTX. We\u2019re excited to see what the community will come up with! We don\u2019t have anything further to announce on NVIDIA Lightspeed Studio projects at this time.\nQ: Is RTX Remix locked to 40xx cards?\nLink\nNo. Performance aside, RTX Mods created with RTX Remix (including Portal with RTX) are expected to run on GPUs that support Vulkan Ray Tracing. The RTX Remix creator toolkit will be supported on 8GB+ RTX GPUs.\nThat said, RTX 40 Series cards with DLSS 3 will deliver the best performance for RTX Remix and RTX Mods. Minimum and recommended GPUs will be provided closer to RTX Remix beta release.\nQ: In the Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind RTX Remix showcase, what work is being done by AI and what is being done by artists?\nWe\u2019ve seen some confusion on this topic so let me clear it up. RTX Remix includes AI-texture tools for upscaling textures by 4X and converting them to be physically based materials. Whenever we show a scene simply processed by AI Texture Tools, we label them as \u201cAI Enhanced\u201d. In our view, AI is helpful at getting a modder started on their remaster. But to achieve an RTX On quality remaster, we encourage modders to hand build the more important assets to achieve their artistic vision.\nWith both Portal with RTX and The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, NVIDIA\u2019s team used Omniverse\u2019s ecosystem of connected creator applications like Adobe Substance, Autodesk Maya and Blender to further enhance most of the assets. In our trailer, we use \u201cRTX On\u201d to signal when we are showing a remastered scene, complete with ray tracing, RT-ready custom assets, and DLSS 3. To see how we added RTX to Morrowind, check out our explainer video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ:\u00a0NVIDIA Remix surely seems wonderful news for the modding space, how broad will be its applicability? Will every game be able to support it, or will it be limited to just some chosen games? \nLink\nInitially, we plan to ship with support for DirectX 8 and 9 games that utilize a fixed function graphics pipeline. Game compatibility may vary by title \u2013 more information will be provided closer to beta release. Definitely let us know which DirectX 8 and 9 games you are excited about modding!\nQ: How is it possible to inject a modded scene back into the game? All these new objects, lighting sources. They need to interact with game engine/NPCs/player characters somehow, but how?\nLink\nThe game engine sends commands to the DirectX runtime, and it\u2019s these commands which instruct the GPU to render these NPCs/Player characters correctly. RTX Remix intercepts those commands from the application, before they reach the GPU, and alters them based on the content creators desires, as expressed in the RTX Remix toolkit.\nQ: Will RTX Remix allow the integration of DLSS 2 and FSR 2.1, or is the upscaling limited to DLSS 3?\nLink\nCurrently RTX Remix supports DLSS 3 features which includes DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution (aka DLSS 2), and NVIDIA Reflex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex\nQ: What about the raw performance? You did a good job in DLSS and ray tracing, but as a competitive FPS player, I care more about raw performance.\nLink\nRaw performance received a major uplift this generation as well! RTX 40 Series GPUs enable 1440p competitive gaming at 360+ FPS. I\u2019m playing Valorant consistently over 400 FPS at 1440p. Check out more in our article that was posted today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: A friend of mine some weeks ago was telling\u00a0me how NVIDIA Reflex is a feature thought for older gpus, is it true? Do older models have the most benefits?\nLink\nOlder GPUs tend to have lower FPS and higher latency, which means there is more latency for NVIDIA Reflex to mitigate.\nFor example (not real data):\u00a0\n\nOld GPU - Reflex OFF 50ms -> Reflex ON 30ms\nNew GPU - Reflex OFF 25ms -> Reflex ON 18ms\n\nBoth old and new GPUs benefit from NVIDIA Reflex. The % savings will just be higher on the older GPU due to it having higher base latency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Broadcast, NVIDIA Studio & NVENC\nQ: What would be the benefits of\u00a0using NVIDIA NVENC over the more traditional x264?\nLink\nx264 is a software encoder that works on CPU, whereas NVENC is a hardware encoder that uses dedicated hardware on NVIDIA GPUs. x264 will utilize part of your CPU, leaving less power to run your games or other apps. NVENC operates on an independent part of the GPU, leaving the CPU and GPU to render the game and apps. Hence, NVENC allows you to maximize the use of your hardware and get more FPS.\nOn top of that, next gen codecs like AV1 consume a lot of resources and cannot run on a typical CPU. But with NVENC in GeForce RTX 40 Series you can encode AV1 up to 8K60 seamlessly.\nQ: Any updates to NVDEC? Still reliant on either M1 or Quicksync for 10 bit 422 decode.\nLink\nGeForce RTX 40 Series use the same NVIDIA Decoder as RTX 30 Series - 5th generation NVDEC. There is no support for 10-bit 4:2:2 decode.\nQ: Will ShadowPlay benefit from the NVENC improvements and the addition of AV1 encoding?\nLink\nShadowPlay has been updated to make use of GeForce RTX 40 Series dual encoders, enabling ShadowPlay to record up to 8K60 HDR in HEVC. AV1 is not currently supported in ShadowPlay.\nQ: What are the performance increases like for blender, and other 3D suites?\nLink\nGeForce RTX 40 Series is up to 2x faster gen-to-gen in offline renderers - like Chaos V-Ray or Blender; and paired with DLSS 3 it\u2019s up to 4x faster in real-time renderers - like Omniverse, Unreal Engine, or Unity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHead to GeForce.com to learn more about GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards and everything else we announced at our GeForce Beyond keynote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The manager of First REIT, on Sept 21, announced that the REIT has acquired two nursing homes in Japan. The homes, which are located near the city centres of Tokyo and Nagoya, were acquired for a purchase consideration of 2.6 billion yen ($26.3 million).  The REIT, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, OUELH Japan Medical Facilities Pte. Ltd., had entered into a tokumei kumiai agreement, or silent partnership agreement for the acquisition of the two nursing homes, Loyal Residence Ayase (Ayase) and Medical Rehabilitation Home Bon S\u00e9jour Komaki (Komaki). The properties have a combined net yield of 5.2%. Ayase, a three-storey nursing home with 80 rooms, has a gross floor area (GFA) of 3,386.52 sqm (36,452.2 sq ft). Komaki, a 10-storey nursing home building with 124 rooms and 165 beds, has a GFA of 8,858.49 sqm. Following the acquisitions, First REIT\u2019s portfolio will be more diversified geographically, with developed markets contributing to approximately one quarter of its assets under management (AUM). The REIT\u2019s tenant diversification will also improve, with the addition of two well-established and experienced third-party operators Social Welfare Research Institute Co., Ltd. and Benesse Style Care Co., Ltd. The acquisitions will be fully funded by debt, and are expected to be accretive to the REIT\u2019s distribution per unit (DPU).  \u201cJapan is one of the key growth markets for First REIT. Our timely penetration and expansion into Kanagawa and Aichi prefectures, after establishing a strong foothold from our maiden acquisition of 12 nursing homes across Japan early this year, will position First REIT for long-term growth with stability,\u201d says Victor Tan, executive director and CEO of the manager. \u201cThese acquisitions are in line with one of our strategic pillars under First REIT 2.0 growth strategy to step up growth in developed markets to more than 50% of our portfolio, which the Trust is progressing steadily towards fulfilling this strategic goal. The enlarged asset base and portfolio diversification will also pave the way for sustainable distributions for unitholders of First REIT,\u201d Tan adds. Units in First REIT closed flat at 27.5 cents on Sept 21.

Angela Koo   18 September 2022 4 min read       In this article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   SE   -5.01%             Sea Ltd is reportedly cutting compensation for its top management, including its CEO. According to Bloomberg News which saw the internal memo, Sea\u2019s leadership team will not take any cash compensation until the company reaches self-sufficiency. This comes as Sea struggles with a perfect storm of declining market value, rising interest rates, increasing inflation, and a volatile stock market environment. This isn\u2019t the first instance of a company CEO cutting compensation (nor will it be the last). However, the question is why would top management cut their own compensation? Read Also: 5 Employee Benefits You Can Offer Your Staff Without Giving A Pay Raise Past Examples Of Top Management That Have Cut Compensation When Their Companies Face Severe Headwinds During the start of the pandemic, many companies faced severe headwinds as the pandemic and its resultant lockdowns took its toll on the economy. The severe impact on aviation caused SIA to implement cost-cutting measures such as staff pay cuts in 2020. This included a 35% pay cut for CEO, 30% pay cut for executive vice-presidents, 25% pay cut for senior vice-presidents, 15% pay cut for vice-presidents and divisional vice-presidents, and 12% pay cuts for managers and senior managers.  Likewise, the CEOs of the 3 largest banks (DBS, OCBC and UOB) in Singapore were cut by 8.2% to 24.3% in FY2020 as the banks experienced lower earnings during that period of the pandemic. Read Also: 10 Types Of Employee Payments (Apart From Salary) That Businesses Need To Pay CPF For This practice of cutting leadership compensation is also seen in other countries. A Fortune analysis found that 657 companies listed on the Russell 3000 publicly announced the intention to cut the base salaries of their chief executive in 2020. Only 512 followed through with the pay cuts. Despite publicly announcing pay cuts, 135 companies had their CEO base pay increase (117) or remain the same (18). In fact, the median compensation for Russell 3000 CEOs increased 3.4% in 2020. Thus, public announcements of pay cuts may not actually translate to an actual reduction in compensation. Companies may change or reverse their positions due to changes in the market environment or when headwinds turn to tailwinds. CEO Compensation Is Often More Than Base Salary The other aspect to consider when looking at CEO pay cuts is whether the cuts are to base salary or to total compensation. This is important because CEOs are often compensated not just in salary and bonuses but also in stock options and stock ownership. For example, with 2020 bank CEO pay cuts, the base salary for these CEOs was untouched, but the pay cuts were a result of cuts to bonuses, share awards and other benefits. Whereas, for SIA, the pay cuts are to the base salary. For SEA management, the proposed cut is to cash compensation.   Story continues The other consideration is the benefits that top management receives. Top management may enjoy lavish benefits such as business class travel, luxurious hotel stays for business trips, and meals and entertainment reimbursement.For Sea Ltd, the cost-cutting measures to help the company achieve positive cash flow as soon as possible also include cutting away frills and excessive benefits. The company will cap business travel to economy class flight fares, limit travel meal expenses to $30 a day, hotel stays to $150 a night, and cull reimbursement for meals and entertainment bills.Cutting CEO Compensation Sends A Signal To EmployeesWhether the CEO takes a 100% or a 10% pay cut, cutting CEO compensation is likely to have minimal effect on the company\u2019s bottom line. However, it does have an outsized effect on employees.For SIA, having the top management take a larger pay cut than middle- or lower-management and non-management staff sends a signal of solidarity to the rest of the company. The higher cuts to top management make the cuts feel more equitable even if they do not have the same impact in absolute numbers.Likewise, SEA\u2019s proposed pay cuts would go a long way to restoring the company\u2019s public image which has been tarnished by the rescindment of job offers by Shopee, Sea\u2019s e-commerce arm. Amidst the adjustments to hiring plans, job cuts and project shutdowns, cutting CEO compensation signals Sea\u2019s commitment to cost cutting and top management\u2019s drive to focus on profitability. Limiting the pay cuts to top management may also help retain (or even improve) the morale of existing employees, even amidst cost-cutting.Read Also: 10 Types Of Company Benefits That Employees Have To Pay Income Tax OnThe post Sea Leadership Cuts Compensation: Why Do Companies Cut The Pay Of Their Top Management? appeared first on DollarsAndSense Business.

Pretty much anything an investor could want is available for purchase through Robinhood. In that sense, it isn\u2019t much different from any other platform.\u00a0\nSo, the best Robinhood stocks to buy are essentially the best stocks to buy, period. But if we look at trades that are trending on Robinhood, then it\u2019s a bit different. We can whittle that down further, as well. \nWithout further ado, here are the seven best stocks among the 20 most popular assets on Robinhood.\n\n\nBest Robinhood Stocks: Microsoft (MSFT)\nSource: Peteri / Shutterstock.com\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is currently the most popular choice on the Robinhood platform. I have to agree, it\u2019s a strong choice no matter which platform investors purchase it from.\u00a0\nThere are multiple reasons that Microsoft is a strong choice. For one, influential analysts, including Wedbush\u2019s Daniel Ives, see it as a secular winner within tech. The long-term outlook that favors Microsoft is its cloud offering, Azure, and the notions that favor the cloud haven\u2019t dimmed. That\u2019s why Ives has identified it among his secular winners within the tech sector.\u00a0\nPersonally, I like Microsoft because it\u2019s relatively cheap right now. Its current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 6.6x isn\u2019t much higher than that of the S&P 500, which is presently at 19.6x. Investors should understand that Microsoft\u2019s P/E ratio was as high as it is now throughout 2019. Investors likely won\u2019t continue to consider MSFT stock overpriced for long.\u00a0\n\nWalmart (WMT)\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\nInvestors are judging whether it makes sense to buy Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock currently. I\u2019d side with Robinhood investors who have it among their top 20 picks right now. On the one hand, Walmart\u2019s share prices fell off a cliff in mid-May when earnings showed that rising costs were eating into its profitability. Its share price has gradually risen since then, but still hasn\u2019t returned to prior levels.\nWalmart did well throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and was able to absorb price increases while maintaining steady earnings beats. That changed in the first quarter of 2022 as the world\u2019s largest retailer missed earnings per share (EPS) targets that averaged $1.48, posting an EPS of $1.30.\nIt seems Robinhood investors are buying into Walmart\u2019s reputation as one of the most recession-proof stocks there is. I\u2019d argue that is smart and the worse things get, the better WMT stock should perform.\u00a0\n\nBest Robinhood Stocks: Apple (AAPL)\n\n\nSource: Apple\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is simply one of the best choices in the market. Share prices have risen to $150 since this summer, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going any lower. For one, Apple has a strong P/E ratio of 24.9x that compares favorably to that of the S&P 500.\u00a0\nTech is down, but it will return as a major mover of the markets. When it does, Apple will surge upward and all of its detractors will be left behind.\u00a0\nFor the investor willing to take a long-term perspective, right now is a great time to buy AAPL stock. It has provided 22.7% annual returns over the past decade. The company has already let it be known that it will slow during the current quarter. But after that, it should be right back on track. Investors who put their money in a decade ago have seen it multiply by a factor of greater than seven.\u00a0\n\nFord (F)\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\nIf we continue with the idea of 10-year performance, Ford (NYSE:F) stock wouldn\u2019t be high on many investors\u2019 lists. It has provided relatively measly 8.2% returns over the same period. So, $1,000 invested a decade ago would have only grown to $2,205 today.\u00a0\nBut the argument in favor of Ford is not about the past and instead relies on the future. It\u2019s really about the transition toward an electric future and what that should mean for F stock. Right now, Ford has a relatively modest electric vehicle (EV) lineup and a low P/E ratio of 5.1x. That ratio signals investors aren\u2019t interested in paying for high multiples of company earnings.\u00a0\nBut, as EV sales increase, that should change. Ford has watched as EV stocks have benefited from very high valuations. That has proven to the firm it can benefit from a more heavily EV-dominated lineup.\u00a0\n\nBest Robinhood Stocks: Meta Platforms (META)\n\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe argument in favor of purchasing Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock in July is this: Even though profit forecasts don\u2019t look too high, its inherent value remains high.\u00a0\nWhat I mean is this: Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White was critical of the business this summer and dropped his target price from $300 to $250 in the process. After praising the firm for its strong position in digital ads, the metaverse and stock repurchases, he highlighted many of the broader knocks, stating:\n\u201cHowever, the economy appears to be on the brink of a recession, regulatory headwinds persist, equity markets are in turmoil, and we expect the geopolitical landscape will grow more treacherous.\u201d\nThat notion led him to assert that current revenue estimates for the quarter and year are overstated and to drop his target price to $250. In other words, META stock has massive upside from its current price near $146, even after accounting for downward revised guidance.\u00a0\n\nLucid (LCID)\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\nIt\u2019s easy to see why Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) stock has received a lot of bad press: Share prices are way down and 2022 delivery projections are looking less and less likely to be met.\u00a0\nAdd to that questions about valuation that suggest LCID stock should trade lower than it does based on 2023 sales projections, and the case becomes bleaker. The argument is Lucid simply doesn\u2019t deserve to trade for more than eight times 2023 sales, while the average EV firm trades for approximately 2.6x 2023 sales.\u00a0\nA Barron\u2019s contributor rightly pointed out Saudi backing differentiates Lucid from its peers, who lack access to such deep-pocketed backers. But also consider Lucid is coming directly for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). That\u2019s a different market than any of the other competitors. In fact, Lucid\u2019s top-of-the-line vehicles are even pricier than Tesla\u2019s. Luxury combined with EV technology means those valuations are likely accurate.\u00a0\n\nBest Robinhood Stocks: Nvidia (NVDA)\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\nInvestors who are going to buy into Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock currently believe it is oversold. It\u2019s no secret that chipmaker stocks and tech stocks at large have taken a beating. Persistent inflation, concerns over interest rate hikes and an overall sense that a recession or worse is ahead are keeping them low.\u00a0\nBut Nvidia has a leg up on the competition as its position in gaming gives it a strong secular driver. Yes, that growth may be slowing, but NVDA stock is among the best positioned to take advantage.\u00a0\u00a0\nFurther, it looks like Nvidia shouldn\u2019t drop much further based on its current P/E ratio, which isn\u2019t far out of line with historic trends. At the end of the day, Nvidia will remain a great chip stock with plenty of strength moving forward.\u00a0\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

After all meme stocks are volatile by nature.\nOther than following meme stocks online, speculators cannot predict when they will surge. These meme stocks to buy all have been on the ropes but look as if they might have a recovery in their future.\nRemember that as the market weakens, some stocks may be getting dumped out of fear rather than because they have poor fundamentals or are overvalued.\nOne of the things that separated a true \u201cmeme stock\u201d from a stock that just behaves like one is cash burn. Companies that continue to raise cash by diluting their investors should be avoided.\n\n\n\n\nAMD\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n$74.48\n\n\nFDX\nFedEx\n$153.25\n\n\nGME\nGameStop\n$26.86\n\n\nNVDA\nNvidia\n$132.61\n\n\nQQQ\nInvesco QQQ Trust\n$283.56\n\n\nTLT\niShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF\u00a0\n$108.03\n\n\nTSLA\nTesla\n$300.80\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the earliest meme stocks investors believed in. Before its incredible turnaround, led by Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su, AMD stock traded in the two-dollar range.\nThe company saddled its balance with debt. It failed to pivot its chip business with products better than the competition.\nPatient investors who waited for the \u201cAMD rocket ship\u201d to blast off made up to 30 times their return. The stock traded as high as $164.46 in the last year.\nIt is in a downtrend along with the semiconductor industry. On August 29, the firm announced the launch of the Ryzen 7000 series desktop processors. The Zen 4 architecture offers customers up to 16 cores and 32 threads. The company\u2019s supplier manufactures the chip on the 5nm process node.\nSavvy investors are not expecting AMD 7000 computer chips to sell out. If proven wrong, AMD will be one of the meme stocks to buy for the long term.\nAfter the announcement, the company earns back the title of having fastest core in gaming. Customers who delayed their purchase will order the latest AMD product. This would help AMD stock rise.\n\nFedEx (FDX)\nSource: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.com\nNeither analysts nor markets expected FedEx (NYSE:FDX) would pre-announce poor first quarter results.\nFDX stock lost over 20% on September 16, 2022, when it also withdrew its guidance.\nFedEx\u2019s surprising revelation should encourage meme creators to promote the stock\u2019s low price at these levels. In its preliminary report, FedEx said that the fiscal 2023 revenue of $23.2 billion.\nThis closely matches the $22.0 billion from last year. Unfortunately, operating income will fall from $1.4 billion last year to $1.19 billion. Its earnings per share of $3.33 are lower than last year\u2019s $4.09 EPS.\nFedEx expects a shortfall of around $500 million in revenue. FedEx Express is experiencing macroeconomic weakness in Asia. China\u2019s zero Covid policy and a drought disrupted output. In Europe, high energy prices are hurting demand. This in turn weakened FedEx\u2019s parcel delivery volumes making it one of the meme stocks to buy on weakness.\n\nGameStop (GME)\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) has loyal shareholders who will not sell at any cost. The company\u2019s horrendous quarterly report did not scare bulls.\nThis suggests that GME stock will outperform the index as the stock market risks crashing.\nIn the second quarter, the used game and console retailer reported net sales of $1.136 billion. This is down from $1.183 billion last year. Although selling, general, and administrative costs fell to $387.5 million, down 14.3% sequentially, it lost 35 cents a share (non-GAAP).\nChances are high that memes will circulate its digital assets pivot through its new FTX partnership. On September 7, 2022, it announced that it would introduce more GameStop customers to FTX\u2019s community and its marketplaces for digital assets.\nFTX and GameStop offered few details on the new partnership. Once it reveals the mystery, markets will re-evaluate GameStop\u2019s prospects in the cryptocurrency exchange space. Still and as ever GME is one of the original meme stocks to buy.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA)\nSource: Shutterstock\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a good candidate for becoming the next meme sensation. On September 16, 2022, the media reported that EVGA, a channel partner, would exit the graphics card market.\nEVGA shared its pains in selling Nvidia cards. The channel partner said that Nvidia did not offer basic pre-launch information about its new products.\nFortunately, markets did not share EVGA\u2019s view that Nvidia did not value its channel partners. On September 19, 2022, NVDA stock rose by 1.39%. Still, partners needed to find out about pricing and product information on the launch day.\nEVGA may have exited the market because it operated at higher costs than other suppliers. It did not want break-even profit to losses from here.\nNvidia\u2019s upcoming RTX 4000 series is a critical inflection point for the gaming firm. Nvidia could become a meme stock if this powerful graphics card price appeals to the retail customer.\nNvidia needs this launch to convince customers not to buy the current generation GPU. After crypto mining crashed, the supply of used cards flooded the market. Lower prices for used cards pressure Nvidia\u2019s profits.\nNvidia might demand a premium price from its gaming fans. This is still bullish for the stock since it lifts profit margins. The company might bet that customers choose the upcoming high-performance RTX 4000 over the cheaper RTX 3000 cards.\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\nInvesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) tracks the Nasdaq index. Technology-savvy investors would naturally bet on the QQQ stock to rise.\nThe world\u2019s biggest firms like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) account for over 20% of this ETF.\nThe tech sector overall may fall as the market crashes. However, Apple recently refreshed its iPhone and Apple Watch line-up. Meme investors may bet that Apple fans cannot live happily without upgrading. Inflation will hurt the average consumer\u2019s disposable income. Yet if Apple customers have above-average income, they can afford to upgrade.\nMicrosoft pivoted away from selling software toward annual subscriptions. No corporate worker or student may enjoy productivity without Office 365. Since subscription revenue growth will not slow, investors may hold MSFT stock through the QQQ ETF holding.\nEventually, the market\u2019s decline will end. The tech sector will rebound first. Companies are nimble. They will grow the fastest as corporate customers increase software and computer hardware spending.\n\niShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT)\nSource: larry1235 / Shutterstock.com\nThe iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) is the last asset class that will become a meme. Still, the 30-year bond is one of the most important assets to watch.\nThe more the yield on this bond rises, the more likely stocks will crash.\nTLT stock is a suitable meme because the 30-year bond price needs to stop falling. Eventually, investors will bet that yields will peak. They will accumulate government-backed debt.\nThe U.S. government\u2019s hawkish interest rate policy increases the attractiveness of debt and U.S. currency. U.S. assets are the most attractive compared to that offered by any other country.\nChances are high that the relatively optimistic view of U.S. debt will not change. The U.S. dollar could stay strong in uncertain times.\nFearful investors will park their cash in this currency. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates steadily in the next few months. When rates eventually peak, this will help TLT break out from its downtrend.\n\nTesla (TSLA)\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) faces minimal competition from emerging electric vehicle firms.\nThe company built Gigafactories around the world. It secured supply deals to lock the best prices. Companies like Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) and Fisker (NYSE:FSR) are very late in entering the market.\nTesla\u2019s early entry into EVs strengthened its brand name. The company has a wide enough variety of models to attract all segments of the market. Model 3 targets the low and medium ranges. Model Y is an SUV EV that appeals to the middle class. Model X and Model S are high-end models available to those who can afford them.\nCEO Elon Musk\u2019s bid for Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) assures he will remain relevant in the news. The more coverage he gets, the more appealing the Tesla memes.\nEurope\u2019s economic troubles might slow Tesla\u2019s growth. The mayor of Gr\u00fcnheide delayed a vote to expand the Gigafactory in Germany.\nOn the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

A simple price performance comparison shows that MATANA had the upper hand in one year. Further, on average, analysts see a higher upside in MATANA stocks. However, investing is not about buying fancy acronyms. According to TipRanks\u2019 data-driven Smart Score, only Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the MATANA list have a higher potential to outperform the market.\u00a0\n\n\nBut before we dig deeper, let\u2019s examine why FAANG needed an upgrade.\n\n\nWhy the Rebranding?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFor years, FAANG stocks - Meta (previously Facebook) (NASDAQ:META), Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Alphabet (earlier Google) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) \u2013 symbolized big tech companies.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, Wang, in a video interview with Yahoo Finance Live, suggested dropping Meta and Netflix from the big tech list and advised adding Microsoft, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to the group. Together, these stocks are now known as MATANA.\u00a0\n\n\nThe move follows the underperformance of FAANG stocks in 2022. Blame the base effect for the slowdown in their growth or investors losing appetite for risk amid fears of an economic slowdown, FAANG stocks have lost their sheen.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\nSpecifically, Meta Platforms and Netflix are struggling to stay relevant to their consumers amid their changing preferences in the post-pandemic world and heightened competition.\u00a0\n\n\nFAANG or MATANA: Which Is the Better Tech Play?\n\n\nBuilt with TipRanks\u2019\u00a0Stock Comparison tool, here is a summary of how FAANG stocks performed in the past year and what analysts recommend.\u00a0\n\n\nThe graph below shows that FAANG stocks, on average, are down over 34% in the past one year. Meanwhile, analysts\u2019 average price target reflects an upside potential of over 25% in one year.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stock Comparison tool shows that a portfolio of MATANA stocks have performed better than FAANG stocks in the past one year. For context, MATANA stocks, on average, are down about 2.2% during the comparable period, significantly outperforming FAANG stocks.\u00a0\n\n\nFurther, analysts\u2019 average price target shows an upside of over 28% in the next 12 months. \n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom Line\n\n\nMATANA is slightly more diversified than FAANG. However, this shouldn\u2019t matter much as the broader industry classification is the same, with these stocks being prone to similar risks.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, the above graph shows that only Microsoft and Apple stock sport an Outperform Smart Score on TipRanks in the MATANA list. Meanwhile, hedge funds are also bullish on only these two stocks.\u00a0\n\n\nAll in all, investors should focus on diversifying their portfolio with\u00a0Top Smart Score Stocks\u00a0across multiple sectors to lower risk and maximize gains.\u00a0\n\n\nRead full\u00a0Disclosure\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAmazon NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Acquires Wiz for a Massive $32 BillionTipRanks 8h \n\n\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Expected to Reveal New Chips at GTC Today as AI Demands Bigger GPUsTipRanks 9h \n\n\n\nAnthropic Goes All-In on Enterprise AITipRanks 10h \n\n\n\nJensen Huang Takes Center Stage: What to Expect from Nvidia\u2019s Big GTC 2025 KeynoteTipRanks 10h \n\n\n\nAmazon files lawsuit against CPSC over recalls, The Verge reportsTipRanks 11h \n\n\n\nTurkey plans to launch new regulations on big tech firms, Bloomberg reportsTipRanks 11h \n\n\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s Threat Gets Real!

The company got approval for its da Vinci surgery system back in 2000. With more than two decades of research, development, and real-world use under its belt, competitors have an uphill battle if they want to catch up with Intuitive's technology.\u00a0\nThat is unless Nvidia (NVDA -2.84%) provides some help. The chip designer and AI specialist revealed during its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) this week that many start-ups are tapping into its platform to accelerate development of their robotic surgery systems. Did Nvidia just deal a serious blow to Intuitive Surgical's ability to stay in the lead? \n\nA long list of competitors\nSuccessful technology always attracts competitors, especially when it's lucrative. Intuitive Surgical has built an empire that hauled in $6 billion in revenue over the 12 months ended in June. It also generates operating profit margins in the high 20% to low 30% range.\u00a0\nIndeed, Intuitive has attracted would-be peers, some of them privately owned and some of them now publicly traded stocks. Many of these companies are trying to speed up their development using Nvidia's Orin IGX -- the same platform Nvidia has built to help with other robotics technology. At GTC 2022, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said over 70 medical device companies are using Orin IGX and the software stack built on top of it to accelerate their smart-device development.\nIncluded in the list of companies using Orin IGX that Huang mentioned is none other than Intuitive Surgical. Other big-name peers that were mentioned include Siemens Healthineers, and Stryker. Smaller companies like Asensus Surgical\u00a0 and Olympus were also named. And start-ups Activ Surgical, Proximie, and Moon Surgical were also announced as Nvidia customers.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the list of aspiring competitors heating up, should Intuitive shareholders be worried?\nLots of new business to go around\nSurgeries performed using robotic assistance are still a small portion of the total procedures performed worldwide. Even in the U.S., where Intuitive has steadily increased the number of procedures that can be done with da Vinci and its newer Ion system, estimates are that upward of 80% of surgeries are still done without robots. That percentage of non-robotic surgery is much higher in most other countries.\nThere is still a massive amount of white space for Intuitive and others. Medical care is highly personalized, and the types of procedures that can be improved with AI-powered robotics number in the hundreds.\nNvidia is also involved in other areas where AI software can improve healthcare, like medical imaging and scanning, testing and diagnostics, and drug and treatment discovery. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBut back to robotic-assisted surgery. Powered with Nvidia's tech, Intuitive's lead could be maintained as it develops new uses for its existing systems and broadens its offerings into new areas of healthcare. Intuitive has the benefit of already having a huge number of its machines in use. It had 7,135 da Vinci systems installed as of the end of June, plus another 204 Ion systems. These systems are expensive, so an upstart competitor won't be able to easily displace a da Vinci robot. Intuitive's $8.18 billion in cash and short-term investments and no debt also give it a leg up when it comes to funding innovation.\nThe days of Intuitive's rapid growth are likely over, but this is still a steadily expanding business worth staying invested in. At this stage, Nvidia's advance into the medical field should help Intuitive Surgical as much as it does other robotic surgery start-ups, so I don't think Intuitive investors need to worry just yet.\n\n\n\nNicholas Rossolillo and his clients have positions in Intuitive Surgical and Nvidia.

Autodesk Revit for 3D design and 2D annotation of buildings; and Unreal Engine for creating walkthrough simulations and 3D virtual spaces.\nIn addition, he uses software like Blender for visual effects, motion graphics and animation, and PlantFactory for modeling 3D vegetation, which gives his virtual spaces a lively and natural aesthetic.\nInfinite-Compute is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a free, global program that nurtures cutting-edge startups.\nProject Speedups With Omniverse\nWithin just four years, Scott went from handling 50 projects a year to more than 3,500, he said.\nAround 80 of his projects each month include lidar-to-point-cloud work, a complex process that involves transforming spatial data into a collection of coordinates for 3D models for manufacturing and design.\nUsing Omniverse doubles productivity for this demanding workload, he said, as it offers physically accurate photorealism and rendering in real time, as well as live-sync collaboration across users.\n\u201cPreviously, members of our team functioned as individual islands of productivity,\u201d Scott said. \u201cOmniverse gave us the integrated collaboration we desired to enhance our effectiveness and efficiency.\u201d\nAt Omniverse\u2019s core is Universal Scene Description \u2014 an open-source, extensible 3D framework and common language for creating virtual worlds.\n\u201cOmniverse\u2019s USD standard to integrate outputs from multiple software programs allowed our team to collaborate on a source-of-truth project \u2014 letting us work across time zones much faster,\u201d said Scott, who further accelerates his workflow by running it on NVIDIA RTX GPUs, including the RTX A6000 on Infinite-Compute\u2019s on-demand cloud infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIt became clear very soon after appreciating the depth and breadth of Omniverse that investing in this pipeline was not just enabling me to improve current operations,\u201d he added. \u201cIt provides a platform for future growth \u2014 for my team members and my organization as a whole.\u201d\nWhile Scott says his work leans more technical than creative, he sees using Omniverse as a way to bridge these two sides of his brain.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to think that adopting technologies like Omniverse to deliver cutting-edge solutions that have a meaningful and measurable impact on my clients\u2019 businesses is, in its own way, a creative exercise, and perhaps even a work of art,\u201d he said.\nJoin In on the Creation\nCreators and developers across the world can download NVIDIA Omniverse for free, and enterprise teams can use the platform for their 3D projects.\nHear about NVIDIA\u2019s latest AI breakthroughs powering graphics and virtual worlds at GTC, running online Sept. 19-22.

New vehicle deliveries. Fresh organic produce. Each of these modern conveniences is accelerated by fleets of mobile robots.\nNVIDIA today is announcing updates to Nova Orin \u2014 an autonomous mobile robot (AMR) reference platform \u2014 that advance its roadmap. We\u2019re releasing details of three reference platform configurations. Two use a single Jetson AGX Orin \u2014 which runs the NVIDIA Isaac robotics stack and the Robot Operating System (ROS) with the GPU-accelerated framework \u2014 and one relies on two Orin modules.\nThe Nova Orin platform is designed to improve reliability and reduce development costs worldwide for building and deploying AMRs.\nAMRs are like self-driving cars but for unstructured environments. They don\u2019t need fixed, preprogrammed tracks and are capable of avoiding obstacles. This makes them ideal in logistics for moving items in warehouses, distribution centers and factories, or for applications in hospitality, cleaning, roaming security and last-mile delivery.\nFor years, AMR manufacturers have been designing robots by sourcing and integrating compute hardware, software and sensors in house. This time-consuming effort demands years of engineering resources, lengthens go-to-market pipelines and distracts from developing domain-specific applications.\nNova Orin offers a better way forward with tested, industrial-grade configurations of sensors, software and GPU-computing capabilities. Tapping into the NVIDIA AI platform frees developers to focus on building their unique software stack of robot applications.\nMuch is at stake for intralogistics enabled by AMRs across industries, a market expected to increase nearly 6x to $46 billion by 2030, up from $8 billion in 2021, according to estimates from ABI Research.\nDesigning a Highly Capable, Flexible Reference Architecture\u00a0\nThe Nova Orin reference architecture designs are provided for specific use cases. There is one Orin-based design without safety-certified sensors, and one that includes them, along with a safety programmable logic controller. The third architecture has a dual Orin-based design that depends on vision AI for enabling functional safety.\nSensor support is included for stereo cameras, lidars, ultrasonic sensors and inertial measurement units. The chosen sensors have been selected to balance performance, price and reliability for industrial applications. The suite of sensors provides a multimodal diversity of coverage that is required for developing and deploying safe and collaborative AMRs.\nThe stereo cameras and fisheye cameras are custom designed by NVIDIA in coordination with camera partners. All sensors are calibrated and time synchronized, and come with drivers for reliable data capture. These sensors allow AMRs to detect objects and obstacles across a wide range of situations while also enabling simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).\nNVIDIA provides two lidar options, one for applications that don\u2019t need sensors certified for functional safety, and the other for those that do. In addition to these 2D lidars, Nova Orin supports 3D lidar for mapping and ground-truth data collection.\nBuilding a Comprehensive AI Platform for OEMs, ISVs\nNVIDIA is driving the Nova Orin platform forward with extensive software support in addition to the hardware and integration tools.\nThe base OS includes drivers and firmware for all the hardware and adaptation tools, as well as design guides for integrating it with robots. Nova can be integrated easily with a ROS-based robot application.\nThe sensors will have validated models in Isaac Sim for application development and testing without the need for an actual robot.\nThe cloud-native data acquisition tools eliminate the arduous task of setting up data pipelines for the vast amount of sensor data needed for training models, debugging and analytics. State-of-the-art GEMs developed for Nova sensors are GPU accelerated with the Jetson Orin platform, providing key building blocks such as visual SLAM, stereo depth estimation, obstacle detection, 3D reconstruction, semantic segmentation and pose estimation.\nNova Orin also addresses the need to quickly create high-fidelity, city-scale 3D maps for indoor environments in the cloud. These generated maps allow robot navigation, fleet planning and simulation. Plus, the maps can be continuously updated using data from the robots.\nAMRs That Are Ready for Industries\nAs robotics systems evolve, the need for secure deployment and management of the critical AI software on board is paramount for future AMRs.\nNova Orin supports secure over-the-air updates, as well as device management and monitoring, to enable easy deployment and reduce the cost of maintenance. Its open, modular design enables developers to use some or all capabilities of the platform and extend it to quickly develop robotics applications.\nNVIDIA is working closely with regulatory bodies to develop vision-enabled safety technology to further reduce the cost and improve reliability of AMRs. And we\u2019re providing a software development kit for navigation, so developers can quickly develop applications.\nImproving productivity for factories and warehouses will depend on AMRs working safely and efficiently side by side at scale. High levels of autonomy driven by 3D perception from Nova Orin will help drive that revolution.\nLearn more about Nova Orin and sign up to be notified of its availability.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | RoboticsTags: GTC 2022 | Jetson \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

Marjorie Taylor Greene and her husband are frequent stock traders.\nSeveral of the Greenes' stock trades are with companies whose values conflict with those of MTG.\nInsider compiled each of Greene and her family's trades that she has reported since 2021.\n\n\n\nAs members of Congress debate whether they and their spouses should be able to trade stocks, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and her family continue to regularly buy, sell, and hold stock in various companies.\nSome of Greene's investments appear to stand in direct opposition with the Georgia congresswoman's political statements and ideology.\n\n\nNotable examples include Greene and her husband's investments in Visa and Walmart, two companies whose executives have openly supported the Black Lives Matter movement. Despite her investment in the companies, Greene has expressed serious disdain for the movement.\nIn April 2021, Greene called Black Lives Matter the \"strongest terrorist threat\" in the country and introduced legislation to give Congressional Gold Medals to \"the law enforcement officers and those who protected American cities during the Black Lives Matter (BLM) riots.\"\nGreene and her husband, Perry Greene, have also invested significant amounts of money in companies that say they'll pay for their employees to travel out-of-state to obtain abortions. Greene is a staunch opponent of abortion rights.\n\n\nAdditionally, Greene and her husband also continue to hold up to $45,000 in stock in the Walt Disney Company, which the congresswoman accused of being \"pro-child predator\" for opposing Florida's \"Don't Say Gay\" law.\nGreene also recently suggested that the Highland Park shooter could have suffered from psychosis due to smoking marijuana and has voted against several marijuana-related bills while in office. In spite of this, Insider found that she and her husband previously held and sold stock in Medical Marijuana Inc.\nGreene previously told Insider in an email that she does not personally make any of her trades.\n\n\n\"I have an independent investment advisor that has full discretionary authority on my accounts,\" Greene wrote. \"I do not direct any trades.\"\nIn September 2022, Greene and her husband announced they're getting divorced, which for now means an uncertain future for the substantial stock assets they jointly own.\n\nHere are all of the trades reported by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene during 2021 and 2022:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAbbVie Inc.

The negative catalyst from crypto mining and Nvidia's price action is eerily similar to Q4 2018/Q1 2019 \u2014- yet the company is not the same company it was four years ago. This is apparent by Nvidia flexing some major product muscle by timing it's best-ever gaming release and it's best-ever AI chip to hit the market in October.\n\nWe draw important parallels (pun intended) between the last crypto mining selloff and this selloff with key reasons as to why this time the stock's comeback will be quicker.\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang With GeForce RTX 4090NVIDIA\n\nNvidia stock has been in the clutches of a steep drawdown after the company has faced nearly every headwind imaginable: United States-China tensions, supply chain disruptions spanning many components, tough comps on the data center, tough comps on gaming, and a less-than-rosy macro environment.\n\nThe most impactful headwind, however, was Ethereum\u2019s merge to Proof of Stake (PoS), which ultimately lowers demand for gaming GPUs. This contributed to a $2.5 billion cumulative miss in revenue driven by the gaming segment.\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s stock performance in 2018 and 2022 feels eerily similar as the stock sold off 54% in 2018 specifically because of a gaming miss tied to crypto mining. Today, Nvidia is currently 57% YTD.\nIt took eighteen months for Nvidia to recover its all-time high from the Q4 2018 selloff (Sept 2018 through Feb 2020). Despite the uncanny similarity that 2018 and 2022 may have \u2014 Nvidia is actually a much stronger company today than it was four years ago.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nBelow, we discuss a few key reasons Nvidia stock will recover quicker this time around.\nDrilling into Parallels Around the Gaming Miss\n\nDuring the Q3 2018 results released in November 2018, Nvidia gave Q4 2018 revenue guidance of $2.7 billion, below the analysts\u2019 consensus estimate of $3.4 billion. In January 2019, the company again lowered revenue guidance from $2.7 billion to $2.20 billion, which suggests a total revenue miss of $1.2 billion. Gaming revenue in Q3 2018 was $1.76 billion, up 13% YoY and down 2% QoQ. In Q4 2018, gaming revenue was $954 million, down 45% YoY and down 46% QoQ.\n\n\nIn the most recent quarter ending July 2022, the company missed on gaming with revenue of $2.04 billion, which is 33% lower than the year ago quarter and 44% lower sequentially. The company is expecting a further decline in gaming sequentially for Q3. According to one analyst on the call, they are modeling for a further 30% sequential decline in gaming and professional visualization offset by low to mid-single digit growth in data center and automotive. The CFO affirmed this understanding is correct.\nAfter 2018, although it took Nvidia eighteen months to reclaim its all-time highs, in 2020-2021, Nvidia would go on to stage a remarkable turnaround as the stock led tech mega cap stocks in gains. This was not simply because all tech performed well during those years \u2013 if you compare Nvidia to Meta, Amazon and Google, you\u2019ll see something unique occurred with Nvidia that caused the stock to outpace its peers. In all cases except Apple, Nvidia doubled, tripled or quadrupled the performance of other mega cap stocks.Perhaps most impressive, Nvidia is still in the lead over all mega cap stocks despite a 57% drawdown ... [+] this year. It\u2019s the company\u2019s past performance that makes it well worth the time to answer: can Nvidia do it again?YCharts\nPerhaps most impressive, Nvidia is still in the lead over all mega cap stocks despite a 57% drawdown this year. It\u2019s the company\u2019s past performance that makes it well worth the time to answer: can Nvidia do it again?\nNvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 40 Series is Perfectly Timed\nNext quarter, Nvidia was expected to report $6.92 billion and the company guided for $5.9 billion. This is down from $7.10 billion in Q3 of last year. This will be a 17% decline in revenue. Due to this, analysts expect Nvidia to end fiscal year 2023 with 0.8% revenue growth, or $27.13 billion in total revenue.\nIt\u2019s not only the top line valuation that is affected by this cut in guidance but it\u2019s the bottom line, as well. In previous quarters, high average sales prices drove $2 billion to $3 billion in operating profits and net profits, whereas in the most recent quarter, the company is reporting $500 million and $656 million, respectively.\nThe GAAP EPS reported was $0.26 compared to $0.94 in the year ago quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.51 versus $1.04 for the year ago quarter.\nAlthough it\u2019s tempting to redirect the conversation toward higher-growth segments, the $2.5 billion total miss between two quarters came from gaming and it\u2019s prudent for investors to start here (for now) when analyzing the stock for a potential recovery.\nThe company stated the miss was driven by both lower units and lower average sales prices including reduced consumer demand. The company is not commenting on crypto as they state they have no visibility here as to how the GPUs are being used, however, it\u2019s certainly contributing to the bulk of this decline.\nNotably, AMD reported gaming growth of 32% to $1.7 billion which provides a better picture of reduced gaming demand minus crypto. Nvidia believes some of their weakness is also from preparation for a new product generation that will be announced this month.\nPer the earnings call, there are two ways that Nvidia plans to overcome the crypto mining selloff which could produce a faster rebound than 2018.\nFirst, Nvidia is restricting supply on its current gaming model. Per the CFO: \u201cAcross those two quarters, the Q2 of \u201823, the Q3 of \u201823, we have likely undershipped gaming to our end demand significantly.\u201d\nFollowing the call, we estimated for our premium members that the amount undershipped is a minimum of $1 billion. The reason behind this is to help keep prices stable and to increase demand for the RTX 40 Series.\nSecond, Nvidia announced its GeForce RTX 40 Series at the GTC 2022 Conference this week.\nThe new Ada Lovelace architecture which uses 76 billion transistors and a 4nm production process. In the keynote, the CEO stated: \u201cNvidia engineers worked closely with TSMC to create the 4N process optimized for GPUs. This process let us integrate 76 billion transistors and over 18,000 CUDA cores, 70% more than the Ampere generation.\u201d\nThe improvement from 8nm to 4nm means more transistors on the GPU, which results in better performance as the 4nm processes data faster.\nIn the gaming world, this much anticipated release is expected to be 2-4X faster than the RTX 3090 Ti. The flagship AD102 GPU model will have 144 individual streaming multiprocessors (SMs) in one die compared to 84 SMs in the Ampere architecture. As stated, the AD102 will also have a 70% increase in CUDA cores over the RTX 3090 Ti.\nIn addition to this, Nvidia is releasing a new feature called Shader Execution Reordering (SER) which will improve ray-tracing performance by 3X with 25% faster frame rates. Rather than deliver workloads sequentially, the GPUs are able to reorder the workloads to process more workloads at once which results in more power and better performance.\nDeep learning super sampling (DLSS) refers to using AI to predict the next pixel. The new DLSS 3.0 not only predicts pixels but will also use AI to predict frames. This results in \u201cup to four times\u201d better performance over traditional rendering.\nThe first release date for the RTX4090 models is October 12th with a starting price of $1,599. There is a second release date in November for the RTX4080 models with prices of $1,199 and $899. Notably, mid-range RTX 40 series will outperform the previous generation\u2019s high end models. This is due to the Ada Lovelace architecture which offers 1,400 Tensor TFLOPs versus 320 Tensor TFLOPs which means the DLSS is superior and the high-end RTX 30 Series cannot compete with the mid range RTX 40 series.\nThe popularity of this release will help determine if Nvidia can stage a comeback in the gaming segment. Here is what analysts are saying:\n\u201cMorgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said his \"biggest takeaway\" from the keynote at Nvidia's GTC conference were the higher prices of gaming GPUs, which increases his conviction about the pace of gaming revenue recovery next year. Prices that are 28% higher than the baseline price from two years ago for the higher volume 4080 should drive material growth in revenue, said Moore, who sees revenues in the gaming segment rebounding from the current quarter run rate of $5.5B or so to $9.5B next year.\u201d\n\u201cGiven the channel inventory work downs in the July and October quarters, the products should be \"strong demand catalysts\" into 2023, Harlan Sur of Chase tells investors in a research note.\u201d\nNvidia Continues to Build a GPU Moat with H100\nIn 2018, we stated in our free newsletter that Nvidia had built a moat in the GPU-powered data center. This was a bold statement as the company would go on to have negative year-over-year data center revenue in 2019. Yet, fast-forward and it\u2019s quite clear that Nvidia is unshakeable in this segment, which has surpassed gaming as Nvidia\u2019s most valuable segment.\nI\u2019ve written quite a bit about Nvidia, which you can reference here and also here. However, I will keep it simple by saying the A100 GPU is what led the company\u2019s gains since Q2 2020 (detailed here) and the Hopper H100 GPU is what will lead the company\u2019s gains for the next two years.\nIn the most recent quarter, data center revenue of 61% is down from 83% last quarter yet accelerated YoY from 35% growth in the year ago quarter. The earnings call reviewed some of the challenges Nvidia faced in the quarter that led to the 1% sequential growth.\nFirst, Chinese hyperscalers slowed their infrastructure investment this year yet the slowdown is unlikely to last much longer. Due to being a large market for Nvidia, the data center growth was impacted by this. The reason Nvidia was able to meet expectations is because \u201cNorth America doubled year-over-year in revenues.\u201d As of now, supplying the Chinese military is restricted for Nvidia, but this does not include supplying the hyperscalers.\nSecond, demand continues to outstrip supply yet there are many components to Nvidia\u2019s systems and they are experiencing supply chain issues.\n\u201cWe were challenged this quarter with a fair amount of supply chain challenges because as you know, we don\u2019t just sell the GPU chip, but these systems are really complex with a large number of chips in the system components that we offer like HGX [\u2026] all of the components that have to come together for us to be able to deliver the final component.\u201d\nH100 Hopper Coming in October\nOn the earnings call, an analyst asked if the company expects data center growth to re-accelerate when Hopper ships: \u201cDo you think that Hopper, as that comes fully available, it sounds like in fiscal 4Q, that you actually see Data Center growth reaccelerate as that product cycle materializes.\u201d\nThe CFO Kress stated: \u201cOur Data Center yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2. We\u2019ll continue to look at it.\u201d\nI believe this means the data center will accelerate above 61% but not to exceed the 83% from Q1. Ultimately, the CFO may not have full visibility into Hopper sales until the units ship and are tested by customers, who in turn, often buy more if the product exceeds expectations.\nOn that note, the new 4nm chips are bound to impress. The H100 GPUs and the DGX H100 server pods and super pods offer Nvidia the next leg-up as the company has solved an important bandwidth issue.\nHopper tackles some of the bigger issues around previous generations like speeding up algorithms by offering dynamic programming on GPUs to break down problems to simpler subproblems. The new GPUs also boost bandwidth by 3X with SHARP in-networking computing and Infiniband Switches, and the H100 can leverage NVLink to connect eight H100s into one giant GPU for 640 billion transistors, 32 petaflops, 640GB of HBM3, and 24 terabytes per second of memory bandwidth.\nThe H100 has about 50% more memory and interface bandwidth than the A100. That\u2019s 1.5X more bandwidth with the NVLink connection and PCIe 5.0 doubling the bandwidth of PCIe 4.0. The H100 will ship with support for 80GB of HBM3 memory at 3 TB/s speed\nWhere the H100 really stands apart is the leap in performance with about 3X more performance than the A100 and the H100 is up to 6X faster. The A100 lacked support for FP8 compute at default whereas the H100 will leverage a transformer engine to switch between FP8 and FP16, depending on the workload.\nAccording to Nvidia, the H100 delivers 9X more throughput in AI training, and 16X to 30X more inference performance. The company also states in HPC application-specific workloads, the H100 is 7X faster. The goal of the H100 was not only to add more transistors and make the H100 faster, but to also offer function-specific optimizations. This is achieved through the transformer engine.\nLast week, MLPerf published artificial intelligence performance tests. The parent company MLCommons provides the industry standard for benchmarking deep learning, AI training, AI inference and HPC. The H100 Tensor Core GPUs delivered 4.5X more performance than the A100 in offline scenarios and 3.9X more in the server scenario compared to its predecessor the A100.\nThe Hopper H100 GPUs are in full production and availability starts next month and will have over 50 server models by the end of the year and \u201cdozens more in the first half of 2023.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s Automotive Opportunity is Massive\nNvidia\u2019s lead in automotive across dozens of OEMs requires its own analysis, which we will write for our free newsletter subscribers next year. Hyperion 8 is shipping in 2024 and Hyperion 9 will ship in 2026. However, as long-term Nvidia investors, now is a good opportunity to remind my readers of the long-term vision for yet another large and sweeping revenue segment.\nAlthough a small segment today of only $220 million, automotive grew 59% sequentially and 45% year-over-year. The company has a $11 billion automotive design win pipeline.\nAt GTC this week, Nvidia announced a new superchip named \u201cThor\u201d which will deliver 2,000 teraflops of performance, up from 200 teraflops from the current generation \u201cOrin.\u201d The chip has a transformer engine which can process video data as a single perception frame and offers 8-bit floating point (FP8) precision to avoid task loss when converting model data from one platform to another platform.\nMore on the Omniverse\nWe\u2019ve covered the Omniverse platform in the past including an interview with Nvidia\u2019s Richard Kerris you can view here.\nAt GTC this week, Nvidia launched Omniverse Cloud, which is a infrastructure-as-a-service software offering to reduce the complexity around building 3D virtual worlds and assets. This removes the need for local compute power and opens up the ability for more creators to access 3D world creation.\nRegarding the China Restrictions\nThe United States government is restricting sales of high-performance chips to China as Nvidia\u2019s AI chips could be used for military purposes. A spokesperson for Nvidia stated the products where the new licensing requirement applies is the A100, H100 and systems that include DGX.\nThe restrictions apply to Russia yet Nvidia has stated there is no exposure to Russia for their products. In a recent SEC filing, the company stated: The Company\u2019s outlook for its third fiscal quarter provided on August 24, 2022 included approximately $400 million in potential sales to China which may be subject to the new license requirement if customers do not want to purchase the Company\u2019s alternative product offerings or if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers.\nAt this time, Nvidia has applied for an exemption and there has also been a clarification that Nvidia can continue to develop the H100 in China through September 1, 2023 through the company\u2019s Hong Kong facility.\nPer the SEC Filing dated August 31, 2022:\nThe U.S. government has authorized exports, reexports, and in-country transfers needed to continue NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s, or the Company\u2019s, development of H100 integrated circuits after the Company filed its Current Report on Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 31, 2022. The authorization also allows the Company to perform exports needed to provide support for U.S. customers of A100 through March 1, 2023. Additionally, the U.S. government authorized A100 and H100 order fulfillment and logistics through the Company\u2019s Hong Kong facility through September 1, 2023.\nSome analysts have stated that being granted an exemption is \u201cfeasible.\u201d Mark Lipacis of Jefferies is modeling for a $200 million hit to October rather than the $400 million identified risk. Harlan Sur of JP Morgan noted AMD is working on getting export licenses for its customers and helping them transition to products that fall below the performance threshold to help mitigate the downside risk.\nAccording to a new report, Nvidia has asked TSMC to rush high-end GPU orders before the US sanctions begin. The report says that TSMC has a special program to speed delivery of orders at a higher negotiated price and can help to cut the delivery time in half. This could lead to a surprise bump in Q4 revenue for the company.\nConclusion\nNvidia is not the same company that it was four years ago. In 2018, Nvidia was a gaming company with promising AI tailwinds. Today, Nvidia\u2019s AI products serve nearly every enterprise company\u2019s artificial intelligence and machine learning ambitions.\nThe company has an impressive launch schedule starting in October for two flagship products \u2013 the RTX 40 Series and the H100 GPU. The timing of these releases is no coincidence as it\u2019s a rapid two months following the crypto/gaming revenue miss. Suffice to say, Nvidia\u2019s management team is prepared to rumble \u2014- putting its very best release in gaming and its most powerful AI chip to-date up against the crypto mining selloff. If history is any indication, the turnaround will only be a matter of time.\nIf you would like notifications when my new articles are published, please hit the button below to \"Follow\" me. \nYou can also follow me on Twitter, and check out my website or some of my other work here. \nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Please note: The I/O Fund conducts research and draws conclusions for the company\u2019s portfolio.

Autonomous vehicle engineers can generate physically based sensor data and simulate traffic scenarios to test a variety of road and weather conditions for safe self-driving deployment.\nEarly supporters of Omniverse Cloud include RIMAC Group, WPP and Siemens.\n\u201cThe metaverse, the 3D internet, connects virtual 3D worlds described in USD and viewed through a simulation engine,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cWith Omniverse in the cloud, we can connect teams worldwide to design, build, and operate virtual worlds and digital twins.\u201d\nGlobal Leaders Support Omniverse Cloud\r\nWPP, the world\u2019s largest marketing services organization, is the first to launch automotive marketing services on Omniverse Cloud to deliver custom, advanced 3D content and experiences to leading automotive brands.\n\u201cThe industry expectation for what great automotive content looks like, in any channel, has increased dramatically in the past few years,\u201d said Stephan Pretorius, chief technology officer at WPP. \u201cWith Omniverse Cloud, we are changing the way we build, share and consume automotive content \u2013 bringing sustainable, low-emission production to our customers.\u201d\nBuilding on the partnership announced earlier this year, Siemens, a leader in industrial automation hardware and software, is working closely with NVIDIA to leverage Omniverse Cloud and NVIDIA OVX\u2122 infrastructure together to deliver solutions from the Siemens Xcelerator business platform.\n\u201cAn open ecosystem is a central design principle for the Siemens Xcelerator digital business platform,\u201d said Tony Hemmelgarn, president and CEO of Siemens Digital Industries Software. \u201cWe are excited to expand our partnership with NVIDIA, develop integrations between Siemens Xcelerator and Omniverse Cloud, and enable an industrial metaverse where companies can remotely connect their organizations and operate in real time across the complete product and production lifecycle.\u201d\nRIMAC, a pioneer in electric vehicle technologies, is using Omniverse Cloud to provide an end-to-end automotive pipeline \u2014 from design to marketing.\n\u201cElectric motors are efficient and can adjust in an instant. Their flexibility allows engineers to create a car that can handle in a way a combustion engine car never could,\u201d said Mate Rimac, founder and CEO of RIMAC. \u201cOmniverse Cloud will provide similar efficiency and flexibility, enabling our engineering teams to focus on the design of the car model itself, and spend less time on the intricacies of complex 3D design pipelines. And with this 3D car configurator experience, it unlocks endless possibilities for customization without having to manually render each layer, which saves time and money.\u201d\nIn the GTC keynote, Huang showcased an Omniverse Cloud demo featuring an advanced, real-time 3D car configurator of the RIMAC Nevera, the recently launched electric hypercar from BUGATTI RIMAC, part of the RIMAC Group.\nOmniverse Cloud services run on the Omniverse Cloud Computer, a computing system comprised of NVIDIA OVX\u2122 for graphics and physics simulation, NVIDIA HGX\u2122 for advanced AI workloads and the NVIDIA Graphics Delivery Network (GDN), a global-scale distributed data center network for delivering high-performance, low-latency metaverse graphics at the edge.\nOmniverse Cloud services include:\n\nOmniverse Nucleus Cloud \u2014 provides 3D designers and teams the freedom to collaborate and access a shared Universal Scene Description (USD)-based 3D scene and data. Nucleus Cloud enables any designer, creator or developer to save changes, share, make live edits and view changes in a scene from nearly anywhere.\nOmniverse App Streaming \u2014 enables users without NVIDIA RTX\u2122 GPUs to stream Omniverse reference applications like Omniverse Create, an app for designers and creators to build USD-based virtual worlds, Omniverse View, an app for reviews and approvals, and NVIDIA Isaac Sim, for training and testing robots.\nOmniverse Replicator \u2014 enables researchers, developers and enterprises to generate physically accurate 3D synthetic data, and easily build custom synthetic-data generation tools to accelerate the training and accuracy of perception networks and easily integrate with NVIDIA AI cloud services.\nOmniverse Farm \u2014 enables users and enterprises to harness multiple cloud compute instances to scale out Omniverse tasks such as rendering and synthetic data generation.\nNVIDIA Isaac Sim \u2014 a scalable robotics simulation application and synthetic-data generation tool that powers photorealistic, physically accurate virtual environments to develop, test and manage AI-based robots.\nNVIDIA DRIVE Sim\u2122 \u2014 an end-to-end simulation platform to run large-scale, physically accurate multisensor simulations to support autonomous vehicle development and validation from concept to deployment, improving developer productivity and accelerating time to market.\n\nAvailability\r\nOmniverse Farm, Replicator and Isaac Sim containers are available today on NVIDIA NGC\u2122 for self-service deployment on AWS using Amazon EC2 G5 instances featuring NVIDIA A10G Tensor Core GPUs. In addition, Omniverse Cloud will be available as NVIDIA managed services via early access by application.\nTo learn more about NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud, watch Huang\u2019s GTC keynote.

AI is a rapidly evolving industry with plenty of wiggle room for companies to carve out a niche. Experts have suggested that most companies will use AI by 2030, adding over $13 trillion to the world\u2019s economy. The long-term case for investing in AI stocks remains as compelling as ever, especially with the proliferation of tech during the pandemic. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Moreover, with stocks trading at multi-year lows, many of the AI stocks trading at frothy valuations are now up for grabs. Hence, here are seven of the best AI stocks you should invest in at this time.  SPLKSplunk\u00a0$88.15 PATHUiPath\u00a0$13.84 UPSTUpstart\u00a0$26.65 TWLOTwilio$67.90 DUOTDuos Technologies Group$4.27 NVDANvidia\u00a0$137.14\u00a0 IDEXIdeanomics\u00a0$.55  Splunk\u00a0(SPLK)   Splunk (SPLK) logo on the company office in Santana Row.   Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com Splunk\u00a0(NASDAQ:SPLK) is an AI specialist, enabling its clients to make sense of mountains of data. Its Big Data solutions have been a hit with several of the top firms across the globe, which has enabled it to post double-digit growth across its top line over the past several years.  The enterprise is in the midst of a transition toward a recurring cloud-based services model. The transformation will help boost margins significantly in the long run and help Splunk turn a profit soon. Splunk serves 90% of the Fortune 100 companies, while clients spending over $1 million annually hit an all-time high of 723 during the quarter. It represents a massive 24% jump from the prior-year period. Its cloud services continue to drive growth, with an incredible 50% improvement in sales during the second quarter. Hence, the transition is already paying dividends in a big way for the business. UiPath\u00a0(PATH)   The UiPath logo on a smartphone in front of a computer screen.   Source: dennizn/Shutterstock.com UiPath\u00a0(NYSE:PATH) has established itself as a leader in an evolving secular growth sector. The robotic process automation (RPA) provider allows various companies to automate their routine activities through AI effectively. Since listing on the stock exchange in April last year, PATH stock has endured a rough start. The business remains largely in stable condition with its annualized renewal run rate, a metric showing its recurring revenues rose an incredible 50%.  Moreover, its net retention rates have stayed above the 100% threshold. According to Grand View Research, the global RPA industry is set to make a whopping $23.9 billion in total sales by 2030. Attaining just a fraction of that market could have UiPath raking in billions in sales each year, making it one of the best AI stocks out there now.   Story Continues Upstart\u00a0(UPST)  In this photo illustration the Upstart (UPST) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen  Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comUpstart\u00a0(NASDAQ:UPST)\u00a0is an AI-based lending business that gained immense traction last year.Naturally, its business model was a massive hit in 2021, when the economy was flushed with stimulus money. The current situation, though, has changed completely with the rampant increase in interest rates. Lenders and loan buyers taking on greater risk are looking for higher profit margins on their loans.The firm couldn\u2019t find buyers for its loans and was compelled to originate loans at unprofitable prices. Upstart decided to hold portions of these loans instead of selling them at a loss. Hence, the business can hardly rely on buyers in such unprecedented times.Sensing a need for change, management is looking to change its business model and provide consistent funding regardless of the credit market cycles. Combining that with the robustness of its algorithms, UPST could significantly expand its business over the long term.Twilio (TWLO)  Twilio Inc (TWLO) logo displayed on mobile phone hidden in jeans pocket  Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comTwilio\u00a0(NYSE:TWLO) offers services as a cloud-based AI customer engagement solutions provider.Its clients can use its platform to embed various communication features into mobile applications and websites. Additionally, it continues to add to its product offerings, dishing out new products such as Flex, which builds cloud-based centers for firms.The closure of the Flex deal helped Twilio generate an incredible 41% jump in sales during the second quarter. The results came in significantly higher compared to management expectations. What\u2019s heartening is that it was able to pull off such results despite the decelerating economic growth, foreign currency headwinds, and other headwinds.The stellar results are attributable to Twilio\u2019s aggressive merger and acquisitions strategy and the need for customers to update their communication tools for the cloud sector. Moreover, with a massive cash balance of over $4.4 billion, it can continue to expand its business and serve more customers rapidly.Duos Technologies Group (DUOT)  a visual representation of the data underlying an artificial intelligence (AI) powered solution  Source: ShutterstockDuos Technologies Group\u00a0(NASDAQ:DUOT) is a budding AI specialist developing algorithms with utility across multiple industries.Its remarkably accurate algorithms have immense long-term potential in many of the areas highlighted by its management, including railcars, trucks, and aircraft inspection portals, along with 5G Edge data centers.Moreover, the company is undergoing a transformation of sorts under its new CEO, who is focusing on transitioning the business towards a recurring business model.Additionally, the goal is to improve the supply chain, organization, core capabilities and talent. Its massive order backlog is a testament to its long-term potential.Perhaps a near-term catalyst for the firm is its railcars inspection portal that can automatically detect problems to see if there\u2019s anything serious with a railcar at speed. It recently secured a $9 million contract from passenger railroad service Amtrak.Nvidia\u00a0(NVDA)  Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.  Source: ShutterstockWith the proliferation of AI-generated datasets, the need for powerful hardware is imperative. Hence, GPU giants such as Nvidia\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) are excellent long-term AI plays.The expansion in AI has spurred incredible growth in the data center segment, software development kits and other segments. Additionally, the business has been a growth juggernaut over the years, with top-line growth averaging in at around 34.6%.Its key segments have all posted double-digit growth in the past few years and have held up well despite the market headwinds. Also, it was also looking to carve out a niche in the metaverse.It is positioning itself as a top player in the field and is likely to succeed due to its high-end graphics and AI-related expertise. Therefore, NVIDIA is an AI stock that can\u2019t be missed with its fingers in several AI-related verticals.Ideanomics\u00a0(IDEX)  An image of a charging station for an EV on a dark background; EV stock  Source: Marko Aliaksandr / ShutterstockIdeanomics\u00a0(NASDAQ:IDEX) \u00a0operates an electric vehicle (EV) and financial services business.It\u2019s made up of five companies that generate revenues from a fully electric car ecosystem that covers battery sales to financing, leasing, and insurance. In the past few quarters, it has witnessed a healthy uptick in sales, which creates a positive long-term outlook for the business.Last year, it transformed itself through various acquisitions that enabled it to pursue its vision of becoming a fully-integrated provider of commercial electrification solutions. Hence, it has significantly expanded its competencies in the different EV businesses it operates.These business areas all offer an enormous growth runway ahead, with multi-billion dollar addressable markets. In its most recent quarter, the company posted a dumbfounding $114.08 million in sales, representing over 326% growth from the same period last year.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing GuidelinesMore From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes Live The Best $1 Investment You Can Make Today Early Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade \u201cOn Air\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

The NVIDIA BioNeMo Service is a cloud application programming interface (API) that expands LLM use cases beyond language and into scientific applications to accelerate drug discovery for pharma and biotech companies.\n\u201cLarge language models hold the potential to transform every industry,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cThe ability to tune foundation models puts the power of LLMs within reach of millions of developers who can now create language services and power scientific discoveries without needing to build a massive model from scratch.\u201d\nNeMo LLM Service Boosts Accuracy With Prompt Learning, Accelerates Deployments\r\nWith the NeMo LLM Service, developers can use their own training data to customize foundation models ranging from 3 billion parameters up to Megatron 530B, one of the world\u2019s largest LLMs. The process takes just minutes to hours compared with the weeks or months required to train a model from scratch.\nModels are customized with prompt learning, which uses a technique called p-tuning. This allows developers to use just a few hundred examples to rapidly tailor foundation models that were originally trained with billions of data points. The customization process generates task-specific prompt tokens, which are then combined with the foundation models to deliver higher accuracy and more relevant responses for specific use cases.\nDevelopers can customize for multiple use cases using the same model and generate many different prompt tokens. A playground feature provides a no-code option to easily experiment and interact with models, further boosting the effectiveness and accessibility of LLMs for industry-specific use cases.\nOnce ready to deploy, the tuned models can run on cloud instances, on-premises systems or through an API.\nBioNeMo LLM Service Enables Researchers to Tap Power of Massive Models\r\nThe BioNeMo LLM Service includes two new BioNeMo language models for chemistry and biology applications. It provides support for protein, DNA and biochemical data to help researchers discover patterns and insights in biological sequences.\nBioNeMo enables researchers to expand the scope of their work by leveraging models that contain billions of parameters. These larger models can store more information about the structure of proteins, evolutionary relationships between genes, and even generate novel biomolecules for therapeutic applications.\nCloud API Provides Access to Megatron 530B, Other Ready-Made Models\r\nIn addition to tuning foundation models, the LLM services include the option to use ready-made and custom models through a cloud API.\nThis gives developers access to a broad range of pretrained LLMs, including Megatron 530B. It also provides access to T5 and GPT-3 models created with the NVIDIA NeMo Megatron framework \u2014 now available in open beta \u2014 to support a broad range of applications and multilingual service requirements.\nLeaders in automotive, computing, education, healthcare, telecommunications and other industries are using NeMo Megatron to pioneer services for customers in Chinese, English, Korean, Swedish and other languages.\nAvailability\r\nThe NeMo LLM and BioNeMo services and cloud APIs are expected to be available in early access starting next month. Developers can apply now for more details.\nThe beta release of the NeMo Megatron framework is available from NVIDIA NGC\u2122 and is optimized to run on NVIDIA DGX\u2122 Foundry and NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD\u2122, as well as accelerated cloud instances from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\nTo experience the NeMo Megatron framework, developers can try NVIDIA LaunchPad labs at no charge.\nTune in to Huang\u2019s GTC keynote to learn more about large language models powered by NVIDIA AI.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

NVIDIA stock forecast: Can the stock come out of the slump?    \n By\n Fitri Wulandari \n  Edited by  Jekaterina Drozdovica   15:03, 2 September 2022 Updated              NVIDIA stock forecast: Is the price set for recovery? \u2013 Photo: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com \nUS chipmaker NVIDIA (NVDA) stock price has not yet come out of its\u00a0slump. A slew of headwinds from rising inflation, soaring rates and slowing demand continued to put a lid on the price recovery.After reporting disappointing second quarter earnings result that missed analysts expectations in August, Nvidia was hit by a new export licence requirement for future shipping of its chips to China.The stock plunged to a\u00a0fresh 52-week low of $132.7 on 1 September after the company announced the new export license in a filing on 31 August.   1m 5m 15m 30m 1h 4h 1d 1w   \nNVDA stock price has been in the dumps in 2022, falling 53.26% year-to-date, as of 2 September, dragging down its market to $347.31bn, according to Companiesmarketcap. But what does the recent fall to a new low mean for the NVIDIA stock predictions?NVIDIA stock analysis: Technical viewNVIDIA (NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units that improve the computing experience. Its products are used in a wide variety of application markets, such as gaming, automotive infotainment systems and cryptocurrency mining.When NVIDIA\u2019s\u00a0founders \u2013\u00a0Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem \u2013\u00a0started the company in 1993,\u00a0there were more than\u00a0two dozen graphics chips companies. Three years later, the number of graphic chips companies soared to 70.\u00a0In the past two years, NVIDIA\u2019s stock growth had been stellar, gaining 121.91% and 129.29% in 2020 and 2021, respectively. The global chip manufacturing industry saw rising demand from new technology trends, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI).The rapid growth of advanced gaming services, IoT and AI has raised demand for data centre capacity to handle internet traffic that needs to be powered by advanced semiconductor chips. New vehicle technology, such as autonomous driving, also requires cutting-edge chips.The rising popularity of cryptocurrencies also drove NVIDIA\u2019s stock growth as the company\u2019s graphics processing chips have been used for crypto mining. Global chip shortages induced by the Covid-19 pandemic had also been bullish for the NVDA stock price.\u00a0But the tech stock started to give up its gains entering 2022. At the time of writing on 2 September, NVDA stock price has fallen 59.7% \u00a0from the all-time high of $346.47 achieved intraday in November 2021. NVIDIA stock has disappointed shareholders with a 38.11% loss in one year. \u00a0Although Nvidia\u2019s recent drop is in line with the wider market, the chipmaker is underperforming the tech-savvy Nasdaq Composite Index (US100), which has lost 25.09% year-to-date, according to TradingView.Risk assets came under pressure amid geopolitical uncertainty following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and monetary policy tightening by the Fed in an attempt to tame decades-high inflation.\u00a0\u00a0The intensifying sell-off in cryptocurrencies, which saw the price of bitcoin (BTC) plummeting to below $26,000 for the first time in 16 months, may have a further negative effect on the Nvidia stock price due to its exposure to cryptocurrency mining.\u00a0In other news, the U.S. government informed Nvidia on 26 August about a new license requirement for upcoming exports to China, including Hong Kong\u00a0and Russia, in order to minimise the possibility that the company\u2019s chips A100 and H100 might be used in or diverted to \u201cmilitary end use\u201d or \u201cmilitary end user\u201d in China and Russia, Nvidia said in a filing on 31 August.The company does not export to Russia. However, it highlighted $400m in potential sales to China in the third quarter, which could be affected by the new licence requirement if customers choose not to buy its alternative product offerings, the US government didn\u2019t grant licenses in a timely fashion, or important clients are refused licenses, Nvidia said in the filing.The US Government granted the permit for export and reexport for the company\u2019s development of H100 integrated circuit on 1 September, but the news did little to lift the stock up. NVDA stock price closed 7.67% lower at $139.37 on 1 September following the announcement.As of 2 September, the stock was quoted at $137.11, dropping 1.6%, TradingView\u00a0data show.\u201cThis could hardly come at a worse time for Nvidia given that the last quarter was already highly challenging due to supply chain snarl ups and slowing demand for gaming consoles. Its artificial intelligence prowess is considered to be the engine for future growth at the company, which is why these strict new rules come as a severe blow.\u00a0 Being at the cutting edge of pioneering industries can be a huge advantage but, as this development shows, it also presents significant risks,\u201d wrote Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown on 1 September.Slowing demand for semiconductorsThe Russia-Ukraine war and new Covid-19 lockdowns in China have severely harmed demand for consumer electronics and home appliances, according to Zhao Haijun, CEO of Chinese Semiconductor Manufacturing International, quoted by Nikkei Asia on 13 May.\u00a0       COIN   182.28 Price   -3.210% 1D Chg, %    Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n                   Swap short:    Swap long:       Long position overnight fee -0.0234%   Short position overnight fee 0.0012%   Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC)   Spread 0.27     Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n           TSLA   225.89 Price   -4.500% 1D Chg, %    Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n                   Swap short:    Swap long:       Long position overnight fee -0.0234%   Short position overnight fee 0.0012%   Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC)   Spread 0.17     Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n           PLTR   84.05 Price   -3.400% 1D Chg, %    Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n                   Swap short:    Swap long:       Long position overnight fee -0.0234%   Short position overnight fee 0.0012%   Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC)   Spread 0.13     Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n           NVDA   116.12 Price   -2.630% 1D Chg, %    Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n                   Swap short:    Swap long:       Long position overnight fee -0.0234%   Short position overnight fee 0.0012%   Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC)   Spread 0.12     Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n   Trade Now\n       As a result, there has been a \u201csignificant adjustment\u201d\u00a0in chip orders for those sectors.Zhao estimated that at least 200 million\u00a0units of smartphones could disappear this year as companies with exposure in Russia and Ukraine saw their revenue gone. In addition, sales in China have also dropped due to the new Covid-19 lockdowns.Disappointing Q1 results, Weak outlookNVIDIA posted a revenue of $6.790bn in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 ending 31 July, a 3% increase from a year ago and 19% decrease from the previous quarter, the company announced on 24 August. It was also lower than its revenue guidance of $8.10bn for the quarter.It reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.51, \u201cdown 51% from a year ago and down 63% from the previous quarter\u201d.NVIDIA also decided to pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per share on 29 September 2022.The company gave a weaker outlook for the third quarter with revenue expected to be $5.9bn, plus or minus 2%. It expected revenue from gaming and \u2018Professional Visualization\u2019 to decline sequentially, as OEMs (original equipment manufacturer) and channel partners reduce inventory to match current levels of demand and get ready for NVIDIA\u2019s new product generation. However, Nvidia said the decline is expected to be partially offset by sequential growth in Data Center and Automotive.\u201cGoing forward, we expect the data center segment to drive most of the firm\u2019s growth, led by the explosive artificial intelligence phenomenon. This involves collecting large swaths of data followed by techniques that develop algorithms to produce conclusions in the same way as humans,\u201d said Abhinav Davuluri, analyst at Morningstar on 1 September.Zacks\u2019 analysts expected NVIDIA to spotlight strong growth in its flagship graphic cards for gaming, GeForce desktop and notebook GPU, as well as surging demand for its hyperscale accelerators for AI computing.\u00a0\u201cAdditionally, collaboration with Mercedes-Benz is expected to further strengthen NVIDIA\u2019s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, management expects COVID-19 pandemic to negatively impact near-term revenues. Moreover, the U.S.\u2013China trade war remains a key concern,\u201d Zacks analysts said.NVIDIA stock forecast 2022-2025, 2030What is the analyst outlook on NVIDIA future stock price for 2022 and beyond? The current downtrend did not seem to dampen analyst optimism.At the time of writing (2 September) the consensus of 34 analyst views compiled by MarketBeat set NVIDIA stock price target at an average of $218.85 for the next twelve months, expecting the price to rise by 58.54% from the share price at the time of writing (2 September). The price targets ranged from a high of $320 to the low of $133. The consensus sentiment on the stock was a \u2018moderate buy\u2019, with 24 out of 34 analysts giving it a \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation, nine a \u2018hold\u2019 and one a \u2018strong buy\u2019.Meanwhile, in its NVIDIA share price forecast, economic data provider Trading Economics \u00a0projected that the stock could trade at $157.95 a share by the end of this quarter and at $144.78 in one year.Although analysts don\u2019t typically provide long-term forecasts beyond 2023, algorithm-based forecasting sites do. Wallet Investor, for example, in its Nvidia stock forecast gave a bullish outlook for NVIDIA\u2019s share price, suggesting the stock is an \u201cawsome long-term\u201d investment.The site in its NVIDIA stock forecast for 2022 projected that the stock could trade at $191.521 per share by December. According to its NVIDIA stock forecast for 2025, the share could rise to $387.282 in December 2025. Its 5 year forecast saw the share price trade at $483.113 by August 2027. As of 2 September, Gov Capital\u2019s algorithm-based NVDA stock forecast estimated that the stock could rise to $185.570 by end of December 2022 and $1,004.329 by end of December 2025. The company expected the NVIDIA stock to increase to $1,617.588 by 5 September 2027. Algorithm-based forecasting sites did not yet provide NVIDIA stock forecast for 2030.When looking for NVIDIA stock price predictions, always\u00a0remember that analyst and algorithm-based projections can be wrong. Forecasts and analysts\u2019 expectations shouldn\u2019t be used as a substitute for your own research.\u00a0Always conduct your own due diligence and remember that your decision to trade should depend on your risk tolerance, portfolio size and goals, and experience in the market. Keep in mind that past performance does not guarantee future returns. And never invest or trade money you cannot afford to lose.\u00a0FAQs Is NVIDIA a good stock to buy?Wall Street analysts maintained a \u2018buy\u2019\u00a0rating for NVIDIA\u2019s stock.\u00a0However, whether NVIDIA stock is a good stock for you to buy should depend on your own research. It\u2019s worth remembering that analysts\u2019 predictions can be wrong. How high can NVIDIA stock go?Wall Street analysts gave varying price targets for the next twelve months, ranging from the high of $320\u00a0and the low of $133, and averaging $218.85\u00a0at the time of writing (2 September). In terms of long-term forecasts, Gov Capital suggested that NVIDIA\u2019s share price could rise to $1,617.588 by 5 September 2027. Wallet Investor projected it to hit $483.113 by August 2027. However, it is critical to conduct your own research before any investing or trading decision, as predictions may be inaccurate.

However, with traditional trading you enter a contract to exchange the legal ownership of the individual shares or the commodities for money, and you own this until you sell it again.CFDs are leveraged products, which means that you only need to deposit a percentage of the full value of the CFD trade in order to open a position. But with traditional trading, you buy the assets for the full amount. In the UK, there is no stamp duty on CFD trading, but there is when you buy stocks, for example.CFDs attract overnight costs to hold the trades (unless you use 1-1 leverage), which makes them more suited to short-term trading opportunities. Stocks and commodities are more normally bought and held for longer. You might also pay a broker commission or fees when buying and selling assets direct and you\u2019d need somewhere to store them safely.\r\n \n Capital Com is an execution-only service provider.

TSMC 4nm. What's not to like.\n\n\nBy Tarinder Sandhu\nSep 20, 2022, 16:36 BST \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\nTwitterFacebookReddItWhatsAppEmail\n\n\n\n\nNvidia boss Jensen Huang spilled the GeForce details you have all been waiting for. Nvidia\u2019s next-generation RTX 40 Series is headlined by GeForce RTX 4090 and it\u2019s launching as soon as October 12.\nPriced at $1,599 excluding taxes, and \u00a31,679 here in the UK, this is a proper monster of a GPU. There are 76 billion transistors fabricated on TSMC\u2019s leading-edge 4nm process, leading to, the boss says, up to 2x the rasterisation and 4x the ray tracing performance of present champ, RTX 3090 Ti. That\u2019s what 90TFLOPS of compute power will give you.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 4080, meanwhile, will be available at an undisclosed date. There are two varieties, a 16GB model priced at \u00a31,269 and a 12GB edition at \u00a3949. The top-line design is also 2-4x faster than RTX 3080 Ti. Quite some feat.\nNew technology includes third-generation RTX touting DLSS 3, so expect improved performance. Shader Execution Reordering (SER) is a brand-new feature which Nvidia reckons is as important as out-of-order execution for CPUs.\n\nA demo of Cyberpunk 2077 was shown to illustrate RTX 40 Series power. With DLSS off and RT on, an unnamed card returned a scant 24FPS. With DLSS 3 on and RT On, however, that framerate jumps to an incredible 100FPS.\nOn Flight Simulator, meanwhile, Nvidia showed performance at 54FPS with DLSS off. With it on, framerate jumped to 114FPS. It would be good to have a 30 Series comparison, but none was shown. \nNvidia loves a graph to illustrate performance improvements over generations. Right on cue, the Ada architecture smashes previous-generation Ampere and Turing in total throughput known as TOPs.\n\n\nLet\u2019s see. That\u2019s 4.3x the Tensor operations, 2.6x RT performance and 2.25x shader improvements over last-generation Ampere.\nAny punters looking for mid-range RTX 40 Series cards are out of luck; Nvidia has said Ada is being reserved for high-end GPUs, with existing RTX 30 Series parts completing the product stack.\n \n\nGeForce RTX 4090GeForce RTX 4080 (16GB)GeForce RTX 4080 (12GB)Cores16,3849,7287,680Boost Clock (GHz)2.522.512.61Base Clock (GHz)2.232.212.31Memory Config24GB GDDR6X16GB GDDR6X12GB GDDR6XMemory Interface384-bit256-bit192-bitGraphics Power450W320W285WRequired System power850W750W700W\n\n\nTarinder SandhuFounder and publisher at Club386, nobody has more experience ripping the guts out of PCs.

What\u2019s more, according an interview with Gamers Nexus, their reasoning is a lack of \u201crespect\u201d shown to them by Nvidia themselves. Suffice to say, there won\u2019t be an EVGA version of the RTX 4090 or any RTX 40 series GPU that might be announced during Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Beyond event later today.\r\n\n\n\r\nEVGA apparently informed Nvidia of their exit strategy back in April 2022, though have only gone public with the news on the eve of the next GeForce generation. They\u2019ll continue selling their existing stock of RTX 30 series models, and will keep parts on hand for replacements and warranty fulfilment, but once they\u2019re gone, that\u2019s it \u2013 no more EVGA graphics cards, thus ending a GPU partnership that began over 20 years ago.\r\n\n\n\n\nEVGA Terminates NVIDIA Partnership, Cites Disrespectful Treatment\n\n\n\nYou can watch the full Gamers Nexus report here.Watch on YouTube\n\r\nEVGA\u2019s statements to Gamers Nexus \u2013 attributed to senior staff like CEO Andrew Han and chief branding officer Joe Darwin \u2013 consistently emphasise that this wasn\u2019t a monetary decision, partly because while graphics cards make up the bulk of EVGA\u2019s revenue, tiny margins supposedly mean they account for only a small portion of profits. Instead, EVGA cite long-standing frustrations with how Nvidia allegedly treat their board partners.\r\n\n\r\nOr, as Han put it, \u201cThis? This is easy. Working with Nvidia was hard.\u201d \r\n\n\r\nNvidia\u2019s secrecy about upcoming GPUs was given as a major factor. For instance, EVGA claim they and other partners aren\u2019t made aware of Nvidia GPU prices until they\u2019re revealed publicly. And not just the RRP/MSRP that consumers pay, but also the finalised chip cost that EVGA would have to pay Nvidia to produce their graphics cards in the first place. \r\n\n\r\nBoard partners are also allegedly prevented from selling flagship models (like the RTX 3080 Ti) above a certain price, limiting the potential for very high-end designs. And trying to set lower prices can be an issue too: EVGA complained to Gamers Nexus that Nvidia would knowingly undercut partner cards by selling their Founders Edition models at prices that partners couldn\u2019t feasibly match. Darwin said the company attempted discuss these price control issues with Nvidia, but were unsuccessful.\r\n\n\r\nNvidia have downplayed any strife between the two companies, releasing a statement to PC Gamer that says \"We've had a great partnership with EVGA over the years and will continue to support them on our current generation of products. We wish Andrew [Han] and our friends at EVGA all the best.\"\r\n\n\r\nThere\u2019s no intimation that EVGA were subjected to any worse treatment than Nvidia\u2019s other GPU partners, which include Asus, PNY, MSI, and many more, though they\u2019re very much the first to openly express discontent. They also confirmed that they\u2019re not even interested in a similar partnership with AMD or Intel, to work on their respective Radeon and Arc GPU lines: they\u2019re out of graphics cards for good. Finished. Donezo.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nInstead, EVGA intend to refocus on their other, if lesser-known, hardware pursuits. Their PSU business reportedly produces much higher profit margins than their graphics cards, even with a much smaller slice of revenue, and they produce motherboards, peripherals and CPU coolers as well. Darwin suggested EVGA weren\u2019t planning staff layoffs as a direct result of shuttering the GPU side of the company, though it\u2019s hard to see how everyone involved in such a large operation would be able to integrate into the much smaller component and peripheral divisions. At the very least, EVGA expect some \u201cattrition\u201d in staff numbers, whereby previously GPU-focused employees leave voluntarily rather than transfer internally.\r\n\n\r\nI do think this is all a bit of a shame. If you ever had the luxury of choosing which partner model of a GPU to pick, you could rarely go wrong with an EVGA version, and their customer service arm has a legendary reputation for helpfulness. With the absolute best of intentions, I also can\u2019t see how EVGA can support the same staff numbers after lopping off such a huge part of itself. \r\n\n\r\nThat said, there\u2019s a sense that the graphics cards industry will just keep on ticking. No other Nvidia board partners are rebelling against the green giant\u2019s policies, even if there\u2019s some off-the-record grumbling in the background, and of course we are only hours away from a major RTX 40 series reveal. Only this time, there\u2019ll be one fewer name among the supporting cast.  \r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor.

Again though, wait for independent benchmarks to be sure of this claim.\n\n\n\nCard\nProcess\nVRAM\nTFLOPS\nLaunch MSRP\n\n\nRTX 3090 Ti\n8nm\n24GB\n40\n$1999\n\n\nRTX 4090\n4nm\n24GB\n83\n$1599\n\n\n\nRTX 4090 will be available on October 12.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Ada Lovelace\u2019 Architecture\nThe RTX 40 series is powered by NVIDIA\u2019s new \u2018Ada Lovelace\u2019 architecture, which introduces a number of improvements.\nIt\u2019s built on TSMC\u2019s 4nm process node \u2013 the previous \u2018Ampere\u2019 architecture used Samsung\u2019s 8nm process node.\nThird Generation Ray Tracing Cores enable more than 2x the ray tracing performance over Ampere\u2019s. These new cores also introduce \u2018Opacity Micro-Map Engines\u2019 and \u2018Micro-Mesh Engines\u2019, two new hardware features to accelerate certain ray tracing workloads. Shader Execution Reordering\u00a0improves shader performance by up to 2x when using ray tracing, which NVIDIA says improves framerate by 25%.\nFourth Generation Tensor Cores offer up to 5x the FP8 performance of Ampere\u2019s. Combined with the new Optical Flow Accelerator this enables Deep Learning SuperSampling (DLSS) 3.0. Similar to the SpaceWarp and Motion Smoothing reprojection techniques used in VR for years now, DLSS 3.0 can generate synthetic frames to double the output framerate.\n\nFinally the Eighth Generation NVIDIA Encoder introduces support for the AV1 video codec, which has 40% improved quality at the same bitrate and supports HDR (high dynamic range).\nWill you be buying an RTX 4080 or 4090 for VR, or are you waiting for AMD\u2019s response?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPC Hardware\n\nAMD's RX 9070 & 9070 XT Graphics Cards Ship Next Week For $550 & $600\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nDavid Heaney\n\n\n        28 February\n \n\n\n\nWeekly Newsletter\nGet a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news.\n\n\nCheck your inbox to confirm!(it might also be in your spam folder)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPC Hardware\n\nHere's What An RTX 5090 Does For Fallout & Flight Simulator In VR\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nJames Galizio\n\n\n        17 February\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPC Hardware\n\nNvidia & AMD's New Graphics Cards Are Set To Push PC VR Forward Again\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nDavid Heaney\n\n\n        7 January\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUnlock the full potential of UploadVR and support our independent journalism with an ad-free experience by becoming a Member.\n\nBecome a Member\nNot Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly Newsletter\n\n\nSign up to get a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news, straight to your inbox.\n\n\nCheck your inbox to confirm!(it might also be in your spam folder)\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMore PC Hardware\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        28 February\n\n\nAMD's RX 9070 & 9070 XT Graphics Cards Ship Next Week For $550 & $600\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n        17 February\n\n\nHere's What An RTX 5090 Does For Fallout & Flight Simulator In VR\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n        7 January\n\n\nNvidia & AMD's New Graphics Cards Are Set To Push PC VR Forward Again\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n        21 August 2024\n\n\nSteam Decktop: Steam Deck & Meta Quest HDMI Link Make A Modular Gaming PC\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLatest Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVR Experiences\n\nVR Exploration Experience Brink Traveler Adds Lake Tahoe\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nSarah Thwaites\n\n\n    Today\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nFitness\n\nMeta CTO Explains The Reason For Killing Move, Quest's Fitness Tracking Feature\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nDavid Heaney\n\n\n    Today\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nHeadsets & Tech\n\nVarjo XR-4 To Require $2500/Year Subscription For Advanced Mixed Reality Features\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nDavid Heaney\n\n\n    Today\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nVR Gaming\n\nRaise A Dragon In Pet Sim Eggy, Launching Next Month On Quest\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nJames Tocchio\n\n\n        17 March\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nApp Development\n\nQuest SDK v74 Brings Thumb Microgestures & Improved Audio To Expression\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nDavid Heaney\n\n\n        17 March\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nGlasses & AR Tech\n\nSnap Spectacles See Peridots Play Together & Now Use GPS\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nIan Hamilton\n\n\n        17 March\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nDeals & Discounts\n\nQuest's Spring Savings & Steam's Spring Sale Offer Discounts On Blockbuster VR Games\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nDavid Heaney\n\n\n        16 March\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSocial VR\n\nThis Working TARDIS From Doctor Who Travels Through Resonite\n\n\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0&\u00a0\nK.

These RTX 40-series graphics cards are launching just as the GPU dought has ended. In fact, many retailers are now offloading RTX 3080 and 3090 GPUs at prices I wouldn\u2019t have imagined a year ago given the above-MSRP gouging in 2021 and early 2022.RTX 4090 in October, 4080 in NovemberNvidia announced the new cards at its GeForce Beyond event where it confirmed pricing and availability for the RTX 4090, its flagship card, starting at $1,599 and launching on October 12. The card features a massive 16,384 CUDA cores and 24GB of GDDR6X graphics memory.Good news, I\u2019ve heard from board partners that they\u2019ll have the RTX 4080 cards ready in the first half of November.\u00a0The more high-end consumer card, the RTX 4080, didn\u2019t get an exact release date, but Nvidia\u2019s website says it's \u201cComing November.\u201d Good news, I\u2019ve heard from board partners that they\u2019ll have the RTX 4080 cards ready in the first half of November, so that\u2019s telling.The Shortcut is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.SubscribeNvidia RTX 40-series GPU specsThe RTX 4080 will come in two configurations, one with 12GB of GDDR6X memory for $899 and one with 16GB of VRAM for $1,199. It may be worth thinking of that 16GB model as an entirely different card, though, as it also features a substantial increase in CUDA cores, jumping from the 7680 CUDA cores in the 12GB model to 9728 CUDA cores, albeit running at lower clock speeds.Nvidia lists the exact dimensions of the 16GB RTX 4080 model, suggesting it will come in as Founders Edition. Meanwhile, the 12GB model only says \u201cvaries by manufacturer,\u201d so odds are against a Founders Edition of that one.\u00a0Gamers who\u2019ve followed the rumors surrounding the RTX 40-series may be able to breathe a sigh of relief, though, as the cards don\u2019t appear to be the power-hungry monsters previous rumors purported. While the RTX 4090 certainly needs heaps of power, calling for 450 watts, the RTX 4080 call for 320 watts (16GB) and 285 watts (12GB).Anyone hoping to pick up a budget RTX 40-series card\u2026 get ready for some confusion. Nvidia didn\u2019t mention anything below the RTX 4080 in the product stack, but did list a bunch of RTX 30-series cards on a slide titled \u201cThe NewGeForce RTX family,\u201d even listing the RTX 3060 starting at $329 (a price it started at in February of 2021). Nvidia will most likely have some RTX 4070, 4060, and lower cards coming eventually, but it could be months before we see them.\u00a0Beyond the basic performance upgrades one should expect from a generational leap, NVIDIA touted its DLSS 3 Frame Generation technology as a way to get 2-4x more performance in games. Earlier versions of DLSS took lower resolution gameplay and used AI models to increase the resolution. But DLSS 3\u2019s Frame Generation will analyze everything going on in a single game frame on a per-pixel basis and try to create extra frames. When the first DLSS was announced, it was something you had to see to believe, and that feels like it\u2019s the case with this new Frame Generation technology.Subscribe3Share this postThe ShortcutNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 and two RTX 4080 modelsCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShareDiscussion about this postCommentsRestacksTopLatestDiscussionsNo postsReady for more?Subscribe\u00a9 2025 Matt SwiderPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice Start WritingGet the appSubstack is the home for great cultureShareCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        This site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

It was originally published in November 2021.\nYou don\u2019t need a private plane to be at the forefront of personal travel.\nElectric automaker XPENG launched the G9 SUV this week during NVIDIA GTC. The intelligent, software-defined vehicle is built on the high-performance compute of NVIDIA DRIVE Orin and delivers AI capabilities that are continuously upgraded with each over-the-air update.\nThe new flagship SUV debuts XPENG\u2019s centralized electronic and electrical architecture and XNGP, its latest advanced driver assistance system for a seamless driving experience. The G9 is also compatible with the next-generation superchargers for charging up to 124 miles in 5 minutes.\nThe XPENG G9 and its fellow EVs are elevating the driving experience with intelligent features that are always at the cutting edge.\nIntelligence at the Edge\nThe G9 is intelligently designed from the inside out.\nThe SUV is the first to be equipped with XNGP, an AI-assisted driving system that includes XPENG\u2019s City Navigation Guided Pilot, Highway Navigation Guided Pilot and Valet Parking Assist smart memory parking capabilities.\nThe XPENG G9 interior.\nIt is built on two NVIDIA DRIVE Orin systems-on-a-chip (SoC), achieving 508 trillion operations per second (TOPS). The G9 uses 31 sensors and a front-view camera for advanced object detection \u2014 its front-mounting dual-lidar sensors cover 180 degrees, reducing the size of blind spots.\nXNGP is capable of tackling multiple driving scenarios \u2014 regardless of map coverage \u2014 by 2023 when it is available in most cities in China.\nThis technology is incorporated into a centralized compute architecture for a streamlined design, powerful performance and seamless upgrades.\nCharging Ahead\nThe G9 is designed for the international market, bringing software-defined innovation to roads around the world.\nIt incorporates new signature details, such as daytime running lights designed to make a sharp-eyed impression. Four daytime running lights at the top and bottom of the headlights form the XPENG logo. These headlights also include discrete lidar sensors, merging cutting-edge technology with an elegant exterior.\nIn addition to fast charging, the electric SUV was designed to meet global sustainability requirements as well as C-NCAP and E-NCAP five-star safety standards. Launched on September 21 in China, the G9 is expected to be delivered to customers in October 2022.\nThe intelligent EV joined a growing lineup of software-defined vehicles powered by NVIDIA DRIVE that are transforming the way the world moves.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

Both GPUs are based on Nvidia\u2019s new Ada Lovelace architecture, and will launch this year: the RTX 4090 on October 12th, and the RTX 4080 sometime in November. \r\n\n\r\nKey features of Ada Lovelace, and thus these new cards, include 3rd Gen RT cores, 4th Gen Tensor cores, and a new streaming multiprocessor. These supposedly add up to twice the performance of Ampere (that\u2019s the RTX 30 series architecture currently dominating our best graphics card guide) in standard rasterised games, and up to four times the performance in ray traced games. And since Nvidia were clearly in a ray-tracey mood, they also took the opportunity to reveal Portal RTX: a semi-official mod for the original Portal that upgrades it with RT lighting and reflection effects. Corrrr.\r\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 4090 | Beyond Fast\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\r\nFirst, though, those GPUs. The RTX 4090 packs 24GB of GDDR6X RAM and will cost \u00a31679 / $1599; in the UK that makes it even more expensive than the RTX 3090 Ti, though Nvidia say it outperforms the top-tier Ampere GPU by up to four times. There will be two versions of the RTX 4080, meanwhile: a 12GB GDDR6X model starting at \u00a3949 / $899, and a 16GB model starting at \u00a31269 / $1199. These are both considerably pricier than the RTX 3080, which launched at $699, though at least the 16GB model is meant to be up to four times quicker than the RTX 3080 Ti. \r\n\n\r\nIf they can reach the hallowed grounds of a 4x performance boost, it will likely be with ray tracing and, especially, DLSS. Ada Lovelace\u2019s \u201cShader Execution Reordering\u201d feature reschedules RT workloads on the fly, so the GPU can process ray traced frames more effectively (and, therefore, faster). RTX 40 series GPUs will also be the first to support DLSS 3, a new version of Nvidia\u2019s Deep Learning Super-Sampling upscaler. This uses the architecture\u2019s hardware and enhanced AI smarts to generate entire new frames in the upscaling process, not simply regenerating the frames that have already been rendered, leading to a massive boost in FPS. \r\n\n\r\nHow massive? Results will vary depending on the game, and even the Cyberpunk 2077 and Microsoft Flight Simulator demos that Nvidia showed during the livestream weren\u2019t terribly helpful due to a lack of specific settings being given. But with maxed-out graphics and ray tracing, these did show Cyberpunk 2077 jumping from about 20-25fps without DLSS to over 60fps with DLSS 3, so it\u2019s clearly got some chops. Nearly 40 games are confirmed to be getting DLSS 3 support, already far more than AMD\u2019s latest FSR 2.1 upscaler, and these include the likes of Cyberpunk 2077, Flight Sim, Hitman 3, Atomic Heart, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nAnother DLSS 3 'game' will be Portal RTX, which is coming to Steam later this year as a free download for Portal owners. I\u2019ll leave opinions about how ray tracing affects Portal\u2019s aesthetic between you and your eyeballs, but it does look swish from a purely technical standpoint. And, in what could be an even more exciting release, the tool used to make it \u2013 Nvidia Remix \u2013 will launch for free as well. Remix aims to help modders easily create ray tracing mods, including DLSS 3 and Nvidia Reflex support, by letting them import a game into the tool and simply add these features with a few clicks. It even uses AI to create brand new models and assets that replace the original, lower-fidelity ones in the game.\r\n\n\r\nIt sounds mad, but apparently is that straightforward \u2013 the games seemingly just need to be based on DX8 or DX9 and use a \u201cfixed function graphics pipeline\u201d, which I\u2019ll admit is getting into techy territory I don\u2019t understand. But Nvidia did show how well it can work with a Remix-ified look at The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, which looks like a fully fledged remake. Not that I\u2019m advocating AI ever take the place of actual artistry, but I\u2019ll definitely be looking forward to see what folk can do with this.\r\n\n\r\nI\u2019ll also be aiming to get the RTX 4090 and at least one of the RTX 4080 variants into my mitts asap. Unlike with the RTX 30 series, Nvidia has elected to bump the prices up this time \u2013 let\u2019s see if they\u2019re really worth it.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            Portal with RTX has popped onto Steam, but good luck running it\n          \n\n\n\n            Portal with RTX is launching December 8th, and there\u2019s a shiny new trailer\n          \n\n\n\n            Portal speedrunner explains their wild tricks to Valve developers\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor.

Freedman \n\nContributions from\nAaron Klotz\n\n\nlast updated\n\n17 September 2022\n\n\n\n\nA huge shift in the GPU business.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments (176)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nWatch On \nEVGA, often considered Nvidia's top add-in-board partner, is making a drastic shift. It's done doing business with Nvidia and will stop making GPUs altogether. That's according to YouTube channels JayZTwoCents and GamersNexus, which both sat down with EVGA CEO Andrew Han to discuss his frustrations with Nvidia as a partner and reasoning for making the decision. Jon Peddie Research also published a brief article on the matter.\n\n\"We are not going to be on [Nvidia CEO] Jensen [Huang]'s lap on stage, so I don't want people to speculate what's going on [when we're not there],\" GamersNexus Steve Burke quotes Han as saying. \"EVGA has decided not to carry the next gen.\"\n\nWhen asked for comment, EVGA product management director Jacob Freeman pointed Tom's Hardware to its forums, where the company offered the following message:\n\n\"EVGA is committed to our customers and will continue to offer sales and support on the current lineup. Also, EVGA would like to say thank you to our great community for the many years of support and enthusiasm for EVGA graphics cards.\" EVGA also confirmed that it will not carry the next generation of GPUs, that it will support current generation products, and that it will \"continue to provide the current generation products,\" though it didn't specify for how long.\n\nIt is notable that Han met with two of the biggest tech YouTubers and had the videos embargoed, so there may be more to the story.\n\n\"We\u2019ve had a great partnership with EVGA over the years and will continue to support them on our current generation of products,\" Bryan Del Rizzo, director of global public relations for GeForce at Nvidia told Tom's Hardware. \"We wish Andrew and our friends at EVGA all the best.\"\n\nEVGA will reportedly continue the existing RTX 30-series product line until it runs out of stock. \u00a0The company won't be moving to partner with AMD or Intel, either, with plans to instead focus on other products for the foreseeable future (EVGA already makes power supplies, coolers and motherboards, for instance), but also reportedly won't expand into new product categories.\n\nThe company has reportedly withheld some stock for the market for the purposes of replacing cards in warranty, which should protect current customers, at least for a while.\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nWatch On \n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nWatch On \nHan told JayZTwoCents and GamersNexus that EVGA won't be selling the business. GamersNexus states that Nvidia's top brass were first notified in April, while Peddie reports that Nvidia was informed in June. Apparently, EVGA did make some RTX 40-series cards that made it as far as the engineering sample stage, however.\n\nIt's unclear how EVGA will keep its employees together. It's not a huge company, and while the GamersNexus video suggests Han said he wants to take care of employees, it's unclear what some of these engineers will have to do. The company laid off some employees in Taiwan earlier in the summer.\n\nBoth videos suggest that EVGA feels that Nvidia has stifled it, and suggest they don't find out details like MSRP, costs to buy GPU chips and more until Nvidia announces them, often publicly on stage. \u00a0There is also talk of price ceilings as well as not being able to customize cards by changing the specs, like adding more memory. \u00a0\n\nIt's also an issue because Nvidia is competing against partners with its own Founders Edition cards, both videos say, because Nvidia, as the supplier and manufacturer, doesn't have to worry about profit margins as much.\n\nEVGA has built its reputation on delivering some of the best Nvidia GPU AIB cards. In fact, the VGA stands for video graphics adapter, which is odd for a company that no longer makes them. According to Jon Peddie Research, EVGA's shift here will \"put a big hole in \u00a0Nvidia's North American sales of AIBs,\" suggesting that EVGA had 40% of the market, as well as fans of the brand in western Europe. Peddie notes that as GPUs require more and more electricity, EVGA may be able to sell individuals and OEMs power supplies to make up for some of the profits.\n\nUpdated September 16, 4:23 p.m. ET with the statement from EVGA's forums.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nYouTube\nEVGA\nGeForce\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (176)\n\n\n\nAndrew E.

In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll be deep diving on new GeForce RTX 40 Series features, demonstrating how NVIDIA Studio technology dramatically accelerates content creation.\nNVIDIA artist Sabour Amirazodi demonstrates his video editing workflows featuring AI this week in a special edition of In the NVIDIA Studio.\nThe talented, versatile artist was asked to attend and capture video from the Electric Daisy Carnival music festival, commonly known as EDC, in Las Vegas this summer. Music festivals are profoundly inspirational for Amirazodi, as such spectacles are only achieved by teams bringing together multiple disciplines to drive unforgettable experiences, he said.\n\u201cFrom music produced by world-class DJs, to incredible visuals designed by the best motion-graphics artists, down to skillful pyro techs and lighting directors, it\u2019s a mix of so many creative worlds to create such an amazing experience,\u201d said Amirazodi.\nTo properly capture every finite detail of the action, Amirazodi filmed the entire event in spectacular 12K and 8K resolution with two cameras: the Canon R5 Mirrorless and the Blackmagic URSA Cinema.\nWorking with such large video files, Amirazodi deployed Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve 18 software to get the editing job done, accelerated by his NVIDIA Studio-powered desktop equipped with four NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs.\n\u201cResolve does an incredible job taking advantage of NVIDIA RTX GPUs and using them to accelerate everything from playback to AI-accelerated effects and even encoding for final delivery,\u201d Amirazodi said.\nAI tools have become increasingly important in video-editing workflows, as 80% of all creative work consists of repetitive, redundant tasks. Reducing, or in some cases eliminating, these tasks frees creators in all fields to focus on experimenting with and perfecting their craft.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/studio-itns-wk24-demo-ai-rotoscoping-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nTake rotoscoping, the process of creating animated sequences by tracing over live-action footage. Done frame by frame, this is a notoriously slow and lengthy process. Thanks to the Magic Mask feature in DaVinci Resolve, however, AI can mask the selected object and automatically track it through multiple frames. This enables artists to apply specific effects to live footage with a single click. \u201cRotoscoping is a huge one that used to take me forever to accomplish,\u201d said Amirazodi.\nThis game-changing feature is further sped up, by up to 70%, with the GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, compared to the previous generation.\nSimilarly, the Surface Tracking feature allows AI to track any surface, including uneven ones such as\u00a0 clothes with wrinkles. Even if the selection morphs and warps, it continues to be tracked, sticking to the surfaces Amirazodi selected.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/studio-itns-wk24-demo-surface-tracking-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nDepth Map Generation is another AI-powered DaVinci Resolve feature that saved Amirazodi countless hours in the editing bay. By generating a depth map, the artist applied vibrant colors and lens effects like fog, and could blur the background of any clip.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/studio-itns-wk24-demo-depth-map-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nDaVinci Resolve has an entire suite of RTX-accelerated, AI-powered features to explore.\nFace Refinement detects facial features for fast touch-ups such as sharpening eyes and subtle relighting. Speed Warp can quickly create super-slow-motion videos with ease. Amirazodi\u2019s favorite feature, Detect Scene Cuts, uses DaVinci Resolve\u2019s neural engine to predict video cuts without manual edits \u2014 it\u2019s an incredible boon for his efficiency.\n\nAccording to Amirazodi, AI is \u201conly scratching the surface\u201d of creative possibilities.\nMost AI features require significant computational power, and GeForce RTX GPUs allow video editors to get the most of these new AI features.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/studio-itns-wk24-demo-encoding-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nThe GeForce RTX 40 Series also features new AV1 dual encoders. These work in tandem, dividing work automatically between them to double output and slash export times by up to 50%. GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics card owners gain an instant advantage over fellow freelancers seeking quick exports in multiple formats for different platforms.\nThe dual encoders are also capable of recording stunning content in up to 8K resolution and 60 frames per second in real time via GeForce Experience and OBS Studio.\nDual encoders can record up to 8K, 60 FPS content in real time via GeForce Experience and OBS Studio.\nThe high-speed decoder allows editors to load and work with RAW footage files in real time for DaVinci Resolve as well as REDCINE-X PRO and Adobe Premiere Pro \u2014 without the need to generate lower-resolution files, also known as proxies.\nDaVinci Resolve, the popular Voukoder plugin for Adobe Premiere Pro, and Jianying \u2014 the top video editing app in China \u2014 are all enabling AV1 support, as well as a dual encoder through encode presets, expected in October.\nNVIDIA artist Sabour Amirazodi.\nAmirazodi specializes in video editing, 3D modeling, interactive experiences, and is an all-around creative savant.

Photo by Sean Hollister / The VergeEVGA, a titan in the PC component space, is getting out of the graphics card game. The company posted in its community forum, saying that it won\u2019t be making next-generation Nvidia graphics cards but will continue to sell and support \u201cthe existing current generation products.\u201d According to Gamers Nexus, the company doesn\u2019t currently have plans to make AMD or Intel graphics cards.EVGA is reportedly making the decision to no longer work with Nvidia because it feels the company was a bad partner, according to both Gamers Nexus and JayzTwoCents. The company claims that Nvidia wouldn\u2019t tell EVGA how much it would have to pay to obtain GPU cores before publicly announcing the price of cards like the RTX 3080, which made it difficult for EVGA to figure out how much it would have to charge for its own products, built around Nvidia\u2019s tech. According to JayzTwoCents, Nvidia sent the drivers required to take full advantage of its GPUs to journalists before it sent them to EVGA and would keep the manufacturer in the dark about how many GPUs it would get to integrate into its own designs and products.Nvidia is apparently hard to work and compete withGamers Nexus also reports that EVGA has to sell high-end cards like the RTX 3080 or 3090 at a loss of \u201chundreds of dollars\u201d in order to keep its prices even remotely competitive with Nvidia\u2019s own Founders Edition cards.When asked for a response to these allegations, Nvidia spokesperson Bryan Del Rizzo told The Verge in an email that the company \u201chad a great partnership with EVGA over the years and will continue to support them on our current generation of products. We wish Andrew and our friends at EVGA all the best.\u201d EVGA didn\u2019t immediately respond to our request for comment, but as Tom\u2019s Hardware notes, it has posted a note on its forum reading: \u201cEVGA is committed to our customers and will continue to offer sales and support on the current lineup. Also, EVGA would like to say thank you to our great community for the many years of support and enthusiasm for EVGA graphics cards.\u201dEVGA told Gamers Nexus that it intends to stay in business and won\u2019t lay off any of its employees. However, it seems extremely likely that the company will have to get smaller or make huge expansions on other projects \u2014 the company also makes power supplies, motherboards, and other PC components and accessories, but it\u2019s mostly known for its graphics cards. On the about section of its website, the first thing the company notes is that it\u2019s \u201cone of the top NVIDIA authorized partners in channel sales throughout North America.\u201dWhile Nvidia\u2019s GPU tech is highly regarded, it doesn\u2019t have the reputation of being the nicest company to work with. In 2020, it sparked a wave of backlash from the gaming press when it told reviewer Hardware Unboxed that they\u2019d have to change their editorial direction and test the features Nvidia wanted if they wanted to keep receiving the samples that let them publish day-one reviews.See More: EntertainmentGamingNewsNvidiaPC GamingTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Over the years, EVGA became the largest AIB supplier of NVIDIA GPU-based boards in North America, and predominant supplier in Europe.EVGA 1. EVGA developed the first high-efficiency NVIDIA cooler.Now, after 22 years as an NVIDIA-only GPU/AIB partner, EVGA has had enough. The company told us they would not sell NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation series graphics boards. The news comes as a huge surprise to us, and it will likely shake up the entire PC graphics industry. EVGA is the leading AIB supplier in the U.S. and a leading supplier in Europe.The price, wattage, complexity, and size have grown over the years from a small single-slot AIB to an over-sized, dual-slot, 500-W $1,500+ monster. The transistor and processor density of GPUs has ramped up faster than Moore\u2019s Law, delivering amazing results and compute acceleration across a range of industries. They found use in games, media & entertainment, simulation, crypto mining, and AI training, to name a few (Fig. 2).Jon Peddie 2. The add-in board\u2019s evolution over time shows significant growth in size and performance.To help integrate the GPU into all types of market segments, NVIDIA invested heavily in R&D, spending over $5 billion in 2021 and estimated to spend over $7.5 billion in 2022 (Fig. 3).Jon Peddie 3. NVIDIA R&D spending has increased over time.But, at the same time manufacturing costs, R&D expense, and market costs have risen, margins for the AIB partners have dropped. The old joke about making it up on volume became less and less funny over the years. NVIDIA\u2019s margin, though, went up over time, as they moved into adjacent markets (Fig. 4). Jon Peddie 4. Margin change over time differs significantly between NVIDIA and its partners.However, the cost of goods, manufacturing, and marketing for EVGA and presumably other AIB partners went up. Furthermore, EVGA is unusual compared to its peer companies in the AIB market because the company maintains a large engineering staff and designs its PCBs and cooling systems. The company also provides software for monitoring and overclocking (EVGA Precision), 24/7 premium customer service, a 48-hour RMA return policy, and an innovative Queue system that delivered AIBs to gamers during the pandemic. On top of that, EVGA put more into its packaging than most (if not all) their competitors as part of its goal to be the quality AIB supplier to the demanding high-end gamer (Fig. 5).\u00a0 EVGA 5. The EVGA RTX 3090 is the latest GPU from EVGA. (EVGA)Slowly over time, the relationship between EVGA and NVIDIA changed from what EVGA considered a true partnership to a customer-seller arrangement where EVGA was no longer consulted on new product announcements and briefings, not featured in events, and not informed of price changes. On September 7, NVIDIA offered via Best Buy an RTX 3090 Ti for $1,099.99, undercutting EVGA and other partners who were offering their products at $1,399.99. There was no warning of the price cut and it left the partners with little choice but to sell their inventory at below cost to meet the NVIDIA price. MSI dropped its price to $1,079.99 on New Egg and EVGA dropped to $1,149 (Fig. 6).Jon Peddie 6. NVIDIA cut the price on the RTX 3090 Ti.EVGA says it will continue to sell and support its existing NVIDIA-based AIBs, while maintaining enough inventory to support its three-year warranty, but the company is ending its relationship with NVIDIA. EVGA will still offer its award-winning PSUs (power supplies) and the rest of the product lines.What Do We Think?EVGA dropping NVIDIA will put a big hole in NVIDIA\u2019s North American sales of AIBs, where EVGA enjoyed 40% market share, and put a dent in Western Europe sales due to the many EVGA fans in that region. NVIDIA can overcome that by adjusting the allocation levels for the remaining AIB partners, as well as direct sales through Best Buy, but it will take a quarter or two. Given the inventory overhang partners and NVIDIA are experiencing, there seems to be no rush. The elephant-in-the-room question is: \u201cWill EVGA pick up AMD or Intel GPUs?\u201d Either company would be delighted to add the EVGA brand to its partner list. However, the CEO and Founder of EVGA, Andrew Han, has expressed a desire to slow down a bit and spend more time with his family. The AIB business is truly a 24/7 pressure cooker, and after 22 years, it\u2019s starting to take its toll. However, physicist trained entrepreneur Han may just need a short recharge period; he\u2019s not taken a vacation in years. Han told NVIDIA in June of his decision, so this isn\u2019t news nor comes as a shock to NVIDIA. But it\u2019s a tectonic shift in the channel and the gamer community. Gamers weren\u2019t the only ones who valued EVGA\u2019s high-quality AIBs. Content creators, financial advisors, and hedge-fund managers also were dedicated buyers.Financially, it will reduce EVGA\u2019s total revenue, but the company will increase its profits by escaping the margin squeeze from AIBs. Han has said he has no interest in selling the company. Ironically, when the 4000 series does come out, it will require many end-users and most OEMs to increase the size of their PSUs\u2014and guess who has an answer for \u201cWhere can I get one?\u201d About the Author Jon Peddie | PresidentDr. Jon Peddie heads up Tiburon, Calif.-based Jon Peddie Research.\u00a0Peddie lectures at numerous conferences on topics pertaining to graphics technology and the emerging trends in digital media technology.

They\u2019re among the most important AI models of our time because they\u2019re incredibly effective at finding in the internet\u2019s pandemonium the pearls users want.\nThese machine learning pipelines run on data, terabytes of it. The more data recommenders consume, the more accurate their results and the more return on investment they deliver.\nTo process this data tsunami, companies are already adopting accelerated computing to personalize services for their customers. Grace Hopper will take their advances to the next level.\nGPUs Drive 16% More Engagement\nPinterest, the image-sharing social media company, was able to move to 100x larger recommender models by adopting NVIDIA GPUs. That increased engagement by 16% for its more than 400 million users.\n\u201cNormally, we would be happy with a 2% increase, and 16% is just a beginning,\u201d a software engineer at the company said in a recent blog. \u201cWe see additional gains \u2014 it opens a lot of doors for opportunities.\u201d\nRecommenders consume tens of terabytes of embeddings, data tables that provide context for making accurate predictions.\nThe next generation of the NVIDIA AI platform promises even greater gains for companies processing massive datasets with super-sized recommender models.\nBecause data is the fuel of AI, Grace Hopper is designed to pump more data through recommender systems than any other processor on the planet.\nNVLink Accelerates Grace Hopper\nGrace Hopper achieves this because it\u2019s a superchip \u2014 two chips in one unit, sharing a superfast chip-to-chip interconnect. It\u2019s an Arm-based NVIDIA Grace CPU and a Hopper GPU that communicate over NVIDIA NVLink-C2C.\nWhat\u2019s more, NVLink also connects many superchips into a super system, a computing cluster built to run terabyte-class recommender systems.\nNVLink carries data at a whopping 900 gigabytes per second \u2014 7x the bandwidth of PCIe Gen 5, the interconnect most leading edge upcoming systems will use.\nThat means Grace Hopper feeds recommenders 7x more of the embeddings \u2014 data tables packed with context \u2014 that they need to personalize results for users.\nMore Memory, Greater Efficiency\nThe Grace CPU uses LPDDR5X, a type of memory that strikes the optimal balance of bandwidth, energy efficiency, capacity and cost for recommender systems and other demanding workloads. It provides 50% more bandwidth while using an eighth of the power per gigabyte of traditional DDR5 memory subsystems.\nAny Hopper GPU in a cluster can access Grace\u2019s memory over NVLink. It\u2019s a feature of Grace Hopper that provides the largest pools of GPU memory ever.\nIn addition, NVLink-C2C requires just 1.3 picojoules per bit transferred, giving it more than 5x the energy efficiency of PCIe Gen 5.\nThe overall result is recommenders get a further up to 4x more performance and greater efficiency using Grace Hopper than using Hopper with traditional CPUs (see chart below).\n\nAll the Software You Need\nThe Grace Hopper Superchip runs the full stack of NVIDIA AI software used in some of the world\u2019s largest recommender systems today.\nNVIDIA Merlin is the rocket fuel of recommenders, a collection of models, methods and libraries for building AI systems that can provide better predictions and increase clicks.\nNVIDIA Merlin HugeCTR, a recommender framework, helps users process massive datasets fast across distributed GPU clusters with help from the NVIDIA Collective Communications Library.\nLearn more about Grace Hopper and NVLink in this technical blog.

In Racer RTX, radio-controlled cars zoom through Los Angeles streets, a desert and a chic loft bedroom.\n\nThe demo consists entirely of simulation, rather than animation. This means that its 1,800+ hand-modeled and textured 3D models \u2014 whether the radio-controlled cars or the dominos they knock over while racing \u2014 didn\u2019t require traditional 3D design tasks like baking or pre-compute, which is the presetting of lighting for environments and other properties for assets.\nInstead, the assets react to the changing virtual environment in real time while obeying the laws of physics. This is enabled by the real-time, advanced physics simulation engine, PhysX, which is built into NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for connecting and building custom 3D pipelines and metaverse applications.\nDust trails are left behind by the cars depending on the turbulence from passing vehicles. And sand deforms under racers\u2019 wheels according to how the tires drift.\nAnd with the Omniverse RTX Renderer, lighting can be physically simulated with a click, changing throughout the environment and across surfaces based on whether it\u2019s dawn, day or dusk in the scenes, which are set in Los Angeles\u2019 buzzing beach town of Venice.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RacerRTX-Blog-mp4.mp4\n\u00a0\nConnecting Apps and Workflows\nRacer RTX was created to test the limits of the new NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture \u2014 and steer creators and developers toward a new future of their work.\n\u201cWe wanted to demonstrate the next generation of content creation, where worlds will no longer be prebaked, but physically accurate, full simulations,\u201d Leone said.\nThe result showcases high-fidelity, hyper-realistic physics and real-time ray tracing enabled by Omniverse \u2014 in 4K resolution at 60 frames per second, running with Ada and the new DLSS 3 technology.\n\u201cOur globally spread team used nearly a dozen different design and content-creation tools \u2014 bringing everything together in Omniverse using the ground-truth, extensible Universal Scene Description framework,\u201d Leone added.\nThe NVIDIA artists began the project by sketching initial concept art and taking a slew of reference photos in the westside of LA. Next, they turned to software like Autodesk 3ds Max, Autodesk Maya, Blender, Cinema4D and many more to create the 3D assets, the vast majority of which were modeled by hand.\n\u201cRacer RTX\u201d features over 1,800 unique 3D models.\nTo add texture to the props, the artists used Adobe Substance 3D Designer and Adobe Substance 3D Painter. They then exported the files from these apps using the USD open 3D framework \u2014 and brought them into Omniverse Create for real-time collaboration in the virtual world.\nHyper-Realistic Physics\nThe RC cars in Racer RTX are each modeled with up to 70 individual pieces, including joints and suspensions, all with physics properties.\n\u201cEach car, each domino, every object in the demo has a different center of mass and weight depending on real-world parameters, so they act differently according to the laws of physics,\u201d Leone said. \u201cWe can change the material of the floors, too, from sand to wood to ice \u2014 and use Omniverse\u2019s native PhysX feature to make the vehicles drift along the surface with physically accurate friction.\u201d\nRadio-controlled cars race through Los Angeles streets in \u201cRacer RTX.\u201d\nAnd to make the dust kick up behind the cars as they would in the real world, the artists used the NVIDIA Flow application for smoke, fluid and fire simulation.\nIn addition, the team created their own tools for the project-specific workflow, including Omniverse extensions \u2014 core building blocks that enable anyone to create and extend functionalities of Omniverse apps with just a few lines of Python code \u2014 to randomize and align objects in the scene.\nThe extensions, 3D assets and environments for the Racer RTX demo will be packaged together and available for download in the coming months, so owners of the GeForce RTX 4090 GPU can gear up to explore the environment.\nLearn More About Omniverse\nDive deeper into the making of Racer RTX in an on-demand NVIDIA GTC session \u2014 where Leone is joined by Andrew Averkin, senior art manager; Chase Telegin, technical director of software; and Nikolay Usov, senior environment artist at NVIDIA, to discuss how they built the large-scale, photorealistic virtual world.\nCreators and developers across the world can download NVIDIA Omniverse for free, and enterprise teams can use the platform for their 3D projects.\nCheck out artwork from other \u201cOmnivores\u201d and submit projects in the gallery. Connect your workflows to Omniverse with software from Adobe, Autodesk, Epic Games, Maxon, Reallusion and more.\nFollow NVIDIA Omniverse on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and Medium for additional resources and inspiration.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nThe first three Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-series graphics cards were officially unveiled last week (September 20) and I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about them. Not because I\u2019m excited about the prospect of shiny new graphics cards, but because of my disappointment with the GPUs. While I understand Nvidia\u2019s need to remain ahead of its competitors (namely, AMD and Intel), it\u2019s hard for me to see who these cards are for beyond the ultra-hardcore PC gamer who absolutely needs the latest tech for the best gaming PCs.I realize I\u2019m a week late to the party since I was on vacation when Nvidia revealed its new Lovelace cards, but I needed to air my thoughts as I\u2019ve seen similar sentiments from like-minded individuals. While the RTX 40-series looks to be the company\u2019s most powerful GPU line yet, they don\u2019t seem like components most people need to rush out and get.Before, I couldn\u2019t get excited about Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-series cards. Now, I\u2019m flat-out skipping this GPU generation and sticking with my RTX 3080 Ti. Here\u2019s why.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nI review gaming PCs for a living, and I'd never buy the RTX 5090 \u2014 here's why\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5090: 3 reasons to buy and 2 reasons to skip\n\n\n\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 30-series are still solid GPUs\u00a0Most of the conversation about the Nvidia RTX 30-series has centered around how unavailable and overpriced they've been since launch. We can blame this on the global pandemic and semiconductor shortage, but scalpers and crypto miners didn\u2019t make things any better. The only way I was able to snag an RTX 3080 Ti without waiting months was to buy a pre-built PC with the elusive card\u2026 though the Ampere GPU still cost $200 more than retail.These woes aside, the RTX 30-series was and is a fantastic GPU line that\u2019s capable of running graphically demanding games at high resolutions and frame rates. The flagship RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 cards have little difficulty running games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Red Dead Redemption 2 at max settings, but even \u201cmid-tier\u201d GPUs like the RTX 3060 and RTX 3070 can play most modern games at mid to high settings without a hitch.The current RTX 30-series cards are still powerful enough to handle even the most demanding modern video games. (Image credit: Nvidia)The pandemic set the gaming industry back by at least two years. Because of that, Ampere GPUs will likely be viable for longer. Developers will continue making the best PC games optimized for Nvidia\u2019s last-gen GPUs even with the 40-series cards out in the wild. And considering how RTX 30-series cards are now more readily available, it will likely be the de facto Nvidia card for quite some time. I don\u2019t see 8K gaming becoming mainstream anytime soon, after all.The price isn\u2019t rightGraphics cards aren\u2019t the most affordable PC components, but the pricing for the RTX 40-series has upset a lot of prospective buyers. At launch, the flagship RTX 4090 will cost an eye-watering $1,599 \u2013 with the RTX 4080 16GB coming at $1,199 and RTX 4080 12GB at $899.We didn't expect the RTX 40-series to be cheap but they each cost hundreds of dollars more than their last-gen equivalents. (Image credit: Nvidia)Admittedly, the RTX 4090 is $400 cheaper than the $1,999 RTX 3090 Ti that launched earlier in 2022. However, it\u2019s $100 more than its last-gen equivalent, the RTX 3090. Nvidia claims the 4090 is two to four times more powerful than the RTX 3090 Ti, which would seemingly make it a great deal since it\u2019s more affordable. Still, $1,599 is a steep price to pay, especially given the current state of the world economy.I\u2019m not a fan of the RTX 4090\u2019s price but I can almost forgive it when compared to the pricing for the two RTX 4080 GPUs. At $1,199 for the 16GB version and $899 for the 12GB edition, the GPUs cost $400 and $200 more than the RTX 3080 12GB and 10GB, respectively. Yes, the new card has more VRAM (memory), but as far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019re better off buying a cheaper last-gen card that can still run games at high or max settings.The GeForce RTX 4080 12GB is borderline insulting\u00a0I have to single out the 12GB version of the RTX 4080 since it\u2019s the one most people (myself included) have the biggest issue with. Nvidia is marketing the RTX 4080 as a single card with two variants, which might make you think they're identical except for the 4GB difference in memory. But there are other differences that make the 12GB card seems more like what the RTX 4070 should be in terms of specs.Based on the specs Nvidia provided, the 12GB RTX 4080 has 7,680 CUDA cores compared to the 9,728 cores found in the 16GB model. This means the $899 Lovelace card won't perform as well as the $1,199 version. In addition, the 12GB variant has a lower bus width and lower power draw. The latter isn\u2019t a bad thing since this card will use less power, but a lower bus width means it won\u2019t be able to access or transmit as much data as the 16GB card.The RTX 4080 12GB is less powerful than the 16GB model. It might as well be the RTX 4070, spec-wise. (Image credit: Nvidia)Though I can somewhat applaud Nvidia for releasing a Lovelace card that costs less than $1,000, it\u2019s hard to ignore the fact that the RTX 4080 12GB is a significantly different GPU compared to the 16GB edition. I worry that unsuspecting buyers will opt for the cheaper card, thinking they\u2019re only getting less memory.\u00a0I\u2019ll just say bluntly: Do not buy the RTX 4080 12GB GPU if you\u2019re in the market to upgrade.Ready to skip the Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-seriesI wasn\u2019t exactly sold on the idea of the RTX 40-series when rumors first began percolating. At the time, Ampere cards were notoriously difficult to find. As such, I questioned the need for the new Lovelace GPUs. Now that Nvidia has officially unveiled its latest graphics cards, I\u2019m even less convinced.If I had a GTX 10- or 20-series GPU then the upgrade would be worth it, even at such steep prices. But given how the RTX 3080 Ti currently residing in my gaming rig is providing me with 4K 60 fps experiences, I don\u2019t see why I have to get a Lovelace card. Even as someone who wants the latest tech, it\u2019s not worth it.If you\u2019re in the same position as me, then it might be best to skip the RTX 40-series line and wait for the next Nvidia GPU generation; or perhaps see if AMD finally releases a GPU Nvidia can truly be scared of.Today's best Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti deals186 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $1,049View Deal $1,199.99View Deal No price informationCheck WalmartWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nnvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (6)\n\n\n\nTony PolancoSocial Links NavigationSenior Computing WriterTony is a computing writer at Tom\u2019s Guide covering laptops, tablets, Windows, and iOS.

I haven't seen any solid numbers yet but even with another leap in performance I think you'd have to be just wanting even higher frames in 4K to need the upgrade. Now I'm only playing in 1440p but with a 240Hz monitor and my 2080Ti can easily handle anything I throw at it. I'm not even upset about the price as a lot of people are. I paid almost $1,500 a few years ago for my 2080Ti. If you want anything other than those hideous stock cards you're going to be paying a decent amount. If these new cards do have the rumored performance then I think the price is a fair jump. I think the number of people that actually need the jump in performance is small. Apparently they're pushing the next gen DLSS and Ray Tracing improvements. I don't have the need for DLSS, Ray Tracing is nice but for me the number of games I've played that support it is so small. So overall I think the number of people crying about the price is much larger than the number of people who would actually buy the card for the improvements regardless of price.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValkyr09\n\n\nWhy are you trying to get it now? It's way overpriced. I'm waiting for 2023. The prices will drop unless we have world war 3\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkato128\n\n\nTbh I'm still rocking a 1080ti and I'm considering holding off yet another generation. Really wanted a 3080 but the heavens weep at the price. Guess we'll see what AMD and Intel have on offer but my bet is the 1080ti will soldier on\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatk2662\n\n\nI knew I'd be skipping when I bought the 3090 almost 2 years ago. I did the same when I bought the 1080ti. I skipped the 2080ti.\nThe 4090 has very few real world uses over the 3090. High end gpu are now in the world of diminishing returns. Humans have limited perception and as such many of the insane laboratory figures we are being told about cannot be perceived by humans. For example, very high frame rates are totally invisible to the human eye. My 3090 actually is on about the fringes of human limits. The 4090 goes way beyond them.\nLet's be totally honest and say that the vast majority of those upgrading will only be doing so for the bragging rights. Less that 4% game at 4k on pc. Hdr use is virtually non existent. Hdr 400 and 600 doesn't count. Its awful.\nThe 3080 is overkill for gaming at less than 4k. Yet many will upgrade just to keep up with the joneses and post inane photos of their new toy.\nThe 4090 doesn't actually do anything new apart from dlss 3. A cynic may say that nvidia even rigged the deck with that one.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFolly_Polymath\n\n\nWhy is this an article? Why did some idiot get paid to write this? There have been editorials decrying new tech and generations of CPUs/GPUs for 20+ years, and the rationale is always, \"I don't need this right now.\" Cool moron, we don't need to know that you don't need new tech you haven't bought. Just go back and look at all the responses to solid state storage 15 years ago, when the same morons would comment \"Nah, I'll stick with my Raptor.\" I have a 3080 and a Samsung Odyssey and the card struggles with ray tracing at that resolution, so I'm the customer for an upgrade.

As a result, the company will not be producing video cards based on NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation of GPUs \u2013 and won\u2019t be immediately switching allegiance to AMD or Intel, either. Consequently, NVIDIA is losing their largest add-in board (AIB) in North America, and the broader North American video card market is losing one of its biggest and best-known vendors.\nIn a brief announcement posted on EVGA\u2019s forums, the company outlined their parting from NVIDIA, while underscoring that this affects the next-generation of video cards, and that EVGA will continue to provide current-gen products and support existing customers.\n\n\nEVGA will not carry the next generation graphics cards.\nEVGA will continue to support the existing current generation products.\nEVGA will continue to provide the current generation products.\n\nEVGA is committed to our customers and will continue to offer sales and support on the current lineup. Also, EVGA would like to say thank you to our great community for the many years of support and enthusiasm for EVGA graphics cards.\nEVGA Management\n\nMeanwhile, in a briefing attended by Jon Peddie Research and Gamers Nexus, EVGA\u2019s CEO (and founder) Andrew Han laid out some further details about the transition. These are both great pieces and as I\u2019m not going to simply rehash them point by point, I\u2019d encourage readers looking for a first-hand recounting of the briefing to check them out.\nAs laid out in both pieces, EVGA\u2019s parting from NVIDIA comes as the company\u2019s relationship with NVIDIA has, according to EVGA, soured over the years. Most notably, AIB margins have been slowly shrinking over the past couple of decades, with JPR publishing that gross margins at the AIB partners have fallen from 25% in 2000 to 10% in 2015, and finally an estimated 5% this year. Meanwhile, as NVIDIA has slowly ramped up its own efforts to directly sell its Founders Edition (reference) video cards in Best Buy and other retailers, AIBs like EVGA have been put in a position of directly competing with their partner-turned-supplier.\n\nJon Peddie Research: AIB Gross Margins v. NVIDIA Gross Margins\nThis, in turn, has put EVGA in a position where they are taking a loss on selling high-end NVIDIA cards, a significant shift from what are normally the highest margin products sold by video card vendors. And while consumers are benefitting from this in the short term via cheaper video cards, taking a loss of hundreds of dollars per video card is not sustainable \u2013 nor is it a viable business practice to begin with.\nAs a result of these factors (and undoubtedly more tales known only between EVGA and NVIDIA) EVGA has opted to part ways from NVIDIA. This means that EVGA will not be selling video cards based on NVIDIA\u2019s next generation of GPUs, and that EVGA is ramping down production of existing GeForce RTX 30 series cards. According to Gamers Nexus, EVGA expects to run out of current-generation cards for retail by the end of the year, with the company setting aside a remainder of those cards as spares to honor warranty obligations.\n\nEVGA RTX 3090 Ti FTW3: A Money-Losing Product\nPerhaps equally notable, EVGA has also made it clear that they are not immediately partnering with a competing GPU vendor, either. So for the moment, at least, this is not going to be a case of EVGA switching allegiances to AMD or Intel. Instead, EVGA is going to be out of the video card market for an indefinite period of time. To be sure, according to GN and JPR, the company has not completely closed the door on partnering with another GPU vendor, but they also aren\u2019t actively pursing the matter right now.\nAnd while this marks a massive cut to EVGA\u2019s business \u2013 Gamers Nexus reports that video cards represent 80% of EVGA\u2019s revenue \u2013 EVGA is not going out of business. The company still has a successful and well-regarded power supply business, as well as a more niche presence in high-end motherboards and gaming peripherals. This also means that EVGA will continue supporting its existing video card customers even once their remaining video card stockpile runs out, as the company still wants to maintain its sterling reputation for customer service.\nCommentary: A Big Loss for Consumers, and a Opening the Door To Vertical Integration\nEVGA\u2019s exit from the video card industry represents what is easily the biggest shift in the retail video card landscape in over a decade. EVGA is not the first NVIDIA partner to part ways with the company \u2013 BFG and XFX were both major NVIDIA partners back in the 00s as well \u2013 but EVGA\u2019s exit would seem to be the biggest yet. According to JPR, EVGA held 40% of the North American retail market, and they were a sizable player in Europe as well. EVGA was NVIDIA\u2019s de facto premiere partner in the west, both in terms of total video card volumes and in terms of mindshare, with a legacy of producing high quality video cards backed with some of the best support in the industry.\nAs a result, EVGA\u2019s exit is a big loss for consumers and video card enthusiasts overall. While NVIDIA can (and undoubtedly will) shift allocations over to their remaining AIB partners \u2013 Zotac is arguably the next best-known NVIDIA-exclusive vendor in North America \u2013 this still represents a reduction in competition in video card designs, especially with premium products where EVGA did some of their best work. And none of the remaining AIBs have a reputation for support that matches EVGA\u2019s (though to be sure, reputation isn\u2019t necessarily representative of the real world).\n\nEVGA's Immediate Future: More Mobos and PSUs\nBut the full impact to the consumer market is going to hinge on what NVIDIA does next. From EVGA\u2019s briefing it\u2019s clear that there has been some friction between the two companies for quite some time, so while these revelations are new to outsiders, internally the businesses have been at odds for a while now. That means NVIDIA had plenty of time to prepare for EVGA\u2019s split (they were first informed in April), and NVIDIA already has their own retail operations.\nIn fact, it\u2019s those retail operations that seem to have led the way to what\u2019s happening today. It wasn\u2019t until the Pascal generation/GTX 10 series (2016) that NVIDIA began selling its own retail cards; for the 20 years before that, NVIDIA relied on AIBs to move its products. And even after that point, NVIDIA has purposely limited its reach by only selling cards directly, and later just through Best Buy.\nStill, I\u2019ve long wondered how AIBs have felt about NVIDIA going into competition with their own board partners, and now we have an answer, it would seem. EVGA is being driven out in part by NVIDIA\u2019s direct presence on the market, with their Founders Edition cards undercutting EVGA\u2019s products in price. It\u2019s a relationship that by its very nature puts AIBs like EVGA at a disadvantage, as NVIDIA has the better brand recognition (all cards are NVIIDA cards) and much of NVIDIA\u2019s R&D is paid for by their internal need for reference cards. This means that AIBs face additional costs on top of buying hardware from NVIDIA, especially if they want to go for premium designs like EVGA has been apt to do.\nIn short, NVIDIA\u2019s decision to directly sell video cards, whether intentional or not, is putting the squeeze on AIBs. And NVIDIA-exclusive AIBs like EVGA are the most vulnerable.\nEVGA\u2019s exit from the video card market, in turn, opens the door to larger changes in video card manufacturing and distribution. Video card complexity has increased significantly over the years, and consequently so have the R&D costs at every single level. GPUs aren\u2019t just getting more advanced, but they need ever finer PCB routing for memory, more advanced VRMs, bulked up cooling, and more. It\u2019s not unlike the fab market, where every generation ups the ante on costs and discourages the kind of competition that results in lower prices, lower margins, and the inability to afford to play in the next generation of the game.\nAll of this, in turn, is making vertical integration look more and more appealing. While the AIBs in one form or another have played pivotal roles in the video card market since the dawn of the PC era, offering retail reach and support that the GPU vendors didn\u2019t have or didn\u2019t want to bother with, the actual value they add is, unfortunately, diminishing. Video cards are becoming so complex that, especially at the high end, the best move may very well be to stick with the reference designs. All of which further reduces the value (and uniqueness) AIBs can provide.\n\nEVGA's Experiments Haven't Always Panned Out...\nIn short, this may be the moment where we see video card production pivot to having the GPU vendors themselves sell their cards, without the use of AIBs. So rather than having 10 video cards within a generation and then numerous AIB variations thereof \u2013 as is the case now with NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 30 series \u2013 we\u2019d have something more akin to desktop CPUs where there\u2019s a dozen or so SKUs provided directly by the manufacturer.\nOf course, this has been tried once before, with disastrous results (kids, go ask your parents about 3dfx), so it\u2019s not by any means a sure-fire thing. But EVGA\u2019s departure opens the door to NVIDIA to swoop in and take back 40% of their retail market for themselves, if that\u2019s what they want.\nAnd if NVIDIA doesn\u2019t fill in the gap, then NVIDIA\u2019s remaining AIBs will no doubt be happy to do it. The volume vacuum from EVGA\u2019s exit means almost half the NVDIIA North American video card market is up for grabs. It is a huge opportunity to reshape that landscape and grab the kind of market share that would take years and years to peel away under more normal circumstances. So although a dark day for EVGA, opportunity knocks for the AIBs who remain.\nThe next-biggest question at this point is whether EVGA will remain in the video card market at all. From the Gamers Nexus and JPR articles it\u2019s clear that EVGA is not keen on immediately jumping back in with a different partner. And, given that the Ethereum Merge just went through this week and video cards across the globe were liberated from their inane toiling (read: Ethereum is no longer relying on proof-of-work for blockchain processing), now is not the time to be making any firm plans.\nThe broad expectations of the industry are that all of these former mining cards are going to be boomeranging back on to the used video card market, similar to the last crypto hangover but in even larger volumes due to the much longer period this most recent mining boom went on. So the video card market is going to be dealing with an oversupply as it is, meaning that it\u2019s not going to be a great time to be producing more video cards, as even next-gen cards below the flagship level will be competing with their predecessors.\nSo even if EVGA does ultimately opt to get back in to video cards \u2013 and I hope they do \u2013 sitting things out while the market corrects itself and digests the sudden surge of used cards is a prudent move. How long all of that will take remains to be seen, but as the current situation took years to get into, it won\u2019t be a fast fix coming back out. In time, it would be a feather in either AMD or Intel\u2019s cap to line up EVGA as a partner, as they bring a level of sophistication and respect that none of their current AIBs possess. Though it should be noted that the overall GPU market share is so significantly tilted in NVIDIA\u2019s favor right now \u2013 a 4:1 ratio \u2013 that at former production levels EVGA could probably absorb most of the AMD retail market presence, something AMD\u2019s other AIBs would no doubt be unhappy with.\nUnfortunately, this exit also underscores how exposed EVGA is in the video card market, since video card sales were 80% of its revenue. The company has other product lines, but these are smaller in volume and all in product categories that are even more commoditized than video cards.\n\nOver the Years EVGA Has Gone Big Into PSUs, In More Ways Than One\nEVGA, for its part, has certainly made efforts to diversify over the years, but with limited success. Almost a decade ago I was fortunate enough to be at a business dinner with EVGA and Anand, where Andrew Han asked for our feedback on what sorts of products we thought would be good markets for EVGA to expand into. We ended up making several suggestions, but as today\u2019s EVGA product mix shows, EVGA never found a second market on the same order of magnitude as video cards. Consequently, I\u2019m not surprised to see Gamers Nexus report that EVGA is not planning on expanding into new product categories in the near future; that\u2019s not something they\u2019ve had luck with in better times, never mind going into this likely recession.\nUltimately, while today\u2019s news marks a seismic shift in the video card landscape, it\u2019s also the kind of news where there\u2019s no way to put a positive spin on it. The video card market, for its part, will keep moving right along without EVGA, but the market and consumers are all the worse for EVGA\u2019s departure. Thankfully, this is not EVGA\u2019s eulogy \u2013 the company is still staying in business \u2013 but I sincerely hope that when we talk about EVGA in the future, it will be for more than just motherboards and PSUs. Video cards are were EVGA has made its name, and it\u2019s still where EVGA does some of its best work.\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n119 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nCooe - Friday, September 16, 2022 - link\nOh look, yet another addition to the BILLIONS already on the list of \"why I will never buy another Nvidia product and support such a trash, anti-consumer, anti-partner business\"!

And wasn't on the market soon enough.nVidia Geforce 256 was a smash hit for example with TnL.. And they quickly followed that up with the venerable Geforce 2.nVidia was simply iterating faster and more significantly... And ATI was quickly catching up while S3, Rendition, Trident, Matrox, NEC and even Intel with the i740 AGP card faltered or fell behind.Eventually 3dfx would be bought out by nVidia... ATI would eventually beat nVidia with the Radeon 9700 Pro and got bought out by AMD eventually...And Intel is planning to re-enter the market.The GPU race has been... Odd.\n\n\n\nMadAd - Saturday, September 17, 2022 - link\nWhile what you say is correct the actual nail in the coffin was the near vexatious lawsuit Nvidia bought upon 3Dfx at your aforementioned worst possible point which saw 3Dfx collapse as Nvidia had the deeper litigation pockets and 3Dfx simply ran out of money defending it, finally making an agreement with Nvidia to hand over the company as long as the workforce were paid off.Since then I have not bought a single Nvida product purely for the asshole way they treated 3Dfx (I still have my old Voodoo 5) and, along with many other consumer negative business moves through the years, I am not surprised with this new news regarding how EVGA has been treated.\n\n\n\nTraxus0 - Tuesday, September 20, 2022 - link\nnVidia's countered a lawsuit started by 3Dfx almost 2 years prior, so it was actually 3Dfx who initially wanted to keep potential competition away by suing. Not to say it did not contribute to 3Dfx' demise.\n\n\n\nWaltC - Saturday, September 17, 2022 - link\n3dfx died for only one reason--when they bought the STB factory in Mexico where the V3 was manufactured, the company foolishly agreed to absorb whatever debt held the plant as collateral, and it turned out that the STB factory had $512M or so in debt that 3dfx was on the hook to pay.  Big money in those days--huge.  Illustrates why it's not a good idea for engineers to buy things like factories without top-notch legal help.  V3 was a great GPU, ironically--likely the best ever made by 3dfx, imo.  But the debt did them in and 3dfx could get no financing.  That was all she wrote for 3dfx. nVidia picked up the remnants at a fire sale.\n\n\n\nBruzzone - Monday, September 19, 2022 - link\ninteresting. mb\n\n\n\nblppt - Monday, September 19, 2022 - link\nI still miss the \"it just works, the way its supposed to\" way that Glide made gaming on PCs back then.Still, I doubt even if 3dfx hadn't died whether Glide would still be around.

The companies are the latest to join the extensive ecosystem of sensor makers using NVIDIA\u2019s end-to-end, cloud-based simulation platform for technology development.\nContinental offers a full suite of cameras, radars and ultrasonic sensors, as well as its recently launched short-range flash lidar, some of which are incorporated into the NVIDIA Hyperion autonomous-vehicle development platform.\nLast year, Continental and AEye announced a collaboration in which the tier-1 supplier would use the lidar maker\u2019s software-defined architecture to produce a long-range sensor. Now, the companies are contributing this sensor model to DRIVE Sim, helping to bring their vision to the industry.\nDRIVE Sim is built on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform for connecting and building custom 3D pipelines, providing physically based digital twin environments to develop and validate autonomous vehicles. DRIVE Sim is open and modular \u2014 users can create their own extensions or choose from a rich library of sensor plugins from ecosystem partners.\nIn addition to providing sensor models, partners use the platform to validate their own sensor architectures.\nBy joining this rich community of DRIVE Sim users, Continental and AEye can now rapidly simulate edge cases in varying environments to test and validate lidar performance.\nA Lidar for All Seasons\nAEye and Continental are creating HRL 131, a high-performance, long-range lidar for both passenger cars and commercial vehicles that\u2019s software configurable and can adapt to various driving environments.\nThe lidar incorporates dynamic performance modes where the laser scan pattern adapts for any automated driving application, including highway driving or dense urban environments in all weather conditions, including direct sun, night, rain, snow, fog, dust and smoke. It features a range of more than 300 meters for detecting vehicles and 200 meters for detecting pedestrians, and is slated for mass production in 2024.\nThe simulated Continental HRL131 long-range lidar sensor, built on AEye\u2019s 4Sight intelligent sensing platform, running in NVIDIA DRIVE Sim.\nWith DRIVE Sim, developers can recreate obstacles with their exact physical properties and place them in complex highway environments. They can determine which lidar performance modes are suitable for the chosen application based on uncertainties experienced in a particular scenario.\nOnce identified and tuned, performance modes can be activated on the fly using external cues such as speed, location or even vehicle pitch, which can change with loading conditions, tire-pressure variations and suspension modes.\nThe ability to simulate performance characteristics of a software-defined lidar model adds even greater flexibility to DRIVE Sim, further accelerating robust autonomous vehicle development.\n\u2018\u2019With the scalability and accuracy of NVIDIA DRIVE Sim, we\u2019re able to validate our long-range lidar technology efficiently,\u2019\u2019 said Gunnar Juergens, head of product line, lidar, at Continental. \u2018\u2019It\u2019s a robust tool for the industry to train, test and validate safe self-driving solutions\u2019\u2019\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC 2022 | NVIDIA DRIVE | NVIDIA DRIVE Sim \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Yet the race to deliver ultrafast wireless internet today resembles a contest between the tortoise and the hare, as some mobile network operators struggle with costly and complex network requirements.\nAdvanced data analytics company HEAVY.AI today unveiled solutions to put carriers on more even footing. Its initial product, HeavyRF, delivers a next-generation network planning and operations tool based on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform for creating digital twins.\n\n\u201cBuilding out 5G networks globally will cost trillions of dollars over the next decade, and our telco network customers are rightly worried about how much of that is money not well spent,\u201d said Jon Kondo, CEO of HEAVY.AI. \u201cUsing HEAVY advanced analytics and NVIDIA Omniverse-based real-time simulations, they\u2019ll see big savings in time and money.\u201d\nHEAVY.AI also announced that Charter Communications is collaborating on incorporating the tool into its modeling and planning operations for its Spectrum telco network, which has 32 million customers in 41 U.S. states. The collaboration extends HEAVY\u2019s relationship with Charter, building on the existing analytics operations to 5G network planning.\n\u201cHEAVY.AI\u2019s new digital twin capabilities give us a way to explore and fine-tune our expanding 5G networks in ways that weren\u2019t possible before,\u201d said Jared Ritter, senior director of analytics and automation at Charter Communications.\nWithout the digital twin approach, telco operators must either: physically place microcell towers in densely populated areas to understand the interaction between radio transmitters, the environment, and humans and devices that are on the move \u2014 or use tools that offer less detail about key factors\u00a0 such as tree density or high-rise interference.\nEarly deployments of 5G needed 300% more base stations for the same level of coverage offered by the previous generation, called Long Term Evolution (LTE), because of higher spectrum bands. A 5G site will consume 300% more power and cost 4x more than an LTE site if they\u2019re deployed in the same way, according to researcher Analysys Mason.\nThose sobering figures are prompting the industry to look for efficiencies. Harnessing GPU-accelerated analytics and real-time geophysical mapping, HEAVY.AI\u2019s digital twin solution allows telcos to test radio frequency (RF) propagation scenarios in seconds, powered by the HeavyRF module. This results in significant time and cost savings, because the base stations and microcells can be more accurately placed and tuned at first installation.\nThe HeavyRF module supports telcos\u2019 goals to plan, build and operate new networks more efficiently by tightly integrating key business information such as mobility and parcels data, as well as customer experience data, within RF planning workflows.\nUsing an RF-synchronized digital twin would enable planners at Charter Communications to optimize capacity and coverage, plus interactively see how changes in deployment patterns translate into customer acquisition and retention at the household level.\nThe goal is to use machine learning and big data pipelines to continuously mirror existing real-world conditions.\nThe digital twin will use the parallel computing capabilities of modern GPUs for visual simulation, as well as to generate physical simulations of RF signals using real-time RTX ray tracing, powered by NVIDIA Omniverse\u2019s RTX Renderer.\nFor telcos, it\u2019s not just about investing in traditional networks. With the rise of AI applications and services, these companies seek to lay the foundation for 5G-enabled devices, autonomous vehicles, appliances, robots and city infrastructure.\nWatch the GTC keynote on demand to see all of NVIDIA\u2019s latest announcements, and register for the conference \u2014 running through Thursday, Sept. 22 \u2014 to explore how digital twins are transforming industries.\n\n\nCategories: Accelerated Analytics | Pro GraphicsTags: 5G | Digital Twin | GTC 2022 | Omniverse | Ray Tracing | Telecommunications \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Whether for a video conference, a call made to a customer service center, or a live stream, Maxine enables clear communications to enhance virtual interactions.\nNVIDIA Maxine is a suite of GPU-accelerated AI software development kits (SDKs) and cloud-native microservices for deploying optimized and accelerated AI features that enhance audio, video and augmented-reality (AR) effects in real time.\nAnd with Maxine\u2019s state-of-the-art models, end users don\u2019t need expensive gear to improve audio and video. Using NVIDIA AI-based technology, these high-quality effects can be achieved with standard microphones and camera equipment.\nAt GTC, NVIDIA announced the re-architecture of Maxine for cloud-native microservices, with the early-access release of Maxine\u2019s audio-effects microservice. Additionally, new Maxine SDK features were unveiled, including Speaker Focus and Face Expression Estimation, as well as the general availability of Eye Contact. NVIDIA Maxine now also includes enhanced versions of existing SDK features.\n\nMaxine Goes Cloud Native\nMaxine\u2019s cloud-native microservices allow developers to build real-time AI applications. Microservices can be independently managed and deployed seamlessly in the cloud, accelerating development timelines.\nThe Audio Effects microservice, available in early access, contains four state-of-the-art audio features:\n\nBackground Noise Removal: Removes several common background noises using AI models, while preserving the speaker\u2019s natural voice.\nRoom Echo Removal: Removes reverberations from audio using AI models, restoring clarity of a speaker\u2019s voice.\nAudio Super Resolution: Improves audio quality by increasing the temporal resolution of audio signal. It currently supports upsampling from 8 kHz to 16 kHz and from 16 kHz to 48 kHz.\nAcoustic Echo Cancellation: Cancels real-time acoustic device echo from the input-audio stream, eliminating mismatched acoustic pairs and double-talk. With AI-based technology, more effective cancellation is achieved than with traditional digital signal processing.\n\nPexip, a leading provider of enterprise video conferencing and collaboration solutions, is using NVIDIA AI technologies to take virtual meetings to the next level with advanced features for the modern workforce.\n\u201cWith Maxine\u2019s move to cloud-native microservices, it will be even easier to combine NVIDIA\u2019s advanced AI technologies with our own unique server-side architecture,\u201d said Eddie Clifton, senior vice president of Strategic Alliances at Pexip. \u201cThis allows our teams at Pexip to deliver an enhanced experience for virtual meetings.\u201d\nSign up for early access.\nExplore Enhanced Features of SDKs\nMaxine offers three GPU-accelerated SDKs that reinvent real-time communications with AI: audio, video and AR effects.\nThe audio effects SDK delivers multi-effect, low-latency, AI-based audio-quality enhancement algorithms.

Now, the Fortune 50 retailer is experimenting with high-tech methods to elevate both the associate and customer experience.\nUsing NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise to visualize and interact with a store\u2019s digital data, Lowe\u2019s is testing digital twins in Mill Creek, Wash,. and Charlotte, N.C. Its ultimate goal is to empower its retail associates to better serve customers, collaborate with one another in new ways and optimize store operations.\n\u201cAt Lowe\u2019s, we are always looking for ways to reimagine store operations and remove friction for our customers,\u201d said Seemantini Godbole, executive vice president and chief digital and information officer at Lowe\u2019s. \u201cWith NVIDIA Omniverse, we\u2019re pulling data together in ways that have never been possible, giving our associates superpowers.\u201d\nAugmented Reality Restocking and \u2018X-Ray Vision\u2019\nWith its interactive digital twin, Lowe\u2019s is exploring a variety of novel augmented reality use cases, including reconfiguring layouts, restocking support, real-time collaboration and what it calls \u201cX-ray vision.\u201d\nWearing a Magic Leap 2 AR headset, store associates can interact with the digital twin. This AR experience helps an associate compare what a store shelf should look like with what it actually looks like, and ensure it\u2019s stocked with the right products in the right configurations.\nAnd this isn\u2019t just a single-player activity. Store associates on the ground can communicate and collaborate with centralized store planners via AR. For example, if a store associate notices an improvement that could be made to a proposed planogram for their store, they can flag it on the digital twin with an AR \u201csticky note.\u201d\nLastly, a benefit of the digital twin and Magic Leap 2 headset is the ability to explore \u201cX-ray vision.\u201d Traditionally, a store associate might need to climb a ladder to scan or read small labels on cardboard boxes held in a store\u2019s top stock. With an AR headset and the digital twin, the associate could look up at a partially obscured cardboard box from ground level, and, thanks to computer vision and Lowe\u2019s inventory application programming interfaces, \u201csee\u201d what\u2019s inside via an AR overlay.\n\nStore Data Visualization and Simulation\nHome-improvement retail is a tactile business. And when making decisions about how to create a new store display, a common way for retailers to see what works is to build a physical prototype, put it out into a brick-and-mortar store and examine how customers react.\nWith NVIDIA Omniverse and AI, Lowe\u2019s is exploring more efficient ways to approach this process.\nJust as e-commerce sites gather analytics to optimize the customer shopping experience online, the digital twin enables new ways of viewing sales performance and customer traffic data to optimize the in-store experience. 3D heatmaps and visual indicators that show the physical distance of items frequently bought together can help associates put these objects near each other. Within a 100,000 square-foot location, for example, minimizing the number of steps needed to pick up an item is critical.\nUsing historical order and product location data, Lowe\u2019s can also use NVIDIA Omniverse to simulate what might happen when a store is set up differently. Using AI avatars created in Lowe\u2019s Innovation Labs, the retailer can simulate how far customers and associates might need to walk to pick up items that are often bought together.\nNVIDIA Omniverse allows for hundreds of simulations to be run in a fraction of the time that it takes to build a physical store display, Godbole said.\nExpanding Into the Metaverse\nLowe\u2019s also announced today at NVIDIA GTC that it will soon make the over 600 photorealistic 3D product assets from its home-improvement library free for other Omniverse creators to use in their virtual worlds. All of these products will be available in the Universal Scene Description format on which Omniverse is built, and can be used in any metaverse created by developers using NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise.\nFor Lowe\u2019s, the future of home improvement is one in which AI, digital twins and mixed reality play a part in the daily lives of its associates, Godbole said. With NVIDIA Omniverse, the retailer is taking steps to build this future \u2013 and there\u2019s a lot more to come as it tests new strategies.\nJoin a GTC panel discussion on Wednesday, Sept. 21, with Lowe\u2019s Innovation Labs VP Cheryl Friedman and Senior Director of Creative Technology Mason Sheffield, who will discuss how Lowe\u2019s is using AI and NVIDIA Omniverse to make the home-improvement retail experience even better.\nWatch the GTC keynote on demand to see all of NVIDIA\u2019s latest announcements, and register free for the conference \u2014 running through Thursday, Sept. 22 \u2014 to explore how digital twins are transforming industries.\n\n\nCategories: CorporateTags: Artificial Intelligence | Digital Twin | GTC 2022 | Metaverse | Omniverse | Omniverse Enterprise | Retail | Universal Scene Description \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang previewed the breakthrough during the GTC keynote.\n\nThis research includes award-winning work first published at SIGGRAPH, a computer graphics conference held last month.\nNeural Reconstruction Engine\nThe Neural Reconstruction Engine is a new AI toolset for the NVIDIA DRIVE Sim simulation platform that uses multiple AI networks to turn recorded video data into simulation.\nThe new pipeline uses AI to automatically extract the key components needed for simulation, including the environment, 3D assets and scenarios. These pieces are then reconstructed into simulation scenes that have the realism of data recordings, but are fully reactive and can be manipulated as needed. Achieving this level of detail and diversity by hand is costly, time consuming and not scalable.\nEnvironments and Assets\nA simulation needs an environment in which to operate. The AI pipeline converts 2D video data from a real-world drive to a dynamic, 3D digital twin environment that can be loaded into DRIVE Sim.\nA 3D simulation environment generated from recorded driving data using AI.\nThe DRIVE Sim AI pipeline follows a similar process to reconstruct other 3D assets. Engineers can use the assets to reconstruct the current scene or place them in a larger library of assets to be used in any simulation.\nUsing the asset-harvesting pipeline is key to growing the DRIVE Sim library and ensuring it matches the diversity and distribution of the real world.\nAssets can be harvested from real-world data, turned into 3D objects and reused in other scenes. Here, the tow truck is reconstructed from the scene on the left and used in a different simulation shown on the right.\nScenarios\nScenarios are the events that take place during a simulation in an environment combined with assets.\nThe Neural Reconstruction Engine assigns AI-based behaviors to the actors in the scene, so that when presented with the original events, they behave precisely as they did in the real drive. However, since they have an AI behavior model, the figures in the simulation can respond and react to changes by the AV or other scene elements.\nBecause these scenarios are all occurring in simulation, they can also be manipulated to add new situations. Timing and location of events can be altered. Developers can even incorporate entirely new elements, synthetic or real, to make a scenario more challenging, such as the addition of a child chasing a ball to the scene below.\nSynthetic objects can be mixed with real-world scenarios.\nIntegration Into DRIVE Sim\nOnce the environment, assets and scenario have been extracted, they\u2019re reassembled in DRIVE Sim to create a 3D simulation of the recorded scene or mixed with other assets to create a completely new scene.\nDRIVE Sim provides the tools for developers to adjust dynamic and static objects, the vehicle\u2019s path, and the location, orientation and parameters of the vehicle sensors.\nThe same scenes in DRIVE Sim are also used to generate pre-labeled synthetic data to train perception systems. Randomizations are applied on top of recreated scenes to add diversity to the training data. Building scenes out of real-world data greatly reduces the sim-to-real gap.\nReconstructed scenes can be augmented with synthetic assets and used to produce new data with ground truth for training AV perception systems.\nThe ability to mix and match simulation formats is a significant advantage in comprehensively testing and validating AVs at scale. Engineers can manipulate events in a world that is responsive and matches their needs precisely.\nThe Neural Reconstruction Engine is the result of work by the research team at NVIDIA, and will be integrated into future releases of DRIVE Sim. This breakthrough will enable developers to take advantage of both physics-based and neural-driven simulation on the same cloud-based platform.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC 2022 | NVIDIA DRIVE | NVIDIA DRIVE Sim | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It demonstrated leadership in both throughput and speed in separate server and offline scenarios.\nNVIDIA H100 GPUs set new high watermarks on all workloads in the data center category.\nThe NVIDIA Hopper architecture delivered up to 4.5x more performance than NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs, which continue to provide overall leadership in MLPerf results.\nThanks in part to its Transformer Engine, Hopper excelled on the popular BERT model for natural language processing. It\u2019s among the largest and most performance-hungry of the MLPerf AI models.\nThese inference benchmarks mark the first public demonstration of H100 GPUs, which will be available later this year. The H100 GPUs will participate in future MLPerf rounds for training.\nA100 GPUs Show Leadership\nNVIDIA A100 GPUs, available today from major cloud service providers and systems manufacturers, continued to show overall leadership in mainstream performance on AI inference in the latest tests.\nA100 GPUs won more tests than any submission in data center and edge computing categories and scenarios. In June, the A100 also delivered overall leadership in MLPerf training benchmarks, demonstrating its abilities across the AI workflow.\nSince their July 2020 debut on MLPerf, A100 GPUs have advanced their performance by 6x, thanks to continuous improvements in NVIDIA AI software.\nNVIDIA AI is the only platform to run all MLPerf inference workloads and scenarios in data center and edge computing.\nUsers Need Versatile Performance\nThe ability of NVIDIA GPUs to deliver leadership performance on all major AI models makes users the real winners. Their real-world applications typically employ many neural networks of different kinds.\nFor example, an AI application may need to understand a user\u2019s spoken request, classify an image, make a recommendation and then deliver a response as a spoken message in a human-sounding voice. Each step requires a different type of AI model.\nThe MLPerf benchmarks cover these and other popular AI workloads and scenarios \u2014 computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems, speech recognition and more. The tests ensure users will get performance that\u2019s dependable and flexible to deploy.\nUsers rely on MLPerf results to make informed buying decisions, because the tests are transparent and objective. The benchmarks enjoy backing from a broad group that includes Amazon, Arm, Baidu, Google, Harvard, Intel, Meta, Microsoft, Stanford and the University of Toronto.\nOrin Leads at the Edge\nIn edge computing, NVIDIA Orin ran every MLPerf benchmark, winning more tests than any other low-power system-on-a-chip. And it showed\u00a0 up to a 50% gain in energy efficiency compared to its debut on MLPerf in April.\nIn the previous round, Orin ran up to 5x faster than the prior-generation Jetson AGX Xavier module, while delivering an average of 2x better energy efficiency.\nOrin delivered up to 50% gains in energy efficiency for AI inference at the edge.\nOrin integrates into a single chip an NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPU and a cluster of powerful Arm CPU cores. It\u2019s available today in the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin developer kit and production modules for robotics and autonomous systems, and supports the full NVIDIA AI software stack, including platforms for autonomous vehicles (NVIDIA Hyperion), medical devices (Clara Holoscan) and robotics (Isaac).\nBroad NVIDIA AI Ecosystem\nThe MLPerf results show NVIDIA AI is backed by the industry\u2019s broadest ecosystem in machine learning.\nMore than 70 submissions in this round ran on the NVIDIA platform. \u00a0For example, Microsoft Azure submitted results running NVIDIA AI on its cloud services.\nIn addition, 19 NVIDIA-Certified Systems appeared in this round from 10 systems makers, including ASUS, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro.\nTheir work shows users can get great performance with NVIDIA AI both in the cloud and in servers running in their own data centers.\nNVIDIA partners participate in MLPerf because they know it\u2019s a valuable tool for customers evaluating AI platforms and vendors. Results in the latest round demonstrate that the performance they deliver to users today will grow with the NVIDIA platform.\nAll the software used for these tests is available from the MLPerf repository, so anyone can get these world-class results. Optimizations are continuously folded into containers available on NGC, NVIDIA\u2019s catalog for GPU-accelerated software. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll also find NVIDIA TensorRT, used by every submission in this round to optimize AI inference.\nRead our Technical Blog for a deeper dive into the technology fueling NVIDIA\u2019s MLPerf performance.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Conversational AI | Hardware | Inference | Jetson | Machine Learning | NGC | NVIDIA A100 | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | Recommender Systems | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

GeForce RTX graphics cards have delivered previously unfathomable frame rates, our work with panel partner AU Optronics created ultra-high refresh rate, tear-free G-SYNC Esports monitors, and NVIDIA Reflex revolutionized the measurement and reduction of system latency with a suite of innovative tools for gamers and developers. Now, virtually all esports pros use GeForce RTX graphics cards and 240Hz+ esports monitors.\nProgress never stops, however, and competitive players always seek a new advantage. Today, that arrived with the launch of our new, beyond fast GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, which have the performance to deliver 360 FPS on 1440p 360Hz monitors arriving this fall, with as low as 10ms of system latency in top esports titles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you game on a GeForce PC or laptop, NVIDIA Reflex reduces system latency in over 40 games, including 8 of the top 10 competitive shooters. Another 8 Reflex games were just announced, including Overwatch 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed, Loopmancer, Scathe, SUPER PEOPLE, and there are many more in the pipeline. Read on for all the details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs & NVIDIA Reflex Make 1440p Competitive Gaming A Reality\nHigher rendering resolutions make graphics clearer and sharper, making enemies easier to identify and attack. Our research found that 1440p 27\u201d displays can improve aiming by up to 3% over traditional 1080p 24\u201d displays, when aiming at small targets, such as an enemy\u2019s head. For competitive gamers and esports professionals, 3% can mean the difference between victory and defeat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if 1440p is better, why hasn\u2019t everyone stepped up to the higher resolution? Simply, performance wasn\u2019t as high at 1440p, reducing responsiveness and display smoothness, negating the benefits 1440p offered.\nWith the launch of our new GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, frame rates are beyond fast, delivering 1440p 360Hz performance in leading esports games. Additionally, NVIDIA Reflex helps keep latency low and responsiveness high across a wider range of frame rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to step up your game, head to our NVIDIA Reflex compatible products page for a list of NVIDIA Reflex gaming monitors, NVIDIA Reflex-compatible mice, and already-released NVIDIA Reflex games.

It has mastered its conversational skills in the highly complex Korean language thanks to large language models (LLMs) \u2014 machine learning algorithms that can recognize, understand, predict and generate human languages based on huge text datasets.\nThe company\u2019s models are built using the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD data center infrastructure platform and the NeMo framework for training and deploying LLMs with billions of parameters.\nThe Korean language, known as Hangul, reliably shows up in lists of the world\u2019s most challenging languages. It includes four types of compound verbs, and words are often composed of two or more roots.\nKT \u2014 South Korea\u2019s leading mobile operator with over 22 million subscribers \u2014 improved the smart speaker\u2019s understanding of such words by developing LLMs. And through integration with Amazon Alexa, GiGA Genie can converse with users in English, too.\n\u201cWith transformer-based models, we\u2019ve achieved significant quality improvements for the GiGA Genie smart speaker, as well as our customer services platform AI Contact Center, or AICC,\u201d said Hwijung Ryu, LLM development team lead at KT.\nAICC is an all-in-one, cloud-based platform that offers AI voice agents and other customer service-related applications.\nIt can receive calls and provide requested information \u2014 or quickly connect customers to human agents for answers to more detailed inquiries. AICC without human intervention manages more than 100,000 calls daily across Korea, according to Ryu.\n\u201cLLMs enable GiGA Genie to gain better language understanding and generate more human-like sentences, and AICC to reduce consultation times by 15 seconds as it summarizes and classifies inquiry types more quickly,\u201d he added.\nTraining Large Language Models\nDeveloping LLMs can be an expensive, time-consuming process that requires deep technical expertise and full-stack technology investments.\nThe NVIDIA AI platform simplified and sped up this process for KT.\n\u201cWe trained our LLM models more effectively with NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD\u2019s powerful performance \u2014 as well as NeMo\u2019s optimized algorithms and 3D parallelism techniques,\u201d Ryu said. \u201cNeMo is continuously adopting new features, which is the biggest advantage we think it offers in improving our model accuracy.\u201d\n3D parallelism \u2014 a distributed training method in which an extremely large-scale deep learning model is partitioned across multiple devices \u2014 was crucial for training KT\u2019s LLMs. NeMo enabled the team to easily accomplish this task with the highest throughput, according to Ryu.\n\u201cWe considered using other platforms, but it was difficult to find an alternative that provides full-stack environments \u2014 from the hardware level to the inference level,\u201d he added. \u201cNVIDIA also provides exceptional expertise from product, engineering teams and more, so we easily solved several technical issues.\u201d\nUsing hyperparameter optimization tools in NeMo, KT trained its LLMs 2x faster than with other frameworks, Ryu said. These tools allow users to automatically find the best configurations for LLM training and inference, easing and speeding the development and deployment process.\nKT is also planning to use the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server to provide an optimized real-time inference service, as well as NVIDIA Base Command Manager to easily monitor and manage hundreds of nodes in its AI cluster.\n\u201cThanks to LLMs, KT can release competitive products faster than ever,\u201d Ryu said. \u201cWe also believe that our technology can drive innovation from other companies, as it can be used to improve their value and create innovative products.\u201d\nKT plans to release more than 20 natural language understanding and natural language generation APIs for developers in November. The application programming interfaces can be used for tasks including document summarization and classification, emotion recognition, and filtering of potentially inappropriate content.\nLearn more about breakthrough technologies for the era of AI and the metaverse at NVIDIA GTC, running online through Thursday, Sept. 22.\u00a0\nWatch NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote address in replay below:\n\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | Conversational AI | GTC 2022 | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA NeMo | Telecommunications \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

For example, if a human walked into a robot\u2019s direct route, the bot might stop, slow or shut down to avoid a collision.\nThis type of safety mechanism already exists in autonomous machines, per standard regulations. But reactive stops of an intelligent machine or factory line result in unplanned downtime, which for some manufacturers can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per hour.\nSecond, proactive safety is the identification of potential safety concerns before breaches happen. NVIDIA IGX is focused on enabling organizations to add this safety layer to intelligent environments, further protecting workers and saving costs. It delivers high-performance, proactive-safety capabilities that are built into its hardware and software.\nFor example, with IGX-powered proactive safety at play, cameras in the warehouse might see a human heading into the path of a robot. It could signal the bot to change routes and avoid being in the same field of movement, preventing the collision altogether. IGX can also alert employees and other robots in the area, rerouting them to eliminate the risk of a backup across the factory.\nAnd third, predictive safety is the anticipation of future exposure to safety threats based on past performance data. In this case, organizations can use simulation and digital twins to identify patterns of intersections or improve a factory layout to reduce the number of safety incidents.\nOne of the first companies to use IGX at the edge is Siemens, a technology leader in industrial automation and digitalization, which is working with NVIDIA on a vision for autonomous factories. Siemens is collaborating with NVIDIA to expand its work across industrial computing, including with digital twins and for the industrial metaverse.\nSiemens is already adding next-level perception into its edge-based applications through NVIDIA Metropolis. With millions of sensors in factories, Metropolis connects entire fleets of robots and IoT devices to bring AI into industrial environments, making it one of the key application frameworks for edge AI running on top of the IGX platform.\nZero-Trust Security, High Performance and Long-Term Support\nIn addition to safety requirements, edge AI deployments have unique security needs compared to systems in data centers or the cloud \u2014 since humans and machines operate side by side in edge environments.\nThe IGX platform has a hardened, end-to-end zero-trust security architecture that starts at the system level and expands through over-the-air updates from the cloud. Advanced networking and a dedicated security controller are paired with NVIDIA Fleet Command, which brings secure edge AI management and orchestration from the cloud.\nThe first product offering of the IGX platform is NVIDIA IGX Orin, the world\u2019s most powerful, compact and energy-efficient AI system for accelerating the development of autonomous industrial machines and medical devices.\nIGX Orin developer kits will be available early next year. Each includes an integrated GPU and CPU for high-performance AI compute, as well as an NVIDIA ConnectX-7 SmartNIC to deliver high-performance networking with ultra-low latency and advanced security.\nIGX also brings up to 10 years of full-stack support from NVIDIA and leading partners.\nLearn more about IGX and other technology breakthroughs by watching the latest GTC keynote address by NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang:\n\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Embedded Computing | GTC 2022 | Industrial and Manufacturing | Smart Spaces \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

This is particularly bad timing for Nvidia given that the pandemic buying spree ended just as the company\u2019s attempt to catch up on demand for its 3000-series of chips were coming to fruition. Needless to say, too much new inventory plus too much used inventory is terrible for a company\u2019s financial results, particularly when you\u2019re trying to clear the channel for a new series:\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang told me in a Stratechery Interview last week that the company didn\u2019t see this coming:\n\n  I don\u2019t think we could have seen it. I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve done anything different, but what I did learn from previous examples is that when it finally happens to you, just take the hard medicine and get it behind you\u2026We\u2019ve had two bad quarters and two bad quarters in the context of a company, it\u2019s frustrating for all the investors, it\u2019s difficult on all the employees.\n We\u2019ve been here before at Nvidia.\n  We just have to deal with it and not be overly emotional about it, realize how it happened, keep the company as agile as possible. But when the facts presented itself, we just made cold, hard decisions. We took care of our partners, we took care of our channel, we took care of making sure that everybody had plenty of time. By delaying Ada, we made sure that everybody had plenty of time for and we repriced all the products such that even in the context of Ada, even if Ada were available, the products that after it\u2019s been repriced is actually a really good value. I think we took care of as many things as we could, it resulted in two fairly horrific quarters. But I think in the grand scheme of things, we\u2019ll come right back so I think that was probably the lessons from the past.\n\nThis may be a bit generous; analysts like Tae Kim and Doug O\u2019Laughlin forecast the stock plunge earlier this year, although that was probably already too late to avoid this perfect storm of slowing PC sales and Ethereum\u2019s transition, given that Nvidia ordered all of those extra 3000-series GPUs in the middle of the pandemic (Huang also cited the increasing lead times for chips as a big reason why Nvidia got this so wrong).\nWhat is more concerning for Nvidia, though, is that while its inventory and Ethereum issues are the biggest drivers of its \u201cfairly horrific quarters\u201d, that is not the only valley its gaming business is navigating. I\u2019m reminded of John Bunyan\u2019s Pilgrim\u2019s Progress:\n\n  Now Christian had not gone far in this Valley of Humiliation before he was severely tested, for he noticed a very foul fiend coming over the field to meet him; his name was Apollyon [Destroyer].\n\nCall Apollyon inventory issues; Christian defeated him, as Nvidia eventually will.\n\n  Now at the end of this valley there was another called the Valley of the Shadow of Death; and it was necessary for Christian to pass through it because the way to the Celestial City was in that direction. Now this valley was a very solitary and lonely place. The prophet Jeremiah describes it as, \u201cA wilderness, a land of deserts and of pits, a land of drought and of the shadow of death, a land that no man\u201d (except a Christian) \u201cpasses through, and where no man dwells.\u201d\n\nWhat was striking about Nvidia\u2019s GTC keynote last week was the extent to which this allegory seems to fit Nvidia\u2019s ambitions: the company is setting off on what appears to be a fairly solitary journey to define the future of gaming, and it\u2019s not clear when or if the rest of the industry will come along. Moreover, the company is pursuing a similarly audacious strategy in the data center and with its metaverse ambitions as well: in all three cases the company is pursuing heights even greater than those achieved over the last two years, but the path is surprisingly uncertain.\nGaming in the Valley: Ray-Tracing and AI\nThe presentation of 3D games has long depended on a series of hacks, particularly in terms of lighting. First, a game determines what you actually see (i.e. there is no use rendering an object that is occluded by another); then the correct texture is applied to the object (i.e. a tree, or grass, or whatever else you might imagine). Finally light is applied based on the position of a pre-determined light source, with a shadow map on top of that. The complete scene is then translated into individual pixels and rendered onto your 2D screen; this process is known as rasterization.\nRay tracing handles light completely differently: instead of starting with a pre-determined light source and applying light and shadow maps, ray tracing starts with your eye (or more precisely, the camera through which you are viewing the scene). It then traces the line of sight to every pixel on the screen, bounces it off that pixel (based on what type of object it represents), and continues following that ray until it either hits a light source (and thus computes the lighting) or discards it. This produces phenomenally realistic lighting, particularly in terms of reflections and shadows. Look closely at these images from PC Magazine:\nLet\u2019s see how ray tracing can visually improve a game. I took the following screenshot pairs in Square Enix\u2019s Shadow of the Tomb Raider for PC, which supports ray-traced shadows on Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics cards. Specifically, look at the shadows on the ground.\nRasterized shadows\nRay-traced shadows\n[\u2026]The ray-traced shadows are softer and more realistic compared with the harsher rasterized versions. Their darkness varies depending on how much light an object is blocking and even within the shadow itself, while rasterization seems to give every object a hard edge. The rasterized shadows still don\u2019t look bad, but after playing the game with ray traced shadows, it\u2019s tough to go back.\n\nNvidia first announced API support for ray tracing back in 2009; however, few if any games used it because it is so computationally expensive (ray-tracing is used in movie CGI; however, those scenes can be rendered over hours or even days; games have to be rendered in real-time). That is why Nvidia introduced dedicated ray tracing hardware in its GeForce 2000-series line of cards (which were thus christened \u201cRTX\u201d) which came out in 2018. AMD went a different direction, adding ray-tracing capabilities to its core shader units (which also handle rasterization); this is slower than Nvidia\u2019s pure hardware solution, but it works, and, importantly, since AMD makes graphics cards for the PS5 and Xbox, it means that ray tracing support is now industry-wide. More and more games will support ray tracing going forward, although most applications are still fairly limited because of performance concerns.\nHere\u2019s the important thing about ray tracing, though: by virtue of calculating light dynamically, instead of via light and shadow maps, it is something developers can get \u201cfor free.\u201d A game or 3D environment that depended completely on ray tracing should be easier and cheaper to develop; more importantly, it means that environments could change in dynamic ways that the developer never anticipated, all while having more realistic lighting than the most labored-over pre-drawn environment.\nThis is particularly compelling in two emerging contexts: the first is in simulation games like Minecraft. With ray tracing it will be increasingly realistic to have highly detailed 3D-worlds that are constructed on the fly and lit perfectly. Future games could go further: the keynote opened with a game called RacerX where every single part of the game was fully simulated, including objects; the same sort of calculations for light were used for in-game physics as well.\nThe second context is a future of AI-generated content I discussed in DALL-E, the Metaverse, and Zero Marginal Cost Content. All of those textures I noted above are currently drawn by hand; as graphical capabilities \u2014 largely driven by Nvidia \u2014 have increased, so has the cost of creating new games, thanks to the need to create high resolution assets. One can imagine a future where asset creation is fully automated and done on the fly, and then lit appropriately via ray tracing.\nFor now, though Nvidia is already using AI to render images: the company also announced version 3 of its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology, which predicts and pre-renders frames, meaning they don\u2019t have to be computed at all (previous versions of DLSS predicted and pre-rendered individual pixels). Moreover, Nvidia is, as with ray-tracing, backing up DLSS with dedicated hardware to make it much more performant. These new approaches, matched with dedicated cores on Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, make Nvidia very well-placed for an entirely new paradigm in not just gaming but immersive 3D experiences generally (like a metaverse).\nHere\u2019s the problem, though: all of that dedicated hardware comes at a cost. Nvidia\u2019s new GPUs are big chips \u2014 the top-of-the-line AD102, sold as the RTX 4090, is a fully integrated system-on-a-chip that measures 608.4mm2 on TSMCs N4 process;1 the top-of-the-line Navi 31 chip in AMD\u2019s upcoming RDNA 3 graphics line, in comparison, is a chiplet design with a 308mm2 graphics chip on TSMC\u2019s N5 process,2 plus six 37.5mm2 memory chips on TSMC\u2019s N6 process.3 In short, Nvidia\u2019s chip is much larger (which means much more expensive), and it\u2019s on a slightly more modern process (which likely costs more). Dylan Patel explains the implications at SemiAnalysis:\n\n  In short, AMD saves a lot on die costs by forgoing AI and ray tracing fixed function accelerators and moving to smaller dies with advanced packaging. The advanced packaging cost is up significantly with AMD\u2019s RDNA 3 N31 and N32 GPUs, but the small fan-out RDL packages are still very cheap relative to wafer and yield costs. Ultimately, AMD\u2019s increased packaging costs are dwarfed by the savings they get from disaggregating memory controllers/infinity cache, utilizing cheaper N6 instead of N5, and higher yields\u2026Nvidia likely has a worse cost structure in traditional rasterization gaming performance for the first time in nearly a decade.\n\nThis is the valley that Nvidia is entering. Gamers were immediately up-in-arms after Nvidia\u2019s keynote because of the 4000-series\u2019 high prices, particularly when the fine print on Nvidia\u2019s website revealed that one of the tier-two chips Nvidia announced was much more akin to a rebranded tier-3 chip, with the suspicion being that Nvidia was playing marketing games to obscure a major price increase. Nvidia\u2019s cards may have the best performance, and are without question the best placed for a future of ray tracing and AI-generated content, but at the cost of being the best values for games as they are played today. Reaching the heights of purely simulated virtual worlds requires making it through a generation of charging for capabilities that most gamers don\u2019t yet care about.\nAI in the Valley: Systems, not Chips\nOne reason to be optimistic about Nvidia\u2019s approach in gaming is that the company made a similar bet on the future when it invented shaders; I explained shaders after last year\u2019s GTC in a Daily Update:\n\n  Nvidia first came to prominence with the Riva and TNT line of video cards that were hard-coded to accelerate 3D libraries like Microsoft\u2019s Direct3D:\n \n  The GeForce line, though, was fully programmable via a type of computer program called a \u201cshader\u201d (I explained more about shaders in this Daily Update). This meant that a GeForce card could be improved even after it was manufactured, simply by programming new shaders (perhaps to support a new version of Direct3D, for example).\n \n  [\u2026]More importantly, shaders didn\u2019t necessarily need to render graphics; any sort of software \u2014 ideally programs with simple calculations that could be run in parallel \u2014 could be programmed as shaders; the trick was figuring out how to write them, which is where CUDA came in. I explained in 2020\u2019s Nvidia\u2019s Integration Dreams:\n\n    This increased level of abstraction meant the underlying graphics processing unit could be much simpler, which meant that a graphics chip could have many more of them. The most advanced versions of Nvidia\u2019s just-announced GeForce RTX 30 Series, for example, has an incredible 10,496 cores.\n    This level of scalability makes sense for video cards because graphics processing is embarrassingly parallel: a screen can be divided up into an arbitrary number of sections, and each section computed individually, all at the same time. This means that performance scales horizontally, which is to say that every additional core increases performance. It turns out, though, that graphics are not the only embarrassingly parallel problem in computing\u2026\n    This is why Nvidia transformed itself from a modular component maker to an integrated maker of hardware and software; the former were its video cards, and the latter was a platform called CUDA. The CUDA platform allows programmers to access the parallel processing power of Nvidia\u2019s video cards via a wide number of languages, without needing to understand how to program graphics.\n  \n  Now the Nvidia \u201cstack\u201d had three levels:\n \n  The important thing to understand about CUDA, though, is that it didn\u2019t simply enable external programmers to write programs for Nvidia chips; it enabled Nvidia itself.\n\nMuch of this happened out of desperation; Huang explained in a Stratechery interview last spring that introducing shaders, which he saw as essential for the future, almost killed the company:\n\n  The disadvantage of programmability is that it\u2019s less efficient. As I mentioned before, a fixed function thing is just more efficient. Anything that\u2019s programmable, anything that could do more than one thing just by definition carries a burden that is not necessary for any particular one task, and so the question is \u201cWhen do we do it?\u201d Well, there was also an inspiration at the time that everything looks like OpenGL Flight Simulator. Everything was blurry textures and trilinear mipmapped, and there was no life to anything, and we felt that if you didn\u2019t bring life to the medium and you didn\u2019t allow the artist to be able to create different games and different genres and tell different stories, eventually the medium would cease to exist. We were driven by simultaneously this ambition of wanting to create a more programmable palette so that the game and the artist could do something great with it. At the same time, we also were driven to not go out of business someday because it would be commoditized. So somewhere in that kind of soup, we created programmable shaders, so I think the motivation to do it was very clear. The punishment afterwards was what we didn\u2019t expect.\n What was that?\n  Well, the punishment is all of a sudden, all the things that we expected about programmability and the overhead of unnecessary functionality because the current games don\u2019t need it, you created something for the future, which means that the current applications don\u2019t benefit. Until you have new applications, your chip is just too expensive and the market is competitive.\n\nNvidia survived because their ability to do direct acceleration was still the best; it thrived in the long run because they took it upon themselves to build the entire CUDA infrastructure to leverage shaders. This is where that data center growth comes from; Huang explained:\n\n  On the day that you become processor company, you have to internalize that this processor architecture is brand new. There\u2019s never been a programmable pixel shader or a programmable GPU processor and a programming model like that before, and so we internalize. You have to internalize that this is a brand new programming model and everything that\u2019s associated with being a program processor company or a computing platform company had to be created. So we had to create a compiler team, we have to think about SDKs, we have to think about libraries, we had to reach out to developers and evangelize our architecture and help people realize the benefits of it, and if not, even come close to practically doing it ourselves by creating new libraries that make it easy for them to port their application onto our libraries and get to see the benefits of it.\n\nThe first reason to recount this story is to note the parallels between the cost of shader complexity and the cost of ray tracing and AI in terms of current games; the second is to note that Nvidia\u2019s approach to problem-solving has always been to do everything itself. Back then that meant developing CUDA for programming those shaders; today it means building out entire systems for AI.\nHuang said during last week\u2019s keynote:\n\n\n  Nvidia is dedicated to advancing science and industry with accelerated computing. The days of no-work performance scaling are over. Unaccelerated software will no longer enjoy performance scaling without a disproportionate increase in costs. With nearly three decades of a singular focus, Nvidia is expert at accelerating software and scaling computer by a 1,000,000x, going well beyond Moore\u2019s Law.\n  Accelerated computing is a full-stack challenge. It demands deep understanding of the problem domain, optimizing across every layer of computing, and all three chips: CPU, GPU, and DPU. Scaling across multi-GPUs on multi-nodes is a datacenter-scale challenge, and requires treating the network and storage as part of the computing fabric, and developers and customers want to run software in many places, from PCs to super-computing centers, enterprise data centers, cloud, to edge. Different applications want to run in different locations, and in different ways.\n  Today, we\u2019re going to talk about accelerated computing across the stack. New chips and how they will boost performance, far beyond the number of transistors, new libraries, and how it accelerates critical workloads to science and industry, new domain-specific frameworks, to help develop performant and easily deployable software. And new platforms, to let you deploy your software securely, safely, and with order-of-magnitude gains.\n\nIn Huang\u2019s view, simply having fast chips is no longer enough for the workloads of the future: that is why Nvidia is building out entire data centers using all of its own equipment. Here again, though, a future where every company needs accelerated computing generally, and Nvidia to build it for them specifically \u2014 Nvidia\u2019s Celestial City \u2014 is in contrast to the present where the biggest users of Nvidia chips in the data center are hyperscalers who have their own systems already in place.\nA company like Meta, for example, doesn\u2019t need Nvidia\u2019s networking; they invented their own. What they do need are a lot of massively parallelizable chips to train their machine learning algorithms on, which means they have to pay Nvidia and their high margins. Small wonder that Meta, like Google before them, is building its own chip.\nThis is the course that all of the biggest companies will likely follow: they don\u2019t need an Nvidia system, they need a chip that works in their system for their needs. That is why Nvidia is so invested in the democratization of AI and accelerated computing: the long term key to scale will be in building systems for everyone but the largest players. The trick to making it through the valley will be in seeing that ecosystem develop before Nvidia\u2019s current big customers stop buying Nvidia\u2019s expensive chips. Huang once saw that 3D accelerators would be commoditized and took a leap with shaders; one gets the sense he has the same fear with chips and is thus leaping into systems.\nMetaverse in the Valley: Omniverse Nucleus\nIn the interview last spring I asked Huang if Nvidia would ever build a cloud service;\n\n  If we ever do services, we will run it all over the world on the GPUs that are in everybody\u2019s clouds, in addition to building something ourselves, if we have to. One of the rules of our company is to not squander the resources of our company to do something that already exists. If something already exists, for example, an x86 CPU, we\u2019ll just use it. If something already exists, we\u2019ll partner with them, because let\u2019s not squander our rare resources on that. And so if something already exists in the cloud, we just absolutely use that or let them do it, which is even better. However, if there\u2019s something that makes sense for us to do and it doesn\u2019t make for them to do, we even approach them to do it, other people don\u2019t want to do it then we might decide to do it. We try to be very selective about the things that we do, we\u2019re quite determined not to do things that other people do.\n\nIt turns out there was something no one else wanted to do, and that was create a universal database for 3D objects for use in what Nvidia is calling the Omniverse. These objects could be highly detailed millimeter-precise objects for use in manufacturing or supply chains, or they could be fantastical objects and buildings generated for virtual worlds; in Huang\u2019s vision they would be available to anyone building on Omniverse Nucleus.\nHere the Celestial City is a world of 3D experiences used across industry and entertainment \u2014 an Omniverse of metaverses, if you will, all connected to Nvidia\u2019s cloud \u2014 and it\u2019s ambitious enough to make Mark Zuckerberg blush! This valley, by the same token, seems even longer and darker: not only do all of these assets and 3D experiences need to be created, but entire markets need to be convinced of their utility and necessity. Building a cloud for a world that doesn\u2019t yet exist is to reach for heights still out of sight.\n\nThere certainly is no questioning Huang and Nvidia\u2019s ambition, although some may quibble with the wisdom of navigating three valleys all at once; it\u2019s perhaps appropriate that the stock is in a valley itself, above and beyond that perfect storm in gaming.\nWhat is worth considering, though, is that the number one reason why Nvidia customers \u2014 both in the consumer market and the enterprise one \u2014 get frustrated with the company is price: Nvidia GPUs are expensive, and the company\u2019s margins \u2014 other than the last couple of quarters \u2014 are very high. Pricing power in Nvidia\u2019s case, though, is directly downstream from Nvidia\u2019s own innovations, both in terms of sheer performance in established workloads, and also in its investment in the CUDA ecosystem creating the tools for entirely new ones.\nIn other words, Nvidia has earned the right to be hated by taking the exact sort of risks in the past it is embarking on now. Suppose, for example, the expectation for all games in the future is not just ray tracing but full-on simulation of all particles: Nvidia\u2019s investment in hardware will mean it dominates the era just as it did the rasterized one. Similarly, if AI applications become democratized and accessible to all enterprises, not just the hyperscalers, then it is Nvidia who will be positioned to pick up the entirety of the long tail. And, if we get to a world of metaverses, then Nvidia\u2019s head start on not just infrastructure but on the essential library of objects necessary to make that world real (objects that will be lit by ray-tracing in AI-generated spaces, of course), will make it the most essential infrastructure in the space.\nThese bets may not all pay off; I do, though, appreciate the audacity of the vision, and won\u2019t begrudge the future margins that may result in the Celestial City if Nvidia makes it through the valley.\nTSMC\u2019s 3rd generation 5nm process\u00a0\u21a9TSMC\u2019s 1st generation 5nm process\u00a0\u21a9TSMC\u2019s 3rd generation 7nm process\u00a0\u21a9ShareFacebookTwitterLinkedInEmail\n\n\n\nGet notified about new Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease verify your email address to proceed.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelatedNvidia On the MountaintopDateMonday, August 28, 2023Nvidia\u2019s Integration DreamsDateTuesday, September 15, 2020Nvidia Waves and MoatsDateTuesday, March 19, 2024\n\u2190Sharp Tech and Stratechery Plus\nMeta Meets Microsoft\u2192\n\n\nSearch\n\nStratechery Plus\nUpdates\n\n\nIntel\u2019s New CEO, Reevaluating Gelsinger, Lip-Bu Tan and Cadence\nTuesday, March 18, 2025\n\nMetallica on Vision Pro, Non-Immersive Immersive Video, Ping and AI\nMonday, March 17, 2025\n\nAn Interview with Tailscale Co-Founder and CEO Avery Pennarun\nThursday, March 13, 2025\n\n\nView All\n\n\n\nStratechery Plus\nPodcasts\n\nA 2021 Redraft: Cade\u2019s Revival, Mobley\u2019s Ascent, Redrafting Multiple Jalens, Sengun Four Years Later, and MoreGreatest Of All Talk | Mar 18A 2021 Redraft: Cade\u2019s Revival, Mobley\u2019s Ascent, Redrafting Multiple Jalens, Sengun Four Years Later, and MoreApple's PreciousnessDithering | Mar 18Apple's Preciousness(Preview) Should Apple Buy Perplexity?, What Apple Could Learn from IBM, Vision Pro and Its VaporwareSharp Tech | Mar 17(Preview) Should Apple Buy Perplexity?, What Apple Could Learn from IBM, Vision Pro and Its Vaporware\n\n\nStratechery Plus\nInterviews\n\n\nAn Interview with Tailscale Co-Founder and CEO Avery Pennarun\nThursday, March 13, 2025\n\nAn Interview with Michael Nathanson About the Streaming Endgame\nThursday, March 6, 2025\n\nAn Interview with Benedict Evans About AI Unknowns\nThursday, February 27, 2025\n\n\nView All\n\n\nMore by Ben Thompson\nYear in Review\nThe most popular and most important posts on Stratechery by year.\n\nView All\n\nAll Articles\nExplore all free articles on Stratechery.\n\nView All\n\nAll Content\nExplore all posts on Stratechery.\n\nView All\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStratechery Plus\nUpdateS\n\n\nIntel\u2019s New CEO, Reevaluating Gelsinger, Lip-Bu Tan and Cadence\nTuesday, March 18, 2025\n\nMetallica on Vision Pro, Non-Immersive Immersive Video, Ping and AI\nMonday, March 17, 2025\n\nAn Interview with Tailscale Co-Founder and CEO Avery Pennarun\nThursday, March 13, 2025\n\n\nView All\n\n\n\n\nStratechery Plus\nPodcasts\n\nA 2021 Redraft: Cade\u2019s Revival, Mobley\u2019s Ascent, Redrafting Multiple Jalens, Sengun Four Years Later, and MoreGreatest Of All Talk | Mar 18A 2021 Redraft: Cade\u2019s Revival, Mobley\u2019s Ascent, Redrafting Multiple Jalens, Sengun Four Years Later, and MoreApple's PreciousnessDithering | Mar 18Apple's Preciousness(Preview) Should Apple Buy Perplexity?, What Apple Could Learn from IBM, Vision Pro and Its VaporwareSharptech | Mar 17(Preview) Should Apple Buy Perplexity?, What Apple Could Learn from IBM, Vision Pro and Its Vaporware\n\n\nStratechery Plus\nInterviews\n\n\nAn Interview with Tailscale Co-Founder and CEO Avery Pennarun\nThursday, March 13, 2025\n\nAn Interview with Michael Nathanson About the Streaming Endgame\nThursday, March 6, 2025\n\nAn Interview with Benedict Evans About AI Unknowns\nThursday, February 27, 2025\n\n\nView All\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stratechery LLC 2025 | Terms of Service | Privacy Policy\nProudly powered by WordPress.

There are millions of modders, and billions of mods are downloaded each\u00a0year. Mod DB and Nexus Mods are the Internet\u2019s premier mod repositories, hosting over 400,000 mods for 1,800 games. Mods enhance graphics as faster GPUs are released, extend a game\u2019s lifespan with new content, expand their audience with total gameplay conversions, and keep games fresh for years after official DLC and update support has concluded. They\u2019re an important aspect of PC games, and have a noticeable impact on the long-term sales and popularity of a title. In fact, the tactical shooter, MOBA, and battle royale genres all started as mods. Today, 9 of the 10 most popular competitive games owe their existence to mods.\nBethesda Softworks\u2019 The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition are the most modded games, and for each title the most downloaded mods are graphical, leveraging the power of modern GPUs to enhance games in ways developers couldn\u2019t at the time.\nCrafting graphics mods isn\u2019t easy, however. Game-specific tools must be invented to actually mod a game, new art must be created for every asset, programming knowledge is often required to add modern effects like displacement mapping, and the final mod must be packaged correctly for others to install.\nFurthermore, many classic games are challenging or impossible to mod because of hard to access files, and a lack of official mod tools. Enthusiast programmers can often pool their talents to overcome these arduous challenges for the most popular games, but for every game that gets this treatment there are hundreds that don\u2019t. Without tools, one simply can\u2019t load updated textures and models into the game.\nAnd if you wish to add true ray tracing (instead of screen space mods), there are several insurmountable barriers: classic games are 32-bit and don\u2019t support ray tracing; 32-bit programs can only use a max of 3GB of RAM, which isn\u2019t enough for the high-res, enhanced assets needed to take full advantage of ray tracing; ray tracing APIs don\u2019t exist for older iterations of DirectX; converting 32-bit/x86 code to modern x64 code, to insert ray tracing support, requires incalculable amounts of time without source code. PCGamingWiki, an invaluable resource, tracks 32-bit games and those that have been ported or patched - of 7,500 known titles, only 28 have been converted to a moddable format, to any degree.\nFor an example of the effort required to get a classic game upgraded with ray tracing, our Quake II RTX mod took a team of NVIDIA engineers, artists and QA experts months to develop, with the benefit of source code and others\u2019 mods and tools. Repeating this process time and again for the many classic games that people love simply isn\u2019t possible, so we\u2019ve taken a different approach.\nEnter NVIDIA RTX Remix, a free modding platform built on NVIDIA Omniverse that enables modders to quickly create and share #RTXON mods for classic games, each with enhanced materials, full ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 3, and NVIDIA Reflex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing NVIDIA RTX Remix\nNVIDIA RTX Remix will launch soon, making it easy to remaster supported DirectX 8 and DirectX 9 games with fixed function graphics pipelines.\nIn a compatible game, press the hotkey and the surrounding scene is captured, as you can see here in a test scene from Bethesda Softworks\u2019 The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, one of Mod DB and Nexus Mods\u2019 most-modded games. Suddenly, one of the hardest challenges in modding is easily solved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Remix is able to capture the textures, geometry, lighting, and cameras thanks to an innovative, custom D3D9 Runtime called the RTX Remix Runtime. Classic games like Morrowind use the D3D9 runtime to send draw calls (rendering instructions) to the GPU. RTX Remix Runtime intercepts those draw calls, interprets them into distinct assets, and reassembles those assets into an identical scene. From there, RTX Remix converts the assets and scene into the widely adopted Universal Scene Description (USD) open 3D framework, which is the foundation of the NVIDIA Omniverse platform for building and operating custom 3D pipelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify classic games, including Bethesda Softworks\u2019 The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, to add ray tracing, DLSS 3, enhanced textures, and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince RTX Remix is built on NVIDIA Omniverse, these USD game assets can easily be imported into the RTX Remix application, or any other Omniverse app or connector, including game industry-standard apps such as Adobe Substance 3D Painter, Autodesk Maya, 3ds Max, Blender, SideFX Houdini, and Epic Games\u2019 Unreal Engine. Mod teams can collaboratively improve and replace assets, and visualize each change, as the asset syncs from the Omniverse connector to Remix\u2019s viewport. This powerful workflow is going to change how modding communities approach the games they mod, giving modders a single unified workflow that allows them to carry their knowledge forward to a variety of titles, enabling the remastering of a diverse set of games without having to learn a multitude of proprietary tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen remastering assets for use with ray tracing, each texture and surface needs physically-based rendering (PBR) materials, to allow them to interact naturally with ray-traced light. For instance, glass reflects the world with clear detail, while laminate wood flooring has rough, coarse reflections. And stone, though without visible reflections, is still capable of bouncing light and having an effect on the scene. Classic games are generally built with simple color textures that lack any of these properties.\nBeyond textures, your surfaces need new details, too. To enhance a classic game, a normal map is required, or an entirely new surface with genuine geometric detail that\u2019s been hand-crafted by the modder, both of which take a fair bit of time to make.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay Tracing & Original Textures on left, Ray Tracing & AI Enhanced Textures on right. Click here to view the comparison in 4K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Remix simplifies and accelerates the art remastering process using AI. AI Super Resolution increases the resolution of the extracted textures by up to 4X, turning 1080p-class textures into higher-quality 4K assets. And AI Physically Based Materials scans the game\u2019s environment to add PBR properties to all extracted assets. As demonstrated by these screenshots from TaleWorlds Entertainment's Mount & Blade, a cobblestone floor immediately goes from a flat surface with a basic texture, to a detailed stone surface with a roughness map that interacts with light realistically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaleWorlds Entertainment's Mount & Blade. The original game is seen on the left, and on the right the game running in RTX Remix with Ray Tracing & AI Enhanced Textures. Click here to view the comparison in 4K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the image below from Bethesda Softworks\u2019 The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, NVIDIA artists used RTX Remix to remaster a scene. Our team loaded into a shared RTX Remix project via Omniverse, and as one member updated an object\u2019s material properties, or an asset\u2019s mesh in Omniverse-connected applications like Substance or Maya, the game scene would sync in the Remix viewport, making collaboration a breeze. A second artist could then spend their time in the Remix application, meticulously moving each completed asset to its perfect position, and relighting the scene with the rebuilt objects in mind. It\u2019s that simple, enabling round-the-clock collaboration and development with a mod team spread across the planet. Previously, you\u2019d need to wait for one person\u2019s work to be finished and sent. Now, there are no delays, and another can pick up where you left off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTextures and models are just one part of the remastering process, however, as classic games were made in a time before advanced lighting techniques, often relying on invisible lighting sources to illuminate scenes. RTX Remix can convert legacy lights into realistic ones, allowing ray tracing to relight a scene with soft and realistic shadows.\nFurthermore, RTX Remix provides immense flexibility to view lighting and shadows in isolation through a white mode, and with little effort, create new lights that help bring realistic global illumination, shadows, ambient occlusion, and reflections to a game. A modder can even create dynamic lights, and introduce volumetrics to make for a more immersive scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith RTX Remix, we took our Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind scene from the year 2002 and quickly gave it state of the art ray-traced and physically-based features. That\u2019s the power of RTX Remix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Remix goes beyond our work for prior remasters like Quake II RTX, introducing new technologies that further enhance ray tracing. One of the most impactful new features, NVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI), enables you to add millions of dynamic lights to your game environments without worrying about performance or resource constraints. Imagine thousands of tiny LEDs, sci-fi control panels, Times Square billboards, or even exploding fireballs. RTXDI makes this possible while rendering in real time, enabling geometry of any shape to emit light, cast appropriate shadows, and move freely and dynamically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reservoir Spatio Temporal Importance Resampling Global Illumination (ReSTIR GI) is a new global illumination technique that calculates per-pixel correct indirect lighting for multiple bounces. It allows indirect light to bathe a scene, and illuminate dark corners that are not even lit directly, in a highly performant manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Real Time Denoisers (NRD) is a spatio-temporal ray tracing denoising library that assists in denoising low ray-per-pixel signals with real-time performance. Compared to previous-gen denoisers, NRD improves quality and ensures the computationally intensive ray-traced output is noise-free, without performance tradeoffs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis combination of ray tracing technologies comes together to create an incredibly accurate ray tracer by modern game standards, far beyond our prior titles, as well as what is possible with screen space technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the RTX Remix Mod is ready, it\u2019s easy to export and share with fellow gamers online - they simply download the mod and drop it into the game\u2019s directory alongside the .exe and launch the game. The NVIDIA RTX Remix Runtime does the rest, replacing the old rendering APIs and systems with RTX Remix Runtime\u2019s 64-bit Vulkan renderer, and upgrading the visuals on the fly. The player also benefits from the instant addition of NVIDIA DLSS 3, for incredibly smooth frame rates, and NVIDIA Reflex, which improves responsiveness by reducing end-to-end system latency. And best of all, NVIDIA RTX Remix Mods work alongside existing gameplay mods downloaded from Nexus Mods, Mod DB and other sites, giving games with rich modded content an instant ray-traced upgrade.\nEvery RTX Mod also comes packaged with the RTX Remix Runtime editor, giving players a multitude of options to customize their experience in real-time. Whether you want to tweak material properties to make the world shiny, customize lighting intensity, add fog and volumetrics, or incorporate post-processing effects like bloom and motion blur, the RTX Remix Runtime has you covered. Advanced users can even activate diagnostic and heuristic tools to highlight every changed asset in a RTX Mod, enabling a collaborative mod team to easily review an in-progress mod as they play, leading to a better public release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind modified in real-time to add fog and volumetrics, using the NVIDIA RTX Remix Runtime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortal with RTX, Made Using NVIDIA RTX Remix\nTo demonstrate the power of RTX Remix, we\u2019ve created a Portal with RTX DLC that reimagines Valve\u2019s classic game.

It\u2019s striving to create a powerful railway system in which trains are automated, safely run with less headway between each other and are optimally steered through the network.\nIn collaboration with NVIDIA, DSD is beginning to build the first country-scale digital twin to fully simulate automatic train operation across an entire network. That means creating a photorealistic and physically accurate emulation of the entire rail system. It will include tracks running through cities and countrysides, and many details from sources such as station platform measurements and vehicle sensors.\nUsing the AI-enabled digital twin created with NVIDIA Omniverse, DSD can develop highly capable perception and incident prevention and management systems to optimally detect and react to irregular situations during day-to-day railway operation.\n\u201cWith NVIDIA technologies, we\u2019re able to begin realizing the vision of a fully automated train network,\u201d said Ruben Schilling, who leads the perception group at DB Netz, part of Deutsche Bahn. The envisioned future railway system improves the capacity, quality and efficiency of the network.\nThis is the basis for satisfied passengers and cargo customers, leading to more traffic on the tracks and thereby reducing the carbon footprint of the mobility sector.\nData, Data and More Data\nCreating a digital twin at such a large scale is a massive undertaking. It needs a custom-built 3D pipeline that connects computer-aided design datasets that are built, for example, within the Siemens JT ecosystem with DSD\u2019s high-definition 3D maps and various simulation tools. Using the Universal Scene Description 3D framework, DSD can connect and combine data sources into a single shared virtual model.\nWith its network perfectly synchronized with the real world, DSD can run optimization tests and \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios to test and validate changes in the railway system, such as reactions to unforeseen situations.\nRunning on NVIDIA OVX, the computing system for running Omniverse simulations, DSD will be able to operate the persistent simulation, which is regularly improved by data stream updates from the physical world.\nWatch the demo to see the digital twin in action:\n\nFuture computer vision-powered systems could continually perform route observation and incident recognition, automatically warning of and reacting to potential hazards.\nThe AI sensor models will be trained and optimized with a combination of real-world and synthetic data, some of which will be generated by the Omniverse Replicator software development kit framework. This will ensure models can perceive, plan and act when faced with everyday and unexpected scenarios.\nThe Future of Rail\nWith its pioneering approach to rail network optimization, DSD is contributing to the future of Europe\u2019s rail system and industry development. Sharing its data pool across countries allows for continuous improvement and deployment across future vehicles, resulting in the highest possible quality while reducing costs.\nWatch the GTC keynote on demand to see all of NVIDIA\u2019s latest announcements, and register free for the conference, running through Thursday, Sept. 22, to explore how digital twins are transforming industries.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: Artificial Intelligence | GTC 2022 | NVIDIA in Europe | Omniverse | Omniverse Enterprise | Transportation | Universal Scene Description \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

In-vehicle technology companies Cerence, Smart Eye, Rightware and DSP Concepts are now using the platform to deliver intelligent features for every vehicle occupant.\nThese partners are joining a diverse ecosystem of companies developing on DRIVE IX, including Soundhound and Jungo, providing cutting-edge solutions for any in-vehicle need.\nDRIVE IX provides an open software stack for cockpit solution providers to build and deploy features that will turn personal vehicles into interactive environments, enabling intelligent assistants, graphic user interfaces and immersive media and entertainment.\nIntelligent Assistants\nAI isn\u2019t just transforming the way people drive, but also how they interact with cars.\nUsing speech, gestures and advanced graphical user interfaces, passengers can communicate with the vehicle through an AI assistant as naturally as they would with a human.\nAn intelligent assistant will help to operate vehicle functions more intuitively, warn passengers in critical situations and provide services such as giving local updates like the weather forecast, making reservations and phone calls, and managing calendars.\nConversational AI Interaction\nSoftware partner Cerence is enabling AI-powered, voice-based interaction with the Cerence Assistant, its intelligent in-car assistant platform.\nCerence Assistant uses sensor data to serve drivers throughout their daily journeys, notifying them, for example, when fuel or battery levels are low and navigating to the nearest gas or charging station.\nIt features robust speech recognition, natural language understanding and text-to-speech capabilities, enhancing the driver experience.\nCourtesy of Cerence\nUsing DRIVE IX, it can empower both embedded and cloud-based natural language processing on the same architecture, ensuring drivers have access to important capabilities regardless of connectivity.\nCerence Assistant also supports major global markets and related languages, and is customizable for brand-specific speech recognition and personalization.\nGesture Recognition\nIn addition to speech, passengers can interact with AI assistants via gesture, which relies on interior sensing technologies.\nSmart Eye is a global leader in AI-based driver monitoring and interior sensing solutions. Its production driver-monitoring system is already in 1 million vehicles on the roads around the world, and will be incorporated in the upcoming Polestar 3, set to be revealed in October.\nWorking with DRIVE IX, Smart Eye\u2019s technology makes it possible to detect eye movements, facial expressions, body posture and gestures, bringing insight into people\u2019s behavior, activities and mood.\nCourtesy of Smart Eye\nUsing NVIDIA GPU technology, Smart Eye has been able to speed up its cabin-monitoring system \u2014 which consists of 10 deep neural networks running in parallel \u2014 by more than 10x.\nThis interior sensing is critical for safety \u2014 ensuring driver attention is on the road when it should be and detecting left-behind children or pets \u2014 and it customizes and enhances the entire mobility experience for comfort, wellness and entertainment.\nGraphical User Interface\nAI assistants can communicate relevant information easily and clearly with high-resolution graphical interfaces. Using DRIVE IX, Rightware is creating a seamless visual experience across all cockpit and infotainment domains.\nCaption: Courtesy of Rightware\nRightware\u2019s automotive human-machine interface tool Kanzi One helps designers bring amazing real-time 3D graphical user interfaces into the car and hides the underlying operating system and framework complexity. Automakers can completely customize the vehicle\u2019s user interface with Kanzi One, providing a brand-specific signature UI.\nEnhancing visual user interfaces by audio features is equally important for interacting with the vehicle. The Audio Weaver development platform from DSP Concepts can be integrated into the DRIVE IX advanced sound engine. It provides a sound design toolchain and audio framework to graphically design features.\nCourtesy of DSP Concepts.\nCreators and sound artists can design a car- and brand-specific sound experience without the hassle of writing complex code for low-level audio features from scratch.\nDesigning in Simulation\nWith NVIDIA DRIVE Sim on Omniverse, developers can integrate, refine and test all these new features in the virtual world before implementing them in vehicles.\nInterior sensing companies can build driver- or occupant-monitoring models in the cockpit using the DRIVE Replicator synthetic-data generation tool on DRIVE Sim. Partners providing content for vehicle displays can first develop on a rich, simulated screen configuration.\n\nAccess to this virtual vehicle platform can significantly accelerate end-to-end development of intelligent in-vehicle technology.\nBy combining the flexibility of DRIVE IX with leading in-cabin solutions providers, spending time in the car can become a luxury rather than a chore.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC 2022 | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But bringing these avatars to life can be incredibly challenging, as traditional methods typically require expensive equipment, specific expertise and time-consuming workflows.\n\nThe Violet demo showcases how Omniverse ACE eases avatar development, delivering all the AI building blocks necessary to create, customize and deploy interactive avatars. Whether taking restaurant orders or answering questions about the universe, these AI assistants are easily customizable for virtually any industry, and can help organizations enhance existing workflows and unlock new business opportunities.\nWatch the video below to see Violet interact with users, respond to speech prompts and make intelligent recommendations:\n\nHow Omniverse ACE Brings Violet to Life\u00a0\nThe demo showcases Violet as a fully rigged avatar with basic animation. To create Violet, NVIDIA\u2019s creative team used the company\u2019s Unified Compute Framework, a fully accelerated framework that enables developers to combine optimized and accelerated microservices into real-time AI applications. UCF helped the team build a graph of microservices for Violet that were deployed in the cloud.\nOmniverse ACE powers the backend of interactive avatars, essentially acting as Violet\u2019s brain. Additionally, two reference applications are built on ACE: NVIDIA Tokkio and NVIDIA Maxine.\nViolet was developed using the Tokkio application workflow, which enables interactive avatars to see, perceive, converse intelligently and provide recommendations to enhance customer service, both online and in places like restaurants and stores.\nNVIDIA Maxine delivers a suite of GPU-accelerated AI software development kits and cloud-native microservices for deploying AI features to enhance real-time video communications. Maxine integrates the NVIDIA Riva SDK\u2019s real-time automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities with real-time \u201clive portrait\u201d photo animation and eye contact features, which enable better communication and understanding.\nWith UCF, NVIDIA\u2019s creative team built a graph of microservices for Violet that were deployed in the cloud.\nLatest Microservices Expand Possibilities for Avatars\nThe demo with Violet highlights how developers of digital humans and virtual assistants can use Omniverse ACE to accelerate their avatar development workflows. Omniverse ACE also delivers microservices that enable developers to access the best NVIDIA AI technology, with no coding required.\nSome of the latest microservices include:\n\nAnimation AI: Omniverse Audio2Face simplifies animation of a 3D character to match any voice-over track, helping users animate characters for games, films or real-time digital assistants.\nConversational AI: Includes the NVIDIA Riva SDK for speech AI and NVIDIA NeMo Megatron framework for natural language processing, allowing developers to quickly build and deploy cutting-edge applications that deliver high-accuracy, expressive voices and respond in real time.\n\nAI Avatars Deliver New Transformations Across Industries\nThe AI avatars that ACE enables will enhance interactive experiences in industries such as gaming, entertainment, transportation and hospitality.\nLeading professional-services company Deloitte has worked with NVIDIA to help enterprises deploy transformative applications. At GTC, Deloitte announced that new hybrid-cloud offerings for NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse services and platforms, including Omniverse ACE, will be added to the existing Deloitte Center for AI Computing.\nNVIDIA Omniverse ACE brings all three versions of Violet to life, from customer service Violet (left), to intelligent Violet (right) to Ultra Violet (center).\n\u201cCloud-based AI models and services are opening up new ways for digital humans to make people feel more connected, and today\u2019s interaction with Violet in the NVIDIA GTC keynote shows a glimpse into the future of AI-powered avatars,\u201d said Vladimir Mastilovi\u0107, vice president of digital humans technology at Epic Games. \u201cWe are delighted to see NVIDIA Omniverse ACE using MetaHumans in Unreal Engine 5 to make it even easier to deploy engaging high-fidelity 3D avatars.\u201d\nNVIDIA Omniverse ACE will be available to early-access partners starting later this year, along with the Tokkio reference application for simplified customer-service avatar implementation.\nLearn more about Omniverse ACE by joining this session at GTC, and explore all the technologies that go into the creation and animation of realistic, interactive digital humans.\nCustomers can request the hands-on, web-based Tokkio demo.\nDevelopers and partners can sign up to be notified when ACE is available.\nAnd catch up on the latest announcements from the GTC keynote by NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang:\n\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: Artificial Intelligence | GTC 2022 | NVIDIA NeMo | Omniverse \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Among them are the powerful new Transformer Engine and an NVIDIA NVLink\u00ae interconnect to accelerate the largest AI models, like advanced recommender systems and large language models, and to drive innovations in such fields as conversational AI and drug discovery.\n\u201cHopper is the new engine of AI factories, processing and refining mountains of data to train models with trillions of parameters that are used to drive advances in language-based AI, robotics, healthcare and life sciences,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cHopper\u2019s Transformer Engine boosts performance up to an order of magnitude, putting large-scale AI and HPC within reach of companies and researchers.\u201d\nIn addition to Hopper\u2019s architecture and Transformer Engine, several other key innovations power the H100 GPU to deliver the next massive leap in NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated compute data center platform, including second-generation Multi-Instance GPU, confidential computing, fourth-generation NVIDIA NVLink and DPX Instructions.\nA five-year license for the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite is now included with H100 for mainstream servers. This optimizes the development and deployment of AI workflows and ensures organizations have access to the AI frameworks and tools needed to build AI chatbots, recommendation engines, vision AI and more.\nGlobal Rollout of Hopper \r\nH100 enables companies to slash costs for deploying AI, delivering the same AI performance with 3.5x more energy efficiency and 3x lower total cost of ownership, while using 5x fewer server nodes over the previous generation.\nFor customers who want to immediately try the new technology, NVIDIA announced that H100 on Dell PowerEdge servers is now available on NVIDIA LaunchPad, which provides free hands-on labs, giving companies access to the latest hardware and NVIDIA AI software.\nCustomers can also begin ordering NVIDIA DGX\u2122 H100 systems, which include eight H100 GPUs and deliver 32 petaflops of performance at FP8 precision. NVIDIA Base Command\u2122 and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software power every DGX system, enabling deployments from a single node to an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD\u2122 supporting advanced AI development of large language models and other massive workloads.\nH100-powered systems from the world\u2019s leading computer makers are expected to ship in the coming weeks, with over 50 server models in the market by the end of the year and dozens more in the first half of 2023. Partners building systems include Atos, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro.\nAdditionally, some of the world\u2019s leading higher education and research institutions will be using H100 to power their next-generation supercomputers. Among them are the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Los Alamos National Lab, Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS), Texas Advanced Computing Center and the University of Tsukuba.\nH100 Coming to the Cloud\r\nAmazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will be among the first to deploy H100-based instances in the cloud starting next year.\n\u201cWe look forward to enabling the next generation of AI models on the latest H100 GPUs in Microsoft Azure,\u201d said Nidhi Chappell, general manager of Azure AI Infrastructure. \u201cWith the advancements in Hopper architecture coupled with our investments in Azure AI supercomputing, we\u2019ll be able to help accelerate the development of AI worldwide\u201d\n\u201cBy offering our customers the latest H100 GPUs from NVIDIA, we\u2019re helping them accelerate their most complex machine learning and HPC workloads,\u201d said Karan Batta, vice president of product management at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. \u201cAdditionally, using NVIDIA\u2019s next generation of H100 GPUs allows us to support our demanding internal workloads and helps our mutual customers with breakthroughs across healthcare, autonomous vehicles, robotics and IoT.\u201d\nNVIDIA Software Support\r\nThe advanced Transformer Engine technology of H100 enables enterprises to quickly develop large language models with a higher level of accuracy. As these models continue to grow in scale, so does the complexity, sometimes requiring months to train.\nTo tackle this, some of the world\u2019s leading large language model and deep learning frameworks are being optimized on H100, including NVIDIA NeMo Megatron, Microsoft DeepSpeed, Google JAX, PyTorch, TensorFlow and XLA. These frameworks combined with Hopper architecture will significantly speed up AI performance to help train large language models within days or hours.\nTo learn more about NVIDIA Hopper and H100, watch Huang\u2019s GTC keynote.

The large language model (LLM) framework will support chemistry, protein, DNA and RNA data formats.\nIt\u2019s part of the NVIDIA Clara Discovery collection of frameworks, applications and AI models for drug discovery.\nJust as AI is learning to understand human languages with LLMs, it\u2019s also learning the languages of biology and chemistry. By making it easier to train massive neural networks on biomolecular data, NVIDIA BioNeMo helps researchers discover new patterns and insights in biological sequences \u2014 insights that researchers can connect to biological properties or functions, and even human health conditions.\nNVIDIA BioNeMo provides a framework for scientists to train large-scale language models using bigger datasets, resulting in better-performing neural networks. The framework will be available in early access on NVIDIA NGC, a hub for GPU-optimized software.\nIn addition to the language model framework, NVIDIA BioNeMo has a cloud API service that will support a growing list of pretrained AI models.\nBioNeMo Framework Supports Bigger Models, Better Predictions\nScientists using natural language processing models for biological data today often train relatively small neural networks that require custom preprocessing. By adopting BioNeMo, they can scale up to LLMs with billions of parameters that capture information about molecular structure, protein solubility and more.\nBioNeMo is an extension of the NVIDIA NeMo Megatron framework for GPU-accelerated training of large-scale, self-supervised language models. It\u2019s domain specific, designed to support molecular data represented in the SMILES notation for chemical structures, and in FASTA sequence strings for amino acids and nucleic acids.\n\u201cThe framework allows researchers across the healthcare and life sciences industry to take advantage of their rapidly growing biological and chemical datasets,\u201d said Mohammed AlQuraishi, founding member of the OpenFold Consortium and assistant professor at Columbia University\u2019s Department of Systems Biology. \u201cThis makes it easier to discover and design therapeutics that precisely target the molecular signature of a disease.\u201d\nBioNeMo Service Features LLMs for Chemistry and Biology\nFor developers looking to quickly get started with LLMs for digital biology and chemistry applications, the NVIDIA BioNeMo LLM service will include four pretrained language models. These are optimized for inference and will be available under early access through a cloud API running on NVIDIA DGX Foundry.\n\nESM-1: This protein LLM, based on the\u00a0state-of-the-art ESM-1b model published by Meta AI, processes amino acid sequences to generate representations that can be used to predict a wide variety of protein properties and functions. It also improves scientists\u2019 ability to understand protein structure.\nOpenFold: The public-private consortium creating state-of-the-art protein modeling tools will make its open-source AI pipeline accessible through the BioNeMo service.\nMegaMolBART: Trained on 1.4 billion molecules, this generative chemistry model can be used for reaction prediction, molecular optimization and de novo molecular generation.\nProtT5: The model, developed in a collaboration led by the Technical University of Munich\u2019s RostLab and including NVIDIA, extends the capabilities of protein LLMs like Meta AI\u2019s ESM-1b to sequence generation.\n\nIn the future, researchers using the BioNeMo LLM service will be able to customize the LLM models for higher accuracy on their applications in a few hours \u2014 with fine-tuning and new techniques such as p-tuning, a training method that requires a dataset with just a few hundred examples instead of millions.\nStartups, Researchers and Pharma Adopting NVIDIA BioNeMo\nA wave of experts in biotech and pharma are adopting NVIDIA BioNeMo to support drug discovery research.\n\nAstraZeneca and NVIDIA have used the Cambridge-1 supercomputer to develop the MegaMolBART model included in the BioNeMo LLM service. The global biopharmaceuticals company will use the BioNeMo framework to help train some of the world\u2019s largest language models on datasets of small molecules, proteins and, soon, DNA.\nResearchers at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard are working with NVIDIA to develop next-generation DNA language models using the BioNeMo framework. These models will be integrated into Terra, a cloud platform co-developed by the Broad Institute, Microsoft and Verily that enables biomedical researchers to share, access and analyze data securely and at scale. The AI models will also be added to the BioNeMo service\u2019s collection.\nThe OpenFold consortium plans to use the BioNeMo framework to advance its work developing AI models that can predict molecular structures from amino acid sequences with near-experimental accuracy.\nPeptone is focused on modeling intrinsically disordered proteins \u2014 proteins that lack a stable 3D structure. The company is working with NVIDIA to develop versions of the ESM model using the NeMo framework, which BioNeMo is also based on. The project, which is scheduled to run on NVIDIA\u2019s Cambridge-1 supercomputer, will advance Peptone\u2019s drug discovery work.\nEvozyne, a Chicago-based biotechnology company, combines engineering and deep learning technology to design novel proteins to solve long-standing challenges in therapeutics and sustainability.\n\n\u201cThe BioNeMo framework is an enabling technology to efficiently leverage the power of LLMs for data-driven protein design within our design-build-test cycle,\u201d said Andrew Ferguson, co-founder and head of computation at Evozyne. \u201cThis will have an immediate impact on our design of novel functional proteins, with applications in human health and sustainability.\u201d\n\u201cAs we see the ever-widening adoption of large language models in the protein space, being able to efficiently train LLMs and quickly modulate model architectures is becoming hugely important,\u201d said Istvan Redl, machine learning lead at Peptone, a biotech startup in the NVIDIA Inception program. \u201cWe believe that these two engineering aspects \u2014 scalability and rapid experimentation \u2014 are exactly what the BioNeMo framework could provide.\u201d\nSign up for early access to the NVIDIA BioNeMo LLM service or BioNeMo framework.

The automotive-grade system-on-a-chip (SoC) is built on the latest CPU and GPU advances to deliver 1,000 teraflops of performance while reducing overall system costs.\nDRIVE Thor succeeds NVIDIA DRIVE Orin in the company\u2019s product lineup, incorporating the newest compute technology to accelerate industry deployment of intelligent-vehicle technology, targeting automakers\u2019 2025 models.\nDRIVE Thor unifies traditionally distributed functions in vehicles \u2014 including digital cluster, infotainment, parking and assisted driving \u2014 for greater efficiency in development and faster software iteration.\nManufacturers can configure the DRIVE Thor SoC in multiple ways. They can dedicate all of the platform\u2019s 1,000 teraflops to the autonomous driving pipeline, or use a portion for in-cabin AI and infotainment and another portion for driver assistance.\nLike the current-generation NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, DRIVE Thor uses the productivity of the NVIDIA DRIVE software development kit, is designed to be ASIL D functionally safe, and is built on a scalable architecture, so developers can seamlessly port their past software development to the latest platform.\nLightning Fast\nIn addition to raw performance, DRIVE Thor delivers an incredible leap in deep neural network accuracy.\nDRIVE Thor marks the first inclusion of a transformer engine in the AV platform family. The transformer engine is a new component of the NVIDIA GPU Tensor Core. Transformer networks process video data as a single perception frame, enabling the compute platform to process more data over time.\nWith 8-bit floating point (FP8) precision, the SoC introduces a new data type for automotive. Traditionally, AV developers see a loss in accuracy when moving from 32-bit floating point to 8-bit integer data formats. FP8 precision eases this transition, making it possible for developers to transfer data types without sacrificing accuracy.\nDRIVE Thor uses an Automotive Enhanced (AE) version of the upcoming Arm Neoverse Poseidon Platform, making it one of the highest performance processors in the industry.\nMulti-Domain Computing\nDRIVE Thor is as efficient as it is powerful.\nThe SoC is capable of multi-domain computing, meaning it can partition tasks for autonomous driving and in-vehicle infotainment. This multi-compute domain isolation lets concurrent time-critical processes run without interruption. On one computer, the vehicle can simultaneously run Linux, QNX and Android.\nTypically, these types of functions are controlled by tens of electronic control units distributed throughout a vehicle. Rather than relying on these distributed ECUs, manufacturers can now consolidate vehicle functions using DRIVE Thor\u2019s ability to isolate specific tasks.\nWith DRIVE Thor, automakers can consolidate intelligent vehicle functions on a single SoC.\nAll vehicle displays, sensors and more can connect to this single SoC, simplifying what has been an incredibly complex supply chain for automakers.\nTwo Is Always Better Than One\nIf one DRIVE Thor seems incredible, try two.\nCustomers can use one DRIVE Thor SoC, or they can connect two via the latest NVLink-C2C chip interconnect technology to serve as a monolithic platform that runs a single operating system.\nThis capability provides automakers with the compute headroom and flexibility to build software-defined vehicles that are continuously upgradeable through secure, over-the-air updates.\nDesigned with the best of NVIDIA GPU technology, DRIVE Thor is truly an AV SoC of heroic proportions.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC 2022 | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

The GeForce RTX 4090 is up to 2x faster than a GeForce RTX 3090 Ti in 3D rendering, AI and video exports.\nThe GeForce RTX 4080 comes in two variants \u2014 16GB and 12GB \u2014 so creators can choose the optimal memory capacity based on their projects\u2019 needs. The RTX GeForce 4080 16GB is up to 1.5x faster than the RTX 3080 Ti.\nThe keynote kicked off with a breathtaking demo, NVIDIA Racer RTX, built in NVIDIA Omniverse, an open platform for virtual collaboration and real-time photorealistic simulation. The demo showcases the latest NVIDIA technologies with real-time full ray tracing \u2014 in 4K resolution at 60 frames per second (FPS), running with new DLSS 3 technology \u2014 and hyperrealistic physics.\nIt\u2019s a blueprint for the next generation of content creation and game development, where worlds are no longer prebaked, but physically accurate, full simulations.\nDeep dive into the making of Racer RTX in this special edition of the In the NVIDIA Studio blog series.\nIn addition to benefits for 3D creators, we\u2019ve introduced near-magical RTX and AI tools for game modders \u2014 the creators of the PC gaming community \u2014 with the Omniverse application RTX Remix, which has been used to turn RTX ON in Portal with RTX, free downloadable content for Valve\u2019s classic hit, Portal.\nVideo editors and livestreamers are getting a massive boost, too. New dual encoders cut video export times nearly in half. Live streamers get encoding benefits with the eighth-generation NVIDIA Encoder, including support for AV1 encoding.\nGroundbreaking AI technology, like AI image generators and new video-editing tools in DaVinci Resolve, are ushering in a new wave of creativity. Beyond-fast GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 graphics cards will power the next step in the AI revolution, delivering up to a 2x increase in AI performance over the previous generation.\nA New Paradigm for 3D\nGeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs and DLSS 3 deliver big boosts in performance for 3D artists, so they can create in fully ray-traced environments with accurate physics and realistic materials all in real time, without proxies.\nDLSS 3 uses AI-powered fourth-generation RTX Tensor Cores, and a new Optical Flow Accelerator on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, to generate additional frames and dramatically increase FPS. This improves smoothness and speeds up movement in the viewport for those working in 3D applications such as NVIDIA Omniverse, Unity and Unreal Engine 5.\nPerformance testing conducted by NVIDIA in September 2022 with desktops equipped with Intel Core i9-12900K with UHD 770, 64 GB RAM. NVIDIA Driver 521.58, Windows 11. Maya with Arnold 2022 renderer performance measures render time of the NVIDIA SOL 3D model. Blender 2.93 measures render time of various scenes using Blender OpenData benchmark, with the OptiX render engine. Render time of various scenes with Redshift version 3.0.45. Tested on Otoy OctaneRender 2020.1.\nNVIDIA Omniverse, included in the NVIDIA Studio software suite, takes creativity and collaboration even further. A new Omniverse application, RTX Remix, is putting powerful new tools in the hands of game modders.\nModders \u2014 the millions of creators in the gaming world who are responsible for driving billions of game mod downloads annually \u2014 can use the app to remaster a large library of compatible DirectX 8 and 9 titles, including one of the world\u2019s most modded games, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. As a test, NVIDIA artists updated a Morrowind scene in stunning ray tracing with DLSS 3 and enhanced assets.\n\nIt starts with the magical capture tool. With one click, capture geometry, materials, lighting and cameras in the Universal Scene Description format. AI texture tools bring assets up to date, with super resolution and physically based materials. Assets are easily customizable in real time using Omniverse Connectors for Autodesk Maya, Blender and more.\nRTX Remix enables artists to easily make incredible mods with ray tracing and DLSS for classic games.\nModders can collaborate in Omniverse connected apps and view changes in RTX Remix to replace assets throughout entire games.

Sign up to be notified when RTX Remix is available.\nThe robust capabilities of this new modding platform were used to create Portal with RTX.\n\nPortal fans can wishlist the Portal with RTX downloadable content on Steam and experience the first-ever RTX Remix-modded game in November.\nFast Forward to the Future of Video Production\nVideo production is getting a significant boost with GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs. The feeling of being stuck on pause while waiting for videos to export gets dramatically reduced with the GeForce RTX 40 Series\u2019 new dual encoders, which slash export times nearly in half.\nThe dual encoders can work in tandem, dividing work automatically between them to double output. They\u2019re also capable of recording up to 8K, 60 FPS content in real time via GeForce Experience and OBS Studio to make stunning gameplay videos.\nDual encoders can record up to 8K, 60 FPS content in real time via GeForce Experience and OBS Studio.\nBlackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve, the popular Voukoder plugin for Adobe Premiere Pro, and Jianying \u2014 the top video editing app in China \u2014 are all enabling AV1 support, as well as a dual encoder through encode presets. Expect dual encoder and AV1 availability for these apps in October. And we\u2019re working with popular video-effects app Notch to enable AV1, as well as Topaz to enable AV1 and the dual encoder.\n\nAI tools are changing the speed at which video work gets done. Professionals can now automate tedious tasks, while aspiring filmmakers can add stylish effects with ease. Rotoscoping \u2014 the process of highlighting a part of motion footage, typically done frame by frame \u2014 can now be done nearly instantaneously with the AI-powered \u201cObject Select Mask\u201d tool in Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve. With GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, this feature is 70% faster than with the previous generation.\n\u201cThe new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs are going to supercharge the speed at which our users are able to produce video through the power of AI and dual encoding \u2014 completing their work in a fraction of the time,\u201d said Rohit Gupta, director of software development at Blackmagic Design.\nContent creators using GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs also benefit from speedups to existing integrations in top video-editing apps. GPU-accelerated effects and decoding save immeasurable time by enabling work with ultra-high-resolution RAW footage in real time in REDCINE-X PRO, DaVinci Resolve and Adobe Premiere Pro, without the need for proxies.\nAV1 Brings Encoding Benefits to Livestreamers and More\nThe open video encoding format AV1 is the biggest leap in encoding since H.264 was released nearly two decades ago. The GeForce RTX 40 Series features the eighth-generation NVIDIA video encoder, NVENC for short, now with support for AV1.\nPerformance testing conducted by NVIDIA in September 2022, using desktops equipped with Intel Core i9-12900K with UHD 770, 32GB RAM. NVIDIA Driver 521.58, Windows 11. Encoding quality is measured as BD-SNR using seventh-generation NVENC with H.264, and eighth-generation NVENC with AV1, both at the maximum-quality P7 preset.\nFor livestreamers, the new AV1 encoder delivers 40% better efficiency. This means livestreams will appear as if bandwidth was increased by 40% \u2014 a big boost in image quality. AV1 also adds support for advanced features like high dynamic range.\n\nNVIDIA collaborated with OBS Studio to add AV1 \u2014 on top of the recently released HEVC and HDR support \u2014 within an upcoming software release, expected later this year. OBS is also optimizing encoding pipelines to reduce overhead by 35% for all NVIDIA GPUs. The new release will additionally feature updated NVIDIA Broadcast effects, including noise and room echo removal, as well as improvements to virtual background.\nWe\u2019ve also worked with Discord to enable end-to-end livestreams with AV1. In an update releasing later this year, Discord will enable its users to use AV1 to dramatically improve screen sharing, be it for game play, school work or hangouts with friends.\nTo make the deployment of AV1 seamless for developers, NVIDIA is making it available in the NVIDIA Video Codec SDK 12 in October. Developers can also access the NVENC AV1 directly with Microsoft Media Framework, through Google Chrome and Chromium, as well as in FFMPEG.\nBenefits to livestreamers go beyond AV1 encoding on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs. The SDKs that power NVIDIA Broadcast are available to developers, enabling native feature support for Logitech, Corsair and Elgato devices, or advanced workflows in OBS and Notch software. At GTC, NVIDIA updated and introduced new AI-powered effects:\n\nThe popular Virtual Background feature now includes temporal information, so random objects in the background will no longer create distractions by flashing in and out. It will be available in the next version of OBS Studio.\nFace Expression Estimation is a new feature that allows apps to accurately track facial expressions for face meshes, even with the simplest of webcams. It\u2019s hugely beneficial to VTubers and can be found in the next version of VTube Studio.\nEye Contact allows creators, like podcasters, to appear as if they\u2019re looking directly at the camera \u2014 highly useful for when the user is reading a script or looking away to engage with viewers in the chat window.\n\nThe Making of \u2018Racer RTX\u2019\nTo showcase the technological advancements made possible by GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, a global team of NVIDIANs, led by creative director Gabriele Leone, created a stunning new technology demo, Racer RTX.\nThe team recreated city streets in West Los Angeles, turning them into a lifelike radio-controlled car track.\nLeone and team set out to one-up the fully playable, physics-based Marbles at Night RTX demo. With improved GPU performance and breakthrough advancements in NVIDIA Omniverse, Racer RTX lets the user explore different sandbox environments, highlighting the amazing 3D worlds that artists are now able to create.\nThe demo is a look into the next generation of content creation, \u201cwhere virtually everything is simulated,\u201d Leone said. \u201cSoon, there\u2019s going to be no need to bake lighting \u2014 content will be fully simulated, aided by incredibly powerful GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs.\u201d\nThe Omniverse real-time editor empowered the artists on the project to create lights, design materials, rig physics, adjust elements and see updates immediately. They moved objects, added new geometry, changed surface types and tweaked physics.\nIn a traditional rasterized workflow, levels and lighting need to be baked. And in a typical art environment, only one person can work on a level at a time, leading to painstaking iteration that greatly slows the creation process. These challenges were overcome with Omniverse.\n\nAnimating behavior is also a complex and manual process for creators. Using NVIDIA MDL-based materials, Leone turned on PhysX in Omniverse, and each surface and object was automatically textured and modeled to behave as it would in real life. Ram a baseball, for example, and it\u2019ll roll away and interact with other objects until it runs out of momentum.\n\u201cRacer RTX\u201d offers a glimpse into the future of content creation, where worlds are no longer prebaked.\nWorking with GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs and DLSS 3 meant the team could modify its worlds through a fully ray-traced design viewport in 4K at 60 FPS \u2014 4x the FPS of a GeForce RTX 3090 Ti.\nAnd the team is just getting started. The Racer RTX demo will be available for developers and creators to download, explore and tweak in November. Get familiar with Omniverse ahead of the release.\nWith all these astounding advancements in AI and GPU-accelerated features for the NVIDIA Studio platform, it\u2019s the perfect time to upgrade for gamers, 3D artists, video editors and live steamers. And battle-tested monthly NVIDIA Studio Drivers help any creator feel like a professional \u2014 download the September Driver.\nStay Tuned for the Latest Studio News\nKeep up to date on the latest creator news, creative app updates, AI-powered workflows and featured In the NVIDIA Studio artists by visiting the NVIDIA Studio blog.\nGeForce RTX 4090 GPUs launch on Wednesday, Oct. 12, followed by the GeForce RTX 4080 graphics cards in November.

These 3D objects are created in the same format used by popular graphics software applications, allowing users to immediately import their shapes into 3D renderers and game engines for further editing.\nThe generated objects could be used in 3D representations of buildings, outdoor spaces or entire cities, designed for industries including gaming, robotics, architecture and social media.\nGET3D can generate a virtually unlimited number of 3D shapes based on the data it\u2019s trained on. Like an artist who turns a lump of clay into a detailed sculpture, the model transforms numbers into complex 3D shapes.\nWith a training dataset of 2D car images, for example, it creates a collection of sedans, trucks, race cars and vans. When trained on animal images, it comes up with creatures such as foxes, rhinos, horses and bears. Given chairs, the model generates assorted swivel chairs, dining chairs and cozy recliners.\n\n\u201cGET3D brings us a step closer to democratizing AI-powered 3D content creation,\u201d said Sanja Fidler, vice president of AI research at NVIDIA, who leads the Toronto-based AI lab that created the tool. \u201cIts ability to instantly generate textured 3D shapes could be a game-changer for developers, helping them rapidly populate virtual worlds with varied and interesting objects.\u201d\nGET3D is one of more than 20 NVIDIA-authored papers and workshops accepted to the NeurIPS AI conference, taking place in New Orleans and virtually, Nov. 26-Dec. 4.\nIt Takes AI Kinds to Make a Virtual World\nThe real world is full of variety: streets are lined with unique buildings, with different vehicles whizzing by and diverse crowds passing through. Manually modeling a 3D virtual world that reflects this is incredibly time consuming, making it difficult to fill out a detailed digital environment.\nThough quicker than manual methods, prior 3D generative AI models were limited in the level of detail they could produce. Even recent inverse rendering methods can only generate 3D objects based on 2D images taken from various angles, requiring developers to build one 3D shape at a time.\nGET3D can instead churn out some 20 shapes a second when running inference on a single NVIDIA GPU \u2014 working like a generative adversarial network for 2D images, while generating 3D objects. The larger, more diverse the training dataset it\u2019s learned from, the more varied and detailed the output.\nNVIDIA researchers trained GET3D on synthetic data consisting of 2D images of 3D shapes captured from different camera angles. It took the team just two days to train the model on around 1 million images using NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs.\nEnabling Creators to Modify Shape, Texture, Material\nGET3D gets its name from its ability to Generate Explicit Textured 3D meshes \u2014 meaning that the shapes it creates are in the form of a triangle mesh, like a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 model, covered with a textured material. This lets users easily import the objects into game engines, 3D modelers and film renderers \u2014 and edit them.\nOnce creators export GET3D-generated shapes to a graphics application, they can apply realistic lighting effects as the object moves or rotates in a scene. By incorporating another AI tool from NVIDIA Research, StyleGAN-NADA, developers can use text prompts to add a specific style to an image, such as modifying a rendered car to become a burned car or a taxi, or turning a regular house into a haunted one.\nThe researchers note that a future version of GET3D could use camera pose estimation techniques to allow developers to train the model on real-world data instead of synthetic datasets. It could also be improved to support universal generation \u2014 meaning developers could train GET3D on all kinds of 3D shapes at once, rather than needing to train it on one object category at a time.\nFor the latest news from NVIDIA AI research, watch the replay of NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote address at GTC:\u00a0\n\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ResearchTags: 3D | Artificial Intelligence | GTC 2022 | NVIDIA Research | Rendering | Synthetic Data Generation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This includes the Orin Nano \u2014 which delivers up to 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of AI performance in the smallest Jetson form factor \u2014 up to the AGX Orin\u2122, delivering 275 TOPS for advanced autonomous machines.\nJetson Orin features an NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPU, Arm-based CPUs, next-generation deep learning and vision accelerators, high-speed interfaces, fast memory bandwidth and multimodal sensor support. This performance and versatility empower more customers to commercialize products that once seemed impossible, from engineers deploying edge AI applications to Robotics Operating System (ROS) developers building next-generation intelligent machines.\n\u201cOver 1,000 customers and 150 partners have embraced Jetson AGX Orin since NVIDIA announced its availability just six months ago, and Orin Nano will significantly expand this adoption,\u201d said Deepu Talla, vice president of embedded and edge computing at NVIDIA. \u201cWith an orders-of-magnitude increase in performance for millions of edge AI and ROS developers today, Jetson Orin is the ideal platform for virtually every kind of robotics deployment imaginable.\u201d\nMaking Edge AI and Robotics More Accessible\r\nThe Orin Nano modules are form-factor- and pin-compatible with the previously announced Orin NX modules. Full emulation support allows customers to get started developing for the Orin Nano series today using the AGX Orin developer kit. This gives customers the flexibility to design one system to support multiple Jetson modules and easily scale their applications.\nOrin Nano supports multiple concurrent AI application pipelines with high-speed I/O and an NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPU. Developers of entry-level devices and applications such as retail analytics and industrial quality control benefit from easier access to more complex AI models at lower cost.\nThe Orin Nano modules will be available in two versions. The Orin Nano 8GB delivers up to 40 TOPS with power configurable from 7W to 15W, while the 4GB version delivers up to 20 TOPS with power options as low as 5W to 10W.\nThe Jetson Orin platform is designed to solve the toughest robotics challenges and brings accelerated computing to over 700,000 ROS developers. Combined with the powerful hardware capabilities of Orin Nano, enhancements in the latest NVIDIA Isaac\u2122 software for ROS put increased performance and productivity in the hands of roboticists.\nStrong Ecosystem and Software Support\r\nJetson Orin has seen broad support across the robotics and embedded computing ecosystem, including from Canon, John Deere, Microsoft Azure, Teradyne, TK Elevator and many more.\nThe NVIDIA Jetson ecosystem is growing rapidly, with over 1 million developers, 6,000 customers \u2014 including 2,000 startups \u2014 and 150 partners. Jetson partners offer a wide range of support from AI software, hardware and application design services to cameras, sensors and peripherals, developer tools and development systems.\nOrin Nano is supported by the NVIDIA JetPack\u2122 software development kit and is powered by the same NVIDIA CUDA-X\u2122 accelerated computing stack used to create breakthrough AI products in such fields as industrial IoT, manufacturing, smart cities and more.\nAvailability\r\nThe Jetson Orin Nano modules will be available in January, starting at $199.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics and ignited the era of modern AI. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.

In the past, such industries required costly solutions custom built for specific use cases, but the IGX platform is easily programmable and configurable to suit different needs.\nAs the platform for safe, secure autonomous systems, IGX improves human-machine collaboration. For manufacturing and logistics, IGX provides an additional layer of safety in highly regulated physical-world factories and warehouses. For medical edge AI use cases, IGX delivers secure, low-latency AI inference to address the clinical demand for instantaneous insights from a range of instruments and sensors for medical procedures, such as robotic-assisted surgery and patient monitoring.\n\u201cAs humans increasingly work with robots, industries are setting new functional safety standards for AI and computing,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA IGX will help companies build the next generation of software-defined industrial and medical devices that can safely operate in the same environment as humans.\u201d\nNVIDIA IGX Platform \u2014 Ensuring Compliance in Edge AI\r\nThe NVIDIA IGX platform is a powerful combination of hardware and software that includes NVIDIA IGX Orin, the world\u2019s most powerful, compact and energy-efficient AI supercomputer for autonomous industrial machines and medical devices.\nIGX Orin developer kits will be available early next year for enterprises to rapidly prototype and test products. Each kit comes with an integrated GPU and CPU for high-performance AI compute and an NVIDIA ConnectX\u00ae-7 SmartNIC to deliver high-performance networking with ultra-low latency and advanced security.\nADLINK, Advantech, Dedicated Computing, Kontron, Leadtek, MBX, Onyx, Portwell, Prodrive Technologies and YUAN will be among the first embedded-computing manufacturers to create products based on the IGX design built for the needs of the industrial and medical device industries.\nAlso included is a powerful software stack with critical security and safety capabilities that can be programmed and configured for different use cases. These features allow enterprises to add proactive safety into environments where humans and robots work side by side, such as warehouse floors and operating rooms.\nThe IGX platform can run NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, which optimizes the development and deployment of AI workflows and ensures organizations have access to necessary AI frameworks and tools. NVIDIA is also working with operating system partners like Canonical, Red Hat and SUSE to bring full-stack, long-term support to the platform.\nFor management of IGX in industrial and medical environments, NVIDIA Fleet Command\u2122 allows organizations to deploy secure, over-the-air software and system updates from a central cloud console.\nBuilding the Industrial Edge\r\nNVIDIA is working with a broad ecosystem of companies to bring the IGX platform to market.\nOne of the first companies to use IGX at the edge is Siemens, a technology leader in industrial automation and digitalization, which is working with NVIDIA on a vision for autonomous factories.\nSiemens is collaborating with NVIDIA to expand its work across industrial computing, including with digital twins and for the industrial metaverse.\nThe collaboration will allow enterprises to complement work carried out using the NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 platform for 3D design and collaboration and the Siemens Xcelerator open digital business platform with the powers of IGX. The platform enables data generated from digital twins in the virtual world to be used to train intelligent machines operating in real-life factories and warehouses using industrial-grade computing infrastructure from Siemens.\nSiemens is already adding next-level perception into its edge-based applications through NVIDIA Metropolis. With millions of sensors in factories, Metropolis connects entire fleets of robots and IoT devices to bring AI into industrial environments, making it one of the key application frameworks for edge AI running on top of the IGX platform.\n\u201cAs part of our ongoing collaboration with NVIDIA to speed digital transformation, Siemens will bring IGX technologies to our industrial compute portfolio to help reduce repetitive tasks in the factory and better support workers,\u201d said Rainer Brehm, CEO of factory automation at Siemens. \u201cBy more closely connecting smart devices on the factory floor and using that data for intelligent machine operation in production, we can increase efficiency and flexibility for our customers.\u201d\nMade for Medical Environments \r\nFor healthcare, the IGX platform supports NVIDIA Clara\u2122 Holoscan \u2014 a real-time, AI computing platform for medical devices \u2014 enabling the rapid development and production deployment of new devices that deliver AI applications directly into operating rooms, where over 300 million surgeries are delivered each year globally.\nMore than 70 medical-device companies, startups and medical centers have already been using Holoscan to advance their efforts in deploying AI applications to clinical settings and evolving medical devices to a software-as-a-service business model. Among them are Activ Surgical, Moon Surgical and Proximie, which are building next-generation surgical systems. With Clara Holoscan and IGX, Moon Surgical said it saved\u00a0significant\u00a0engineering time in its imaging pipelines, management system and hardware while developing\u00a0its next-generation Maestro surgical robot assistant.\n\u201cBy harnessing NVIDIA Clara Holoscan to power Maestro\u2019s next-gen capabilities, Moon is creating an exceptional surgical experience,\u201d said Anne Osdoit, CEO of Moon Surgical. \u201cThis collaboration has accelerated Moon\u2019s time to market and allowed the team to focus on developing novel features and algorithms, confident that cutting-edge computing architecture is at the heart of the Maestro System.\u201d\nTo learn more about NVIDIA IGX, watch Huang\u2019s GTC keynote.

Using centralized, high-performance compute, the NVIDIA DRIVE Concierge platform spans traditional cockpit and cluster capabilities, as well as personalized, AI-powered safety, convenience and entertainment features for every occupant.\nDrivers in the U.S. spend an average of nearly 450 hours in their car every year. With just a traditional cockpit and infotainment display, those hours can seem even longer.\nDRIVE Concierge makes time in vehicles more enjoyable, convenient and safe, extending intelligent features to every passenger using the DRIVE AGX compute platform, DRIVE IX software stack and Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE).\nThese capabilities include crystal-clear graphics and visualizations in the cockpit and cluster, intelligent digital assistants, driver and occupant monitoring, and streaming content such as games and movies.\nWith DRIVE Concierge, every passenger can enjoy their own intelligent experience.\nCockpit Capabilities\nBy running on the cross-domain DRIVE platform, DRIVE Concierge can virtualize, as well as host, multiple virtual machines on a single chip \u2014 rather than distributed computers \u2014 for streamlined development.\nWith this centralized architecture, DRIVE Concierge seamlessly orchestrates driver information, cockpit and infotainment functions. It supports the Android Automotive operating system, so automakers can easily customize and scale their IVI offerings.\nAnd digital cockpit and cluster features are just the beginning. DRIVE Concierge extends this premium functionality to the entire vehicle, with world-class confidence view, video-conferencing capabilities, digital assistants, gaming and more.\nVisualizing Intelligence\nSpeed, fuel range and distance traveled are key data for human drivers to be aware of. When AI is at the wheel, however, a detailed view of the vehicle\u2019s perception and planning layers is also crucial.\nDRIVE Concierge is tightly integrated with the DRIVE Chauffeur platform to provide high-quality, 360-degree, 4D visualization with low latency. Drivers and passengers can always see what\u2019s in the mind of the vehicle\u2019s AI, with beautiful 3D graphics.\nThis visualization is critical to building trust between the autonomous vehicle and its passengers, so occupants can be confident in the AV system\u2019s perception and planned path.\nHow May AI Help You?\nIn addition to revolutionizing driving, AI is creating a more intelligent vehicle interior with personalized digital assistants.\nOmniverse ACE is a collection of cloud-based AI models and services for developers to easily build, customize and deploy interactive avatars.\nWith ACE, AV developers can create in-vehicle assistants that are easily customizable with speech AI, computer vision, natural language understanding, recommendation engines and simulation technologies.\nThese avatars can help make recommendations, book reservations, access vehicle controls and provide alerts for situations like if a valuable item is left behind.\nGame On\nWith software-defined capabilities, cars are becoming living spaces, complete with the same entertainment available at home.\nNVIDIA DRIVE Concierge lets passengers watch videos and experience high-performance gaming wherever they go. Users can choose from their favorite apps and stream videos and games on any vehicle screen.\nBy using the NVIDIA GeForce NOW cloud gaming service, passengers can access more than 1,400 titles without the need for downloads, benefitting from automatic updates and unlimited cloud storage.\nSafety and Security\nIntelligent interiors provide an added layer of safety to vehicles, in addition to convenience and entertainment.\nDRIVE Concierge uses interior sensors and dedicated deep neural networks for driver monitoring, which ensures attention is on the road in situations where the human is in control.\nIt can also perform passenger monitoring to make sure that occupants are safe and no precious cargo is left behind.\nUsing NVIDIA DRIVE Sim on Omniverse, developers can collaborate to design passenger interactions with such cutting-edge features in the vehicle.\n\nBy tapping into NVIDIA\u2019s past heritage of infotainment technology, DRIVE Concierge is revolutionizing the future of in-vehicle experiences.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC 2022 | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

Users can now analyze a whole genome in just over one hour with Clara Parabricks compared to 24 hours in a CPU-based environment and can reduce the compute cost by more than half.\nBuilding large language models (LLMs): Researchers will develop foundational models for DNA and RNA, the building blocks of life, to better understand human biology using NVIDIA BioNeMo, an AI application framework announced today for LLMs in biology.\nBringing improved deep learning to Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK): NVIDIA is contributing a new deep learning model directly to the Broad Institute\u2019s GATK toolkit, the industry standard used by more than 100,000 researchers, which helps identify genetic variants that are associated with diseases. This will help drug discovery researchers develop new therapies.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a need across the healthcare ecosystem for better computational tools to enable breakthroughs in the way we understand disease, develop diagnostics and deliver treatments,\u201d said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA. \u201cBy expanding our collaboration with the Broad Institute, we can bring the power of large language models to ultimately deliver joint solutions and narrow the divide between insights from researchers and real benefits for patients.\u201d\nThe Broad Institute aims to enable the next generation of collaborative biomedical research by providing an open cloud platform that connects researchers both to each other and to the datasets and tools they need to achieve scientific breakthroughs.\n\u201cLife sciences are in the midst of a data revolution, and researchers are in critical need of a new approach to bring machine learning into biomedicine,\u201d said Anthony Philippakis, chief data officer of the Broad Institute. \u201cIn this collaboration, we aim to expand our mission of data sharing and collaborative processes to scale genomics research.\u201d\nLarge Language Models to Study Disease \nNVIDIA\u2019s BioNeMo framework includes pretrained LLMs for proteins and chemistry that simplify training, inference and scaling. BioNeMo is an extension of the NVIDIA NeMo Megatron framework and is domain-specific for chemistry, proteins and DNA/RNA sequences.\nBioNeMo allows developers to effectively train and deploy biology LLMs with billions of parameters.\u00a0Together, teams from both organizations will build on this work, creating new models to add to the BioNeMo collection and make available in the Terra platform.\nNVIDIA Software for Domain-Specific AI\r\nNVIDIA Parabricks GPU-accelerated workflows provide researchers with faster turnaround times and lower costs for a wide range of genomic data analyses. For Broad\u2019s GATK best practices germline workflow, doing the analysis with Parabricks on GPUs can be as much as 24x faster and less than half the cost.\nBroad Institute researchers will also gain access to MONAI, an open-source deep learning framework for medical imaging AI, as well as NVIDIA RAPIDS\u2122, a GPU-accelerated data science toolkit for faster data preparation, which can be used for genomic single-cell analysis.\nLearn more about Clara Parabricks and Terra integration and sign up for early access to the NVIDIA BioNeMo LLM service.\nTune in to NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s GTC keynote to learn more about the collaboration with the Broad Institute.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics and ignited the era of modern AI.

Plus Portal with RTX, Cyberpunk 2077 New Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode & More\n\n\t\t\t\t\n                    \n                     By Andrew Burnes on September 20, 2022\n                \n\t\t\t\t | \n\t\t\t\t\t\nFeatured Stories\nCyberpunk 2077\nGeForce RTX GPUs\nGeForce RTX Laptops\nNVIDIA DLSS\nNVIDIA Omniverse\nNVIDIA Racer RTX\nNVIDIA RTX\nNVIDIA RTX Remix\nPortal with RTX\nRay Tracing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur new GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards are beyond fast, giving gamers our highest ever gen-to-gen frame rate boost. This quantum leap in performance comes courtesy of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture and its many innovations, and NVIDIA DLSS 3, which accelerates performance by up to 4X. With a GeForce RTX 4090 or GeForce RTX 4080 in your system, your games will run far faster, and you\u2019ll have the power to experience richer, more immersive ray-traced experiences, such as NVIDIA Racer RTX, Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s new Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, and Portal with RTX.\nPortal with RTX will launch in November and will be free for Portal owners. It\u2019s a ray-traced reimagining of Valve\u2019s classic game, built using a revolutionary modding tool called NVIDIA RTX Remix, which allows gamers to remaster classic games with ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 3, and NVIDIA Reflex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortal with RTX and the upcoming NVIDIA Racer RTX demonstrate the unprecedented performance of GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, delivering ultra-quality ray-traced gameplay at the highest resolutions, leveraging our new NVIDIA DLSS 3 technology to multiply frame rates.\nOver 35 games and applications are adding DLSS 3, with the first coming in October. And CD PROJEKT RED are also upgrading Cyberpunk 2077 with a new Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode that uses the power of GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards to take the game\u2019s incredible visuals to new heights.\nKeep reading to learn about all of these announcements, and to see new, exclusive #RTXON videos and screenshots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 35 Games And Apps Adding NVIDIA DLSS 3 & Many More To Come\nNVIDIA DLSS 3 has just been announced, and already we have over 35 games and apps coming with support, the first of which launch in October:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 3 with Optical Multi Frame Generation multiplies performance on GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards by using AI to generate more frames. DLSS 3 analyzes sequential frames and motion data from the new Optical Flow Accelerator in GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs to create additional high quality frames. NVIDIA DLSS 3 also includes NVIDIA Reflex, so each of these titles will be even more responsive for all GeForce RTX gamers. For a complete breakdown of how DLSS 3 works, head here.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Plague Tale: Requiem\nAtomic Heart\nBlack Myth: Wukong\nBright Memory: Infinite\nChernobylite\nConqueror's Blade\nCyberpunk 2077\nDakar Desert Rally\nDeliver Us Mars\nDestroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed\nDying Light 2 Stay Human\nF1\u24c7 22\nF.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch\nFrostbite Engine\nHITMAN 3\nHogwarts Legacy\nICARUS\nJurassic World Evolution 2\nJustice\nLoopmancer\nMarauders\n \n\n\nMarvel's Spider-Man Remastered \nMicrosoft Flight Simulator\nMidnight Ghost Hunt\nMount & Blade II: Bannerlord\nNaraka: Bladepoint \nNVIDIA Omniverse\nNVIDIA Racer RTX\nPERISH\nPortal with RTX\nRipout\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl \nScathe\nSword and Fairy 7\nSYNCED\nThe Lord of the Rings: Gollum\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt\nTHRONE AND LIBERTY\nTower of Fantasy\nUnity\nUnreal Engine 4 & 5 \nWarhammer 40,000: Darktide\n \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, gamers on all GeForce RTX graphics cards can continue to enjoy NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, which massively boosts performance in 216 games and apps by using AI to output higher resolution frames from a lower resolution input.

Each environment is filled with photo-real objects, simulated in real time in NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for 3D content creation and collaboration. The Universal Scene Description (USD)-based levels composed of 1,811 hand-modeled, textured and simulated assets objects, were built in 3 months by NVIDIA artists across 12 time zones using Omniverse. Artists collaboratively contributed to the shared Omniverse world using their preferred design and content creation tools, such as Autodesk 3ds Max, Maya, Blender, Modo, Maxon ZBrush, Adobe Substance 3D Painter, Substance 3D Designer, Photoshop, Illustrator, Rizom UV, and SideFX Houdini, achieving interoperability via the USD file format.\nEach environment is rendered exclusively with full ray tracing, running at 60 FPS at 4K thanks to the power of GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards and NVIDIA DLSS 3\u2019s game-changing Optical Multi Frame Generation technology. NVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI), NVIDIA Reservoir Spatio Temporal Importance Resampling Global Illumination (ReSTIR GI), multiple light bounces, and high ray counts create worlds with the most accurate shadows and realistic lighting ever seen in a real-time game. And in an instant, the time of day can be changed, updating world lighting accordingly, and switching-on lamps and other artificial light sources at night, transforming the scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe end result is the most accurate representation of reality ever simulated in real time on a PC. Things in the environment are not static props, but rigid body, cloth, and fluid simulations. Baseballs roll and toys are knocked over as real world physics are calculated on the fly. Materials are accurately portrayed, and everything in the environment is fully interactive and presented to you fully ray traced at high frame rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Racer RTX will be available for download and play in November; developers and creators can tweak and explore the NVIDIA Omniverse project the same day. Head here to get familiar with Omniverse so you\u2019re ready to rock \u2018n\u2019 roll race the second Racer RTX is released.\nFor further detail on the making of Racer RTX, head over to our NVIDIA Studio article, where you\u2019ll also discover several other GeForce RTX 40 Series announcements for creators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077 Adding New Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode & DLSS 3\nCD PROJEKT RED\u2019s Cyberpunk 2077 is already one of the most advanced games available, using several ray tracing techniques to render a massive future city at incredible levels of detail.

The result is even more accurate, realistic and immersive global illumination, reflections, and self-reflections\nRay-traced reflections are now rendered at full resolution, further improving their quality\nImproved, more physically-based lighting removes the need for any other occlusion techniques\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporting the new Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode are several new NVIDIA technologies that greatly accelerate and improve the quality of advanced ray tracing workloads, for even faster performance when playing on GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards:\n\nShader Execution Reordering (SER) reorders and parallelizes the execution of threads that trace rays, without compromising image quality.\nOpacity Micromaps accelerate ray tracing workloads by encoding the surface opacity directly onto the geometry, drastically reducing expensive opacity evaluation during ray traversal, and enabling higher quality acceleration structures to be constructed. This technique is especially beneficial when applied to irregularly-shaped or translucent objects, like foliage and fences. On GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, the Opacity Micromap format is directly decodable by ray tracing hardware, improving performance even further.\nNVIDIA Real Time Denoisers (NRD) is a spatio-temporal ray tracing denoising library that assists in denoising low ray-per-pixel signals with real-time performance. Compared to previous-gen denoisers, NRD improves quality and ensures the computationally intensive ray-traced output is noise-free, without performance tradeoffs. \u00a0\n\nStay tuned to GeForce.com to learn when the new DLSS 3 and Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode updates will be released.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator\u2019s Performance Takes Off With The Addition Of NVIDIA DLSS 3\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator is a stunning, critically-acclaimed flight simulator that marries realistic recreations of popular planes with an accurate map of our planet, and regular free updates add immersive hand-crafted detail to the world\u2019s most visited cities, airports and regions.\nThe 1:1 real-world recreation of our planet in Microsoft Flight Simulator challenges even the most powerful PCs.

Challenges that were accompanied by an award-winning script that made antagonist GLaDOS one of gaming\u2019s most-loved characters, spawning a massive fandom that celebrates Portal and its sequel to this day.\nPortal\u2019s gameplay is timeless, but in the 15 years since its release GPUs have become hundreds of times faster. Our new GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards are beyond fast and come loaded with immersive features, such as ray tracing and AI graphics, that weren\u2019t possible all those years ago.\nTo demonstrate the capabilities of these incredible new GPUs, we\u2019re releasing Portal with RTX, which reimagines the classic game\u2019s graphics with full ray tracing and entirely new art evocative of the original. Portal with RTX will be free for existing Portal owners. Wishlist on Steam now!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis RTX upgrade builds-upon our work on Quake II and Minecraft, but is extra special, as the tool used to make Portal with RTX will be released for free, allowing you to give the RTX treatment to other classic games. Called NVIDIA RTX Remix, this ingenious modding platform can add ray tracing with just a few clicks, and gives modders the tools to make ambitious remasters, even for games that were previously unmoddable. Simply press a hotkey to import a game, use AI to enhance materials, build custom assets using Omniverse, and export an RTX Mod complete with ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 3, and NVIDIA Reflex. RTX Remix elevates modding to a whole new level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the power of RTX in the fullscreen 4K comparison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortal with RTX\u2019s Ray Tracing Is No Lie\nPortal with RTX exemplifies the incredible power of our new, beyond fast GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, and the capabilities of our NVIDIA RTX Remix modding platform. Every frame of gameplay is upgraded with stunning full ray tracing, new, hand-crafted hi-res physically based textures, and new, enhanced high-poly models evocative of the originals. Performance is accelerated with NVIDIA DLSS 3, allowing the game to run incredibly smoothly, and system latency is minimized using NVIDIA Reflex. And it was all built collaboratively by NVIDIA Lightspeed Studios.\nIn Portal with RTX, full ray tracing transforms each level, enabling light to bounce and be affected by the scene\u2019s geometry and materials. Every light is ray-traced and casts shadows, global illumination indirect lighting naturally illuminates and darkens rooms, volumetric ray-traced lighting scatters through fog and smoke, and shadows are pixel perfect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\nWith RTX Remix, the game runs in the background and we replace the old rendering APIs and systems with RTX Remix\u2019s 64-bit Vulkan renderer. This enables the addition of ray-tracing to classic games and it all updates in real-time as lights and objects move. Light can be cast from behind the player, or from another room, and in Portal with RTX, light even travels through portals. Glass refracts light, surfaces reflect detail based on their glossiness, reflections can be cast into the scene from behind the player, objects can self-reflect, and indirect light from off-screen illuminates and affects what you see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to Quake II RTX and Minecraft with RTX, the path-traced ray tracing introduced by RTX Remix is even more advanced, bouncing light four times instead of once, improving quality, immersion, and the simulation of real-world light. Additionally, we\u2019ve also introduced several new ray tracing techniques that further improve quality while also being more performant.\nNVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI) enables the addition of countless direct light sources, big and small, each casting light and shadows.\nNVIDIA Reservoir Spatio Temporal Importance Resampling Global Illumination (ReSTIR GI) enhances indirect light, enabling it to bathe a scene and illuminate dark corners that are not lit directly. And it also works smarter than previous ray-traced global illumination techniques, improving the efficiency of our ray tracing denoiser.\nA denoiser converts the raw ray-traced output into the beautiful on-screen graphics you experience in Portal with RTX and other ray-traced games. NVIDIA Real Time Denoisers (NRD) is a new spatio-temporal ray tracing denoising library that assists in denoising ray traced images in real-time, with superior performance and quality. Portal with RTX, RTX Remix, and other new ray-traced games and game updates leverage NRD for maximum quality and performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\nPortal with RTX and RTX Remix also introduce a number of graphical enhancements that improve ray tracing, immersion, realism, and your overall experience.\nVolumetric ray-traced lighting is perhaps the most spectacular, converting the fog effects of old into true, properly simulated volumetrics. Now, thick captivating beams of light pierce through smoke and fog, with light rays realistically scattering, affecting a scene in a realistic manner. Want more instances elsewhere? Add them quickly and easily with RTX Remix.\nPortal\u2019s unique selling point is the ability to take anything through a portal, and see through them, something that hadn\u2019t been done before its release. With ray tracing, light can pass through portals, too. Even the light from the moving High Energy Pellets will cast through portals, causing shadows to shift in step.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\nPortal and RTX Remix also introduce ray-traced emissive particles, and emissive game elements, such as our remixed and enhanced Companion Cube. These all cast light, which is of course ray-traced and rendered realistically in the game. For games that make extensive use of particle effects, the upgrade will be jaw-dropping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\nLights get an upgrade, too. The original Portal used point lights exclusively. For a greater variety of lighting, and improved quality, lights of different shapes and sizes have been introduced, along with area lights, enabling entire rooms to be illuminated by a single bright light source, such as the offices that loom over test chambers.\nTo take full advantage of ray tracing, your game assets need to have physically based properties, and ideally be geometrically detailed, too. Without physically based rendering (PBR) materials, light reacts identically on all surfaces. By specifying the attributes of each material and their reflectivity, light bounces, reflects, diffuses and dissipates realistically across each texture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\nAs for surfaces, if they\u2019re flat, as most were in games back in 2007, light won\u2019t react realistically. In the process of remaking each of Portal\u2019s surface materials, we\u2019ve introduced detail, such as bumps, divots and rivets, allowing light to fall across them accurately, bouncing light, creating new shadows, and generating accurate reflections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\nTo maximize the benefit of upgraded materials and surfaces, our team remade many of Portal\u2019s models. Silhouettes were retained to avoid changing their appearance, but in every other respect models were updated, increasing polygon counts and adding geometric detail, allowing them to interact flawlessly with ray tracing, and to look appropriately detailed alongside the game-changing ray-raced effects. A continually-seen example is on the Portal gun: its plastics react differently, and the cylinder is upgraded with ray-traced glass, with accurate fresnel properties, showing accurate real-time reflections that bend and distort across the glass as you attempt to escape from the test facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven decals, such as bullet holes, blood splatters and scorch marks, have been upgraded with PBR properties. Remix\u2019s AI texture tools transform the decals to accurately blend with the upgraded scenery, and interact naturally with ray tracing.\nThe end result is incredible, enhancing Portal, putting it on par visually with today\u2019s latest and greatest games. And with gameplay that\u2019s still as good today as was in 2007, Portal with RTX delivers the definitive experience for anyone discovering Portal for the first time, or returning for a fresh playthrough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortal with RTX Performance Is Accelerated By NVIDIA DLSS 3\nIn just a few years, NVIDIA DLSS has transformed gaming, enabling developers to craft more detailed and immersive games that run smoothly on today\u2019s hardware. Performance boosts of up to 2X in 216 games and apps have made it possible for GeForce RTX gamers to enjoy the most-anticipated titles at the highest detail levels and resolutions, with ray tracing maxed out. And all the while, NVIDIA DLSS has maintained --and in some cases improved-- image quality, a feat previously thought impossible for a scaling technique. That\u2019s the power of its AI-driven upscaling, running in real-time on GeForce RTX GPUs thanks to their Tensor Cores.\nThe possibilities of AI graphics are constantly evolving, just like NVIDIA DLSS, and with the launch of our GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards we\u2019re debuting NVIDIA DLSS 3. Headlining this major update is Optical Multi Frame Generation, a groundbreaking technique for creating entirely new frames.\nPerformance increases multiply when Optical Multi Frame Generation is activated, with the same amazing DLSS image quality you know and love, making gameplay even faster, and giving you the headroom to max out the most demanding titles. In Portal with RTX, GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics card owners can experience full ray tracing at 4K!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 3 is coming to over 35 games, and is available for RTX Remix mods. Learn more about the first wave of games adding DLSS 3 in our #RTXON games article, and get the complete rundown on the new tech in our NVIDIA DLSS 3 article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Best Responsiveness With NVIDIA Reflex\nAs NVIDIA DLSS revolutionized scaling and performance, NVIDIA Reflex has revolutionized low latency gaming, giving multiplayer gamers a competitive advantage, and making single-player games incredibly responsive. Pinpoint accuracy and timing are key to overcoming Portal with RTX\u2019s most difficult challenges; NVIDIA Reflex reduces system latency, making gameplay smooth and more responsive, delivering the reaction time needed in critical moments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflex also comes as standard alongside RTX Remix mods, minimizing system latency in modded games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX Remix: The Ultimate Modding Platform\nNVIDIA\u2019s Lightspeed Studios loves bringing RTX to classic games, but each project requires many months of development effort to get everything product-ready. With these challenges in front of us we set out to make a modding platform that enabled gamers and modders of all ability levels to bring ray tracing and NVIDIA technologies to classic games. Combining Open Source technology like DXVK, the latest rendering technology from NVIDIA, and a toolchain built on Omniverse, we were able to achieve this vision. The result is the revolutionary NVIDIA RTX Remix, and we can\u2019t wait to see what the community creates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Remix launches soon, supporting DirectX 8 and DirectX 9 games with fixed function graphics pipelines. In a compatible game, press the hotkey and the surrounding scene is captured, ready to be enhanced. Then, load into the Remix Application, and use AI to super-res textures to transform materials to be physically based. Rebuild your favorite assets using Omniverse-connected applications like Autodesk Maya and Adobe Substance, while you tweak the lighting and set the scene in Remix. Finally, hit a button to compile your changes into a mod that players simply place alongside the game\u2019s .exe to play with full ray tracing and DLSS 3.\nBuilt on NVIDIA Omniverse, RTX Remix solves a multitude of previously insurmountable challenges for modders, making classic game graphics modding simple, opening the door to modding previously unmoddable games.\nFor graphics modding, it\u2019s a game changer, and with the necessary time and expertise you too can craft a total upgrade like the one we\u2019ve made for Portal. Learn about the complete classic game modding workflow in our NVIDIA RTX Remix article, and sign up for the beta here.\nNVIDIA RTX Remix requires a GeForce RTX GPU to create RTX Mods, while mods built using Remix should be compatible with any hardware that can run Vulkan ray-traced games.

DLSS 3 is another quantum leap for gamers and creators,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cOur pioneering work in RTX neural rendering has opened a new universe of possibilities where AI plays a central role in the creation of virtual worlds.\u201d\nDLSS 3 is already receiving widespread support from the gaming ecosystem, with over 35 games and applications integrating the technology.\nDLSS 3: The Performance Multiplier, Powered by AI \r\nThe combination of ray tracing and AI technologies has revolutionized video games by simultaneously delivering dramatic improvements in image quality along with massive uplifts in performance \u2014 a feat unheard of before GeForce RTX.\nPowered by new fourth-generation Tensor Cores and a new Optical Flow Accelerator on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, DLSS 3 is the latest iteration of the company\u2019s critically acclaimed Deep Learning Super Sampling technology and introduces a new capability called Optical Multi Frame Generation.\nOptical Multi Frame Generation generates entirely new frames, rather than just pixels, delivering astounding performance boosts. The new Optical Flow Accelerator incorporated into the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture analyzes two sequential in-game images and calculates motion vector data for objects and elements that appear in the frame, but are not modeled by traditional game engine motion vectors. This dramatically reduces visual anomalies when AI renders elements such as particles, reflections, shadows and lighting.\nPairs of super-resolution frames from the game, along with both engine and optical flow motion vectors, are then fed into a convolutional neural network that analyzes the data and automatically generates an additional frame for each game-rendered frame \u2014 a first for real-time game rendering. Combining the DLSS-generated frames with the DLSS super-resolution frames enables DLSS 3 to reconstruct seven-eighths of the displayed pixels with AI, boosting frame rates by up to 4x compared to without DLSS.\nBecause DLSS Frame Generation executes as a post-process on the GPU, it can boost frame rates even when the game is bottlenecked by the CPU. For CPU-limited games, such as those that are physics heavy or involve large worlds, DLSS 3 allows the GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs to render the game at up to twice the frame rate that the CPU is able to compute the game.\nDLSS 3 integrations also incorporate NVIDIA Reflex, which synchronizes the GPU and CPU, ensuring optimum responsiveness and low system latency.\nGame Developers Embrace DLSS 3, Over 35 Games, Applications Coming Soon\r\nThe revolutionary power of DLSS 3 is a boon for game developers who want to express their artistic vision. The technology is coming to the world\u2019s most popular game engines, such as Unity and Unreal Engine.\nDLSS 3 has also received support from many of the world\u2019s leading game developers, with more than 35 games and applications announcing support, including:\n\n\n\n\n\nA Plague Tale: Requiem\nAtomic Heart\nBlack Myth: Wukong\nBright Memory: Infinite \nChernobylite\nConqueror's Blade\nCyberpunk 2077\nDakar Rally\nDeliver Us Mars\nDestroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed\nDying Light 2 Stay Human\nF1\u00ae 22\nF.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch\nFrostbite Engine\nHITMAN 3\nHogwarts Legacy \nICARUS\nJurassic World Evolution 2\nJustice\nLoopmancer\nWarhammer 40,000: Darktide\n\n\n\n\nMarauders\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator\nMidnight Ghost Hunt\nMount & Blade II: Bannerlord\nNaraka Bladepoint\nNVIDIA Omniverse\u2122\nNVIDIA Racer RTX\nPERISH\nPortal With RTX\nRipout\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R 2: Heart of Chornobyl\nScathe\nSword and Fairy 7\nSYNCED\nThe Lord of the Rings: Gollum\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt\nTHRONE AND LIBERTY\nTower of Fantasy\nUnity \nUnreal Engine 4 & 5\n\n\n\n\n\nSince DLSS 3 builds on top of DLSS 2 integrations, game developers can quickly enable it in existing titles that already support DLSS 2 or NVIDIA Streamline.\nDLSS 3 Coming Oct. 12\nDLSS 3 is supported in GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs and will debut on Wednesday, Oct. 12, with the availability of GeForce RTX 4090 GPUs. More details are available on GeForce.com and NVIDIA.com, including details on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs and NVIDIA DLSS technology.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

Since the release of DLSS, 216 games and apps have incorporated the technology, providing faster frame rates and the performance headroom to make real-time videogame ray tracing a reality.\nToday, we are excited to announce NVIDIA DLSS 3, the next revolution in neural graphics. Combining DLSS Super Resolution, all-new DLSS Frame Generation, and NVIDIA Reflex, running on the new hardware capabilities of GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, DLSS 3 multiplies performance by up to 4X over brute-force rendering. DLSS 3 is already being rapidly adopted by the ecosystem, with over 35 games and applications integrating the technology, the first of which launch in October.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Evolution of NVIDIA DLSS\nWhen we first introduced NVIDIA DLSS, we set out to redefine real-time rendering through AI-based super resolution - rendering fewer pixels and then using AI to construct sharp, higher resolution images. Less than two years later, we introduced the world to NVIDIA DLSS 2, which further improved image quality and performance with a generalized neural network that could adapt to all games and scenes without specific training. DLSS 2 is now widely adopted in 216 games and apps, along with support in Unity and Unreal Engine. DLSS 2 continues to improve through ongoing training on NVIDIA\u2019s AI supercomputer, with 4 major updates released to date, which have brought further enhancements to image quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing NVIDIA DLSS 3   - A Revolution in Neural Graphics\nDLSS 3 is a revolutionary breakthrough in AI-powered graphics that massively boosts performance, while maintaining great image quality and responsiveness. Building upon DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS 3 adds Optical Multi Frame Generation to generate entirely new frames, and integrates NVIDIA Reflex low latency technology for optimal responsiveness. DLSS 3 is powered by the new fourth-generation Tensor Cores and Optical Flow Accelerator of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, which powers GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards.\nThe DLSS Frame Generation convolutional autoencoder takes 4 inputs \u2013 current and prior game frames, an optical flow field generated by Ada\u2019s Optical Flow Accelerator, and game engine data such as motion vectors and depth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAda\u2019s Optical Flow Accelerator analyzes two sequential in-game frames and calculates an optical flow field. The optical flow field captures the direction and speed at which pixels are moving from frame 1 to frame 2. The Optical Flow Accelerator is able to capture pixel-level information such as particles, reflections, shadows, and lighting, which are not included in game engine motion vector calculations. In the motorcycle example below, the motion flow of the motorcyclist accurately represents that the shadow stays in roughly the same place on the screen with respect to their bike.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhereas the Optical Flow Accelerator accurately tracks pixel level effects such as reflections, DLSS 3 also uses game engine motion vectors to precisely track the movement of geometry in the scene. In the example below, game motion vectors accurately track the movement of the road moving past the motorcyclist, but not their shadow. Generating frames using engine motion vectors alone would result in visual anomalies like stuttering on the shadow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each pixel, the DLSS Frame Generation AI network decides how to use information from the game motion vectors, the optical flow field, and the sequential game frames to create intermediate frames. By using both engine motion vectors and optical flow to track motion, the DLSS Frame Generation network is able to accurately reconstruct both geometry and effects, as seen in the picture below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith DLSS 3 enabled, AI is reconstructing three-fourths of the first frame with DLSS Super Resolution, and reconstructing the entire second frame using DLSS Frame Generation. In total, DLSS 3 reconstructs seven-eighths of the total displayed pixels, increasing performance significantly!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3 also incorporates NVIDIA Reflex, which synchronizes the GPU and CPU, ensuring optimum responsiveness and low system latency. Lower system latency makes game controls more responsive, and ensures on-screen actions occur almost instantaneously once you click your mouse or other control input. When compared to native, DLSS 3 can reduce latency by up to 2X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a pre-release version of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s new Ray Tracing: Overdrive mode, DLSS 3 enables DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Frame Generation, and NVIDIA Reflex to boost performance by up to 4X, and increase responsiveness by 2X, compared to native resolution, all while maintaining great image quality.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 3 Can Double CPU Bound Performance\nDLSS Frame Generation executes as a post-process on the GPU, allowing the AI network to boost frame rates even when the game is bottlenecked by the CPU. For CPU-limited games, such as those that are physics-heavy or involve large worlds, DLSS 3 allows GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards to render at up to twice the frame rate over what the CPU is able to compute. In Microsoft Flight Simulator for example, with the 1:1 real-world recreation of our planet, DLSS 3 boosts FPS by up to 2X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 3 Multiplies Performance By Up To 4X\nAcross a set of games and engines, DLSS 3 helps increase GeForce RTX 40 Series performance by up to 4X compared to traditional rendering:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3 delivers total gaming performance, advanced AI networks and Reflex software algorithms, dedicated Tensor Core and Optical Flow hardware, and an NVIDIA Supercomputer that continuously trains and improves AI networks. GeForce RTX 40 Series users get faster frame rates, quick responsiveness, and great image quality, which is only possible through full stack innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 3: Available This October\nThe combination of ray tracing and AI technologies has revolutionized video games by simultaneously delivering dramatic improvements in image quality, along with massive uplifts in performance, a feat that was unheard of before the invention of RTX and DLSS.\nDLSS 3 builds upon our pioneering work in AI for games, boosting performance by up to 4X, making full ray-traced games a reality, and giving gamers the power to enjoy fully simulated worlds, as demonstrated by NVIDIA Racer RTX. \nAnd DLSS 3 has already received support from many of the world\u2019s leading game developers and engines, with more than 35 games and applications announcing support, the first of which launch in October.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3 games are backwards compatible with DLSS 2 technology. DLSS 3 technology is supported on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs. It includes 3 features: our new Frame Generation tech, Super Resolution (the key innovation of DLSS 2), and Reflex. Developers simply integrate DLSS 3, and DLSS 2 is supported by default. NVIDIA continues to improve DLSS 2 by researching and training the AI for DLSS Super Resolution, and will provide model updates for all GeForce RTX gamers, as we\u2019ve been doing since the initial release of DLSS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether with the other marvels of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, DLSS 3 delivers next-gen performance.

In creative apps, GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards provide up to 2X the performance in 3D rendering, video export speed, and AI tools.\nWith the new GeForce RTX 4090 and GeForce RTX 4080, your system will have the power to render fully simulated, fully ray-traced worlds at the highest resolutions, with incredible levels of detail and unbelievable performance. Portal with RTX, NVIDIA Racer RTX, and Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s new Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode launch soon, demonstrating the incredible experiences developers can now deliver with GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards.\nAda also powers new features that further enhance your experience: NVIDIA DLSS 3 multiplies frame rates using the new Optical Flow Accelerator; NVIDIA RTX Remix enables you to easily make incredible mods with ray tracing and DLSS for classic games, like Portal with RTX; Shader Execution Reordering revolutionizes ray-traced rendering; AV1 dual encoders speed up video exports by up to 2X, and significantly improve quality in livestreams and video calls.\nThe benefits of Ada extend to existing features, too. For gamers, NVIDIA Reflex makes your games even more responsive, with system latency as low as 10 milliseconds in top esports titles, and GeForce Experience can now record gameplay at up to 8K 60 FPS in HDR. For creators, NVIDIA Broadcast, a free NVIDIA Studio app that eliminates microphone background noise and enhances your camera for video calls and streams, applies effects up to 2X faster than prior gen. And NVIDIA Omniverse creators gain an average 2X speed up in real-time RTX ray tracing and interactive path tracing performance with Ada.\nGame developers and app creators are already taking advantage of these and other Ada enhancements, bringing NVIDIA DLSS 3 to over 35 games and apps, including A Plague Tale: Requiem, Cyberpunk 2077, Microsoft Flight Simulator, and Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, and top real-time 3D apps, including Unreal Engine, Unity, and NVIDIA Omniverse. Full ray tracing is coming to Cyberpunk 2077, Justice, and Portal with RTX. NVIDIA Reflex launches soon in 8 new games, including Overwatch 2 and Cyberpunk 2077. And all features are supported by our extensively-tested Game Ready and NVIDIA Studio drivers.\nWhen you upgrade to the GeForce RTX 40 Series, you\u2019re not just getting the fastest GPUs in existence, you\u2019re being welcomed into the world\u2019s most advanced GPU ecosystem, filled with applications and technologies that leverage our decades of experience, industry-leading AI, and class-leading hardware to enhance your PC experience every second of every day.\nWatch our GeForce Beyond presentation on demand, and read-on below for more details about each announcement.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best gaming platform in the world just got better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarvels Of The NVIDIA Ada Lovelace Architecture\nThe NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture at the heart of each GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics card delivers a massive generational leap in performance, efficiency and capabilities. Built on a custom TSMC 4N process, with up to 76 billion transistors (compared to last-gen\u2019s 28 billion), Ada is the world\u2019s most advanced GPU architecture ever created.\nAda is incredibly efficient, with over twice the performance at the same power compared to Ampere, and excellent scalability and overclockability as power is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Ada Lovelace Streaming Multiprocessors\nStreaming Multiprocessors (SMs) deliver much of the performance for your games. Having previously doubled peak FP32 throughput last-gen, we\u2019re now more than doubling peak throughput with the launch of Ada, packing up to 90-TFLOPs of Shader power on NVIDIA GPUs, with 83-TFLOPs on the GeForce RTX 4090. That\u2019s compared to the 40 Shader-TFLOPS of our fastest previous-gen GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShader Execution Reordering\nGPU architecture is highly parallelized and at its most efficient when executing similar workloads at the same time. However, advanced ray tracing requires computing the impact of millions of rays striking numerous different material types throughout a scene, creating a sequence of divergent, inefficient workloads for shaders (shaders calculate the appropriate levels of light, darkness, and color during the rendering of a 3D scene, and are used in every modern game).\nOur new Shader Execution Reordering (SER) technology dynamically reorganizes these previously-inefficient workloads into considerably more efficient ones, improving shader performance by up to 2X, and in-game frame rates by up to 25%!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3rd Generation Ray Tracing Cores\nNVIDIA made real-time videogame ray tracing a reality with the invention of Ray Tracing Cores, dedicated processing cores on the GPU specifically designed to tackle performance-intensive ray tracing workloads. Ada\u2019s 3rd generation Ray Tracing Cores have twice the ray-triangle intersection throughput, increasing peak RT-TFLOP performance by up to an astounding 2.8X. On the GeForce RTX 4090, gamers and creators will have 191 RT-TFLOPS of power at their disposal, compared to the 78 RT-TFLOPS of our fastest previous-gen GPU, enabling far more immersive ray-traced worlds to be rendered, at far faster speeds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAda\u2019s 3rd gen RT Cores also introduce Opacity Micro-Map Engines and Micro-Mesh Engines, two new hardware units for the acceleration of demanding ray-traced workloads, used in concert with new software techniques detailed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4th Generation Tensor Cores\nNVIDIA Tensor Cores enable and accelerate transformative AI technologies, including NVIDIA DLSS, which is available in 216 released games and apps, and the new frame rate multiplying NVIDIA DLSS 3. Millions of GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX users also leverage Tensor Cores to enhance their broadcasts, and video and voice calls, in the free NVIDIA Broadcast app.\nAda\u2019s new 4th Generation Tensor Cores are unbelievably fast, with an all new 8-Bit Floating Point (FP8) Tensor Engine, increasing throughput by up to 5X, to 1.32 Tensor-petaFLOPS on the GeForce RTX 4090.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Optical Flow Accelerator\nNVIDIA DLSS 3\u2019s Frame Generation technology is powered by Ada\u2019s new Optical Flow Accelerator, which feeds pixel motion data from subsequent frames to the DLSS neural network, generating new frames on the GPU, ensuring performance accelerates even in CPU-bound scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDual AV1 Encoders\nGeForce RTX 4090 and GeForce RTX 4080 graphics cards feature two of our new eighth-generation NVIDIA Encoders (NVENC), now with support for AV1 encoding, enabling a raft of new possibilities for livestreamers, video editors and video callers.\nFor livestreamers, AV1 improves encoding efficiency by 40% - your livestreams will look as if you were using 40% more bitrate. OBS Studio, the leading streaming app, is collaborating with NVIDIA to enable AV1 encoding within its next software release, expected in October. OBS is also optimizing encoding pipelines to reduce overhead by 35% for all NVIDIA GPUs. Video callers also get the benefits of high quality live streaming, with Discord adding AV1 support later this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor video editors, the dual encoders are up to 2X faster, saving creators hours upon hours each week. We\u2019ve collaborated with DaVinci Resolve, Voukoder - a popular plugin for Adobe Premiere Pro - and Jianying - China\u2019s most popular video editing app - to enable this feature on the top video editing apps. The updates will be available in October. And if you are interested in capturing high-res content for your videos, GeForce Experience users with GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards can now use NVIDIA ShadowPlay to capture gameplay at up to 8K at 60 FPS, in HDR.\nLearn more about all the benefits of 8th gen encoders in our NVIDIA Studio article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Software Accelerates & Optimizes Performance  \nNVIDIA is at the forefront of graphics research and development, with subject matter experts devising new and better ways to deliver immersive experiences at performant frame rates. With the creation of Ada, our GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards can leverage new features that greatly accelerate advanced ray-traced workloads, and deliver even faster frame rates in your favorite games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 3 Multiplies Frame Rates\nNVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is a groundbreaking revolution in AI-powered graphics, increasing performance on GeForce RTX GPUs using dedicated Tensor Cores. To date, 216 released games and apps accelerate performance with DLSS, while generating beautiful, sharp images that maintain \u2013 and in some cases improve upon - the native picture.\nAda introduces DLSS 3, adding new AI-powered Optical Multi Frame Generation, which generates entirely new high quality frames, rather than just pixels. Through a process detailed in full in our NVIDIA DLSS 3 article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Frame Generation, and NVIDIA Reflex to reconstruct 7/8ths of the displayed pixels, accelerating performance significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn GPU-limited games, DLSS 2 and its Super Resolution technology can increase your frame rates by up to 2X. With DLSS 3, we can boost them by up to 4X in fully ray-traced worlds like those seen in the incredible NVIDIA Racer RTX.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertain games make extensive use of the CPU, limiting the benefit of faster graphics cards and Super Resolution technologies. DLSS 3 operates on the GPU, bypassing CPU bottlenecks and boosting frame rates. In Microsoft Flight Simulator, with a 1:1 real-world recreation of our planet, DLSS 3 boosts frame rates by up to 2X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 3 is one of our greatest neural rendering inventions, and it\u2019s powered by our new 4th gen Tensor Cores and Optical Flow Accelerator. NVIDIA\u2019s DLSS Supercomputer also continuously trains and improves the AI networks, delivering further quality enhancements via driver and game updates.\u00a0\nNVIDIA DLSS 3 is coming to over 35 games and apps, with the first games arriving in October. Get further details about all of the games in our #RTXON games article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame developers looking to integrate DLSS 3 can learn more here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpacity Micro-Maps\nOpacity Micro-Maps optimize ray tracing by encoding data about game details directly onto the world\u2019s objects in the game engine ahead of time. Complex items, like foliage, are especially demanding to ray trace due to the many different ways rays can affect their appearance based on scene lighting, and the innumerable directions rays can bounce between leaves and branches. The 3rd generation RT Core present in Ada GPUs uses opacity masks to assign the opacity state of these items, which can be opaque, transparent, or unknown.\nBy baking the ray tracing characteristics of irregularly-shaped and translucent objects into an opacity mask, the 3rd generation RT Cores render these complex objects faster, improving performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplaced Micro-Meshes  \nDisplaced Micro-Meshes (DMM) are generated by Ada\u2019s 3rd generation RT Cores, which build ray tracing Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH) 10X faster, using 20X less VRAM. DMMs are new primitives that represent a structured mesh of micro-triangles that 3rd gen RT Cores process natively, reducing storage and processing requirements compared to previous-generations, when rendering complex geometries using only basic triangles.\nDMM is particularly beneficial in highly detailed ray-traced games and scenes, and gives developers the performance to create photo-real games and experiences that leverage photogrammetry, and super-detailed objects and surfaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 4090: 2X The Performance Of GeForce RTX 3090 Ti\nAvailable October 12th, 2022, starting at $1599, the GeForce RTX 4090 is the ultimate GeForce GPU for gamers and creators, running up to twice as fast, using the same amount of power as the previous-generation champ, the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti.

The house sits on a land area of 7,987 sq ft. Hence, the asking price works out to $373 psf. As the 99-year lease on the land started from 1978, there are 55 years remaining on the lease.  The seller of the detached house is a company, and the property will be put up for sale by auction on Sept 30 by SRI. The house at Pasir Ris Avenue is one street away from Pasir Ris Park and a short walk from Pasir Ris Beach. It is located within a landed housing area with about 120 houses, bordered by Pasir Ris Heights, Pasir Ris Road and Elias Road. Read also:\u00a0Linden Drive bungalow for sale at $27 mil    Dining area (SRI Auction) The houses fronting the park and the beach, especially those along Pasir Ris Avenue and Pasir Ris Road, are predominantly detached and semi-detached houses, and were built sometime in the early 1980s. They tend to have 99-year leases from 1978. Many of these houses are believed to have been sold to companies over the past decades to be used for corporate retreats, given the idyllic location. The double-storey house that is currently on the market is one such house. The property is just a short walk from the park and beach. It has a built-up area of 3,789 sq ft and a total of five bedrooms. According to Mok Sze Sze, managing partner of auction and sales at SRI, given the land size of 7,987 sq ft, the future buyer could redevelop the property into two semi-detached houses, subject to approval from the authorities.    Living area (SRI Auction) Alternatively, additions and alterations could be made to the existing house before the buyers move in, adds Mok. The house has a car porch large enough for two cars. There is also a garden, with a children\u2019s play area and barbeque pits. Despite its shortening lease, Mok expects the property to appeal to both investors and owner-occupiers due to the attractive land size, and possible redevelopment potential. Interest has come mainly from owner-occupiers, she notes. The houses in this enclave of Pasir Ris are near Downtown East mall and Wild Wild Wet water park, Changi Village and malls in Tampines Central. The upcoming Elias MRT Station on the Cross Island Line is about a 10-minute walk from the neighbourhood. It is scheduled for completion in 2032.  The latest detached house to change hands in the neighbourhood this year is located along Elias Road. The property sits on a 999-year leasehold site of 4,793 sq ft and changed hands for $5.49 million ($1,145 psf). Previously, another detached house along Pasir Ris Way had changed hands for $2.95 million, according to a caveat lodged in June 2021. The detached house sits on a site area of 4,981 sq ft, with a 99-year lease from 1978. Both these properties are also a short walk from Pasir Ris Park and the beach.   Story continues The most recent rental transaction of a detached house in this landed housing area is for a property along Pasir Ris Road. It sits on a land area of 4,100 sq ft to 4,200 sq ft and commands a monthly rental rate of $14,500, according to URA data.Check out the latest listings near Pasir Ris Avenue, Pasir Ris WaySee Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) Mortgagee sale of three-bedder at The Peak @ Balmeg for $2.75 mil Freehold conservation shophouse in Balestier on the block for $4.29 mil  Freehold corner terraced house at Countryside Road sold for $5.01 mil En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

With up to 4x the performance of the previous generation, Ada is setting a new standard for the industry,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0\nDLSS 3 Generates Entire Frames for Faster Game Play\r\nHuang also announced NVIDIA DLSS 3 \u2014 the next revolution in the company\u2019s Deep Learning Super Sampling neural-graphics technology for games and creative apps. The AI-powered technology can generate entire frames for massively faster game play. It can overcome CPU performance limitations in games by allowing the GPU to generate entire frames independently.\nThe technology is coming to the world\u2019s most popular game engines, such as Unity and Unreal Engine, and has received support from many of the world\u2019s leading game developers, with more than 35 games and apps coming soon.\nAdditionally, the RTX 40 Series GPUs feature a range of new technological innovations, including:\n\nStreaming multiprocessors with up to 83 teraflops of shader power \u2014 2x over the previous generation.\nThird-generation RT Cores with up to 191 effective ray-tracing teraflops \u2014 2.8x over the previous generation.\nFourth-generation Tensor Cores with up to 1.32 Tensor petaflops \u2014 5x over the previous generation using FP8 acceleration.\nShader Execution Reordering (SER) that improves execution efficiency by rescheduling shading workloads on the fly to better utilize the GPU\u2019s resources. As significant an innovation as out-of-order execution was for CPUs, SER improves ray-tracing performance up to 3x and in-game frame rates by up to 25%.\nAda Optical Flow Accelerator with 2x faster performance allows DLSS 3 to predict movement in a scene, enabling the neural network to boost frame rates while maintaining image quality.\nArchitectural improvements tightly coupled with custom TSMC 4N process technology results in an up to 2x leap in power efficiency.\nDual NVIDIA Encoders (NVENC) cut export times by up to half and feature AV1 support. The NVENC AV1 encode is being adopted by OBS, Blackmagic Design DaVinci Resolve, Discord and more.\n\nNew Ray-Tracing Tech for Even More Immersive Games\r\nFor decades, rendering ray-traced scenes with physically correct lighting in real time has been considered the holy grail of graphics. At the same time, geometric complexity of environments and objects has continued to increase as 3D games and graphics strive to provide the most accurate representations of the real world.\nAchieving physically accurate graphics requires tremendous computational horsepower. Modern ray-traced games like Cyberpunk 2077 run over 600 ray-tracing calculations for each pixel just to determine lighting \u2014 a 16x increase from the first ray-traced games introduced four years ago.\nThe new third-generation RT Cores have been enhanced to deliver 2x faster ray-triangle intersection testing and include two important new hardware units. An Opacity Micromap Engine speeds up ray tracing of alpha-test geometry by a factor of 2x, and a Micro-Mesh Engine generates micro-meshes on the fly to generate additional geometry. The Micro-Mesh Engine provides the benefits of increased geometric complexity without the traditional performance and storage costs of complex geometries.\n\n\nCreativity Redefined With RTX Remix, New AV1 Encoders\r\nThe RTX 40 Series GPUs and DLSS 3 deliver advancements for NVIDIA Studio creators. 3D artists can render fully ray-traced environments with accurate physics and realistic materials, and view the changes in real time, without proxies.\nVideo editing and live streaming also get a boost from improved GPU performance and the inclusion of new dual, eighth-generation AV1 encoders. The NVIDIA Broadcast software development kit has three updates, now available for partners, including Face Expression Estimation, Eye Contact and quality improvements to Virtual Background.\nNVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 \u2014 included in the NVIDIA Studio suite of software \u2014 will soon add NVIDIA RTX Remix, a modding platform to create stunning RTX remasters of classic games. RTX Remix allows modders to easily capture game assets, automatically enhance materials with powerful AI tools, and quickly enable RTX with ray tracing and DLSS.\nPortal Is RTX ON!\r\nRTX Remix has been used by NVIDIA Lightspeed Studios to reimagine Valve\u2019s iconic video game Portal, regarded as one of the best video games of all time. Advanced graphics features such as full ray tracing and DLSS 3 give the game a striking new look and feel. Portal with RTX will be released as free, official downloadable content for the classic platformer with RTX graphics in November, just in time for Portal\u2019s 15th anniversary.\nThe GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080: The New Ultimate GPUs\r\nThe RTX 4090 is the world\u2019s fastest gaming GPU with astonishing power, acoustics and temperature characteristics. In full ray-traced games, the RTX 4090 with DLSS 3 is up to 4x faster compared to last generation\u2019s RTX 3090 Ti with DLSS 2. It is also up to 2x faster in today\u2019s games while maintaining the same 450W power consumption. It features 76 billion transistors, 16,384 CUDA\u00ae cores and 24GB of high-speed Micron GDDR6X memory, and consistently delivers over 100 frames per second at 4K-resolution gaming. The RTX 4090 will be available on Wednesday, Oct. 12, starting at $1,599.\nThe company also announced the RTX 4080, launching in two configurations. The RTX 4080 16GB has 9,728 CUDA cores and 16GB of high-speed Micron GDDR6X memory, and with DLSS 3 is 2x as fast in today\u2019s games as the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and more powerful than the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti at lower power. The RTX 4080 12GB has 7,680 CUDA cores and 12GB of Micron GDDR6X memory, and with DLSS 3 is faster than the RTX 3090 Ti, the previous-generation flagship GPU.\nBoth RTX 4080 configurations will be available in November, with prices starting at $1,199 and $899, respectively.\n\nWhere to Buy\r\nThe GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 GPUs will be available as custom boards, including stock-clocked and factory-overclocked models, from top add-in card providers such as ASUS, Colorful, Gainward, Galaxy, GIGABYTE, Inno3D, MSI, Palit, PNY and Zotac.\nThe RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 (16GB) are also produced directly by NVIDIA in limited Founders Editions for fans wanting the NVIDIA in-house design.\nLook for the GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs in gaming systems built by Acer, Alienware, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and MSI, leading system builders worldwide, and many more.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

(PHOTO: PS.Cafe)  \u00b7 PS.Cafe By Elffie Chew and Manuel Baigorri (Bloomberg) \u2014 Sun Venture, a Singapore-based investment firm, is considering a deal for the remaining shares it doesn\u2019t own in the parent of restaurant chain PS.Cafe, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The potential transaction values the closely-held PSGourmet Pte Ltd at about S$300 million, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the process is private. Sun Venture owns a majority stake in the firm and is in talks with banks to secure financing for a buyout, the people said.  Deliberations are ongoing and there is no guarantee that Sun Venture, which is backed by Taiwanese and Singaporean investors, will proceed with the deal, the people said. Representatives for Sun Venture and PSGourmet didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment by phone, email and LinkedIn. PS.Cafe, which is known for dishes such as truffle shoestring fries as well as cakes, puddings and tarts, opened its doors within the Projectshop clothing store in Singapore in 1999, according to its website. The PSGourmet group now includes 10 PS.Cafes, Anglo-Chinese brand Chopsuey Cafe and contemporary Japanese restaurant JYPSY. The group has two outlets in Shanghai, opening the first in 2018. Sun Venture was established in 2006 and invests globally in asset classes such as public equities, fixed income, private market funds and real estate, as well as private equity and alternatives, its website shows. Its private equity portfolio also includes content delivery network provider Conversant and freight and logistics solutions company Satsaco. \u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.

Hundreds of millions of fans and enthusiasts visit or watch the event from all over the world, with millions of dollars poured into it \u2013 from the logistics to the organising of the event itself.  Similar to other large international sporting events such as the Olympics (and its offshoots such as Youth Olympics and Winter Olympics), the F1 has become a huge marketing and business opportunity for the country/city hosting it. In 2008, Singapore took that chance and hosted the world\u2019s first F1 night race Read Also: Guide To Car Sharing Options In Singapore: Blue SG, Tribecar, Car Club, WhizzCar, CarLite, Shariot, GetGo, Drive lah F1 in Singapore Started In 2008  The opportunity to host the F1 started in 2006 when then F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone invited Singapore to host an F1 event in 2008. Having previous aspirations to host the event in Singapore, the owner of Singapore GP Pte Ltd, Mr Ong Beng Seng, and the Singapore government inked a deal for Singapore to host the F1 event for five years. On the 26th of September 2008, the world\u2019s first F1 night race was hosted in Singapore on a 5.063km track consisting of 24 turns under the Singapore tropical night sky.  The initial contract to host the F1 lasted from 2008 to 2013. Singapore GP Pte Ltd and The Singapore Tourism Board went to sign another 4-year extension from 2018 to 2022. Unfortunately, in 2019, the coronavirus pandemic took place and major events like the F1 were cancelled, until now. On the 24th of March 2022, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced COVID-19 relaxation measures for Singapore, just in time for the upcoming 2022 Singapore F1 Grand Prix from the 30th of September to the 2nd of October.

This helps keep the total cost outlay of the event lower for the taxpayers, while still allowing the private entities who directly benefit from the event (e.g., hoteliers, F&B operators) to earn from the event. According to Statista, F1 viewership in 2008 was 600 million and there was a significant drop to 352.3 million in 2016. Countries like Malaysia and Australia even reported making losses, with Malaysia eventually pulling out of hosting the F1 in 2017. However, viewership has increased since 2016 to 445 million in 2021. The 2019 Singapore Grand Prix reached a viewership of 86 million television viewers globally, which was one of the highest global viewership of any international sporting event.   Story continues As Singapore inks a new deal to host the event for the next 7 years, the cost is estimated to be between $135 million to $140 million. While hefty, this amount is likely to be outweighed by what Singapore may reap from hosting the races.Read Also: How Much You Can Save With An Off-Peak Car \u00a0Singapore\u2019s Tourism Has Directly Benefited From The F1Since its launch, the Singapore F1 event has brought in increased profits for businesses in Singapore and attracted more than 550,000 international visitors so far. According to MTI, the Singapore Grand Prix generated around $130 million in annual incremental spending from tourists attending the race since 2008.Hoteliers, Food & Beverage companies and other tourism-related industries have also reported an uptick in transactions from previous F1 events and will likely continue to do so in the 2022 F1 Singapore Grand Prix.There Are Also Indirect Benefits In Hosting The F1 Aside from the direct increase in tourism receipts, there are other indirect benefits of hosting the F1. \u00a0The festivities that come with the event such as live performances by famous artists inject energy and vibrancy into our arts and nightlife scene. This year\u2019s event boasts big names like Westlife, Marshmallow and Green Day to wow the crowd with their performances.According to MTI\u2019s parliamentary reply on F1, hosting the F1 event has other benefits for Singapore\u2019s economy and its citizens. 90% of the race organisation is subcontracted to Singaporean companies, not only showcasing the efficiency of our local businesses but also directly profiting these businesses. The race also brought in more than 30 Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE) events each year.The F1 event also brought in $70 to $75 million in media value in 2019, with around 86 million viewers worldwide. This has brought in great media representation for Singapore and showcased the beauty, splendour, safety and opportunities to do business in Singapore.Extending the F1 Singapore Grand Prix Till 2028Given the overall beneficial nature of hosting the F1, Singapore has signed a fourth contract renewal to host the Formula 1 Grand Prix for another 7 years. This is the longest extension for the race and will mean that Singaporeans will be able to enjoy the annual F1 race on the streets of Marina Bay until 2028.As the pandemic has caused much disruption to trade, commerce, and tourism, the resumption of international events is especially important to the Singapore economy. By leveraging on the F1 event, Singapore can establish itself as a frontrunner in business continuity during the pandemic and help local businesses to be able to establish their presence during an international event.The post How Much Does It Cost For Singapore To Host The F1  appeared first on DollarsAndSense.sg.

New heights in raw power also came with new heights as far as MSRP, which falls in the $899 to $1,599 range for the 40-series cards.\nWhen asked about those price increases, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told the gathered press to, in effect, get used to it. \"Moore's law is dead,\" Huang said during a Q&A, as reported by Digital Trends. \"A 12-inch wafer is a lot more expensive today. The idea that the chip is going to go down in price is a story of the past.\"\nSorry, how expensive?\nIn justifying Nvidia's price increases, Huang defended the raw power of the 40-series cards compared with past offerings. \"The performance of Nvidia's $899 GPU or $1,599 GPU a year ago, two years ago, at the same price point, our performance with Ada Lovelace is monumentally better,\" he said. \"Off-the-charts better.\"\nBut those price comparisons are a bit misleading. True, the $1,599 flagship RTX 4090 is only $100 more expensive than the $1,499 launch price for the RTX 3090 in 2020. Adjusted for inflation (which has been unusually high in recent years), the launch RTX 3090 would cost more than $1,700 in August 2022 dollars, making today's RTX 4090 look like a relative bargain.\nWhen you look at the lower tiers, the price increases begin to look a bit less reasonable. The RTX 4080 line\u2014split into $899 and $1,199 pricing tiers\u2014is significantly more expensive than the $699 and $799 launch prices for the two tiers of RTX 3080 cards in 2020. Even accounting for inflation, those cards would have launched at about $800 and $900 in today's dollars, well below what Nvidia is asking for its RTX 4080 cards now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's more, the 40-series thus far has nothing even approaching the launch price of the lowest-cost 30-series option Nvidia offered in 2020\u2014the RTX 3070, which cost $499 back then (about $567 in today's dollars). And there are rumors that Nvidia's low-end 4080 card is on a less-performant chipset than its more expensive cousin, making it more technologically similar to the 3070 from the last generation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia says the high cost of its new Ada Lovelace architecture comes with plenty of additional processing power.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Nvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Nvidia says the high cost of its new Ada Lovelace architecture comes with plenty of additional processing power.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n                      \n          \n          Nvidia\n\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\nSure, one could argue that the RTX 30-series cards were priced too low\u2014those cards were exceptionally tough to find at their launch MSRPs at the time, in large part due to extreme interest from cryptocurrency miners. But the days of widespread GPU shortages are now long gone, as cratering crypto prices and changes in the GPU crypto mining landscape have led second-hand GPU prices to fall steadily for months. Nvidia explicitly noted this trend in August, warning investors that crypto market effects \"may reduce demand for our new GPUs.\"\nIf we can\u2019t do it, someone else can?\nGenerational price comparisons aside, Huang's blanket assertion that \"Moore's law is dead\" is a bit shocking for a company whose bread and butter has been releasing graphics cards that roughly double in comparable processing power every year. But the prediction is far from a new one, either for Huang\u2014who said the same thing in 2019 and 2017\u2014or for the wider industry\u2014the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors formally announced it would stop chasing the benchmark in its 2016 roadmap for chip development.\nYou could write an entire book on the implications of Moore's law (and Ars practically has), but the core assertion laid out by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 has remained remarkably prescient: The number of transistors per chip (keeping size/price relatively constant) roughly doubles every year (in a later update, Moore would amend the doubling time to 24 months).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Kevin Kelly laid out in a 2009 piece, though, Moore's law is best understood not as a law of physics but as a law of economics and corporate motivation. Processing power keeps doubling partly because consumers expect it to keep doubling and finding uses for that extra power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                AMD's upcoming RDNA 3 chipset could up the pressure to keep up with Moore's law.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          AMD\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      AMD's upcoming RDNA 3 chipset could up the pressure to keep up with Moore's law.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          AMD\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nThat consumer demand, in turn, pushes companies to find new ways to keep pace with expectations. In the recent past, that market push led to innovations like tri-gate 3D transistors and production process improvements that continually shrink the size of individual transistors, which IBM can now push out at just 2 nm.\nThe point here is that Huang's purported \"death of Moore's law\" isn't entirely up to Nvidia. Even if Nvidia can no longer keep its processor power increases on trend at consistent prices, they're not the only game in town. AMD, for instance, is already teasing that its soon-to-be-announced RDNA 3 cards could sport some larger-than-expected improvements in efficiency and overall processing power, thanks to some new chiplet-based designs.\nWhile it's much too soon to say how AMD and Nvidia's new chips will compare, this is the kind of market competition that has traditionally kept hardware makers from becoming too complacent in the push toward new frontiers of relative hardware power (see also: Apple Silicon versus previous Intel-based Macintoshes). In other words, even if Nvidia can't figure out how to keep up with Moore's law these days, someone else might.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Nvidia\u2019s Ada Lovelace GPU generation: $1,599 for RTX 4090, $899 and up for 4080\n          \n\n            4090 launches October 12; 4080 to follow in \"November.\"\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            The end of Ethereum mining could be a bonanza for GPU shoppers\n          \n\n            Graphics card prices have been dropping all year\u2014and could go even lower.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Classic.Ars: Understanding Moore's Law\n          \n\n            In this installment of Classic.Ars, we take you back to April of 1965, when  \u2026\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle Orland\nSenior Gaming Editor\n\n\n\n\nKyle Orland\nSenior Gaming Editor\n\n\n      Kyle Orland has been the Senior Gaming Editor at Ars Technica since 2012, writing primarily about the business, tech, and culture behind video games.

The just-released Windows 11 2022 Update is causing a lot of bugs and performance issues, particularly in machines with Nvidia graphics cards. That\u2019s according to a host of users on Reddit and other spots around the web. The complaints are now widespread enough that there\u2019s definitely something behind them, even if it isn\u2019t clear yet quite what it is. \nUpdate: Nvidia has formally addresses the Windows 11 2H22 issues with a beta update to the GeForce Experience app, available for download now. An update to the release version and the full Nvidia GPU driver is expected soon. Our original coverage of the performance woes continues below\nEarly adopters on Reddit and elsewhere are complaining of higher-than-normal CPU usage, resulting in significant stuttering and a drop in frames per second in a variety of games. Others report audio glitches and the occasional full system crash, the dreaded Blue Screen of Death, according to Windows Latest. \n\n\nDespite the vehement outcry, these problems might be affecting only a small percentage of users. However many Windows Insiders experienced the problem, it wasn\u2019t enough to stop the sizeable update from heading out into the general population (or, to be fair, it\u2019s possible that Microsoft\u2019s engineers decided to kick the can down to Nvidia post-release). Of course, that would be little comfort to the users who are seeing the issue, and don\u2019t have an easy way to fix it. \nHowever widespread it is, Nvidia is aware of the problem, and presumably working on a driver-level fix via an update. In the meantime, some users are finding relief by killing the NVIDIA FrameView SDK service in the Task Manager and rebooting their system. If troubles persist, you can roll back the 2022 Update and wait for these wrinkles to be ironed out.Update: Over the weekend Nvidia directly addressed the widespread performance issues, posting a new beta version of the GeForce Experience app that reportedly fixes the problem. While it\u2019s an odd move to put the fix in Nvidia\u2019s add-on application instead of the standard GPU driver package itself, gamers suffering from dramatic performance decreases aren\u2019t about to look a gift horse in the mouth. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\nThe download is also available within GeForce Experience itself, by opening the Settings menu and selecting \u201cEnable Experimental Features.\u201d If you don\u2019t want to use GeForce Experience, Nvidia says that a new Game Ready Driver will be released \u201cthe week of September 26.\u201d\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Michael Crider, Staff Writer, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael is a 10-year veteran of technology journalism, covering everything from Apple to ZTE.

Whether for design reviews or virtual collaboration, advanced XR solutions enable professionals to tackle complex workflows while maintaining productivity and efficiency.\nLenovo\u2019s new all-in-one VR headset was built with enterprise use cases in mind. Users can stream immersive experiences using ThinkReality VRX as a standalone device, or tethered to a PC or workstation. And with NVIDIA CloudXR, they can easily stream and deliver high-quality, photorealistic XR experiences.\nNVIDIA CloudXR allows creative and technical professionals to take advantage of powerful NVIDIA RTX GPUs to stream to their Lenovo ThinkReality VRX and collaborate in high-fidelity, immersive virtual environments from any location.\n\nEnhancing Immersive Experiences From Anywhere\u00a0\nThe ThinkReality VRX headset incorporates several key design advancements to make it more comfortable for extended VR sessions in the office, at home or wherever the hybrid workforce is getting things done.\nInnovative pancake optics and a slim design reduce the overall profile of the headset, while optimal battery position for better weight distribution and balance provides a better fit and feel. Pass-through technology also offers mixed-reality (MR) application capabilities, allowing users to superimpose 3D graphics on the real world so workers can get more done with a single XR device.\nThe Lenovo ThinkReality VRX is supported by a full suite of end-to-end services \u2014 from consulting and content creation to cloud deployment and customer support \u2014 to help organizations achieve success in the new realities of the business environment. The built-in ThinkReality software platform includes mobile device management features to make deployment and configuration of the VRX simpler for IT teams.\nAnd with NVIDIA CloudXR, which is built on NVIDIA RTX technology, users can choose from a variety of configurations and setups. Professionals and developers can easily stream experiences over 5G or WiFi to the ThinkReality VRX headset from a Lenovo desktop, laptop or server \u2014 which can be at home or in a data center hundreds of miles away.\nCloudXR dynamically adjusts to network conditions, so it can maximize quality and frame rates to deliver the best XR experience. And CloudXR delivers immersive content to the Lenovo ThinkReality VRX with a level of fidelity that\u2019s indistinguishable from native tethered configurations.\n\nThe ThinkReality VRX also supports enterprise-grade security practices with a secure supply chain and manufacturing process that thoroughly vets every component and service supplier.\nThe Lenovo ThinkReality VRX will be available in select markets starting early next year.\nLearn more about NVIDIA CloudXR and Lenovo ThinkReality VRX.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: CloudXR | NVIDIA RTX | Virtual Reality \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe launch of the Nvidia RTX 40-series and Ada Lovelace GPUs has been greeted with a range of emotions. Excitement from some, disbelief from others, and outright scorn from many. In building a GPU that promises to outperform the best graphics cards, Nvidia has gone big \u2014 big and expensive. AMD, on the other hand, is using a more cost-effective technology that could make its upcoming RDNA cards more appealing, more affordable choice.\n\nWhile we're not privy to Nvidia's Bill of Materials (BOM), the high price of Nvidia's GPUs is largely due to the company's refusal to embrace \"Moore's Law 2.0\" and look to things like chiplets. AMD started beating Intel on CPUs when it switched to chiplets, especially on cost, and now they're about to do the same for GPUs. Putting the analog memory interfaces on an older process with RDNA 3 is a brilliant approach, since analog scales very poorly with newer process nodes. The same goes for cache.\u00a0\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nWatch On \nLooking at the AD102 die shots Nvidia has posted so far, we know the die size is 608mm^2. That's only slightly smaller than GA102 at 628mm^2, but now Nvidia is on a cutting edge TSMC 4N process node instead of Samsung 8N. Pricing on the wafers definitely shot up, and we had multiple stories in the past year about TSMC raising prices. That's all coming to bear.\n\nThe AD102 die pictured below \u2014 which is a rendering but it's the best we've got \u2014 shows some clear details of how and why Nvidia's latest tour de force costs more than the previous generation chips. Flip through the gallery for annotated versions of the image.Image 1 of 6(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia / Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Nvidia / Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Nvidia / Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Nvidia / Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Nvidia / Tom's Hardware)The twelve Graphics Processing Clusters (GPCs) are easily distinguishable from the rest of the chip, and each of those has 12 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs). All of the GPCs and SMs together take up about 45% of the total die area. Where does the rest go?\n\nThe twelve 32-bit GDDR6X memory controllers use up most of the outside edge of the die, with the PCIe x16 connector using about a third of the bottom edge. The memory controllers and related circuitry take up a hefty 17% of the die area, give or take. But that's not the only part of the memory subsystem, as Nvidia has a much larger L2 cache than on previous designs.\n\nYou can see the six 16MB chunks of L3 in the center section of the die, with some related routing and other circuitry (ROPs?) around it. The L2 cache blocks are at least 15% of the total die area, while the entire center portion of the die (L2 plus other logic) takes up 25% of the total. The remainder of the die at the bottom is dedicated to things like the dual NVENC encoders, the PCIe interface and physical display interfaces. It's about 7% of the total, and then there are a few other miscellaneous bits scattered around that take up the last ~6% of the die.(Image credit: Nvidia)The point of discussing those die areas is to help put things in perspective. Nvidia, with its monolithic approach on the AD102 chip, has dedicated roughly 33% of the total die area just to memory interfaces and L2 cache. AMD's MCD (Memory Chiplet Die) approach used with its Radeon RX 7000-series and RDNA 3 GPUs will apparently move nearly all of that off the main chiplet, and it will reportedly use TSMC N6 instead of TSMC N5, reducing price and improving yields at the same time.\n\nTSMC doesn't reveal its contract negotiations with large partners like Apple, AMD, Intel, or Nvidia. However, there are reports that TSMC N5 (and thus 4N, which is more or less just \"refined\" N5) costs at least twice as much as TSMC N7/N6. With a 608mm^2 die size for AD102, Nvidia can only get around 90 full dies per wafer \u2014 and for reference, that's only about two more chips per wafer than GA102.\n\nIf TSMC 4N costs more than twice as much per wafer as Samsung 8N, that means AD102 costs more than twice as much per chip as the previous generation GA102 and the RTX 3090. Gordon Mah Ung of PC World asked Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during a Q&A session about pricing. I'll go ahead and quote it directly to put things in context.\n\nGordon: [RTX] 4000 is finally here, which for you I'm sure feels like a huge launch. The reaction universally I'm seeing out there is, \"Oh, my God. It costs so much money.\" Is there anything you would like to say to the community regarding pricing on the new generational parts? As well as, can they expect to see better pricing at some point and basically address all the loud screams that I'm seeing everywhere?\"\n\nJensen: \"First of all, a 12 inch wafer is a lot more expensive today than it was yesterday. And it's not a little bit more expensive, it is a ton more expensive. Moore's law is dead. And the ability for Moore's law to deliver the same performance, half the cost every year and a half is over. It's completely over. And so the idea that the chip is going to go down in cost over time, unfortunately is a story of the past.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nOf course, there's a lot more to building a graphics card than just the GPU. Memory, PCB, VRMs, PMICs, capacitors, and all sorts of other bits are involved. Prices on many of those have increased over the past two years as well. Nvidia also has to put a lot of effort into the research and development of GPUs and related technologies. And the final design has to take all of that into account and then ultimately turn into a successful product.\n\nSo how much does a new part need to cost in order to make for a profitable product? That's more difficult to say.(Image credit: Nvidia)One more interesting thing about the RTX 40-series announcement is that Nvidia has revealed three different graphics card models, and each one uses a different GPU. Again, that sort of approach has to increase costs, and it means Nvidia also needs to figure out how to best allocate its wafer orders. The AD102 chip in the RTX 4090 is the new halo part with a large die and all the trimmings. AD103 cuts down the memory interface and the core counts, and then AD104 cuts them down even further.\n\nNvidia hasn't released die shots or renderings of AD103 and AD104 just yet, but we do have the full specs. They're quite a bit smaller, and much of that comes from reducing core counts, memory interfaces, and L2 cache size. The 4080 models will naturally be higher volume products than the 4090, though it's worth pointing out that the 4090 potentially has 70% more compute, 50% more memory bandwidth and capacity, and uses 41% more power, all while \"only\" costing 33% more. In other words, RTX 4080 16GB pricing is proportionately worse than the RTX 4090.\n\nWe can do the same for the RTX 4080 12GB. The 4080 16GB offers 21% more compute, 33% more memory capacity, 42% more memory bandwidth, but only uses 12% more power. It also costs 33% more. Both of the RTX 4080 models look overpriced and underpowered compared to what we've seen in previous Nvidia architectures, where the halo cards cost substantially more while only moderately increasing performance.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)When RTX 30-series launched, Nvidia started with the RTX 3090 and 3080. Both used the GA102 chip, just with fewer cores enabled on the 3080. Next came the RTX 3070 and 3060 Ti, both of which used the GA104 chip. Eventually, Nvidia would add GA106 to the family, used in the RTX 3060 and 3050 \u2014 and there was GA107 for the mobile RTX 3050 Ti and 3050, but that never came to desktops. Ultimately, just looking at the desktop cards, Nvidia had three different GPUs that powered ten different graphics cards. Now, Nvidia has announced three cards using three GPUs, and it has to figure out how to balance the number of each chip.\n\nI can't help but wonder what the full RTX 40-series product stack will look like by the end of 2023. Word is that there are still two more Ada GPUs in development (AD106 and AD107). At some point, Nvidia will start getting more binned chips that can function as something other than the three announced SKUs, and then we'll likely start seeing more graphics card models.\n\nAMD in contrast appears set to announce perhaps a single core GPU on November 3, which will use chiplets. Current information says the GCD (GPU Chiplet Die) will measure just 308mm^2, about half the size of AD102, and it will link up with up to six MCDs (Memory Chiplet Dies) that are all relatively small (38mm^2). That's about the same size as AD104 (294.5mm^2), and if rumors are correct, AMD's Navi 31 will be packing up to 12,288 GPU shader cores \u2014 60% more than Nvidia's RTX 4080 12GB in roughly the same size chip.\n\nAMD could launch RX 7900 XT, RX 7800 XT, and maybe even RX 7800 using the same GCD, only with different numbers of GPU cores enabled and with 6, 5, or 4 MCDs. Yields would be significantly better than AD102, and costs would also be much lower. AMD might even be able to compete with AD104 on pricing while delivering significantly higher performance, at least in games that don't leverage DLSS 3 and/or extreme ray tracing effects. Advantage: AMD.(Image credit: AMD)There's also the question of why the RTX 4080 12GB isn't just called the RTX 4070. Talking with Nvidia during a briefing, this exact question came up: What was the thought process behind calling the 12GB chip a 4080 instead of a 4070, especially since it's a different chip?\n\nNvidia's Justin Walker, Senior Director of Product Management, said, \"The 4080 12GB is a really high performance GPU. It delivers performance considerably faster than a 3080 12GB... it's faster than a 3090 Ti, and we really think it's deserving of an 80-class product.\"\n\nFrankly, that's a crap answer. Of course it's faster! It's a new chip and a new architecture; it's supposed to be faster. Remember when the GTX 1070 came out and it was faster than a 980 Ti? I guess that wasn't \"deserving\" of an 80-class product name. Neither was the RTX 2070 when it matched the 1080 Ti, or the 3070 when it matched the 2080 Ti.\n\nBut then we get the performance comparisons where Nvidia says the 4080 12GB will be \"up to 3x faster than the 3080 12GB.\" And that's where you have to start to wonder, because obviously that's with DLSS 3, in heavy ray tracing games. What will happen when you're not playing games that meet those criteria?Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.(Image credit: Nvidia)Based on Nvidia's benchmarks, it's going to be a mixed bag. The first three games in the above chart on the left don't use DLSS, or DLSS 3. The RTX 4080 12GB is often tied with or slightly slower than an RTX 3090 Ti when DLSS 3 and ray tracing aren't part of the equation.\u00a0How often will that be the case on future games is far more difficult to predict.\n\nIn a lot of ways, the RTX 40-series launch so far feels very reminiscent of the RTX 20-series launch. Nvidia is once again hyping up ray tracing and DLSS, only we're now in round three of that story. The RT hardware is far more capable, DLSS 3 is supposed to be a lot better as well, but will all the big games support both technologies to sufficient levels? Undoubtedly the answer is no; some will, some won't.\n\nMeanwhile, generational pricing has increased (again), and the specs on some of the models certainly look questionable. RTX 4080 12GB feels far too much like it really should have been the RTX 4070 right now, and Nvidia could have started tacking on Ti and Super or whatever to create other models.\n\nThe RTX 3080 10GB will apparently still linger on with a $699 MSRP for the time being. That certainly can't last, not when an eventual RTX 4070 will inevitably displace it on performance and features. But Nvidia and its partners need the unwitting to buy up the existing inventory of RTX 30-series cards, for the highest prices they can still get, before they're ready to move down the stack to the rest of the Ada Lovelace lineup.We're still waiting for full details on AMD's RDNA 3 lineup as well, and as discussed above, the design decisions AMD made \u2014 specifically with GPU chiplets \u2014 should result in lower prices that Nvidia can't possibly match. AMD may not take the outright performance crown, but if it can come close while undercutting Nvidia's prices, it might not matter. Add to that Intel's Arc A770 and A750, which could launch in the near future as well. We'll see who emerges as the victor in the GPU market in the next couple of months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nrdna\nGeForce RTX 4090\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (97)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

Pity.\n\nRegards.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRodroX\n\n\nTheres no doubt the new RTX 4xxx series will deliver lots of performance, but the cost to build, yields, the power need it to run them, the once again new connector, and the asking price does not match with the post pandemic world we are living in today.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I understand the \"it cost more, and it needs more power but it finish the work faster\", but not everyone can go from a 500~600 watts PSU to a 750 to 1000 watts unit at the same time they need to pay for the new GPU.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2+2\n\n\nRemember when the next gen cards came out,\nand you got the same performance\nat half the cost\nand half the power?\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKing_V\n\n\nAnd now, @JarredWaltonGPU , because of the wording in the article's title . . even though it's not exactly the same, I now no longer picture you as what you really look like.\n\nI now picture you like this:\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnimbulan\n\n\nWhile silicon manufacturing costs are increasing rapidly, the costs are being greatly exaggerated. Even with the massive price increase of TSMC's 5nm node, that shouldn't add up to more than $100 extra for AD102 vs GA102. The much smaller AD103 shouldn't add more than about $45 in cost compared to GA102 (4080 vs 3080.) AMD's chiplet approach won't save them more than $60 compared to nVidia at the outside comparing their flagship cards - I expect other design considerations (lower TDP reducing power delivery and cooling costs, and cheaper VRAM) will bring more cost savings.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblacknemesist\n\n\nHonestly to the end consumer it does not matter if costs are higher when you are putting more and more tech into something that won't even be backwards compatible.\nJust give us what you can at price points that are attractive, don't have 2 entirely different cards named the same and improve backwards compatibility so at least a card can still be \"fresh\" for 1-2 years more, which given the price is not asking for much.\nAlso, the USA is not the only country in the world bu apparently is the only one where you can buy these at their announced stock, for EU we already have reports of pricing that indicates that someone is eating through the MSRP and VAT, what gives?\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nelforeign\n\n\nIt will be interesting to see how this plays out over the next 2 quarters as supply ramps up, AMD and Intel come into the channel and reviews and benchmarks come out. Nvidia gets <Mod Edit> on a lot for performance with DLSS etc, but the truth is the new consoles and AMD and Intel have followed suit with their versions of upscaling tech because it's genuinely great when applied correctly. Game engines will also catch up to better utilize these new methods and ray-tracing, while expensive, is definitely the future.\n\nI agree the 4000 series is overpriced at the moment. I'm glad I bought a 3080 12GB @ 750.00 and since I only game at 2K i'm sure it will hold up for a refresh cycle or two. I do not plan to buy anything from Nvidia this go round. I will wait until Nvidia comes out with a new architecture with a stack that's meant to compete with AMD and Intel and is non-monolithic.\n\nThere is no way they can continue down the trend of monolithic dies with the complexity and pricing mechanics on the fabrication end and the competition from AMD and Intel.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPiranhaTech\n\n\nI didn't even think of the non-compute part of the chip. I think AMD made the I/O on Ryzen 5000 at 12nm. Even if AMD used a single compute module, that could still be an advantage. How much of a processor is actual compute? Quite a bit of a processor is cache, and AMD looks like they are going to do the cache for Ryzen 7000 on an older node (no idea about the GPU)\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvalidError\n\n\nAMD and Nvidia got funny ideas from how much crypto-miners were willing to pay for GPUs, designed their next-gen GPUs to meet the crazy sales they got from crypto and now they are expecting normal gamers to open their wallets as wide as crypto-miners once did. It also doesn't help that the market is still sitting on a large pile of unsold inventory.\n\nLooks like AMD and Nvidia are about to get a stiff reality check.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTR909\n\n\nSo since you have the die size and the wafer size a simple calculation would provide the chips / wafer. Then let's say a 80% working chips per wafer (20%defects). And then divide the wafer cost to the working chips to get the cost per chip. Add to it the GDDR6x cost, the PCB and the cooling and there you have it. Does this have a value of 1599 USD (like 2k in retail)? Really doubt it.\n\nPS - I am sure Tomshardware can do a better calculation and use its resources to get current component prices.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 97 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm debuts new Snapdragon G handheld gaming PC chips to compete with Intel and AMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina to spend $55 billion on R&D in 2025 \u2014 Semiconductor, AI and quantum computing fields to benefit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBambu Lab Announces New Printer: H2D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotherboard dies after marathon 100-hour BIOS update process, vigil attended by thousands online\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD boasts its Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is up to 12.2x faster than Lunar Lake in AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreeware image editor GIMP 3.0 arrives after seven years of incubation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle's Gemini 2.0 Flash is reportedly capable of removing watermarks \u2014 Also found to generate AI celebrity photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi and ChatGPT bring AI conversations to your retro rotary phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI Afterburner update enables RTX 50 series owners to push their GDDR7 VRAM up to 36 GT/s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD manager reports 45% GPU retail market share in Japan \u2014 Eyes 70% as the next target\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

He made the comments during an online session organised by China\u2019s ICwise, a consultancy focused on the country\u2019s chip supply chain.While local Chinese rivals have started to develop their own GPUs, they are still not able to challenge industry giants AMD and Nvidia, according to Lu, who previously worked for Nvidia and Samsung Electronics. However, Lu said Chinese firms could catch up by improving \u201cversatility\u201d through support for more AI algorithms.\u201cIf a client has developed an AI algorithm \u2026 it should be able to run on an Nvidia chip, but also on an Iluvator chip,\u201d Lu said.The online session focused what has become a major debate in China\u2019s chip industry since the US government\u2019s decision last month to restrict Nvidia from selling its two most advanced chips, the A100 and the upcoming H100, to clients in China, which has sent shock waves through China\u2019s AI, cloud computing and smart vehicle industries, as there is no immediate substitute for those GPUs.Iluvatar Corex could be the best positioned Chinese start-up that stands to benefit from the US restrictions, as it claims to have the only domestically produced GPU in mass production. The Tiangai 100, which took four years to develop and is already being used for cloud computing applications, has received 230 million yuan (US$33 million) in orders so far, the company said at the 2022 World AI Conference in Shanghai this month.AdvertisementLu said that he was unable to find any mature \u201crival products\u201d from Chinese GPU start-ups for assessment against Nvidia chips. \u201cSo far we can\u2019t get any, probably because everyone is still in the development stage,\u201d he said.Advertisement"

Now, armed with a Ph.D. in quantum computing, she\u2019s helping Microsoft Azure Quantum carve out a position at the cutting edge of cloud services.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been attracted to interesting problems and working hard to achieve a goal,\u201d said Heim, a principal software engineering manager at Microsoft. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was drawn to quantum computing, where there\u2019s a huge potential to benefit society by creating a completely new tool beyond today\u2019s classical systems.\u201d\nLast winter, Azure Quantum \u2014 in collaboration with Quantinuum, Quantum Circuits Inc., Rigetti Computing and Oak Ridge National Lab \u2014 demonstrated how classical and quantum systems can work together to tackle big problems, a capability it aims to deliver to any cloud user.\nTo get there, it\u2019s embracing tools such as NVIDIA CUDA-Q, an open, universal programming environment that will link GPUs and quantum processors in future hybrid systems.\n\u201cCUDA-Q will help us take that next step of offering a robust integration of very different systems and developer tools,\u201d said Heim, a Swiss national now based in Seattle.\nQuantum\u2019s Software Foundation\nLaying the software foundation for quantum computers is the focus of the QIR Alliance that Heim chairs.\nThe industry group oversees work on a common interface between quantum programming languages and targeted quantum computers. QIR enables developers to use tools like CUDA-Q to build apps that run on hybrid quantum computers to accelerate scientific discovery.\nThat\u2019s a huge leap for a sector where developers are used to writing the equivalent of assembler programs that directly address the specifics of each system.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to have tools that don\u2019t require deep knowledge of quantum systems, so we\u2019re collaborating with companies like NVIDIA to engage and inspire a broad field of developers,\u201d she said.\n\u201cCUDA-Q and cuQuantum provide a great step ahead for the field by taking advantage of classical HPC resources for quantum development,\u201d she added, referring to NVIDIA cuQuantum, a software library for running quantum-circuit simulations on GPU-accelerated systems.\nAn Expanding Quantum Ecosystem\nThe collaboration with Microsoft to expand the QIR ecosystem and integrate NVIDIA\u2019s toolset with Azure Quantum is one among many. Dozens of companies are adopting cuQuantum to accelerate quantum research on today\u2019s classical computers and CUDA-Q to program tomorrow\u2019s hybrid classical-quantum systems.\nFor example, Rigetti Computing will let developers use CUDA-Q to program its superconducting quantum computers. And software specialist Classiq will use the platform to optimize performance of its quantum algorithms.\nCUDA-Q provides a unified programming model for hybrid quantum-classical computers.\nThe companies join quantum hardware providers IQM Quantum Computers, Pasqal, Quantinuum, Quantum Brilliance and Xanadu, which announced collaborations using CUDA-Q in July. They support a broad range of qubit technologies that reinforce CUDA-Q\u2019s role as a unified platform enabling all hybrid quantum-classical systems.\nIn addition, CUDA-Q has support from software providers QC Ware and Zapata Computing and four supercomputing centers: Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and RIKEN in Japan.\nIndustry Research Rides cuQuantum\nMeanwhile, the applications for quantum circuit simulations on cuQuantum are expanding.\nBMW Group identified more than 40 automotive use cases for quantum computing in a paper last year. This year, it used cuQuantum\u2019s cuStateVec library as part of its work on a benchmark for quantum applications.\nThe automaker hosted a global challenge in collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to show ways quantum systems can address the sector\u2019s toughest optimization, AI and material science problems. In a sign of the broad interest in the technology, the challenge attracted 70 teams.\nIn Japan, the Fujifilm Informatics Research Laboratory is using cuQuantum to build quantum circuits with startup blueqat. The collaboration aims to create simulations of large-scale quantum circuits\u00a0 to accelerate Fujifilm\u2019s R&D.\nDevelopers can use cuQuantum to create accurate simulations of hundreds of qubits on a single NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU, and thousands of qubits on a supercomputing cluster.\nQuantum Expands in the Cloud\nOracle Cloud services will let developers create quantum-circuit simulations on GPUs. It\u2019s making available on the Oracle Cloud Marketplace the cuQuantum Appliance, a container with all the components needed to run cuQuantum jobs and deliver multi-node capabilities\nLikewise, AWS announced the availability of cuQuantum in its Braket service. It also demonstrated on Braket how cuQuantum can provide up to a 900x speedup on quantum machine learning workloads.\nConsulting firms are also showing the potential of quantum computing accelerated with NVIDIA software.\nAI Gets a Quantum Boost\nDeloitte will use cuQuantum and CUDA-Q to take natural language processing to new heights in customer service. It will employ high-dimensional datasets to let systems interpret full sentences.\nIn other projects, it will explore how cuQuantum can speed drug discovery and unravel complex optimization problems in structured medical data.\nThe R&D group at SoftServe, a global IT consulting and services company, is using cuQuantum in several application areas including drug discovery and the optimization of emergency logistics. It also runs the software in quantum simulations of finance such as forecasting trends in stock prices and automating financial portfolio management.\nThe research efforts join those from existing collaborators, including Google Quantum AI and IonQ, that announced support for cuQuantum at its launch in late 2021.\nLearn More at GTC\nLearn more by watching GTC sessions that give an overview of quantum-accelerated supercomputing, its ecosystem and its applications in the pharmaceutical industry.\nAnd to get the big picture, watch NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s GTC keynote below.\n\n\n\nCategories: SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | GPU Computing | GTC 2022 | GTC Digital | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA in Europe | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

The most interesting aspect is that real-time ray tracing doesn\u2019t require spiffy new gaming engines or setups \u2014 you can apply it to super-basic 3D titles like Minecraft or even the original Doom. As part of its RTX 4000 series announcement, Nvidia showed off an updated version of Valve\u2019s classic Portal, a first-person puzzler, with a ray tracing lighting mod and DLSS 3 applied. \n\n\n\nNvidia isn\u2019t the first to apply ray tracing to Portal, but its new version of the game consistently applies the lighting technology to the entire game. This enhances the original title\u2019s bleak atmosphere and the super-clean testing facility and its dark, foreboding underbelly. Lighting from the portals themselves, the rare gun-packing turrets, and floating energy balls really show off the enhanced engine and tweaked textures. The update was created with Nvidia\u2019s new modding tool system, RTX Remix. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\nPortal came out way back in 2007 as part of Valve\u2019s Orange Box package, becoming an instant classic and a staple of gaming culture thanks to its novel first-person physics puzzles, menacing and hilarious narration, and an incredible vocal performance from GladOS actor Ellen McLain. Valve released a sequel in 2011, but has since done little with the series aside from some promotional tie-ins. \nNvidia\u2019s ray tracing upgrade to the original Portal will be available in November after the new Lovelace-based GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 desktop graphics cards. It will be a free DLC download for those who already own the game on Steam. It\u2019s not known whether the ray-tracing graphics will be available on older graphics cards or AMD-based hardware. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Michael Crider, Staff Writer, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael is a 10-year veteran of technology journalism, covering everything from Apple to ZTE.

The GeForce RTX 4090 isn't just a GPU, it's the flagship green team offering, and offers four times the performance increases over its predecessor.\nNVIDIA Takes Gaming To The Next Level With Its Next-Gen GeForce RTX 4090 BFGPU, Infused With The Fastest GPU On The Planet\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4090 has been long-awaited and now it's finally here. The graphics card is designed for enthusiasts and gamers who want the best visual fidelity and to achieve that, you want a powerful GPU considering how demanding the next-gen AAA titles have become. Keeping that in mind, NVIDIA didn't push its next chip to be a few percent or 50% faster than the last gen but a whole 4x faster with DLSS and 2x faster in native resolution to make sure that their graphics cards are not just ready for the upcoming titles but also for enhanced features such as Ray Tracing, etc.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\nNVIDIA's AD102 'Ada Lovelace' GPU - The Next-Gen Powerhouse\nAt the heart of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card lies the Ada Lovelace AD102 GPU. The GPU measures 608,4mm2 and will utilize the TSMC 4N process node which is an optimized version of TSMC's 5nm (N5) node designed for the green team. The GPU features an insane 76.3 Billion transistors.\n\nThe NVIDIA Ada Lovelace AD103 GPU is expected to feature up to 7 GPC (Graphics Processing Clusters). This is the same GPC count as the Ampere GA102 GPU and one additional GPC over the GA103 GPU. Each GPU will consist of 6 TPCs and 2 SMs which is the same configuration as the existing chip. Each SM (Streaming Multiprocessor) will house four sub-cores which is also the same as the GA102 GPU. What's changed is the FP32 & the INT32 core configuration. Each sub-core will include 128 FP32 units but combined FP32+INT32 units will go up to 192. This is because the FP32 units don't share the same sub-core as the IN32 units. The 128 FP32 cores are separate from the 64 INT32 cores.\nSo in total, each sub-core will consist of 32 FP32 plus 16 INT32 units for a total of 48 units. Each SM will have a total of 128 FP32 units plus 64 INT32 units for a total of 192 units. And since there are a total of 84 SM units (12 per GPC), we are looking at 12,288 FP32 Units and 6,144 INT32 units for a total of 18,432 cores. Each SM will also include two Wrap Schedules (32 thread/CLK) for 64 wraps per SM. This is a 50% increase on the cores (FP32+INT32) and a 33% increase in Wraps/Threads vs the GA102 GPU.\nNVIDIA AD102 'Ada Lovelace' Gaming GPU 'SM' Block Diagram (Image Credits: Kopite7kimi):\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameGB202AD102GA102TU102GA100GH100\n\n\n\n\nGPC12 (Per GPU)?12 (Per GPU)1.7x2x1.5x1.5x\n\n\nTPC8 (Per GPC)?6 (Per GPC)SameSame0.75x0.67x\n\n\nSM2 (Per TPC)?2 (Per TPC)SameSameSameSame\n\n\nSub-CoreTBD4 (Per SM)SameSameSameSame\n\n\nFP32128 (Per SM)?128 (Per SM)Same2x2xSame\n\n\nFP32+INT32TBD192 (Per SM)1.5x1.5x1.5xSame\n\n\nWarpsTBD64 (Per SM)1.33x2xSameSame\n\n\nThreadsTBD2048 (Per SM)1.33x2xSameSame\n\n\nL1 CacheTBD192 KB (Per SM)1.5x2xSame0.75x\n\n\nL2 CacheTBD96 MB (Per GPU)16x16x2.4x1.6x\n\n\nROPsTBD32 (Per GPC)2x2x2x2x\n\n\nMemory StandardGDDR7GDDR6XGDDR6GDDR5XHBM2(e)HBM3(e)\n\n\n\nMoving over to the cache, this is another segment where NVIDIA has given a big boost over the existing Ampere GPUs. The Ada Lovelace GPUs will pack 192 KB of L1 cache per SM, an increase of 50% over Ampere. That's a total of 4.5 MB of L1 cache on the top AD102 GPU. The L2 cache will be increased to 96 MB as mentioned in the leaks. This is a 16x increase over the Ampere GPU that hosts just 6 MB of L2 cache. The cache will be shared across the GPU.\nFinally, we have the ROPs which are also increased to 32 per GPC, an increase of 2x over Ampere. You are looking at up to 384 ROPs on the next-gen flagship versus just 112 on the fastest Ampere GPU, the RTX 3090 Ti. There are also going to be the latest 4th Generation Tensor and 3rd Generation RT (Raytracing) cores infused on the Ada Lovelace GPUs which will help boost DLSS & Raytracing performance to the next level. Overall, the Ada Lovelace AD102 GPU will offer:\n\n2x GPCs (Versus Ampere)\n50% More Cores (Versus Ampere)\n50% More L1 Cache (Versus Ampere)\n16x More L2 Cache (Versus Ampere)\nDouble The ROPs (Versus Ampere)\n4th Gen Tensor & 3rd Gen RT Cores\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 'Official' Specifications\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 will use 128 SMs of the 144 SMs for a total of 16,384 CUDA cores. The GPU will come packed with 96 MB of L2 cache and a total of 384 ROPs which is simply insane but considering that the RTX 4090 is a cut-down design, it may feature slightly lower L2 and ROP counts. The clock speeds are not confirmed yet but considering that the TSMC 4N process is being used. The clock speeds are rated at up to 2.6 GHz and NVIDIA is claiming over 3 GHz speeds with overclocking which you can read more about here.\nAs for memory specs, the GeForce RTX 4090 will feature 24 GB GDDR6X capacities that will be clocked at 21 Gbps speeds across a 384-bit bus interface. This will provide up to 1 TB/s of bandwidth. This is the same bandwidth as the existing RTX 3090 Ti graphics card and as far as the power consumption is concerned, the TBP is rated at 450W. The card will be powered by a single 16-pin connector which delivers up to 600W of power. Custom models will be offering higher TBP targets.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Graphics Cards Performance\nAs for the performance of these monster GPUs, NVIDIA shared the computational and gaming performance figures and it looks like the GeForce RTX 4090 will be the first gaming card to hit the 100 TFLOPs compute horsepower limit.\nJust for comparison's sake:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090: 90 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.8 GHz clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti: 40 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.86 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090: 36 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.69 GHz Boost clock)\n\nBased on a theoretical clock speed of 2.8 GHz, you get up to 103 TFLOPs of compute performance and the rumors are suggesting even higher boost clocks. Now, these are definitely sounding like peak clocks, similar to AMD's peak frequencies which are higher than the average 'Game' clock. A 100+ TFLOPs compute performance means more than double the horsepower versus the 3090 Ti flagship. But one should keep in mind that compute performance doesn't necessarily indicate the overall gaming performance but despite that, it will be a huge upgrade for gaming PCs and an 8.5x increase over the current fastest console, the Xbox Series X.\n\n\nFP32 Compute Horsepower Comparisons (Higher is Better)\n\nCompute Power\n\n\n020406080100120\n\n\n\n\n\n020406080100120\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090\n\n90\n\n\nRTX 3090 Ti\n\n40\n\n\nRX 6900 XTX\n\n25\n\n\nXbox Series X\n\n12\n\n\nPlayStation 5\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will be a 2x compute performance uplift and a 2x gain in gaming performance as NVIDIA has demonstrated for each graphics card versus its predecessor and this is without even factoring in the RT and Tensor core performance which are expected to get major lifts too in their respective department.\u00a0 A 2-4x gain over the RTX 3090 & RTX 3090 Ti would be very disruptive.\n\nGamers should expect 4K gaming to be buttery smooth on these graphics cards and with DLSS, we might even see playable 60 FPS at 8K resolution which is something that NVIDIA has been trying to achieve with its RTX 3090 series BFGPUs for a while now.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Graphics Cards Price & Availability\nNow coming to the prices, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti & RTX 3090 graphics cards are without a doubt the most expensive single-chip GPUs to date.

But according to the YouTubers at Gamers Nexus,\u00a0analyst Jon Peddie, and an EVGA forum post, EVGA is officially terminating its relationship with Nvidia and will not be manufacturing cards based on the company's RTX 4000-series GPUs.\nEVGA's graphics cards have exclusively used Nvidia GPUs since its founding in 1999, and according to Gamers Nexus, GeForce sales represent 80 percent of EVGA's revenue, making this a momentous and arguably company-endangering change. But EVGA CEO Andrew Han told Gamers Nexus that the decision was about \"principle\" rather than financials\u2014Han complained about a lack of communication from Nvidia about new products, including information about pricing and availability.\nNvidia's pricing strategy was apparently another sore point for EVGA. Nvidia's first-party Founders Edition cards could often undercut the pricing of cards offered by EVGA and other vendors, forcing them to either lower prices or lose sales as a result.\nNvidia may not be entirely at fault here\u2014the wider dynamics of the GPU market are also tough to navigate. As Peddie points out, even as GPU costs have gone up, profit margins for the board partners that manufacture Nvidia graphics cards have gone down. Modern high-end graphics cards have massively higher power, cooling, and PCI Express signaling requirements than cards from just a few years ago, making them more expensive to design and manufacture, and reporting about the RTX 4000 series indicates that that trend is only going to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Profit margins for Nvidia's add-in board partners like eVGA have been sinking for a while.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          John Peddie Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Profit margins for Nvidia's add-in board partners like eVGA have been sinking for a while.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n                      \n          \n          John Peddie Research\n\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it probably doesn't help that the GPU market has been plummeting back to earth this year, after over a year of limited stock and inflated pricing. Sliding cryptocurrency values and the Ethereum cryptocurrency's move away from GPU mining have both flooded the market with secondhand GPUs, which has in turn affected demand for new GPUs. In Nvidia's last earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang complained of \"excess inventory\" of RTX 3000-series GPUs that made it miss its quarterly revenue projections by $1.4 billion.\nFor Nvidia's part, its public stance can be summed up as \"so long and good luck.\"\n\"We\u2019ve had a great partnership with EVGA over the years and will continue to support them on our current generation of products,\" Nvidia spokesperson Bryan Del Rizzo told Tom's Hardware. \"We wish Andrew [Han] and our friends at EVGA all the best.\"\n\nThe end of the EVGA-Nvidia relationship could\u00a0hurt Nvidia\u2014Peddie says that EVGA represents about 40 percent of Nvidia's GPU market share in North America\u2014but in the medium term the company is unlikely to be fazed much. Nvidia has other partners, and despite differences in cooler design and clock speeds, GPUs in the same series tend to perform similarly regardless of which of Nvidia's partners actually made them. In other words, an RTX 3070 is an RTX 3070, and people who want one are just going to buy one from another company if EVGA's products aren't available.\nEVGA will continue to sell its other products, including power supplies, though Han told Gamers Nexus that the company doesn't plan to return to the GPU market at all\u2014not with AMD's or Intel's GPUs, and not with future GeForce product generations. Han also said that EVGA would continue to sell cards based on older GeForce GPUs, including the RTX 3000 series, until they run out of stock toward the end of 2022. The company will keep enough inventory of these cards on-hand to fulfill any warranty repairs or replacements for currently supported cards.\nKyle Orland contributed to this report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            The end of Ethereum mining could be a bonanza for GPU shoppers\n          \n\n            Graphics card prices have been dropping all year\u2014and could go even lower.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            The GPU shortage is over.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang debuted two new models on Tuesday: the RTX 4090, which will start at a whopping $1,599, and the RTX 4080, which will launch in two configurations.\nThe pricier card, slated to launch on October 12, occupies the same highest-end category as Nvidia's 2020 megaton RTX 3090 (previously designated by the company as its \"Titan\" product). The 4090's increase in physical size will demand three slots on your PC build of choice. The specs are indicative of a highest-end GPU:\u00a016,384 CUDA cores (up from the 3090's\u00a010,496 CUDA cores) and\u00a02.52 GHz of boost clock (up from\u00a01.695 GHz on the 3090). Despite the improvements, the card still performs within the same 450 W power envelope as the 3090.\u00a0Its RAM allocation will remain at 24GB of GDDR6X memory.\nThis jump in performance is fueled in part by Nvidia's long-rumored jump to TSMC's \"4N\" process, which is a new generation of 5 nm chips that provides a massive efficiency jump from the previous Ampere generation's 8 nm process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                The RTX 4080, coming in two SKUs.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Nvidia\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The RTX 4080, coming in two SKUs.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Nvidia\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the RTX 4080 will follow in November in two SKUs: a 12GB\u00a0GDDR6X model (192-bit bus) starting at $899, plus a 16GB\u00a0GDDR6X model (256-bit bus) starting at $1,199. Based on how different the specs are between these two models, however, Nvidia appears to be launching two entirely different chipsets under the same \"4080\" banner; traditionally, this much Nvidia hardware differentiation has come with separate model names (i.e. last generation's 3070 and 3080). We're awaiting firmer confirmation from Nvidia on whether the 4080 models do or do not share a chipset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pricier of these two will include more CUDA cores (9,728, up from the RTX 3080's 8,704), boost clock (2.51 GHz, up from 3080's 1.71 GHz), and power draw (320 W, same as the 3080 but more than the lower-memory 4080's 285 W). At least for this generation, Nvidia is offering 12GB of memory as a 4080 baseline\u2014effectively addressing a major criticism with the consistently memory-starved RTX 3000 generation of GPUs.\nMicromap, micromesh\nBoth new models include iterative updates to Nvidia's proprietary RTX chipset elements\u2014RT cores and tensor cores. Alongside these, Nvidia has announced updated processes for both its handling of real-time ray tracing in 3D graphics and its Deep Learning Super-Sampling (DLSS) upscaling system. The former will be augmented on Lovelace GPUs with two new types of hardware units: an \"opacity micromap engine,\" meant to double raw ray-tracing performance, and a \"micromesh engine\" to increase the amount of geometric coverage \"without storage cost\" on the rendering front.\nThe latter has now been bumped to a new version: DLSS 3, which appears to be an RTX 4000-series exclusive feature. According to Huang, this system promises to \"generate new frames [of gameplay] without involving the game, effectively boosting both CPU and GPU performance.\" This frame-by-frame rebuilding of graphics in real time is designed to solve the issues found in image reconstruction techniques that cannot necessarily model the motion vectors of in-game elements like particles. This new method, combined with the techniques established by prior DLSS generations, could be used to reconstruct a whopping 7/8 of a scene's pixels\u2014thus dropping computational demands on both GPUs and CPUs. If it works as promised, DLSS could deliver a substantial improvement over the pixel-by-pixel process that has been so successful across both DLSS and its competitors\u2014AMD's FSR 2.0 and Intel's upcoming XeSS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn top of those proprietary systems, Nvidia's newest GPUs will apparently lean on a new process that Huang calls \"shader execution reordering.\" While this will improve performance for raw rasterization, Huang's brief description of the system hinges largely on ray tracing's computationally expensive workloads. The system will drive \"2-3 times\" the ray-tracing performance of the company's previous Ampere generation of GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      DLSS 3 demonstration on an unnamed RTX 4000 system.\n          \n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3 demonstration on an unnamed RTX 4000 system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      DLSS 3 demonstration on an unnamed RTX 4000 system.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3 demonstration on an unnamed RTX 4000 system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      DLSS 3 demonstration on an unnamed RTX 4000 system.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3 demonstration on an unnamed RTX 4000 system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3 demonstration on an unnamed RTX 4000 system.\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3 demonstration on an unnamed RTX 4000 system.\n\n\n\n\nAs part of today's announcements, Nvidia presented a few titles with upcoming Nvidia RTX-specific optimizations, and the biggest is arguably Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. When combined with DLSS 3's image reconstruction system, MSFS was demonstrated with frame rates easily reaching the 100s in some of the game's busiest scenes (though raw rasterization of the same scenes on an unnamed Lovelace GPU and PC showed solid performance as well, considering how power-hungry that game and its massive cityscapes can be). The above gallery is captured in 4K, so you may want to click and zoom in to see how DLSS 3 handles fine pixel details compared to an apparent combination of raw pixels and standard temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) in older systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      RTX Remix, after.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Remix, after.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      RTX Remix, before.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Remix, before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Remix, after.\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Remix, before.\n\n\n\n\nHuang also tried to curry favor with the PC modding scene by demonstrating how a new Nvidia-developed toolset, dubbed RTX Remix, can be applied to a number of classic games whose modding capabilities are wide open. The best results came from a before-and-after demonstration applied to Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, which used RTX GPU tensor cores to programmatically update the game's textures and physical material properties. (See above, or go to Nvidia's site for even more before-and-after comparisons.) Similar results are expected from a free Portal 1 DLC package that Nvidia will release for fans to apply to that PC gaming classic in November.\u00a0We'll be curious to see head-to-head showdowns of Nvidia's automatic modding results compared to the best stuff from over a decade of community development.\nArs Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through\u00a0affiliate programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Listing image:\n    Nvidia\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Machkovech\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Machkovech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    301 Comments\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Comments\n  \n\n\nForum view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Loading comments...\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrev story\n\n\nNext story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Most Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\nEverything you say to your Echo will be sent to Amazon starting on March 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\u201cAwful\u201d: Roku tests autoplaying ads loading before the home screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\nTrump plan to fund Musk\u2019s Starlink over fiber called \u201cbetrayal\u201d of rural US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\nReport: mRNA vaccines are in RFK Jr\u2019s crosshairs; funding in question\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\nSobering revenue stats of 70K mobile apps show why devs beg for subscriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArs Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

Nvidia  What's happening Nvidia revealed a new processor, called Thor, that's designed for cars arriving in 2025 that need a lot more computer horsepower than they've got today. Why it matters Thor could help carmakers sweep away a host of smaller processors handling everything from door locks, braking, navigation, entertainment and engine control with one centralized computer system that's easier to update. Chip designer Nvidia on Tuesday revealed a new processor called Drive Thor it expects will power the autonomous vehicle revolution.\u00a0Thor processors should arrive in 2024 for cars hitting the roads in 2025, starting with an EV from\u00a0Chinese carmaker Zeekr, said Danny Shapiro, vice president of Nvidia's automotive work. They're based on Nvidia's new Hopper graphics processing unit to better handle the artificial intelligence software that's key to self-driving cars.\"It absolutely will scale up to full autonomy,\" Shapiro said, referring to Level 4 or Level 5 self-driving abilities, in which cars can pilot themselves without human occupants paying attention or even present.Nvidia had planned a chip called Atlan for 2024 but canceled it in favor of Thor, which handles AI software at 2 quadrillion operations per second -- twice the speed planned for Atlan and eight times that of its current Orin processor. Thor incorporates one key Hopper feature: the ability to accelerate a powerful AI technique called transformers. Nvidia also expects lower-end Thor variations for the less revolutionary driver-assist technologies like lane keeping and automatic emergency braking.The automotive processor market is big and getting bigger as carmakers demand more and more processors and other semiconductor chips for driver assistance, infotainment, and the electronic control units that oversee everything from engine combustion to GPS navigation. Each Porsche Taycan has 8,000 semiconductor elements.Chip designers are cashing in on the new market.\u00a0Nvidia has $11 billion in automotive chip orders, and a top rival, Qualcomm, has\u00a0$19 billion in automotive orders in the pipeline.Also new at Nvidia's GTCAmong other Nvidia developments at its GTC event:Its GeForce RTX 4090 graphics cards, powered by its new Ada Lovelace generation of GPUs for gaming PCs and workstations, will go on sale in October with prices ranging from $899 to $1,599.The Jetson Orin line of processors for robots now includes Nano models for smaller robots. They consume between 5 and 15 watts of power for better battery life, cost $199 and up, and start shipping in January. Newly announced companies using Jetson Orin include Canon, John Deere, Microsoft Azure, Teradyne and TK Elevator, Nvidia said.The new new Nemo LLM technology is designed to help researchers get more use out of large language models, a hot new area in AI that's responsible for rapid advances in processing language, imagery and other data. Retraining an LLM consumes massive resources, but the Nemo technology lets researchers perform a much faster incremental AI training that customizes the big AI.Thor automotive AI chip detailsWith 77 billion transistors, Thor will be massive, if not the biggest processor on the market. But it'll let automakers replace a heavier, more expensive and more power hungry collection of smaller chips, Nvidia says. In addition to using Hopper GPUs, it borrows CPU cores from Nvidia's 2023 Grace processor for conventional computing tasks. It also draws technology from Nvidia's newest GPU technology for gaming and design, the Ada Lovelace architecture.The design will make it easier for carmakers to improve their car software with over-the-air updates, Huang said. Tesla has had a big technological lead in that technology for years.Thor also will be used for robots and medical equipment, Huang said. And it will be able to run three operating systems simultaneously -- Linux, QNX, and Android -- for different parts of the car computing environment. Partitioning technology ensures the less important work, like infotainment, doesn't interrupt the crucial safety-related work, Nvidia said.     This computer rendering shows Nvidia's Drive Thor processor built into an automotive electronics board with many connectors for cameras, radar, lidar and other sensors to enable self-driving cars. NvidiaWith autonomous vehicles, promised for years but still only in testing, those chips become even more important.\"The industry has recognized that it's a much more complex task than initially thought,\" Shapiro said of autonomous vehicles. \"With safety being paramount, nobody is ready to release these vehicles into the wild until there's more compute.\"Correction, 11:30 p.m. PT: This story incorrectly described the first car that's expected to use Nvidia's Thor processor. It will be used in an electric vehicle Zeekr plans to produce, which is due to arrive in 2025.

Here I\u2019ll outline the requirements for Enterprise Nucleus Server deployment and dive deep into the technical steps for getting Nucleus running in your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.\nWhat is Omniverse?\nNVIDIA Omniverse is a scalable, multi-GPU, real-time platform for building and operating metaverse applications, based on Pixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description (USD) and NVIDIA RTX technology.\nNVIDIA Omniverse Nucleus is the database and collaboration engine of Omniverse. With Omniverse Nucleus, teams can have multiple live users connected using different applications at once. This allows people to use the application they are most comfortable with and opens a lot of doors for rapid iteration. Learn more on the NVIDIA Omniverse Introduction Documentation.\nNucleus operates under a publish-and-subscribe model and enables efficient live synchronization between NVIDIA Omniverse applications. Changes to USD scenes are transmitted in real-time between connected Omniverse clients. Clients connect using the publish-and-subscribe pattern, which makes it possible for them to receive changes submitted in near real-time.\nOther Nucleus features include users and group management, assets access control lists (ACLs) for fine-grained access control, versioning with checkpoints, single sign-on (SSO) with SAML Authentication, and TLS encryption support.\nWhy AWS?\nThere are multiple reasons to deploy Nucleus on the AWS Global Cloud Infrastructure. With AWS you can connect distributed users all over the globe. Our security, identity, and access management controls allow you to retain complete control over your data. Also, with the variety of compute instance types and storage solutions AWS offers, you can right size your infrastructure and fine tune performance as needed.\nSolution Overview\nThe following steps outline a solution that implements the basic components of a Nucleus deployment. To handle communication from end users an Amazon EC2 instance configured as a NGINX reverse proxy is deployed in a public subnet. The reverse proxy accepts TLS traffic and has a TLS certificate from Amazon Certificates Manager (ACM). Typically, this component would be an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), but the Nucleus Server requires path rewrites in the request which is not currently supported by an ELB.\nThe Enterprise Nucleus Server is an Amazon EC2 instance deployed to a private subnet that only accepts traffic from the reverse proxy subnet. The Enterprise Nucleus Server is running the Nucleus Enterprise Stack, which is deployed as a Docker Compose Stack. The Nucleus instance will need a NAT Gateway and Internet Gateway to communicate with the NVIDIA NGC. This procedure uses the basic Nucleus stack with TLS support, and not SSO.\nPrerequisites\n\nAWS Command Line Interface (CLI) \u2013 Installing or updating the latest version of the AWS CLI\nAWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) \u2013 Install the AWS CDK\nPython 3.9 or greater \u2013 Python Downloads\nNVIDIA Enterprise Omniverse Nucleus packages \u2013 Enterprise Nucleus Server Quick Start Tips\nNitro Enclaves Marketplace Subscription \u2013 AWS Certificate Manager for Nitro Enclaves\n\nDeploying Omniverse Nucleus on Amazon EC2\n\nRegister a domain and create a hosted zone with Amazon Route 53\nFirst, you will need a hosted zone and a domain for the Nucleus Server. Amazon Route 53 (Route 53) allows registration of a domain, such as my-omniverse.com, and creation of a subdomain, such as nucleus.my-omniverse.com, for the Nucleus Server. When registering a domain, communication occurs with the domain registrar. It is best to do this step manually and then reference the Hosted Zone ID, created by Route 53, in the subsequent configuration steps.\nSee this page for more information on registering a domain and creating a hosted zone: Registering a new domain.\nConfigure the CDK Stack\nNext, you will configure a CDK stack with basic resources for the Nucleus deployment.\nStep 1. Open a terminal and create a project folder for your CDK app\nThe name of the folder will become the application name. For this procedure, nucleus-app is the name used.\nStep 2. Change directory into the folder created in Step 1 and initialize your CDK app with the following command:\n\ncdk init sample-app --language=typescript\n\nNow your project structure should be the following:\n\nnucleus-app/\n     bin/\n         nucleus-app.ts\n     lib/\n         nucleus-app-stack.ts\n \nadditional config files \u2026\n\nnucleus-app.ts is the main entry point for the app and the file that subsequent CDK commands will reference. When viewing this file, you can see it imports lib/nucleus-app-stack.ts, which is where you\u2019ll put custom code for your deployment.\nStep 3. Run a basic \u201cHello World\u201d test\nDeploy the starter CDK stack with cdk deploy. This will produce a basic stack and confirm your CLI and CDK are properly configured.\nStep 4. Set default account and AWS Region environment values\nOpen bin/nucleus-app.ts and set the default account and Region environment (env) values. The contents of the file should look like the following:\n\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nimport * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';\nimport { NucleusAppStack } from '../lib/nucleus-app-stack';\n\nconst app = new cdk.App();\nnew NucleusAppStack(app, 'NucleusAppStack', {\n    env: { account: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT, region: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_REGION },\n});\n\nStep 5. Remove sample resources\nOpen lib/nucleus-app-stack.ts and remove the sample Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) resources. Your file should now look like the following:\n\nimport { Stack, StackProps } from 'aws-cdk-lib';\nimport { Construct } from 'constructs';\n\nexport class NucleusAppStack extends Stack {\n  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: StackProps) {\n    super(scope, id, props);\n    \n    // custom resources go here\n\n  }\n}\n\nStep 6. Add the below CDK libraries, as these are required in subsequent steps\n\nimport * as route53 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-route53'\nimport { Tags, CfnOutput } from 'aws-cdk-lib'\nimport * as s3 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3'\nimport * as ec2 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2'\nimport * as iam from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-iam'\nimport * as acm from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-certificatemanager'\n\nDefine Stack Resources\nNext, you will define custom infrastructure resources required for the deployment. Code samples in this section need to be added inside the constructor of the NucleusAppStack class\nStep 1. Create an  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket for artifacts\nFirst, create a simple Amazon S3 bucket that will be used to transfer artifacts from our local client to Amazon EC2 instances. As per security best practices, enable encryption, enforce SSL, and block public access. Then create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that allows access to list bucket and get objects from the bucket. This policy will be attached to our Amazon EC2 instance profile role.\n\nconst artifactsBucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'artifactsBucket', {\n    encryption: s3.BucketEncryption.S3_MANAGED,\n    enforceSSL: true,\n    blockPublicAccess: s3.BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ALL,\n});\n\nconst getBucketObjectsPolicy = new iam.PolicyDocument({\n    statements: [\n    new iam.PolicyStatement({\n        actions: [\n            \"s3:GetObject\",\n            \"s3:ListBucket\",\n        ],\n        resources: [\n            `${artifactsBucket.bucketArn}`,\n            `${artifactsBucket.bucketArn}/*`\n        ]\n    })]\n});\n\nStep 2. Add an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configuration\nSpecify the private subnet that contains the NAT gateway with a route to the internet. Then provision two security groups that the proxy server and the Nucleus Server will use.\n\nconst eip = new ec2.CfnEIP(this, 'natGatewayElasticIP', {\n      domain: 'vpc'\n    });\n\n    const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'nucleusVpc', {\n      cidr: '10.0.0.0/20',\n      natGateways: 1,\n      subnetConfiguration: [{\n        name: 'publicSubnetNatGateway',\n        subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC,\n        cidrMask: 24\n      }, {\n        name: 'privateSubnet',\n        subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_NAT,\n        cidrMask: 24\n      }],\n      natGatewayProvider: ec2.NatProvider.gateway({\n          eipAllocationIds: [eip.attrAllocationId]\n      }),\n    });\n\n    const proxySG = new ec2.SecurityGroup(this, 'reverseProxySG', {\n      vpc: vpc,\n      allowAllOutbound: true,\n      description: \"Reverse Proxy Security Group\"\n      });\n\n    const nucleusSG = new ec2.SecurityGroup(this, 'nucleusSG', {\n      vpc: vpc,\n      allowAllOutbound: true,\n      description: \"Nucleus Server Security Group\"\n    });\n\nStep 3. Add security group ingress rules\nConfigure the proxy and Nucleus security groups to allow traffic on required ports. The Nucleus security group only allows traffic from the proxy security group. The proxy security group allows traffic from a specific CIDR range. You\u2019ll want to set this to a range you will use to connect to the server. For example, you can use the IP address of the client machine you plan to connect from. Then, you enter that IP appended with a network mask as the CIDR range. For this solution, the recommended network mask is /32.\n\nconst allowedCidrRange = 'ip-address/network-mask'\n    proxySG.addIngressRule(\n      ec2.Peer.ipv4(allowedCidrRange), ec2.Port.tcp(443), \"HTTPS Traffic\");\n    proxySG.addIngressRule(\n      ec2.Peer.ipv4(allowedCidrRange), ec2.Port.tcp(3180), \"Auth login\");\n    proxySG.addIngressRule(\n      ec2.Peer.ipv4(allowedCidrRange), ec2.Port.tcp(3100), \"Auth Service\");\n    proxySG.addIngressRule(\n      ec2.Peer.ipv4(allowedCidrRange), ec2.Port.tcp(3333), \"Discovery Service\");\n    proxySG.addIngressRule(\n      ec2.Peer.ipv4(allowedCidrRange), ec2.Port.tcp(3030), \"LFT\");\n    proxySG.addIngressRule(\n      ec2.Peer.ipv4(allowedCidrRange), ec2.Port.tcp(3019), \"Core API\");\n    proxySG.addIngressRule(\n      ec2.Peer.ipv4(allowedCidrRange), ec2.Port.tcp(3020), \"Tagging Service\");\n    proxySG.addIngressRule(\n      ec2.Peer.ipv4(allowedCidrRange), ec2.Port.tcp(3400), \"Search Service\");\n\n    const proxySGId = proxySG.securityGroupId\n    nucleusSG.addIngressRule(\n      ec2.Peer.securityGroupId(proxySGId), ec2.Port.tcp(8080), \"HTTP Traffic\");\n    nucleusSG.addIngressRule(\n      ec2.Peer.securityGroupId(proxySGId), ec2.Port.tcp(3180), \"Auth login\");\n    nucleusSG.addIngressRule(\n      ec2.Peer.securityGroupId(proxySGId), ec2.Port.tcp(3100), \"Auth Service\");\n    nucleusSG.addIngressRule(\n      ec2.Peer.securityGroupId(proxySGId), ec2.Port.tcp(3333), \"Discovery Service\");\n    nucleusSG.addIngressRule(\n      ec2.Peer.securityGroupId(proxySGId), ec2.Port.tcp(3030), \"LFT\");\n    nucleusSG.addIngressRule(\n      ec2.Peer.securityGroupId(proxySGId), ec2.Port.tcp(3019), \"Core API\");\n    nucleusSG.addIngressRule(\n      ec2.Peer.securityGroupId(proxySGId), ec2.Port.tcp(3020), \"Tagging Service\");\n    nucleusSG.addIngressRule(\n      ec2.Peer.securityGroupId(proxySGId), ec2.Port.tcp(3400), \"Search Service\");\n\nStep 4. Add TLS Certificate and set the domain from Step 1 for validation\nNote: the root-domain variable must be set to the domain registered with the Route 53 hosted zone from Step 1.\n\nconst rootDomain = root-domain;\n    const fullDomain = 'nucleus.'+rootDomain;\n    const hostedZone = route53.HostedZone.fromLookup(this, \n        'PublicHostedZone', {domainName: rootDomain}\n    );\n\n    const certificate = new acm.Certificate(this, 'PublicCertificate', {\n      domainName: rootDomain,\n      subjectAlternativeNames: [`*.${rootDomain}`],\n      validation: acm.CertificateValidation.fromDns(hostedZone),\n    });\n\nNote: Currently there is no additional management of this CNAME record. Meaning when you no longer require it, you\u2019ll have to remove it manually from your Route 53 Hosted Zone.\nStep 5. Add reverse proxy resources\nFor the reverse proxy, configure it with Nitro Enclaves enabled. Enclaves provides features to create isolated compute environments to protect and securely process highly sensitive data. In this case that\u2019s our TLS certificate. On top of that, Nitro Enclaves has support for integration with Amazon Certificates Manager. This means Certificates Manager can automatically handle the rotation of the certificate. For more information, see AWS Nitro Enclaves User Guide.\nStarting from the Certificate Manager for Nitro Enclaves AMI, create a c5.xlarge instance with 32GB of storage. In this case c5.xlarge was chosen as one of the smallest available instances required for the Nitro Enclaves AMI. Configure a basic instance role with the AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore policy. This allows you to connect to the instance with AWS Systems Manager (SSM) and avoid opening the instance to SSH traffic over the internet.\nFinally, attach a \u201cdummy\u201d IAM policy to the reverse proxy. This is an empty policy which will get updated with the configuration scripts.\nNote, if your Region is not in the list of Regions below, review the AMI listing on the AWS Marketplace AWS Certificate Manager for Nitro Enclaves or the AWS Documentation for finding the correct AMI ID, Finding AMI IDs.\n\n// AWS Certificate Manager for Nitro Enclaves AMI\n    const proxyServerAMI = new ec2.GenericLinuxImage({\n      'us-west-1': 'ami-0213075968e811ea7',    //california\n      'us-west-2': 'ami-01c4415fd6c2f0927',    //oregon\n      'us-east-1': 'ami-00d96e5ee00daa484',    //virginia\n      'us-east-2': 'ami-020ea706ac260de21',    //ohio\n      'ca-central-1': 'ami-096dd1150b96b6125', //canada\n      'eu-central-1': 'ami-06a2b19f6b97762cb', //frankfurt\n      'eu-west-1': 'ami-069e205c9dea19322',    //ireland\n      'eu-west-2': 'ami-069b79a2d7d0d9408'     //london\n    })\n\n    const proxyInstanceRole = new iam.Role(this, 'proxyInstanceRole', {\n      assumedBy: new iam.ServicePrincipal('ec2.amazonaws.com'),\n      description: 'EC2 Instance Role',\n      managedPolicies: [\n          iam.ManagedPolicy.fromAwsManagedPolicyName('AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore')\n      ],\n      inlinePolicies: {\n        getBucketObjectsPolicy: getBucketObjectsPolicy\n      }\n    });\n\n    const cfnInstanceProfile = new iam.CfnInstanceProfile(this, 'proxyInstanceProfile', {\n      roles: [proxyInstanceRole.roleName],\n    });\n\n    // using CfnInstance because it exposes enclaveOptions\n    const cfnInstance = new ec2.CfnInstance(this, 'reverseProxyServer',  {\n      blockDeviceMappings: [{\n          deviceName: '/dev/xvda',\n          ebs: {\n            encrypted: true,\n            volumeSize: 32,\n          }\n        }],\n      enclaveOptions: {\n          enabled: true,\n      },\n      imageId: proxyServerAMI.getImage(this).imageId,\n      instanceType: 'c5.xlarge',\n      securityGroupIds: [proxySG.securityGroupId],\n      subnetId: vpc.selectSubnets({subnetGroupName: 'publicSubnetNatGateway'}).subnetIds[0],\n      tags: [{\n          key: 'Name',\n          value: 'Nucleus-ReverseProxy',\n        }],\n      iamInstanceProfile: cfnInstanceProfile.ref\n    })\n\n    new route53.CnameRecord(this, `CnameApiRecord`, {\n      recordName: fullDomain,\n      zone: hostedZone,\n      domainName: cfnInstance.attrPublicDnsName,\n    });\n\n\n    const revProxyCertAssociationPolicy = new iam.ManagedPolicy(this, 'revProxyCertAssociationPolicy', {\n        statements: [\n        new iam.PolicyStatement({\n          actions: [\"s3:GetObject\"], resources: [\"*\"]\n        })\n      ]\n    })\n    proxyInstanceRole.addManagedPolicy(revProxyCertAssociationPolicy)\n\nStep 6. Add Nucleus Server resources\nNext, configure the Nucleus Server. Start with the Ubuntu, 20.04 LTS AMI with c5.4xlarge as the instance type. C5 instances are optimized for compute-intensive workloads and deliver cost-effective high performance at a low price per compute ratio. The instance has 16 vCPUs and 32GB of Memory. An Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume is attached to the instance with 512GB of storage. These specs were chosen to be sufficiently large for a proof of concept.\nThe instance user data script is configured to install docker, docker-compose, and the AWS CLI.\n\nconst nucleusServerAMI = new ec2.GenericLinuxImage({\n      'us-west-1': 'ami-0dc5e9ff792ec08e3',    //california\n      'us-west-2': 'ami-0ee8244746ec5d6d4',    //oregon\n      'us-east-1': 'ami-09d56f8956ab235b3',    //virginia\n      'us-east-2': 'ami-0aeb7c931a5a61206',    //ohio\n      'ca-central-1': 'ami-0fb99f22ad0184043', //canada\n      'eu-central-1': 'ami-015c25ad8763b2f11', //frankfurt\n      'eu-west-1': 'ami-00c90dbdc12232b58',    //ireland\n      'eu-west-2': 'ami-0a244485e2e4ffd03'     //london\n    })\n\n    const nucleusEbsVolume: ec2.BlockDevice = {\n      deviceName: '/dev/sda1',\n      volume: ec2.BlockDeviceVolume.ebs(512, {\n          encrypted: true,\n      })\n    };\n\n    const nucleusInstanceRole = new iam.Role(this, 'nucleusInstanceRole', {\n      assumedBy: new iam.ServicePrincipal('ec2.amazonaws.com'),\n      description: 'EC2 Instance Role',\n      managedPolicies: [\n          iam.ManagedPolicy.fromAwsManagedPolicyName('AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore')\n      ],\n      inlinePolicies: {\n        getBucketObjectsPolicy: getBucketObjectsPolicy\n      }\n    });\n\n    const nucleusUserData = `\n    #!/bin/bash\n    sudo apt-get update\n\n    # docker\n    sudo apt-get -y install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common\n    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -\n    sudo add-apt-repository \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable\"\n    sudo apt-get -y update\n    sudo apt-get -y install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io\n\n    # docker compose\n    sudo curl -L \"https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)\" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n\n    # aws cli\n    sudo curl \"https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip\" -o \"awscliv2.zip\"\n    sudo apt-get install unzip\n    sudo unzip awscliv2.zip\n    sudo ./aws/install\n    sudo rm awscliv2.zip\n    sudo rm -fr ./aws/install\n    `\n\n    const nucleusServerInstance = new ec2.Instance(this, \"NucleusServer\", {\n      instanceType: new ec2.InstanceType(\"c5.4xlarge\"),\n      machineImage: nucleusServerAMI,\n      blockDevices: [nucleusEbsVolume],\n      vpc: vpc,\n      role: nucleusInstanceRole,\n      securityGroup:  nucleusSG,\n      userData: ec2.UserData.custom(nucleusUserData),\n      vpcSubnets: vpc.selectSubnets({subnetGroupName: 'privateSubnet'}),\n      detailedMonitoring: true,\n    });\n\n    Tags.of(nucleusServerInstance).add(\"Name\", \"Nucleus-Server\");\n\nStep 7. Configure stack outputs\nNext, add output values so you can easily reference them later.\n\nnew CfnOutput(this, 'region', {\n      value: this.region\n    }).overrideLogicalId('region');\n\n    new CfnOutput(this, 'artifactsBucketName', {\n      value: artifactsBucket.bucketName\n    }).overrideLogicalId('artifactsBucketName');\n\n    new CfnOutput(this, 'tlsCertifcateArn', {\n      value: certificate.certificateArn\n    }).overrideLogicalId('tlsCertifcateArn');\n\n    new CfnOutput(this, 'proxyInstanceRoleArn', {\n      value: proxyInstanceRole.roleArn\n    }).overrideLogicalId('proxyInstanceRoleArn');\n\n    new CfnOutput(this, 'proxyCertAssociationPolicyArn', {\n      value: revProxyCertAssociationPolicy.managedPolicyArn\n    }).overrideLogicalId('proxyCertAssociationPolicyArn');\n\n    new CfnOutput(this, 'nucleusServerPrivateDnsName', {\n      value: nucleusServerInstance.instancePrivateDnsName\n    }).overrideLogicalId('nucleusServerPrivateDnsName');\n\n    new CfnOutput(this, 'domain', {\n      value: fullDomain\n    }).overrideLogicalId('domain');\n\nStep 8. Deploy the stack\n\ncdk deploy\n\nOnce this is complete, you will have the basic resources required and next you will configure them.\nIf you encounter the following CDK deploy error:\n\n[Error at /NucleusAppStack] Found zones: [] for dns:DOMAIN, privateZone:undefined, vpcId:undefined, but wanted exactly 1 zone\n\nCheck that you have the correct domain specified and that your hosted zone exists in the Route 53 console Route 53 Hosted zones.\nStep 9. Note the stack output values. You\u2019ll use them in the future\n\nOutputs:\nNucleusAppStack.*artifactsBucketName*  = nucleusappstack-artifactsbucket\u2026\nNucleusAppStack.*domain*  = nucleus.my_omniverse.com\nNucleusAppStack.*nucleusServerPrivateDnsName*  = ip-...us-west-2.compute.internal\nNucleusAppStack.*proxyCertAssociationPolicyArn*  = arn:aws:iam::...:policy/...\nNucleusAppStack.*proxyInstanceRoleArn*  = arn:aws:iam::...:role/...\nNucleusAppStack.*region*  = ...\nNucleusAppStack.*tlsCertifcateArn*  = arn:aws:acm:...:...:certificate/...\n\nConfigure The Reverse Proxy Server\nStep 1. Associate Enclave certificate with proxy instance IAM role\nThe first thing you have to do with the reverse proxy is associate your certificate with the IAM role that the Nitro Enclave uses. In the following code, please replace tls-certificate-arn, proxy-instance-role-arn, proxy-cert-association-policy-arn, and region in the below script with stack output values from above.\nNote: The following script was written in Python 3.9. If you have issues with conflicting python versions. It\u2019s recommended that you set a local virtualenv. For more information, see Python Tutorial Virtual Environments and Packages.\n\nCERT_ARN = tls-certificate-arn\nROLE_ARN = proxy-instance-role-arn\nROLE_POLICY_ARN = proxy-cert-association-policy-arn\nREGION = region\n \nimport boto3\nimport json\n \nec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')\niam_client = boto3.client('iam')\niam_rsrc = boto3.resource('iam')\n \nresponse = ec2_client.associate_enclave_certificate_iam_role(\n    CertificateArn=CERT_ARN,\n    RoleArn=ROLE_ARN\n)\n \nprint(response)\n \nbucket = response['CertificateS3BucketName']\ns3object = response['CertificateS3ObjectKey']\nkmskeyid = response['EncryptionKmsKeyId']\n \n# update policy with association resources\npolicy = iam_rsrc.Policy(ROLE_POLICY_ARN)\npolicyJson = policy.default_version.document\ncur_version = policy.default_version_id\n \npolicyJson['Statement'] = [\n{\n    \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n    \"Action\": [\n    \"s3:GetObject\"\n    ],\n    \"Resource\": [f\"arn:aws:s3:::{bucket}/*\"]\n},{\n    \"Sid\": \"VisualEditor0\",\n    \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n    \"Action\": [\n        \"kms:Decrypt\"\n    ],\n    \"Resource\": f\"arn:aws:kms:{REGION}:*:key/{kmskeyid}\"\n},{\n        \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n        \"Action\": \"iam:GetRole\",\n        \"Resource\": ROLE_ARN\n}]\n \nresponse = iam_client.create_policy_version(\n    PolicyArn = ROLE_POLICY_ARN,\n    PolicyDocument= json.dumps(policyJson),\n    SetAsDefault= True\n)\n \nprint(response)\n \nresponse = iam_client.delete_policy_version(\n    PolicyArn = ROLE_POLICY_ARN,\n    VersionId = cur_version\n)\n \nprint(response)\n\nThis script associates an identity and IAM role with an AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate. This enables the certificate to be used by the ACM for Nitro Enclaves application inside an enclave. For more information, see Certificate Manager for Nitro Enclaves in the Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves User Guide. The script then updates the IAM role policy with permissions to get its own role, download the certificate, and decrypt it.\nSave the script to a file and run it from the terminal:\n\npython ./associate_enclave_cert.py\n\nStep 2. Configure Nginx conf\nNVIDIA provides a sample Nginx config for the Nucleus deployment. It is packaged within a provided archive file. At the time of writing this, the latest is nucleus-stack-2022.4.0+tag-2022.4.0-rc.1.gitlab.6522377.48333833.tar.gz\nOpen the archive and look for: ssl/nginx.ingress.router.conf\nThis file needs to be updated and then placed at /etc/nginx/conf.d/nginx.conf on the reverse proxy instance.\nFirst, you need to update the config with configuration outlined in the AWS Certificate Manager for Nitro Enclaves guide: Nitro Enclaves application: AWS Certificate Manager for Nitro Enclaves.\nAt the top of the file, in the main context add the following:\n\nuser nginx;\nworker_processes auto;\nerror_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;\npid /run/nginx.pid;\n\nssl_engine pkcs11;\n\nAfter the line, # Configure your SSL options as required by your security practices, add the below snippet:\n\nssl_protocols TLSv1.2;\nssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;\nssl_session_timeout  10m;\nssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;\n\n# Set this to the stanza path configured in /etc/nitro_enclaves/acm.yaml\ninclude \"/etc/pki/nginx/nginx-acm.conf\";\n\nNext, update the config file with the Nucleus Server private DNS address and the fully qualified domain for your server. Replace instances of my-ssl-nucleus.my-company.com with your domain. Then, replace instances of BASE_STACK_IP_OR_HOST with the nucleusServerPrivateDnsName from the stack outputs above.\nStep 3. Copy the .conf file to Amazon S3\n\naws s3 cp ssl/nginx.ingress.router.conf s3://artifactBucketName/nginx.conf\n\nStep 4. Connect to the proxy instance\nFrom your web browser, navigate to the EC2 Dashboard in the AWS Console, select the Nucleus-ReverseProxy instance, and press the Connect button.\nSelect the Session Manager tab, then press the Connect button.\n\nStep 5. In the terminal, copy the nginx.conf file path from Amazon S3 to /etc/nginx/\n\nsudo aws s3 cp s3://*artifactBucketName*/nginx.conf  ./nginx.conf \nsudo mv ./nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/nginx.conf\n\nStep 6. While still in the proxy server terminal, rename the sample ACM for Nitro Enclaves configuration file from /etc/nitro_enclaves/acm.example.yaml to /etc/nitro_enclaves/acm.yaml using the following command:\n\nsudo mv /etc/nitro_enclaves/acm.example.yaml /etc/nitro_enclaves/acm.yaml\n\nStep 7. Update the acm.yaml certificate_arn value\nUsing your preferred text editor, open /etc/nitro_enclaves/acm.yaml. In the ACM section, update certificate_arn, with the ARN of the certificate from our stack. This is the tls-certificate-arn from the stack outputs above. Save and close the file.\nStep 8. Start the Nginx server\n\nsudo systemctl start  nitro-enclaves-acm.service\nsudo systemctl enable  nitro-enclaves-acm\n\nStep 9. Confirm the server is accepting TLS requests to your domain\n\ncurl https://nucleus.my-omniverse.com\n\nYou\u2019ll see a generic HTML template as output.\nConfigure Nucleus Server\nMuch of the following comes from NVIDIA\u2019s documentation on deploying a Nucleus Server. Review these docs for more information: Enterprise Nucleus Server Quick Start Tips.\nStep 1. From your local computer using the AWS CLI, copy the Nucleus Stack archive to Amazon S3\n\naws s3 cp  ./nucleus-stack-2022.4.0+tag-2022.4.0-rc.1.gitlab.6522377.48333833.tar.gz s3://*artifactBucketName*/nucleus-stack-2022.4.0+tag-2022.4.0-rc.1.gitlab.6522377.48333833.tar.gz\n\nStep 2. Connect to the Nucleus Server with EC2 Session Manager\nWith your web browser, navigate to the EC2 Dashboard in the AWS Console, select the Nucleus-Server instances, press the Connect button, and then press the Connect button again on the Session Manager tab.\nStep 3. In the Nucleus-Server terminal, change directory to the home directory, and then copy the Nucleus Stack from S3\n\ncd ~\naws s3 cp s3://*artifactBucketName*/nucleus-stack-2022.4.0+tag-2022.4.0-rc.1.gitlab.6522377.48333833.tar.gz  ./nucleus-stack-2022.4.0+tag-2022.4.0-rc.1.gitlab.6522377.48333833.tar.gz \n\nStep 4. Unpack the archive to an appropriate directory, then cd into that directory\n\nomniverse_root=/opt/ove\nsudo mkdir -p $omniverse_root\nsudo tar xzvf  nucleus-stack-2022.4.0+tag-2022.4.0-rc.1.gitlab.6522377.48333833.tar.gz -C  $omniverse_root --strip-components=1\ncd ${omniverse_root}/base_stack\n\nStep 5. Update nucleus-stack.env\nWith your preferred text editor, review the nucleus-stack.env file. It is recommended that you review this file in its entirety. You will use this file to confirm that you accept the NVIDIA Omniverse end user license agreement.\nThen update the following nucleus-stack.env variables as needed\n\nACCEPT_EULA          Review the notes in the .env file\nSECURITY_REVIEWED    Review the notes in the .env file\nSERVER_IP_OR_HOST    Set to the Nucleus Server private DNS name\nSSL_INGRESS_HOST     Set as fully qualified domain name eg, nucleus.my_omniverse.com\nMASTER_PASSWORD      Omniverse master user password\nSERVICE_PASSWORD     Omniverse service user password\nINSTANCE_NAME        Omniverse instance name\nDATA_ROOT            Omniverse Data root directory\nWEB_PORT             NVIDIA recommends that you set this to 8080, this is also what the nginx.conf is configured to expect \n\nStep 6. Generate secrets required for authentication\nNote the following is required because you are not using SSO integration at this time. See the security notes in nucleus-stack.env for more information.\n\nsudo chmod +x  ./generate-sample-insecure-secrets.sh\nsudo ./generate-sample-insecure-secrets.sh\n\nStep 7. Pull the Nucleus docker images sudo docker-compose \u2013env-file ${omniverse_root}/base_stack/nucleus-stack.env -f ${omniverse_root}/base_stack/nucleus-stack-ssl.yml pull\nStep 8. Start the Nucleus stack\n\nsudo docker-compose --env-file ${omniverse_root}/base_stack/nucleus-stack.env -f ${omniverse_root}/base_stack/nucleus-stack-ssl.yml up -d\n\nUsage\nBack on your local machine, test a connection to your Nucleus Server by pointing your web browser to the domain you specified in the .env file. You should be greeted with the following login dialog:\n\nHere you can use the Master or Service Username and Password configured in the nucleus-stack.env, or press Create Account. Then you\u2019ll be presented with a navigator view of your Nucleus Server content\n\nCleanup\nStep 1. Disassociate the Nitro Enclave certificate by running the dissacociate_enclave_cert.py script\n\nprint(response)\nCERT_ARN = \"*tlsCertifcateArn*\"\nROLE_ARN = \"*proxyInstanceRoleArn*\"\n \nimport boto3\n \nec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')\n \nresponse = ec2_client. disassociate_enclave_certificate_iam_role(\n    CertificateArn=CERT_ARN,\n    RoleArn=ROLE_ARN\n)\n\nStep 2. Delete the stack by running cdk desktroy from the nucleus-app application folder.\nConclusion\nThis post provides the basics to get up and running with NVIDIA Omniverse Nucleus on Amazon EC2 using the Docker Compose container.

The new cash brings PassiveLogic\u2019s total raised to over $80 million, and CEO Troy Harvey tells TechCrunch it\u2019ll be put toward expanding the Utah-based company\u2019s headcount from 100 employees to 140 within the next year.\nThe investment represents a major vote of confidence in PassiveLogic, considering that the startup hasn\u2019t released any products to the public yet (although a beta\u2019s planned for later this year). Nvidia was perhaps won over by PassiveLogic\u2019s go-to-market strategy, which netted the startup contractual commitments for the first two years of sales and distribution partners that plan to include PassiveLogic\u2019s platform in construction and retrofit projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were impressed with PassiveLogic\u2019s vision to revolutionize the real estate industry through autonomous operations at the edge,\u201d nVentures head Mohamad Siddeek said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe are excited to support a world-class team with deep industry and technical expertise as they prepare to launch a highly differentiated solution with their initial customers.\u201d\nHarvey founded PassiveLogic in 2016 with Jeremy Fillingim, who was previously a partner at Mote Systems, where he designed a touchscreen universal remote control. Harvey is the ex-CEO of Heliocentric, an engineering firm that worked with clients to architect \u201cnext-generation\u201d buildings.\nPassiveLogic\u2019s service \u2014 running on Nvidia\u2019s Jetson computing platform \u2014 interfaces with legacy building systems using a combination of sensors, software and on-premises devices. The software lets customers create system models from 3D drawings or scans, which are then used to generate physics-based \u201cdigital twins\u201d that predict how a buildings\u2019 equipment will interact. Based on data from the digital twin, PassiveLogic makes control and management decisions for the real-world building\u2019s systems.\nImage Credits: PassiveLogic\n\u201cOur research indicates that the biggest use case for generalized autonomy is buildings, which represent 25% of the world economy,\u201d Harvey told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cUnlike cars, each building is a one-off, with entirely custom needs for autonomous controls \u2026 A large building could have 500,000 inputs and outputs \u2014 or sensors and controllable degrees of freedom. That is enormous.\u201d\nBeyond the aforementioned features, PassiveLogic automatically structures, labels and fuses building data into an ontology for use by third-party cloud apps. Responding to a question about privacy, Harvey asserted that all of PassiveLogic\u2019s computing and storage happens at the edge and that data (e.g., from sensors) is maintained on an independent intranet not accessible to other IT infrastructure.\n\n\u201cTo get to the future of real estate, there needs to be a digital platform that can aggregate building data, enable building managers to customize automation controls and act upon it in real-time,\u201d Harvey said. \u201c[T]he PassiveLogic platform solves the divide between IT and operational technology in the enterprise, and supports workflows that acknowledge that building controls purchasing decisions are most often made not at the C-level, but by the contractors installing controls.\u201d\nWhile PassiveLogic is currently focused on buildings and building infrastructure, Harvey believes that the company\u2019s technology is applicable to other control systems, like energy grids and logistics and supply chain facilities. The long-term plan is to adapt PassiveLogic\u2019s products to broader markets, including the utilities and networking sectors.\nCompetitors in the space include Honeywell, which recently launched an AI-powered building control system, and HVAC management startups BrainBox and 75F. There\u2019s also Mesa, a platform from Sidewalk Labs designed to help commercial building operators optimize existing climate control systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nAI, AI, Apps, Artificial Intelligence (AI), autonomous, buildings, Climate Control, construction, Enterprise, Funding, Internet of Things, machine learning, PassiveLogic, Startups, Startups \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tKyle Wiggers\t\n\n\n\nAI Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tKyle Wiggers is TechCrunch\u2019s AI Editor.

It\u2019s the first AI act to reach an AGT finals.\nCalled \u201cthe best act of the series so far\u201d and \u201cone of the most unique things we\u2019ve ever seen on this show\u201d by notoriously tough judge Simon Cowell, the team\u2019s performances involve a demonstration of photorealistic AI avatars, animated in real time by singers on stage.\nIn Metaphysic\u2019s semifinals act, three singers \u2014 Daniel Emmet, Patrick Dailey and John Riesen \u2014 lent their voices to AI avatars of Cowell, fellow judge Howie Mandel and host Terry Crews, performing the opera piece \u201cNessun Dorma.\u201d For the finale, the team plans to \u201cbring back one of the greatest rock and roll icons of all time,\u201d but it\u2019s keeping the audience guessing.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mDJSq7bInY\nThe AGT winner will be announced on Wednesday, Sept. 14.\n\u201cMetaphysic\u2019s history-making run on America\u2019s Got Talent has allowed us to showcase the application of AI on one of the most-watched stages in the world,\u201d said the startup\u2019s co-founder and CEO Tom Graham, who appears on the show alongside co-founder Chris Um\u00e9.\n(L to R): Daniel Emmet, Tom Graham and Chris Um\u00e9 presented Metaphysic\u2019s audition for \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d (Photo by Trae Patton/NBC, courtesy of Metaphysic.)\n\u201cWhile overall awareness of synthetic media has grown in recent years, Metaphysic\u2019s AGT performances provide a front-row seat into how this technology could impact the future of everything, from the internet to entertainment to education,\u201d he said.\nCapturing Imaginations While Raising AI Awareness\nFounded in 2021, London-based Metaphysic is developing AI technologies to help creators build virtual identities and synthetic content that is hyperrealistic, moving beyond the so-called uncanny valley.\nThe team initially went viral last year for DeepTomCruise, a TikTok channel featuring videos where actor Miles Fisher animated an AI avatar of Tom Cruise. The posts garnered around 100 million views and \u201cprovided many people with their first introduction to the incredible capabilities of synthetic media,\u201d Graham said.\nBy bringing its AI avatars to the AGT stage, the company has been able to reach millions more viewers \u2014 with sophisticated camera rigs and performers on stage demonstrating how the technology works live and in real time.\nAI, GPU Acceleration Behind the Curtain\nMetaphysic\u2019s AI avatar software pipeline includes variants of the popular StyleGAN model developed by NVIDIA Research. The team, which uses the TensorFlow deep learning framework, relies on NVIDIA CUDA software to accelerate its work on NVIDIA GPUs.\n\u201cWithout NVIDIA hardware and software libraries, we wouldn\u2019t be able to pull off these hyperreal results to the level we have,\u201d said Jo Plaete, director of product innovation at Metaphysic. \u201cThe computation provided by our NVIDIA hardware platforms allows us to train larger and more complex models at a speed that allows us to iterate on them quickly, which results in those most perfectly tuned results.\u201d\nFor both AI model development and inference during live performances, Metaphysic uses NVIDIA DGX systems as well as other workstations and data center configurations with NVIDIA GPUs \u2014 including NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs.\n\u201cExcellent hardware support has helped us troubleshoot things really fast when in need,\u201d said Plaete. \u201cAnd having access to the research and engineering teams helps us get a deeper understanding of the tools and how we can leverage them in our pipelines.\u201d\nFollowing AGT, Metaphysic plans to pursue several collaborations in the entertainment industry. The company has also launched a consumer-facing platform, called Every Anyone, that enables users to create their own hyperrealistic AI avatars.\nDiscover the latest in AI and metaverse technology by registering free for NVIDIA GTC, running online Sept. 19-22.

This process computed the approximate focal length, orientation and position of the camera in 3D space, based on the defined control points chosen from his Etch\u016b-Daimon reference image.\nThe artist then moved to Blender software to begin the initial blockout, a 3D rough-draft level built with simple 3D shapes without details or polished art assets. The goal of the blockout was to prototype, test and adjust the foundational shapes of the level.\nDrago tests and adjusts foundational shapes of the level in Blender during the blockout phase of the project.\nFrom there, Drago measured the height of a staircase and extrapolated those proportions to the rest of the 3D scene, ensuring it fit the grid size. The scene could then be built modularly, one model at a time. He modeled with lightning speed using NVIDIA RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in the Blender viewport.\nIncredibly, the entire scene is a combination of custom-textured assets. Drago\u2019s texturing technique elevated the sense of realism by using tileable textures and trim sheets, which are textures that combine separate details into a single sheet. Mixing these techniques proved to be profitable in creating original, more detailed textures, as well as keeping good pixel density across the scene. Textures never exceeded more than 2048\u00d72048 pixels in size.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/studio-itns-wk21-substance-texturing-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nDrago created his textures in Adobe Substance 3D Painter, taking advantage of NVIDIA Iray rendering for faster, interactive rendering. RTX acceleration enabled him to quickly bake ambient occlusion and other maps used in texturing, before exporting and applying the textures to the models inside Unreal Engine 5.\nFinal frame renders came quickly with Drago\u2019s GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER GPU doing the heavy lifting. Drago stressed the necessity of his graphics card.\n\u201cFor a 3D artist, probably the majority of the work, excluding the planning phases, requires GPU acceleration,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing able to work on scenes and objects with materials and lighting rendered in real time saves a lot of time and headaches compared to wireframe or unshaded modes.\u201d\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/studio-itns-wk21-ue5-lighting-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nDrago moved on to importing and assembling his textured models in Unreal Engine 5. Elated with the assembly, he began the lighting process. Unreal Engine 5\u2019s Lumen technology enabled lighting iterations in real time, without Drago having to wait for baking or render times.\nUnreal Engine\u2019s virtual-reality framework allowed Drago to set up a virtual camera with motion tracking. This gave the animation its signature third-person vantage point, enabling the artist to move around his creative space as if he were holding a smartphone.\nThe GPU-accelerated NVDEC decoder in Premiere Pro enabled smooth playback and scrubbing of high-resolution video for Drago.\nWith the renders and animation in place, Drago exported the scene to Adobe Premiere Pro software, where he added sound effects. He also sharpened image details in the animation, one of the many GPU-accelerated features in the software. Drago then deployed GPU-accelerated encoding, NVENC, to speed up the exporting of final files.\nSubtle modifications allowed Drago to create ultra-realistic renders. \u201cMimicking a contemporary smartphone camera \u2014 with a limited dynamic range, glare and sharpening artifacts \u2014 was a good way of selling the realism,\u201d he said.\n\u201cRTX features, like DLSS and ray tracing, are amazing, both from a developer\u2019s point of view and a gamer\u2019s,\u201d Drago stated.\nNVIDIA 3D artist Lorenzo Drago.\nDrago recently imported Etch\u016b-Daimon Station into NVIDIA Omniverse, a 3D design platform for collaborative editing, which replaces linear pipelines with live-sync creation. Drago noted the massive potential within the Omniverse Create App, calling it \u201ca powerful tool capable of achieving extremely high-fidelity results.\u201d\nNVIDIA GTC, a global AI conference running online Sept. 19-22, will feature Omniverse sessions with industry experts to demonstrate how the platform can elevate creative workflows.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: EVGA)\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most important makers of Nvidia-based graphics cards won't be making them anymore: EVGA has decided not to produce video cards with Nvidia's next generation of GPUs, the RTX 40-series, reports analyst Jon Peddie. The news is even bigger than that, though: Speaking to Gamers Nexus, EVGA CEO Andrew Han said that the California-based company isn't just skipping the next generation of Nvidia chips, but will \"completely stop\" making graphics cards going forward.EVGA has been making graphics cards since it was founded in 1999, going all the way back to Nvidia's RIVA TNT2 chips, but Han \"wouldn't even entertain the idea of working with Intel or AMD\" to continue producing cards, says Gamers Nexus.EVGA's decision is at least partially the result of frustration over its treatment by Nvidia, according to both sources; it's \"about respect,\" Gamers Nexus said. Graphics cards are reportedly 80% of EVGA's current business, but that doesn't mean it plans to close up shop because of its split with Nvidia\u2014it told Gamers Nexus that it doesn't even have layoffs planned. Once EVGA finishes selling off its stock of RTX 30-series cards, it will focus on its other products, which include motherboards, power supplies, and other PC components and peripherals.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is winding down developer support for 9 and 10-series graphics cards, but they'll likely keep getting driver updates for a while yet\n\n\n\n\nMSI says that the supply of its RTX 5090 cards will be very tight, due to a limited supply of GPUs from Nvidia\n\n\n\nThe majority of EVGA's revenue comes from sales of its Nvidia graphics cards right now, but Han told Gamers Nexus that the margin is incredibly thin, and that EVGA makes 300% more profit on power supplies. Even so, it isn't entirely clear how EVGA will ditch the largest part of its business without laying off any employees, including staff members currently dedicated to graphics card engineering and support. \"Attrition\" is expected, says Gamers Nexus.EVGA's decision isn't the sort of dispassionate business move one might expect: Han reportedly feels that Nvidia has been treating EVGA unfairly, and told Gamers Nexus that the decision to stop working with Nvidia was \"easy,\" because working with Nvidia was so hard.According to Jon Peddie Research, \"the relationship between EVGA and Nvidia changed from what EVGA considered a true partnership to [a] customer-seller arrangement whereby EVGA was no longer consulted on new product announcements and briefings, not featured at events, and not informed of price changes.\" Peddie and Gamers Nexus also say that EVGA was frustrated by Nvidia undercutting its cards with its own Founders Editions.EVGA's direct communication on the topic reveals much less. In a statement posted by EVGA in its forums today, the company said that it will continue to support its existing graphics cards, but \"will not carry the next generation graphics cards.\"The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\"EVGA is committed to our customers and will continue to offer sales and support on the current lineup,\" the company said. \"Also, EVGA would like to say thank you to our great community for the many years of support and enthusiasm for EVGA graphics cards.\"Nvidia's perspective on its relationship with EVGA isn't precisely known. The company did send PC Gamer a statement about EVGA's departure from the GeForce scene, but it's as diplomatic as it gets.\"We've had a great partnership with EVGA over the years and will continue to support them on our current generation of products,\" said an Nvidia representative. \"We wish Andrew [Han] and our friends at EVGA all the best.\"I think it's safe to assume that Nvidia might have more to say if it weren't a public company with a $328B market cap, but that's all we're getting for now.\u00a0The hole left by EVGA's exit from the Nvidia graphics card business will presumably be filled by other manufacturers, such as Gigabyte, ASUS, and Zotac. Nvidia recently teased something called \"Project Beyond,\" which we assume is related to its upcoming GeForce RTX 40-series GPUs. We expect to hear more this month.The 30-minute Gamers Nexus video on EVGA's departure from the graphics card business includes some further speculation on the company's motivations, and more about Han's plans for the future\u2014the EVGA CEO told the channel that he does not plan to retire or sell the company.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nTyler WildeSocial Links NavigationEditor-in-Chief, USTyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs.

As well, we will provide high-level details about how AWS addresses important components of connecting Omniverse users.\nIndustry Trends & Challenges\nIn today\u2019s environment, businesses are constantly innovating to stay competitive and relevant. Consumers have their own challenges they are trying to navigate. As a result, their behaviors can turn on a dime. Companies are working relentlessly to meet consumer expectations by reducing product cycle lifetimes.\nThe world has become more and more distributed, from global teams, to remote workers, increasingly intricate machinery, ever-growing datasets, and complex supply chains only becoming more complex.\u00a0The focus on environmental sustainability means that companies are working to reduce the total carbon impact of products, from design to transport to material waste. From the boardroom to the shop floor, business leaders around the globe are continuously putting pressure on their organizations to innovate and address these challenges.\nSpatial computing technologies are one area of innovation where businesses see opportunity to be more competitive and deliver value to the market. Underpinning spatial computing is 3D spatial data, a medium that is enabling organizations to tackle these challenges.\nInnovating with AWS Spatial Computing\nAWS Spatial Computing teams are innovating and solving industry challenges by making it easy to create, manage, operate, and deploy spatial computing experiences on AWS. By identifying pain points and developing building blocks, we are helping customers, like you, expand and simplify business operations by using 3D spatial data.\nSpatial data is complex. There are a dizzying number of applications that can create, view, and update 3D data. There are equally many file interchange formats and conversion processes. In today\u2019s demanding and fast-paced environments, the iteration of data must be quick. Your teams and stakeholders across all business lines need workflows that enable coordination and collaboration from their applications of choice.\u00a0NVIDIA Omniverse on AWS solves these challenges.\nWhat is Omniverse?\nNVIDIA Omniverse is \u201ca platform for building and operating metaverse applications, enabling enterprises of every size to develop custom 3D pipelines, and simulate large scale virtual worlds.\u201d\nThe Omniverse platform is built on Universal Scene Description (USD), a powerful, extensible 3D framework and ecosystem that enables 3D designers and developers to connect and collaborate between industry-leading 3D content creation, rendering, and simulation applications. Omniverse helps individual creators to connect and enhance their 3D artistic process, and enterprises to build and simulate large scale virtual worlds for industrial applications.\nWith Omniverse, everyone involved in the lifecycle of 3D data has access to high-quality visualizations, authoring, and review tools. Teams do not need additional overhead to manage complex 3D data pipelines. Instead, they can focus on their unique contributions to bring value to the market.\u00a0Non-technical stakeholders do not need to subject themselves to applications with steep learning curves, nor do results need to be compromised for the sake of iteration reviews.\nWhat is Omniverse Nucleus?\nA core feature of the Omniverse platform is Nucleus \u2014 the database and collaboration engine that enables real-time exchange of USD data. With Omniverse Nucleus, you can connect multiple users working in their preferred 3D applications, providing a single source of truth for their 3D data. This allows your teams to use the application they are the most comfortable with and opens the doors for rapid iteration.\nNVIDIA Omniverse Nucleus operates under a publish-and-subscribe model and enables efficient live synchronization between Omniverse applications. It transmits changes to USD scenes in real-time between connected applications.\nOmniverse Nucleus can be used by individual artists and creatives, deployed on a local workstation. Or, your enterprise teams can also deploy Omniverse Enterprise Nucleus Server on AWS.\nOmniverse Enterprise Nucleus Server On AWS\nTo support distributed Omniverse users, Nucleus should be deployed in a secure environment. With on-demand compute, storage, and networking resources, AWS infrastructure is well suited to all spatial computing workloads, including Omniverse Nucleus.\nWith an extensive selection of compute instance types and storage solutions, you can right-size your infrastructure and fine-tune performance as needed. The AWS global footprint provides you the ability to connect distributed users from all over the globe. With the security, encryption, identity, and access management controls, you keep complete control over your data.\nOmniverse running on AWS infrastructure opens a variety of use cases. In the retail industry, it is common for teams in different geographical locations to have ownership over each part of a product\u2019s lifecycle. These teams need to coordinate around the same desired end goal while working in their tool of choice.\nAs another example, manufacturing companies sit on a treasure trove of Computer Aided Design (CAD) assets. These assets are well suited for manufacturing, but need to be converted to be consumed by visualization tools offered by Omniverse. With the AWS global storage solution, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and content distribution networks, Amazon CloudFront, teams can easily deliver data to a Nucleus deployment and have it converted by Omniverse. Or, automate custom and third-party conversion processes with AWS Serverless technologies.\nYou can develop custom Omniverse Kit extensions that connect into AWS backend services to support event driven architectures.\nWith Omniverse RTX-powered visualization, simulation and out-of-the-box, life-like, render quality, Omniverse is an exceptional solution for synthetic data generation, data which can then be fed into Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) services for training models.\nNext Steps\nExplore Omniverse Enterprise today. Enterprises can purchase an Omniverse Enterprise Nucleus license, then learn how to Deploy Omniverse Enterprise Nucleus server on Amazon EC2.\n\n\n\n\n         TAGS: \n        AI, AR, Computer Vision, Digital Twin, Metaverse, Simulation, Spatial, VR, XR\n\n\n\n\n\nKellan Cartledge\nKellan Cartledge is a Senior Prototyping Architect focused on Spatial Computing at Amazon Web Services.
