That's actually a bit surprising though, given the news today:\nGoldman Sachs just reinitiated coverage of Nvidia.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nSo what\nWhat's more, Goldman Sachs didn't even diss the stock -- to the contrary, Goldman kind of likes Nvidia.\n\"We continue to view Nvidia as an industry leader in accelerated computing,\" said the analyst, \"and expect the proliferation of [artificial intelligence and machine learning] to drive\u00a0earnings\u00a0growth and a valuation multiple that exceeds the industry average over the long-run.\"\nFurthermore, Goldman sees a possible \"positive catalyst for the stock\" in Nvidia's upcoming annual Graphics Technology Conference (GTC 2022) to be held from March 21 to March 24. \"We expect management to unveil new products and provide more detail on its expanding SAM,\" said Goldman in a note covered by StreetInsider.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow what\nAll that being said, Goldman Sachs warned that that at its current share price of $219 and change, \"risk/reward on the stock is fairly balanced on a 12-month basis.\"\nFor this reason, Goldman declined to recommend the semiconductors star, assigning Nvidia only a $245 price target and a neutral rating. Moreover, the company didn't give even a hint of being interested in changing its mind (or its rating) on Nvidia in the near future, saying instead, \"We await normalization in consumer GPU demand and/or a better entry point before turning more constructive on the stock.\"\nAnd sad to say, I have to agree with Goldman Sachs on this one. Although it's true that Nvidia stock has gotten a lot cheaper -- losing about a third of its value over the last three months -- at a stock price currently 63 times trailing earnings, Nvidia still looks too expensive based on its projected 21% long-term annual earnings growth rate.\nSimply put: A price-to-earnings growth ratio of 3 is too high a price to pay -- even for Nvidia.\n\n\n\n\nRich Smith has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

It also makes semiconductor chips and hardware used for high-end computing in data centres as well as data-networking equipment.NVDA stock was down by as much as 3.5% Wednesday before recovering some losses. As at 11:30 EDT (UTC-4) the stock was changing hands at $263.90 per share and is down 12% for the year to date.The company was keen to emphasise a total addressable market (TAM) of $1trn (\u00a3757bn, \u20ac909bn) for its combined areas of business distributed across gaming, automotive, chips and software. Nvidia Analysts however were sceptical on how this figure was agreed on and when it will filter through into earnings.\u201cThe new trillion dollar TAM offers us with little to no assistance in figuring out how growth will flow into the model, particularly with limited to no explanation behind NVDA's calculation of TAM for each segment, or the timing as to when this outlook might be realized,\u201d Wedbush Securities\u00a0analyst Matt Bryson wrote in his latest research note.Tuesday\u2019s online event took place almost a month from the end of its current fiscal first quarter, but Nvidia CFO Colette Kress did not disclose any new financial guidance despite being pressed by analysts in a question-and-answer session.\u201cWhile we weren't expecting NVDA to update their quarterly revenue guide, management's choice not to talk to progress in the current quarter differed from last year,\u201d Wedbush\u2019s Bryson commented.Supply chainNvidia management also didn\u2019t address current supply chain issues that are preventing chips getting into the hands of customers.Supply constraints linked to the Covid-19 pandemic have resulted in car makers slowing production as they wait for chip deliveries and PC gaming enthusiasts seeing limited inventory and higher prices for Nvidia\u2019s RTX series of graphics cards, which are also popular with cryptocurrency miners.

Nvidia In his presentation, Kerris said the company was \u201cbuilding a long-term subscription-based model\u201d for Omniverse services while Nvidia\u2019s CFO said it was a driver of opportunity.\u201cNot only does Omniverse present a large software opportunity but it will also help drive a hardware opportunity as Omniverse runs on Nvidia-powered hardware,\u201d CFO Kress added.\u201cProbably the most concrete takeaway, in our view, is that NVDA now sees large software revenue opportunities that we believe could/should add to its data centre hardware sales streams with NVDA categorising these revenues in the hundreds of millions annually today with a total market in the 100s of billions per their TAM analysis,\u201d the Wedbush Securities analyst wrote.Hyperscale computingThe other key message from Nvidia\u2019s Investor Day was how the company was at the forefront of high-performance computing and artificial intelligence (AI).The company will offer two products\u00a0aimed at high-performance computing and AI: the Grace Hopper superchip and the Grace central processing unit (CPU) superchip. Both products take their name from the late US Navy Rear Admiral Grace Hopper, an early pioneer of computer programming. Nvidia Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said that its new Grace Hopper-named chips would be \"the new engine for the world's AI infrastructure\" giving a performance \u201corders of magnitude\u201d greater than its current range of Ampere\u00a0chips.\"Grace is on track for production next year. [It] moves and processes mountains of data and is ideal for AI infrastructures, scientific computing and Omniverse digital twins,\" Huang told investors and analysts at Tuesday\u2019s event.The H100 Grace Hopper superchip is currently in production with availability beginning in the third quarter of 2022 while the Grace GPU is on track for production in 2023.Overall, Wedbush\u2019s Bryson noted that Nvidia \"delivered a comprehensive vision around how they can continue to dominate in markets they control today\u201d and how they could \u201cestablish a similar position\u201d in the automotive industry and push into adjacent segments and develop \u201cincremental software revenue streams (that only further lock customers into NVDA's platforms).\"Nvidia will update the market on financial performance for its fiscal first quarter on 25 May.

However, with traditional trading you enter a contract to exchange the legal ownership of the individual shares or the commodities for money, and you own this until you sell it again.CFDs are leveraged products, which means that you only need to deposit a percentage of the full value of the CFD trade in order to open a position. But with traditional trading, you buy the assets for the full amount. In the UK, there is no stamp duty on CFD trading, but there is when you buy stocks, for example.CFDs attract overnight costs to hold the trades (unless you use 1-1 leverage), which makes them more suited to short-term trading opportunities. Stocks and commodities are more normally bought and held for longer. You might also pay a broker commission or fees when buying and selling assets direct and you\u2019d need somewhere to store them safely.\r\n \n Capital Com is an execution-only service provider.

(NYSE: KR) and NVIDIA today announced a strategic collaboration to reimagine the shopping experience using AI-enabled applications and services.\nKroger, the nation\u2019s largest grocer, and NVIDIA will build a state-of-art AI lab and demonstration center to expand Kroger\u2019s freshness initiatives, improve shipping logistics and create a better shopping experience in stores through digital twin simulations \u2014 virtual models designed to accurately reflect store layouts and other operations.\n\u201cOur collaboration with NVIDIA supports Kroger\u2019s \u2018Fresh for Everyone\u2019 commitment,\u201d said Wesley Rhodes, vice president of Technology Transformation & Research and Development at Kroger. \u201cWe look forward to learning more about how AI and data analytics will further our journey to provide our customers with anything, anytime, anywhere.\u201d\nThe lab will be located in Kroger\u2019s Cincinnati-based headquarters office. It will use the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite for retail, NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 Enterprise to build digital twin simulations and NVIDIA cuOpt to explore logistics optimizations. The initial installation will use nine NVIDIA DGX\u2122 A100 systems, NVIDIA InfiniBand networking and NVIDIA RTX\u2122 workstations to gather actionable insights on the grocer\u2019s nearly 2,800 stores across the United States.\n\u201cNVIDIA and Kroger\u2019s collaboration on AI and digital twins will further expand Kroger\u2019s digital technology leadership,\u201d said Azita Martin, vice president and general manager of Retail at NVIDIA. \u201cKroger already is delivering excellent customer experiences in stores and providing fast home delivery. With NVIDIA AI, shoppers gain more personalized experiences in physical stores and online.\u201d\nThe companies will explore how NVIDIA technology can:\n\nIdentify early indicators of deteriorating freshness through computer vision and analytics.\nUse dynamic routing for last-mile delivery to ensure freshness from farm to plate\nOptimize store efficiency and processes with digital twin store simulation\r\n\t\u00a0\n\nLearn more about Kroger\u2019s AI journey in the NVIDIA GTC AI Implementers Panel.

The GPU giant's GTC event this week indicated its path at least involves extracting repeat revenue from software that runs atop Nvidia's hardware. This has been apparent for a while now, from past statements and launches.\nGTC focused heavily on AI and graphics applications that cut across Nvidia's GPU, CPU, data processing, and automotive offerings. It is Nvidia's belief that software in the long run will generate more cash through subscriptions and upgrades than money coming in through one-time hardware shipments. These subscriptions will be tied to the software layer of Nvidia's full stack of technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress broke down the $1tr revenue opportunity, saying $100bn could come from gaming, $300bn from chips and systems, $150bn from AI Enterprise software, $150bn from Omniverse Enterprise software, and $300bn from the automotive sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an example, Nvidia is helping car makers to put Netflix-style subscription services to enable features like autonomous driving, from which Nv will presumably take some kind of cut. Mercedes Benz and Jaguar Land Rover will put autonomous cars with Nvidia's computers and software on the roads in 2024 and 2025 respectively, it is hoped.\n\"These services give OEMs an exciting opportunity to transform their business model like we have seen Tesla do with their Autopilot software that has grown in price from less than $5,000 to $12,000 a car today,\" said Ali Kani, vice president and general manager of Nvidia's automotive division, during an investor day presentation that ran alongside GTC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware represents a vast majority of the $300 billion automotive opportunity, said Kress at the investor meeting.\n\"Our software content per vehicle can be in the thousands of dollars over the lifetime of the vehicle compared to the hundreds of dollars for the hardware. And second, software scales with the installed base of vehicles, not annual production,\" she added.\n\nOur software content per vehicle can be in the thousands of dollars over the lifetime of the vehicle compared to the hundreds of dollars for the hardware\n\nNvidia's automotive business has three components: the Drive software stack for autonomous driving; in-vehicle hardware; and the datacenter infrastructure for management, training, and simulation, which were all upgraded at GTC.\nPreeminent automotive chip players, such as Renesas and NXP, are largely focused on supplying the components. Nvidia's full-stack approach takes some stress away from vehicle makers by providing the necessary tools and resources to train, test, and deploy complex AI systems. Intel and Qualcomm, and others, are also offering auto chips, but largely work with partners, like with the PC and smartphone markets.\n\nVR universe revenues\n\nNvidia is also placing big bets on what it calls the Omniverse and Facebook's Meta has called the Metaverse, which are virtual-reality universes in which users can play, interact, and build things. Nvidia sees opportunities in the hardware, and tools for creation and collaboration, for these 3D immersive spaces.\nThe 'verse opportunity could be expensive for Nvidia's consumer GPU users.\n\"The graphics required to deliver a cinematic VR experience in a massive multiplayer, physically accurate world will likely require three to four orders of magnitude more than the performance of our highest-end GPUs,\" said Jeff Fisher, senior vice president of gaming at Nvidia, during the investor conference. That means physical upgrades and software to make use of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also threw in buzzwords about virtual economies within the 'verses, with NFTs, real-estate, and cryptocurrencies as the backbones of it all.\n\"The GPU is offering more value than ever. Based on our data, they are spending $300 more than they paid for the graphics card they replaced,\" Fisher added.\nThere are three billion gamers globally, the number is growing every year, and there is no difference in hardware (GeForce hardware) and software (GeForce Now in the cloud) revenue opportunities, Kress claimed.\n\"The per user pricing is similar and annualizes at over $100 per year,\" Kress said.\nNvidia also expects to generate close to $150bn in subscription software through enterprise use of Omniverse, which is aimed at engineers and designers who want to build and simulate things in a 3D VR space.\n\"We also estimate $150bn software opportunity based on two opportunities. First, a per seat software subscription for professional designers and creators, which we estimate at 45 million [users] and second, a per-robot software subscription for digital twins, based on more than 10 million factories and warehouses,\" Kress said.\nAt GTC, Nvidia also announced the Enterprise AI 2.0, aka \"the operating system of AI,\" Manuvir Das, vice president of enterprise computing at Nvidia, said during the investor conference.\nCompared to its 1.0 predecessor, the software has expanded hardware support with the ability to run on CPU or GPU parts, as opposed to only GPUs. The software will also run on virtualized and bare metal servers, with support for VMWare, Red Hat, and other platforms in major public clouds, compared to only VMware support in its predecessor.\n\"For Nvidia AI Enterprise, we estimate the total available opportunity at $150bn based on the installed base of enterprise servers and our per server software pricing,\" Kress said.\n\nChip designers made bank in 2021 amid global shortage\nNvidia CEO: We're open to Intel making our chips\nIt takes big business to make Nvidia's Omniverse tangible\nHow Nvidia is overcoming slowdown issues in GPU clusters\n\nNvidia's software assets are built on the closed-source CUDA framework, which Nvidia considers a crown jewel. At GTC, the company announced more than 60 updates to CUDA-related software libraries, including frameworks for quantum computing, 6G networks, robotics, cybersecurity, and drug discovery.\n\"With each new SDK, new science, new applications and new industries can tap into the power of Nvidia computing. These SDKs tackle the immense complexity at the intersection of computing algorithms and science,\" said CEO Jensen Huang during a keynote on Tuesday.\nIt's interesting that Google has opted for a build approach, creating its own AI accelerators in the cloud and in handheld devices, and Facebook is taking a buy approach, using Nvidia's GPUs and AMD CPUs for its research. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n                    COMMENTS\n            \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNvidia won the AI training race, but inference is still anyone's game\n\nComment\u00a0When it's all abstracted by an API endpoint, do you even care what's behind the curtain?\n\nSystems12 Mar 2025 | 5\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAMD looks to undercut Nvidia, win gamers' hearts with RX 9070 series\nThe question is whether we can find them in stock and at MSRP\n\nSystems28 Feb 2025 | 51\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCoreWeave rides AI wave with IPO filing \u2013 but its fate hinges on Microsoft\nGPU farm discloses 77% of revenue tied to just two customers, putting Redmond giant front and center\n\nAI + ML4 Mar 2025 | \n\n\n\n\n\n \nHow legacy storage infrastructure could endanger your future\nYour data is critical to AI success.

(PHOTO: Getty Creative)  \u00b7 3yephotography via Getty Images By David Ramli and Low De Wei (Bloomberg) \u2014 The number of expatriate white-collar workers in Singapore fell to the lowest in more than a decade, suggesting that the city hasn\u2019t yet benefited from an exodus of professionals from the rival finance hub of Hong Kong. Ministry of Manpower figures released on Wednesday show that Employment Pass holders \u2014 a type of visa issued to foreign professionals, managers and executives earning at least S$4500 per month \u2014 fell by 9% in the year ended December 2021 to 161,700.  That\u2019s the lowest level since 2010 when there were 143,300 in the country, according to data on the Ministry of Manpower website and earlier pages stored by the Internet Archive. A spokesperson for the ministry had no immediate comment on the data. Singapore has traditionally drawn well-heeled expatriates thanks its low taxes and role as a regional base for a range of industries. But with Covid-19 exacerbating the concerns of some locals that foreigners are taking the best jobs, the government has been tightening the criteria for businesses wishing to hire such workers from abroad. Restrictions on travel thanks to the pandemic have also contributed to a steady decline in the net number of expatriates in the city over the last two years. Meanwhile, the exodus of white-collar professionals from Hong Kong hasn\u2019t translated into a boost for Singapore. The decline has extended beyond white-collar workers to include technicians and labourers in the construction sector. Housing projects and other building works have faced lengthy delays as a result. The total number of foreign workers in the city-state stood at 1.2 million at the end of last year, well below the 1.43 million that Singapore hosted in 2019. But the city has pledged to fill a shortage of overseas workers within the next few months. The number of blue-collar Work Permit holders rose by 15,400 in the six months ended December 2021. To be sure, numbers for white-collar expatriates could shift in the other direction this year as Singapore re-opens its borders in an effort to live with Covid while Hong Kong implements stringent measures that have exacerbated departures. \u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.

It combines the accuracy of DeepMap survey mapping with the freshness and scale of AI-based crowdsourced mapping.\nWith four localization layers \u2014 camera, lidar, radar and GNSS \u2014 DRIVE Map provides the redundancy and versatility required by the most advanced AI drivers.\nDRIVE Map will provide survey-level ground truth mapping coverage to 500,000 kilometers of roadway in North America, Europe and Asia by 2024. This map will be continuously updated and expanded with millions of passenger vehicles.\nNVIDIA DRIVE Map is available to the entire autonomous vehicle industry.\nMulti-Layered\u00a0\nDRIVE Map contains multiple localization layers of data for use with camera, radar, lidar and GNSS modalities. The AI driver can localize to each layer of the map independently, providing the diversity and redundancy required for the highest levels of autonomy.\nThe camera localization layer consists of map attributes such as lane dividers, road markings, road boundaries, traffic lights, signs and poles.\nDRIVE Map semantic localization layer\nThe radar localization layer is an aggregate point cloud of radar returns. It\u2019s particularly useful in poor lighting conditions, which are challenging for cameras, and in poor weather conditions, which are challenging for cameras and lidars.\nDRIVE Map radar localization layer\nRadar localization is also useful in suburban areas where typical map attributes aren\u2019t available, enabling the AI driver to localize based on surrounding objects that generate a radar return.\nThe lidar voxel layer provides the most precise and reliable representation of the environment. It builds a 3D representation of the world at 5-centimeter precision \u2014 accuracy very difficult to achieve with camera and radar.\nDRIVE Map lidar voxel localization layer\n\u00a0\nThe GNSS, or global navigation satellite system, layer provides information about the location, speed and orientation of the vehicle with high absolute accuracy and gathered from differential GNSS in data collection vehicles. This capability is particularly useful in bad weather conditions (rain, fog, snow, etc.) and on roads with limited markings.\nOnce localized to the map, the AI can use the detailed semantic information provided by the map to plan ahead and safely perform driving decisions.\nBest of Both Worlds\u00a0\nDRIVE Map is built with two map engines \u2014 ground truth survey map engine and crowdsourced map engine \u2014 to gather and maintain a collective memory of an Earth-scale fleet.\nThis unique approach combines the best of both worlds, achieving centimeter-level accuracy with dedicated survey vehicles, as well as the freshness and scale that can only be achieved with millions of passenger vehicles continuously updating and expanding the map.\nThe ground truth engine is based on the DeepMap survey map engine \u2014 proven technology that has been developed and verified over the past six years.\nThe AI-based crowdsource engine gathers map updates from millions of cars, constantly uploading new data to the cloud as the vehicles drive. The data is then aggregated and used to update the map, providing the real-world fleet fresh over-the-air map updates.\nDRIVE Map also provides a data interface, DRIVE MapStream, to allow any passenger car that meets the DRIVE Map requirements to continuously update the map using camera, radar and lidar data.\nEarth-Scale Digital Twin\nIn addition to assisting the AI to make the optimal driving decisions, DRIVE Map accelerates AV deployment, from generating ground-truth training data for deep neural network training, as well as for testing and validation.\nThese workflows are centered on Omniverse, where real-world map data is loaded and stored. Omniverse maintains an Earth-scale representation of the digital twin that is continuously updated and expanded by survey map vehicles and millions of passenger vehicles.\nUsing automated content generation tools built on Omniverse, the detailed map is converted into a drivable simulation environment that can be used with NVIDIA DRIVE Sim. Features such as road elevation, road markings, islands, traffic signals, signs and vertical posts are accurately replicated at centimeter-level accuracy.\nWith physically based sensor simulation and domain randomization, AV developers can use the simulated environment to generate training scenarios that aren\u2019t available in real data.\nAV developers can also apply scenario generation tools to test AV software on digital twin environments before deploying AV in the real world. Finally, the digital twin provides fleet operators a complete virtual view of where the vehicles are driving in the world, assisting remote operation when needed.\nAs a highly versatile and scalable platform, DRIVE Map equips the AI driver with the understanding of the world needed to continuously advance autonomous capabilities.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC 2022 | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Some details may be outdated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPhoto by Kampus Production from Pexels\n\nIn mid 2021, Canadian investors gained a significant new way of accessing popular U.S. blue-chip stocks. Canadian depositary receipts (CDRs) resemble the more established American depositary receipts (ADRs).\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are ADRs?\nADRs are a way to gain easy access to global stocks in U.S. dollars trading on U.S. stock exchanges. According to Seeking Alpha, among the 10 most actively traded ADRs are China\u2019s Baidu (Bidu/Nasdaq), the UK\u2019s BP (BP/NYSE), Brazil\u2019s Vale (Vale/NYSE), and Switzerland\u2019s Novartis (NVS/NYSE.) The first ADR was introduced by J.P. Morgan in 1927 for the British retailer Selfridges.\nDividends paid by ADRs are in U.S. dollars. Canadians are of course able to buy ADRs, just as they can buy stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) trading on American stock exchanges. But they\u2019ll have to convert their Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar to do so. And if they plan to retire in Canada, they will have to pay again to repatriate that money.\u00a0\nWhat are CDRs?\nBy contrast, CDRs give Canadian investors a way to buy popular U.S. stocks\u2014particularly the FAANG tech stocks\u2014in Canadian dollars, trading on the Canadian NEO exchange. (FAANG stands for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet, formerly Google.)\nYou can find more information at CIBC, which developed CDRs. As you might expect, the Canadian bank has a positive spin on CDRs, saying it provides the \u201csame stocks, lower risks,\u201d with a \u201cbuilt-in currency hedge,\u201d while offering \u201cfractional ownership, easier diversification.\u201d Its slogan: \u201cOwn the company, not the currency.\u201d\u00a0\nA video by CIBC shows that, while Canadian stocks account for just 3.1% of the world\u2019s stock market capitalization, most Canadians have 59% of their investments in Canadian stocks. To the extent foreign stocks, and especially American ones, have generated stronger returns, arguably Canadians are missing out. It suggests one reason for this is foreign exchange.\u00a0\nWhen CDRs are good for a portfolio\nAccessibility\nCDRs may especially appeal to younger investors with limited wealth. CDRs offer a way of accessing high-priced stocks in lower-priced Canadian dollar versions. For example, a single regular Amazon (AMZN) share currently costs a whopping US$3,200. Compare that with the CDR version AMZN.NE, which costs just $20CAD a share. Generally, the CDR version has the same ticker as the underlying U.S. stock, so be careful when you are buying to specify which version you wish to acquire.\u00a0\nDividends\nIf the U.S. company pays a dividend, so will the CDR. Since most Canadian retirees spend their golden years in Canada, they can diversify beyond Canada\u2019s resource and financial-concentrated market, and still have their assets and dividends in Canadian dollars.\u00a0\nCurrency value and exchange rates\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to worry about currency exchange and just want to hold your portfolio in Canadian dollars, then I believe CDRs are a great option,\u201d wrote Bob Lai in his introductory CDR blog on Tawcan.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision to buy CDRs might revolve around currency hedging for many investors, says Norm Rothery of The Stingy Investor. \u201cThose who think the Canadian dollar will appreciate versus the U.S. dollar\u2014due, say, to a long-term resurgence in oil prices\u2014might prefer the CDR to the original stock. Of course, the reverse could also be true.\u201d\nLow risk\nInvestment coach Aman Raina, of Toronto-based Sage Investors, likes both the accessibility and currency risk management aspects of CDRs.\u00a0\n\u201cBecause they are so new, the missing pieces are how efficiently they behave and correlate to the underlying stock they are tracking and also how effective it is at price discovery, which are no different issues than we face when evaluating ETFs.\u201d\nRaina adds that the Amazon CDR trades 50,000 shares a day, which is only a tiny fraction of the 4.8 million shares a day of the underlying stock. But he wonders how easy it would be to sell the CDR version in a major downturn. \u201cOnly time can answer these questions. For a Canadian investor looking to add blue-chip U.S. stocks, it is one worth exploring, but like anything, look under the CDR hood.\u201d\nFee structure\nUnlike ETFs, CDRs don\u2019t have ongoing management fees, although there are more subtle embedded fees.\u00a0\nThis is from the CIBC site: \u201cThe notional currency hedge includes a spread earned by CIBC which will on average not exceed 0.60% on an annualized basis. In addition, CIBC is entitled to adjust the CDR Ratio to compensate CIBC for actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with non-ordinary Corporate Actions (such as distributions or exchanges of securities upon a merger event or spin-off transaction), but the amount of such costs and expenses will not exceed 0.10% of the aggregate value of the CDRs of the relevant Series.\u201d\nThese \u201cembedded fees might also give some investors pause,\u201d says Rothery. They \u201cmight prove to be a touch high for investors used to low-fee ETFs that offer more diversification and are at the core of many modern portfolios.\u201d\nThe tax implications of CDRs\u00a0\nWhen I first heard about CDRs, I had a faint hope that perhaps they would not be considered foreign content by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). However, that is not the case.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestors with large foreign taxable portfolios will be disappointed to learn that even if these investments are traded in Toronto, CDRs are still considered foreign income. The CRA requires owners of portfolios with more than $100,000 CAD (book value) to complete the T1135 Foreign Income Verification Statement.\u00a0\nElliot Scherer, managing director and head of sales, Wealth Solutions Group, CIBC Capital Markets, confirmed CDRs are considered \u201cspecified foreign property\u201d for purposes of the Canadian specified foreign property reporting rules.\u00a0\n\u201cT1135 reporting in Canada would be required for an investor that is a taxpayer resident in Canada and whose cost of CDRs of all Series, plus any underlying shares of those Series that are held directly, plus the cost of any other specified foreign property, exceeds $100,000.\u201d See also CIBC\u2019s CDR resources page.\u00a0\nIn that regard, CDRs do not achieve what Canadian ETFs with foreign holdings \u2014\u00a0 trading on the TSX or NEO \u2014\u00a0 facilitate, which \u201ccount\u201d as merely Canadian content for tax purposes.\u00a0\nJamie Golombek, CIBC Wealth\u2019s tax expert and Financial Post columnist, says CDRs have a structure that differs from ETFs and mutual funds that are Canadian trusts that happen to hold U.S. or global equities. A Canadian mutual fund trust or ETF means the investor owns Canadian property, Golombek said via email. \u201cThe CDRs are entirely different: The best way to think of it is a fractional ownership in the underlying U.S. stock itself.\u201d\nPopular CDRs\nThe most popular CDRs are the big tech names like AMZN, TSLA and GOOG, says Scherer. \u201cWe have also seen a lot of interest in AAPL, MSFT, PYPL and VISA, especially when there is earnings or corporate news on a specific stock.\u201d\nThus far only U.S. stocks are available as CDRs, says Lai, but it would be nice to expand to non North American stocks like South Korea\u2019s Samsung.\u00a0\nAnd Scherer adds: \u201cWe are certainly considering a number of areas to grow the platform, including adding international names. That said, our first priority is to grow the number of CDRs on U.S. names to meet the demand we\u2019re seeing from our clients.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonally\u2026\nSince I am approaching the $100,000 foreign content limit in taxable portfolios, and prefer to avoid the paperwork involved in passing that threshold, I\u2019ll hold CDRs either in my registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs) or my tax-free savings accounts (TFSAs).\u00a0\nIdeally, dividend payers should go in an RRSP. I did just that with the Pfizer CDR. Non-dividend payers, like Berkshire Hathaway, could go nicely in a TFSA.\u00a0\nThe only other CDR I have purchased is Meta Platforms, after it famously fell 25% in early February 2022.\u00a0\nSince my family already owned most of the original U.S. versions of the FAANG stocks, we\u2019ll hold off until the Ukraine volatility clears. Most tech stocks have been correcting since late 2021.\u00a0\nAt some point, of course, they may come down to the point where they are tempting, either in their native U.S. form or in the CDR version.\nMoneySense Investing Editor at Large Jonathan Chevreau is also the founder of Financial Independence Hub, author of Findependence Day and co-author of Victory Lap Retirement.

Will certainly, consider adding to our own investments.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Chip Clermont says: \n\nJune 6, 2022 at 9:43 am \n\n\nWhat happens to my Amazon cdr with the 20 to 1 split?\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Jeff Holicky says: \n\nJune 13, 2022 at 11:32 am \n\n\n@Chip\nFirst, a SPLIT does not generate any value \u2013 it merely adjusts the share price and quantity of shares. 1 share at $2000, now becomes 20 shares at $100. This is the most important concept of a SPLIT or CONSOLIDATION.\nSecond, what CIBC did was adjust the internal ratio. if you go to \u201ccdr.cibc.com\u201d -> CDR Directory -> Click on AMZN right down arrow, then -> See Corporate Actions you can read about this. The result of this likewise does not create value but it does result in a MORE AMPLIFIED move going forward for every dollar the AMZN Nasdaq share moves.\nPer their site too:\n\u201cCDR holders will experience the same economic impact of a share split or consolidation as they would if the underlying shares were held directly. If a split of the underlying shares occurs, either the CDR Ratio will be adjusted to account for the increase in the number of underlying shares or the CDRs will be split so that CDR holders will automatically receive additional CDRs. For example, if there is a two-for-one stock split of the underlying shares, then either there will be a corresponding two-for-one split of that class of CDRs or, alternatively, the CDR Ratio will double. If a consolidation of the underlying shares occurs, the CDR Ratio will be reduced to account for the decrease in the number of underlying shares.\u201d\nThe benefit to split AMZN is so that non-institutional investors can now purchase shares at a more affordable price than $2000 per share. One can do that only via a broker that offers FRACTIONAL transactions such as WealthSimple. I wished TD Investing too offered this as I may choose to buy the underlying security and unhedged. \nThe NEO stocks are already priced to be fractions (hence the ratio) inherently so there is no need to modify the underlying shares or price. They have to do something though and that involved the ratio. Future increases in AMZN will result in greater moves of the CDR \u2013 at some point it may well trade in the north of $50/share and they will chose to do an actual split to bring it back down to the more affordable $12-20 range for investors.\nWarren Buffett didn\u2019t see value in splits (admin costs) and so never did them but then created a new class (BRK/B) to help investors afford Berkshire and NEO has brought entry even cheaper and hedged for investors. If brokers offered fractional trading then a split/consolidation would no longer be required but the mechanics of fractional shares prevents industry wide adoption IMO. WealthSimple AFAIK needs to themselves own the fractions [rounded up to 1] not owned by investors. Not mind blowing numbers but it changes the nature of the business.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Mike h says: \n\nNovember 9, 2022 at 3:50 am \n\n\ndo these vehicles fall under identical property rules for capital loss selling ?\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n MoneySense Editors says: \n\nNovember 10, 2022 at 2:02 pm \n\n\nDue to the large volume of comments we receive, we regret that we are unable to respond directly to each one.

If we are adjusting CDR ratio daily then that actually means that we are adjusting the share fraction as per daily currency fluctuations. Is CDR Hedge some sort of gimmick or am I missing something?\n\nReply \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJacks on Tax\n\nWorried about tariffs and their effects?

(PHOTO: Getty Creative)  \u00b7 DuKai photographer via Getty Images By Ambereen Choudhury and Manuel Baigorri (Bloomberg) \u2014 Societe Generale SA is temporarily relocating at least a dozen traders from Hong Kong to Singapore as the Chinese territory\u2019s stringent Covid strategy spurs Wall Street and European firms to move some staff out of Asia\u2019s largest financial hub. The traders, who work across fixed income and equity derivatives, will be based in the city-state for at least eight weeks, according to people with knowledge of the situation. The moves will begin in April and it\u2019s unclear whether the individuals will eventually stay longer, said one of the people, who declined to be identified as the details are private.  SocGen joins other international firms that are moving employees out of Hong Kong, either for short stretches or permanently. Expatriate staff are driving a number of the moves, worn down by rules that have isolated the city from the world and them from their families. Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have also seen bankers move out of Hong Kong. Firms are reluctant to publicise the departures for fear of angering Beijing. The French lender declined to comment. Conversations are also ongoing with staff keen to temporarily work from the Chinese mainland and Australia so they can see family, one of the people said. Hong Kong\u2019s business groups have sounded warnings that the city is facing an exodus of foreign talent as its dogged approach to keeping infections at bay makes it hard to operate. The city\u2019s government has only recently started to shift away from its tough Covid-zero stance after being overwhelmed by the rapid spread of the omicron variant. Hong Kong\u2019s severe restrictions on travel have contrasted with easing in a growing number of Asian countries such as Singapore, which is taking steps to allow vaccinated travelers to enter freely. Singapore also recently lifted a requirement to wear masks outdoors. In Hong Kong, it\u2019s mandatory to wear a mask, even when doing exercise. Violators face a fine of HK$5,000 (US$640). \u2014With assistance from Alexandre Rajbhandari. \u00a9 2022 Bloomberg L.P.

This technique involves feeding information about a real-world function into a virtual representation of the activity and then using insights gleaned from the data to improve the process.\nThe laboratory will be equipped with a variety of software and equipment supplied by Nvidia to collect information about operations at Kroger's almost 2,800 supermarkets across the country.\nThe combination of digital twin simulations and artificial intelligence will form the foundation of an effort by Kroger to better serve shoppers, Wesley Rhodes, vice president of technology transformation and research and development for Kroger, said in the announcement.\n\u201cWe look forward to learning more about how AI and data analytics will further our journey to provide our customers with anything, anytime, anywhere,\u201d Rhodes said in a statement. The grocer is aligning the partnership with Nvidia with its \"Fresh for Everyone\" branding effort, which Kroger kicked off in 2019 to highlight its efforts to supply shoppers with fresh and affordable food, Rhodes added.\nDuring a recent business update, Kroger executives said the company has used technology to increase shelf life for the fresh food it sells, which helps secure shopper loyalty as it ramps up e-commerce, digital ad sales and more.\u00a0\nKroger will also work with Nvidia to use dynamic routing to improve its last-mile delivery operations \"to ensure freshness from farm to plate,\" according to the press release. In addition, the companies indicated they will look for ways to identify when food is beginning to lose freshness as early as possible by deploying computer vision and analytics.\nThe partnership with Nvidia follows Kroger's efforts to work with Google to improve its pickup operations through the internet giant's Maps app. That arrangement, which began last summer at 96 stores in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana, expanded to more than 2,000 locations in 32 states by November.\nAlbertsons is also working with Google\u00a0to step up its ability to interact with customers online. Google described the partnership, announced in early 2021, as an effort to use artificial intelligence to make ordering easier for grocery customers, enable predictive shopping carts and produce other benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npurchase licensing rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled Under:\nTechnology, \nCorporate Operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrocery Dive news delivered to your inbox\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect user consent:\n\n\n\n\n    By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our\n    Terms of Use and\n    Privacy Policy.

This new acronym, a riff on the Nasdaq Composite\u2019s top-performing FAANG tech stocks, is generating interest. So what are the MANGO stocks and what else do you need to know?\nSource: Shutterstock\nLike the fruit, MANGO stocks have provided sweet returns for investors recently. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya suggests this group of chip stocks \u2014 Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL),\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI), Nvidia\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS) and ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) \u2014 could be leaders in the future economy. Notably, this analyst believes that these chip stocks can outperform despite various market concerns right now.\nFinding a group of stocks that is able to weather this current environment is what many investors are after. Indeed, there is an impressive amount of uncertainty weighing on Wall Street right now. Investors are concerned with inflation, interest rate hikes, geopolitical tensions and supply chain bottlenecks.\nThe semiconductor sector is exposed to these issues. However, there are reasons why analysts are growing increasingly bullish on these stocks.\nLet\u2019s dive into what investors may want to consider with chip stocks right now.\n\nWhy MANGO Stocks Could Outperform\nDespite the impacts of the pandemic and supply chain woes on chip makers, the Bank of America analyst believes there is reason to be bullish on MANGO stocks. This is because demand has been increasing for chips for some time, and the underlying technology is improving. Assuming these tailwinds remain in place, MANGO stocks could be key winners.\nAdditionally, Arya sees a few other things to like about chip stocks. Many of the names in the MANGO acronym have ties to the cloud and artificial intelligence. Others are in the electric vehicle space.\nMost investors can wrap their heads around this rather easy-to-understand thesis. While semiconductor stocks have struggled this year, the for this sector remain bright. Thus, MANGO stocks are the new tech grouping investors may want to keep on their radar right now.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2022/03/what-are-mango-stocks/.\n\u00a92025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Headlines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMore from InvestorPlace\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHot Stocks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Top Stocks to Buy Under Trump Come From Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018BRAIN\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Luke Lango, InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Danger that Could Derail Our Economy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Jeff Remsburg, Contributing Editor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Prediction Came True: Where to Find Opportunity Despite Market Unpredictability\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Eric Fry, Editor, Fry's Investment Report\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTop Stories\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFeb 8, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWolfpack Research Short Report Sends B.

So, Nvidia isn't as close to the trillion-dollar market cap milestone as it was three months ago. But can the tech giant regain its mojo and become a trillion-dollar company by 2025? Let's find out.\n\nNVDA Market Cap data by YCharts.\nNvidia's growth isn't slowing down\nNvidia stock may have taken a beating over the past three months, but the company's fiscal 2022 results that were released\u00a0on Feb. 16 make it clear that its growth isn't slowing down. The company finished the fiscal year with $26.9 billion in revenue, an increase of 61% over the prior year. Its adjusted net income shot up 79% to $11.2 billion, or $4.44 per share.\n\nNvidia grew at a faster pace in fiscal 2022 as compared to the 53% revenue growth it had reported\u00a0in fiscal 2021. Its bottom-line growth also accelerated last year as compared to fiscal 2021's growth of 75%. It is worth noting that Nvidia's top line has increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32% over the past three fiscal years. Its adjusted net income has increased at a CAGR of nearly 40% over the same period.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 suggests that the company won't be taking its foot off the gas. It has guided\u00a0for $8.1 billion in revenue for the ongoing quarter, an increase of 43% over the prior year. The chipmaker's full-year revenue is expected to increase 29%, as per analysts' estimates, while earnings are expected to jump 26%.\nHowever, Nvidia's first-quarter guidance indicates that it could clock a much faster pace of growth this year and beyond.\nThe high pace of growth is here to stay\nThe gaming business is the biggest reason why Nvidia seems built for solid growth. The gaming business produced\u00a0a record $12.4 billion in revenue last fiscal year and recorded 61% year-over-year growth. Nvidia's dominant share of the discrete GPU (graphics processing unit) market is the key reason behind this terrific growth.\nAccording\u00a0to Jon Peddie Research, Nvidia held 77% of the discrete GPU market in the fourth quarter of 2021. Nvidia's discrete GPU shipments increased 27.7% year over year during the quarter thanks to its robust market share. What's more, Nvidia is enjoying a stronger average selling price that's reportedly 15% higher than the prior-generation Turing cards and up to 80% higher than the Pascal generation cards that were launched in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWith only 15% of the installed base using Nvidia's latest generation Ampere cards, as per analyst estimates, there is a lot of room for growth in the company's gaming revenue. It is also worth noting that sales of discrete GPUs are expected to jump to $54 billion\u00a0by 2025 as compared to $23.6 billion in 2020, paving the way for substantial incremental growth at Nvidia thanks to its strong market share in this space.\nThe data center business is another key catalyst for Nvidia. The company's data center revenue was\u00a0up 58% in fiscal 2022 to a record $10.6 billion, accounting for 39% of its total revenue. Just like the gaming business, data centers also present a secular growth opportunity for Nvidia. That's because the usage of GPUs in data centers is increasing at a rapid pace thanks to their ability to tackle\u00a0heavy workloads related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and high-performance computing.\nThe chipmaker will also expand\u00a0its wings in the data center space with the launch of a new CPU (central processing unit) next year. This will strengthen the company's position in the global data center accelerator market that's estimated\u00a0to clock an annual growth rate of 25% through 2028 and exceed $25 billion in revenue.\nWill it hit a trillion-dollar market cap in three years?\nThe impressive growth drivers discussed above indicate why analysts expect Nvidia's earnings to grow at an annual rate\u00a0of 30% over the next five years. Assuming this rate of earnings growth for the next three fiscal years, Nvidia's earnings at the end of fiscal 2025 would increase to\u00a0$9.75 per share.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia stock has a five-year average forward earnings multiple of 40. Assuming a similar multiple after three years would lead to a stock price of $390, which would translate into an 81% upside from current levels. Nvidia now has a market cap of $530 billion, and an 81% appreciation over that would lead to a market cap of nearly $960 billion.\nSo, Nvidia stock could get close to a $1 trillion market cap by 2025 because of the solid catalysts discussed above, making it an ideal bet for investors looking to buy a growth stock following its recent pullback.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

It could potentially take two years before Olam is able to effectively launch the initial public offering (IPO) and demerger of its operating unit Olam Agri Holdings, its co-founder and group CEO Sunny Verghese said in a briefing today.  This follows an earlier announcement that Saudi Agriculture and Livestock Investment Company is acquiring an estimated 35.4% substantial minority stake in Olam Agri for US$1.24 billion. \u201cWe will have to wait for some time because the deal will only be completed before the end of the year. The new shareholders will have to join us, understand the business and feel comfortable with it before we can effectively launch the IPO,\u201d said Verghese. He clarified that the company does not expect any special dividend to be paid out as a result of the transaction. The entire proceeds will go towards repaying the company\u2019s debt at the group level and will not impact either Olam Agri or Olam Food Ingredients (OFI). Separately, Olam is working on exiting deprioritised assets under Olam Global Holdings as well as forming strategic partnerships for its gestating businesses. The company is also identifying the right strategic partners that will allow it to take both Olam Ventures and Olam Technology and Business Services to its full potential.  \u201cIt is very difficult to say the timing on when each of these will be completed. But we would think that in the next two years, much of these plans would be fully executed in all these different component steps,\u201d said Verghese. On March 24, Olam announced that it is postponing the planned separate listing of OFI on the London Stock Exchange, given market conditions negatively hit by the war in Ukraine. The IPO was slated to take place during 2Q202, with a concurrent secondary listing in Singapore. As the OFI IPO will be fairly substantial, the company would like to do it at the \u201cright time\u201d, said Verghese. \u201cWe are fully prepared and ready to pursue the IPO [at] the first available opportunity based on prevailing market conditions,\u201d said Verghese. As at 1.17pm, shares in Olam are trading 9 cents higher or 5.08% up at $1.86.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Keppel Corp, Keppel Asia Infrastructure fund (KAIF) and a co-investor of the fund are acquiring 50% of the interest in Cleantech Solar Asia (CSA) from CEF 200 BV, a fund managed by Climate Fund Managers, for US$115 million.  The acquisition will be made through Cloud Alpha and is expected to close in the first half of 2022. CSA\u2019s remaining 50% stake is owned by Cleantech Renewable Assets. The consortium previously announced that they were acquiring a 51% stake in Cleantech on December 13, 2021 at a consideration price of US$130 million. Post-transaction, the consortium\u2019s collective stake in CSA would be 75.5% from 25.5%. The consideration for the CSA acquisition was reached at a \u201cwilling-buyer and willing-seller basis\u201d, taking into account the strategic merits, development pipeline and platform value of CSA as well as synergy with the Cleantech transaction and prevailing market conditions. The book value and net asset value represented by the CSA shares as at June 31, 2021 was US$58.7 million. Keppel Corp will satisfy its share of the Consideration at US$69 million in cash using internal resources, the company said in a stock exchange filing. The transaction is not expected to have any material impact on the earnings per share and net tangible asset per share of Keppel Corp for its FY22 ending Dec 31.  Cleantech is a solar energy platform focused on the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment. It has a strong development pipeline and is targeting to grow its asset portfolio to more than 2.5 GW by 2026, the company said. CSA is the asset company under Cleantech and currently has a total capacity of over 600 megawatts across various stages of operations, construction and development. Its assets are located across India, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Singapore and Vietnam. Keppel Corp CEO Loh Chin Hua said the increased stake in Cleantech\u2019s solar asset portfolio is a testament to its commitment in growing its renewables business as part of Vision 2030. \u201cIncreasing our additional stake in Cleantech\u2019s solar assets, through the acquisition of our stake in CSA, will also increase the Keppel Group\u2019s exposure to Cleantech\u2019s growing solar business and in turn strengthen the ability to create collaboration and synergy opportunities with the rest of the Keppel Group,\u201d KAIF is managed by a private fund manager under Keppel Capital. Launched in January 2020, the KAIF partnership and its co-investment vehicles have aggregate commitments of around US$1 billion from global institutional investors.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

(PHOTO: REUTERS/Caroline Chia)  \u00b7 Caroline Chia / reuters (Bloomberg) \u2014 Grab Holdings Inc.\u2019s stock plummeted 37% on Thursday after the company reported wider losses in the fourth quarter, pushing to US$22 billion the decline in its market value since it went public through a merger with a blank-cheque firm in December. Southeast Asia\u2019s ride-hailing and delivery giant has plunged 63% since its debut, placing it among the Nasdaq Composite Index\u2019s worst performers over that stretch. Thursday\u2019s drop marked its biggest selloff ever after the Singapore-based company\u2019s quarterly net loss nearly doubled from last year while revenue shrank 44%. The tumble came as 116 million shares changed hands, more than four-times the average over the past month.  Grab \u2014 which counts SoftBank Group Corp. and Uber Technologies Inc. as its two biggest shareholders \u2014 has struggled to gain a steady footing since its merger with Brad Gerstner\u2019s Altimeter Growth Corp. late last year. The ride-hailing company has racked up losses since its founding and Thursday\u2019s report showed spending on growth is taking it further from profitability. Its net loss reached US$1.06 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with the consensus estimate of US$645 million. Those mounting losses have led investors to flee the stock alongside other companies that have yet to turn a profit. Grab was the worst performer in the De-SPAC Index on Thursday as the basket of former special-purpose acquisition companies dropped 5.4% to a record low. As the pandemic has weighed on ride-hailing demand, Grab has expanded its food delivery business to drive user growth. The online grocery market in Southeast Asia is expected to almost triple to US$11.9 billion in 2025 from US$4.1 billion in 2020, according to Euromonitor International.  But while spending by customers on Grab\u2019s platform is increasing, the growth isn\u2019t yet translating to earnings. Revenue booked from delivery last quarter was just US$1 million. Grab deducts incentives that it offers to drivers and consumers from sales, and its quarterly revenue number fluctuates wildly depending on how much it spends on such efforts. Its total spending on incentives more than doubled to US$583.5 million in the fourth quarter. For 2021 as a whole, incentive spending soared to US$1.78 billion from US$1.24 billion the previous year. \u201cWe did not expect Grab to spend on such huge incentives,\u201d Shifara Samsudeen, an analyst at LightStream Research, said in a research report on Smartkarma. This implies the company is \u201cstruggling to grow its business and profitability seems like a tall order from Grab.\u201d   Story continues Grab, founded by Anthony Tan and Hooi Ling Tan, has long been viewed as one of the most promising growth companies in Southeast Asia. Its business model is similar to that of Uber, the U.S. ride-hailing and delivery pioneer that sold its Southeast Asia operations to Grab in 2018.Among Grab\u2019s challenges is intensifying competition, including from Sea Ltd., Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest internet company. More directly, its Indonesian ride-hailing rival, Gojek, merged with e-commerce provider PT Tokopedia to become GoTo. The combined entity is preparing for an initial public offering at home and in the U.S. this year.(Updates with details on Grab\u2019s spending starting in third paragraph)\u00a9 2022 Bloomberg L.P.

And this is likely to rise in the future. If the stock market averages 9% annualized returns between now and 2035, that implies that the 10 largest companies will have market caps of about $1.7 trillion or greater, and some will likely be several times larger than this threshold. With that in mind, here are 10 companies (in no particular order) that I think have an excellent shot of being on the list when 2035 arrives.\nThe 10 largest stocks by 2035?\n\n Apple (AAPL -0.72%)\n\nThis shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. With a market cap of about $2.7 trillion today, Apple would likely be firmly in the top 10 in 2035 even if it doesn't appreciate in value at all. But with an extremely loyal customer base, tremendous pricing power, and the ability to generate over $100 billion in free cash flow annually, I wouldn't be shocked to see Apple become the first $5 trillion company, and well before 2035.\n\n\n Amazon (AMZN -1.22%)\n\nWith a market cap of about $1.63 trillion, Amazon is one of the largest companies today, but don't make the mistake of thinking it has maxed out its potential. After all, e-commerce is still less than 15% of total U.S. retail sales, its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has a rapidly growing addressable market, and there are several other areas Amazon could expand into over the next decade or so.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n\n MercadoLibre (MELI -4.36%)\n\nMercadoLibre often gets referred to as the Amazon of Latin America, but it is so much more than that. It's like the Amazon, Block (XYZ 1.98%), eBay (EBAY -3.37%), and maybe even the Shopify (SHOP -2.66%) of Latin America, all in one stock, and at much earlier stages of their respective growth cycles. With a $57 billion market cap, MercadoLibre is one of the smaller companies on this list, but it definitely has trillion-dollar potential if it can realize its true potential.\n\n\n PayPal (PYPL -0.59%)\n\nPayPal's stock has been beaten down recently, and to be fair, its customer base isn't growing as fast as investors had been expecting. However, this is still the dominant leader in payment processing, especially for e-commerce, with over 400 million active users and operations all over the world. There are still some unanswered questions regarding future growth strategy and the ability to effectively monetize all of its users, but there's trillion-dollar potential here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Alphabet (GOOG -2.33%) (GOOGL -2.28%)\n\nAlphabet is best known for its Google platform, which has a dominant share of the internet search market. With a $1.8 trillion market cap, and several other businesses that could end up being needle-movers, Alphabet is likely to still be one of the 10 largest companies in the market by 2035.\n\n Block (Square)\n\nBlock, formerly known as Square, has evolved from a niche payment processing hardware company into a full-featured financial ecosystem in its first 13 years of existence. And with the company just scratching the surface of its long-term opportunities, it will be fun to watch the next 13 years of Block's evolution. If it can be half as innovative as it has been so far, it could certainly earn a spot in the top 10.\n\n\n Shopify \n\nAs mentioned in the context of Amazon, fewer than 15% of retail sales take place by e-commerce. And this is in the U.S. -- in many international markets, e-commerce penetration is even lower. Shopify has grown into a leader in enabling e-commerce for businesses of all sizes, and it could multiply its business many times over as the industry continues to evolve.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT -1.36%)\n\nMicrosoft isn't going to deliver jaw-dropping returns between now and 2035, but it doesn't need to. With a $2.24 trillion market cap and a largely predictable and growing revenue stream, it's difficult to imagine a world where Microsoft wasn't near the top of the list for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirbnb (ABNB -1.87%)\n\nIt's tough to imagine a \"lodging stock\" with a trillion-dollar market value, but it wouldn't be shocking to see Airbnb achieve it. The company's addressable market is literally every short-term and long-term rental property in the world, as well as every adjacent experience that can be booked through the platform. Airbnb estimates that the current opportunity is roughly $4 trillion in annual bookings, and if Airbnb can grow into a dominant force, it could reach the top 10 list.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.03%) (BRK.B 0.07%)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is designed to produce returns that are consistently market-beating, and with a nearly 60-year track record of doing just that, there's no reason to believe this will change. And this is even true if Warren Buffett is no longer at the helm. Buffett would turn 105 years old in 2035, so it's unlikely he'll still be calling the shots at Berkshire, but this is a long-term compounding machine that should keep doing what it's designed to do.\nThere are many others that could end up on the list\nAs I mentioned, nobody can predict the future, and I certainly am not an exception. And it's important to mention that this isn't an exhaustive list of stocks that have multitrillion-dollar market cap potential between now and 2035. Just to name a few examples, chipmaker NVIDIA (NVDA -2.65%) was No. 11 on my list, and there are several companies in the payments industry, especially Visa (V -0.09%), Mastercard (MA -0.35%), and Adyen (ADYE.Y -0.15%), that could certainly grow to several times their current size.\nThe electric vehicle space remains a massive opportunity. Tesla (TSLA -4.86%) could certainly land in the top 10 if it ends up dominating the industry, and General Motors (GM -1.08%) is an example of a company that has lots of potential in both electric and autonomous vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\nI know I missed some other high-potential companies here, including some that are currently on the top 10 list by market cap. But the point is that I could go on and on with companies that could be the next trillion-dollar businesses. But the 10 in this list are those I feel have the best chance to end up on top.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The world's largest and most powerful accelerator, the H100 has groundbreaking features such as a revolutionary Transformer Engine and a highly scalable NVIDIA NVLink\u00ae interconnect for advancing gigantic AI language models, deep recommender systems, genomics and complex digital twins.\n\"Data centers are becoming AI factories -- processing and refining mountains of data to produce intelligence,\" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \"NVIDIA H100 is the engine of the world's AI infrastructure that enterprises use to accelerate their AI-driven businesses.\"\nH100 Technology Breakthroughs\r\nThe NVIDIA H100 GPU sets a new standard in accelerating large-scale AI and HPC, delivering six breakthrough innovations:\n\nWorld's Most Advanced Chip\u00a0-- Built with 80 billion transistors using a cutting-edge TSMC 4N process designed for NVIDIA's accelerated compute needs, H100 features major advances to accelerate AI, HPC, memory bandwidth, interconnect and communication, including nearly 5 terabytes per second of external connectivity. H100 is the first GPU to support PCIe Gen5 and the first to utilize HBM3, enabling 3TB/s of memory bandwidth. Twenty H100 GPUs can sustain the equivalent of the entire world's internet traffic, making it possible for customers to deliver advanced recommender systems and large language models running inference on data in real time.\nNew Transformer Engine\u00a0-- Now the standard model choice for natural language processing, the Transformer is one of the most important deep learning models ever invented. The H100 accelerator's Transformer Engine is built to speed up these networks as much as 6x versus the previous generation without losing accuracy.\n2nd-Generation Secure Multi-Instance GPU\u00a0-- MIG technology allows a single GPU to be partitioned into seven smaller, fully isolated instances to handle different types of jobs. The Hopper architecture extends MIG capabilities by up to 7x over the previous generation by offering secure multitenant configurations in cloud environments across each GPU instance.\nConfidential Computing\u00a0-- H100 is the world's first accelerator with confidential computing capabilities to protect AI models and customer data while they are being processed. Customers can also apply confidential computing to\u00a0federated learning\u00a0for privacy-sensitive industries like healthcare and financial services, as well as on shared cloud infrastructures.\n4th-Generation NVIDIA NVLink\u00a0-- To accelerate the largest AI models, NVLink combines with a new external NVLink Switch to extend NVLink as a scale-up network beyond the server, connecting up to 256 H100 GPUs at 9x higher bandwidth versus the previous generation using NVIDIA HDR Quantum InfiniBand.\nDPX Instructions\u00a0-- New DPX instructions accelerate dynamic programming -- used in a broad range of algorithms, including route optimization and genomics -- by up to 40x compared with CPUs and up to 7x compared with previous-generation GPUs. This includes the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find optimal routes for autonomous robot fleets in dynamic warehouse environments, and the Smith-Waterman algorithm used in sequence alignment for DNA and protein classification and folding.\n\nThe combined technology innovations of H100 extend NVIDIA's AI inference and training leadership to enable real-time and immersive applications using giant-scale AI models. The H100 will enable chatbots using the world's most powerful monolithic transformer language model,\u00a0Megatron 530B, with up to 30x higher throughput than the previous generation, while meeting the subsecond latency required for real-time conversational AI. H100 also allows researchers and developers to train massive models such as Mixture of Experts, with 395 billion parameters, up to 9x faster, reducing the training time from weeks to days.\nBroad NVIDIA H100 Adoption\r\nNVIDIA H100 can be deployed in every type of data center, including on-premises, cloud, hybrid-cloud and edge. It is expected to be available worldwide later this year from the world's leading cloud service providers and computer makers, as well as directly from NVIDIA.\nNVIDIA's fourth-generation DGX\u2122 system,\u00a0DGX H100, features eight H100 GPUs to deliver 32 petaflops of AI performance at new FP8 precision, providing the scale to meet the massive compute requirements of large language models, recommender systems, healthcare research and climate science.\nEvery GPU in DGX H100 systems is connected by fourth-generation NVLink, providing 900GB/s connectivity, 1.5x more than the prior generation. NVSwitch\u2122 enables all eight of the H100 GPUs to connect over NVLink. An external NVLink Switch can network up to 32 DGX H100 nodes in the next-generation NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD\u2122 supercomputers.\nHopper has received broad industry support from leading cloud service providers Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu AI Cloud, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure,\u00a0Oracle Cloud\u00a0and Tencent Cloud, which plan to offer H100-based instances.\nA wide range of servers with H100 accelerators are expected from the world's leading systems manufacturers, including Atos, BOXX Technologies, Cisco,\u00a0Dell Technologies, Fujitsu,\u00a0GIGABYTE, H3C,\u00a0Hewlett Packard Enterprise,\u00a0Inspur, Lenovo, Nettrix and\u00a0Supermicro.\nNVIDIA H100 at Every Scale\r\nH100 will come in SXM and PCIe form factors to support a wide range of server design requirements. A converged accelerator will also be available, pairing an H100 GPU with an NVIDIA ConnectX\u00ae-7 400Gb/s\u00a0InfiniBand\u00a0and\u00a0Ethernet\u00a0SmartNIC.\nNVIDIA's H100 SXM will be available in HGX\u2122 H100 server boards with four- and eight-way configurations for enterprises with applications scaling to multiple GPUs in a server and across multiple servers. HGX H100-based servers deliver the highest application performance for AI training and inference along with data analytics and HPC applications.\nThe H100 PCIe, with NVLink to connect two GPUs, provides more than 7x the bandwidth of PCIe 5.0, delivering outstanding performance for applications running on mainstream enterprise servers. Its form factor makes it easy to integrate into existing data center infrastructure.\nThe\u00a0H100 CNX, a new converged accelerator, couples an H100 with a ConnectX-7 SmartNIC to provide groundbreaking performance for I/O-intensive applications such as multinode AI training in enterprise data centers and 5G signal processing at the edge.\nNVIDIA Hopper architecture-based GPUs can also be paired with\u00a0NVIDIA Grace\u2122 CPUs\u00a0with an ultra-fast\u00a0NVLink-C2C interconnect\u00a0for over 7x faster communication between the CPU and GPU compared to PCIe 5.0.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., March 22, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC\u2014NVIDIA today unveiled more than 60 updates to its CUDA-X\u2122 collection of libraries, tools and technologies across a broad range of disciplines, which dramatically improve performance of the CUDA\u00ae software computing platform. Dozens of updates are immediately available, reinforcing CUDA\u2019s position as the industry\u2019s most comprehensive platform for developers to build accelerated applications to address challenges across high performance computing fields such as research in 6G, quantum computing, genomics, drug discovery and logistics optimization, as well as advanced work in robotics, cybersecurity, data analytics and more.  The CUDA platform has been downloaded more than 33 million times since its introduction in 2008, with 8 million downloads in 2021 alone, up 3x in three years. \u201cInnovation in AI and accelerated computing is driving major scientific breakthroughs and the creation of new applications and services in virtually every industry,\u201d said Greg Estes, vice president of Developer Programs at NVIDIA. \u201cWith these updates, NVIDIA is making it easier than ever for researchers and developers to take advantage of the power of CUDA and get the highest performance from our platforms.\u201d Built on top of CUDA, NVIDIA\u2019s platforms for AI, HPC and graphics include software development kits and tools that are at the heart of enabling higher performance and accelerated algorithms across multiple application domains. The SDKs make it easy for developers, researchers and data scientists to tap into the power of NVIDIA\u2019s advanced platform, tackling the immense complexity at the intersection of computing, algorithms and science.  These updates make the NVIDIA systems that developers already use across science, AI and data processing even faster. Highlights include: cuQuantum, for accelerating quantum circuit simulation, is now in general availability and, for the first time, available in the cuQuantum DGX Appliance, which provides HPC researchers a full quantum simulation stack optimized for deployment on the NVIDIA DGX\u2122 platform. A key element in a rapidly expanding ecosystem, cuQuantum is now integrated as a backend in popular simulators from Google Quantum AI, Xanadu and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. It is also now being offered as a part of quantum application development platforms from Classiq and Zapata Computing, and is being used by QC Ware, Xanadu and others to power quantum research at scale in areas from chemistry to climate modeling. Sionna\u2122, for 6G physical-layer research, is a new, GPU-accelerated, open-source library, with native support for the integration of neural networks and machine learning. Sionna enables rapid prototyping of complex communication system architectures and adds to NVIDIA\u2019s investment in the wireless domain, which includes Aerial, a unified software-defined platform for delivering AI-on-5G.\u201cSionna will transform the way AI/ML-based communication systems are developed in the future,\u201d said Christoph Studer, professor in the Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at ETH Z\u00fcrich. \u201cEven better, it runs incredibly fast on our NVIDIA DGX Station.\u201d  RAPIDS\u2122, data science libraries to accelerate drug discovery, social connections, fraud detection and more, is one of NVIDIA\u2019s most popular SDKs with 2 million downloads and leveraged in over 5,000 projects on GitHub. The RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark speeds processing by over 3x with no code changes. With 80 percent of the Fortune 500 using Apache Spark in production, data engineers can transparently accelerate Spark dataframe and SQL operations. cuOpt, formerly ReOpt, for logistics optimization research focused on vehicle routing, enables users to route thousands of packages to thousands of locations in \u200bmere seconds with record accuracy \u2014 enabling real-time rerouting and saving potentially billions in delivery costs each year. Morpheus, for cybersecurity applications, makes it possible to analyze up to 100 percent of one\u2019s data in real time, for more accurate detection and faster remediation of threats as they occur. F5 achieved 200x performance improvements to its malware detection model, going from 1,013 messages per second to 208,333 messages per second, with just 136 lines of code. DGL container, for training graph neural networks, adds algorithm improvements delivering 4x faster end-to-end ETL and training workflows than CPUs in areas such as drug discovery and fraud detection. Nsight\u2122 Systems, for system-wide visualization of an application\u2019s performance, allows developers to see how GPU-accelerated libraries use system resources, interact with the application and identify optimization opportunities to reduce bottlenecks.    Story Continues Among other libraries being updated are MONAI, for medical imaging; NVIDIA FLARE\u2122, for federated learning, with nearly 300,000 downloads; Maxine, for reinventing communications; Riva, for speech AI; Merlin, for recommender systems; and Isaac\u2122, for robotics.Join the 3 million developers already enjoying benefits, such as access to training courses and materials through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, technical talks and tools, by registering for the NVIDIA Developer program.To learn more about CUDA-X libraries, watch the GTC 2022 keynote from NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang.

Scott RaynovichFollowShareSaveInnovationCloudNetworking Could Be NVIDIA\u2019s Next Big GameByR. Scott Raynovich, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. R. Scott Raynovich is the Founder and Chief Analyst at Futuriom.comFollow AuthorMar 28, 2022, 05:26pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 2 years old.Ever since NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang took the company from the relatively obscure graphics processing market to being a major player in cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence (AI), he\u2019s been justly acknowledged as a genius. And at last week\u2019s GTC conference, Huang flaunted his engineering savvy, unveiling a plan for full cloud domination.\n\n\u201cComputer science is being reinvented as we speak,\u201d said Huang on a Q&A with industry analysts. \u201cThe way you write software is being fundamentally changed by AI and ML [machine learning]. Datacenters are becoming AI factories with exponentially more data and intelligence.\u201d\n\n\nAt GTC, NVIDIA announced an impressive new lineup of chips, software, and networking products designed to expand its mission as the go-to supplier for cloud infrastructure.. This included NVIDIA\u2019s presentation to investors, which plotted a total addressable market (TAM) of $1 trillion with software and hardware products in markets such as AI, enterprise automation, and autonomous vehicles (see chart below).\nNVIDIA sees new market opportunities totaling up to $1 trillion. NVIDIA\n\nWhile ambitions for $300 billion in new TAM for automotive technologies, $150 billion in TAM for its AI software, and $150 in TAM for its Omniverse AI software line are impressive, something flying under the radar might be NVIDIA\u2019s new ambitions in networking. If I were Arista Networks, Cisco Systems, or Juniper Networks, I would be paying very close attention to this. Let\u2019s dive in and explore.\n\nWhy Networking and the DPU is Key\nHuang and NVIDIA are unique in always taking a deep, thoughtful engineering approach to new markets. In entering the market for AI with its GPU chip, which was previously used for graphics processing, NVIDIA took advantage of shifting needs in chip architecture. It focused on providing fast interconnects and a software architecture that allowed many GPUs to be strung together in a datacenter for powerful AI and ML processing.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nIt\u2019s now doing the same thing in networking. One of the key new products from NVIDIA is its BlueField-2 Data Processing Unit (DPU), technology it acquired when it bought Mellanox for $7 billion in 2019.\n\nIn its acquisition and further development of the BlueField DPU, NVIDIA noticed shifting needs in datacenters. With a massive surge in east-west networking connections between servers as well as increased demands related to cybersecurity and encryption calculations, servers can get overloaded with network processing. One of the answers has been to put a powerful DPU chip on the networking cards to offload this processing.\n\n\nThe DPU market isn\u2019t necessarily new, it\u2019s just that the growing demands of security and networking are making it more visible now. DPUs are an outgrowth of SmartNICs (smart network interface cards), which have been around for years. And NVIDIA isn\u2019t the only one that\u2019s noticed the growing popularity of DPUs \u2013 Amazon has developed its own DPU for its datacenters, and startups such as Pensando and Fungible are focused on the problem. Another manufacturer of SmartNICs, Napatech, also has technology that could be used for DPUs.\nDPUs are dedicated to networking and security functions. While at first DPUs were considered eccentric and expensive, driving up the cost of networking cards, many datacenter architects realized they could also produce a return on investment (ROI). By taking pressure off server CPUs, it was possible that a datacenter could reduce the need for new servers by pushing more of the load to a DPU.\nThere are other savings potentially in an approach using DPUs. For example, if you put a software-defined networking (SDN) system on the DPU, you could build an entire networking system integrated right into the NIC. This is an approach NVIDIA is taking in a partnership with Pluribus Networks. The two companies announced a DPU integration with Pluribus NetVisor network operating system (NOS) several weeks ago.\nIntegrated Networking and Security\nPluribus Networking is obviously excited about the NVIDIA partnership, pointing out that its networking software can be used to build networks whether there is a DPU or not. But the company says there are many operational and capital benefits in running a software-based NOS in conjunction with a DPU. In this architectural model, networking architects can create SDNs with full secure encryption in any datacenter. By Using the Pluribus NOS, networks can be set up on servers with DPUs or with traditional networking switches without DPUs. In the case of using a DPU, further savings can be realized by running security functions, including IPsec encryption and a firewall.Pluribus Networks sees combining its NOS with a DPU as having several Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) ... [+] benefits.Pluribus Networks\nThe powerful combination of a DPU and software-based networking may give NVIDIA an edge in the networking market. It now has all the components to provide networking, security, and processing in one package. It\u2019s also been ramping up its own networking hardware portfolio, including a new line of datacenter switches. Its new Spectrum-4 Ethernet switch provides 51 terabytes in throughput and 12.8 terabits per second of line-rate encryption. NVIDIA also claims 40% in power savings.NVIDIA's Spectrum-4 switch can process at a 12.8 terabit-per-second line rate. NVIDIA\nIn other words, NVIDIA now has a full portfolio of high-performance networking solutions \u2013 high-performance datacenter switches, a software-defined networking fabric (with Pluribus as well as other partners), and its own DPU.\nNVIDIA has been working on networking for a while, primarily through the acquisition of Mellanox as well as SDN provider Cumulus Networks. However, the new networking products, the evolution of the BlueField DPU, and the new partnership with Pluribus show that NVIDIA has been thinking about this market strategically and putting a lot of engineering resources into building high-performance networking and DPUs.\nThis networking story won\u2019t stay long under the radar. Huang himself acknowledged on the call with analysts that they had underplayed the networking story at last week\u2019s GTC but would be focusing on it more in the coming months.

On an average market day, Netflix shares worth roughly $2.8 billion are changing hands. Nvidia's daily dollar volume is an even beefier $12.1 billion. Furthermore, both of these are seen as high-octane growth stocks, and investors must have made many of the trades mentioned above after weighing these two against each other.\nSo let's run through that comparison right now. Should you buy Netflix stock today, or is Nvidia a better buy?\n\nWhy should you buy Netflix?\nThese are still early days in the making of a global entertainment giant.\nTV networks and feature films are moving online as we speak; 25 million American families dropped their cable TV packages between 2012 and 2020, and the transition is not slowing down. On the silver screen, global box office totals were stagnant for a decade while video-streaming services moved from zero to 1 billion subscribers.\nNetflix has been leading the charge all along. The top media-streaming service now has 222 million paying subscribers, generated $29.7 billion of top-line sales last year, and regularly dominates the media industry's awards season.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the growth story is far from over. According to data from Nielsen, Netflix accounted for just 6.4% of media-consuming screen time in December 2021. Old-school options still dominate the domestic media universe as 26% of that month's screen hours were directed at broadcast TV, and cable/satellite channels won the day with a 37% slice of the pie.\nAnd that's in one of the most mature and saturated media-streaming markets in the world. Netflix and rivals should be able to triple in size during this market transition, and the growth opportunity is even more significant in most of the markets overseas.\nAnd investors seem to have lost sight of this fantastic growth story. Its shares barely kept up with the market in recent years, and then a temporary subscriber-growth speed bump slashed share prices in half.\nNetflix shares are on fire sale, but the long-term growth story is as clear as ever. So this is a no-brainer buy in my book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should you buy Nvidia?\nLike Netflix, Nvidia has several powerful growth drivers:\n\nAs always, its number-crunching chips are locked in battle with Advanced Micro Devices over the lucrative market for video game systems and gaming consoles.\nThe company is also making inroads in the data center, focusing on the computing-intensive sub-sector of artificial intelligence.\nNvidia also provides a complete platform for self-driving cars, opening the door to yet another high-octane growth market.\nCryptocurrency mining is another important target market, though management keeps brushing that particular business under the rug. Given the crypto sector's propensity for sudden and massive swings, this is both an explosive growth vector and a source of significant risk.\n\nSo Nvidia is tapping into a plethora of promising market trends, often as a clear-cut front-runner. Wall Street is paying attention to this company's success, and Nvidia has been crushing the broader market over the last five years.\nThe stock has taken a 30% haircut in the last three months as investors backed away from richly valued growth stocks. Many see it as a great buy after this substantial price drop, but Nvidia still looks expensive with shares trading at 55 times trailing earnings and 20 times sales.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nFinal verdict: Buy Netflix, hold Nvidia\nWe could very well be looking at two long-term winners here, but I'm much more comfortable with buying Netflix at today's prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe media-streaming growth story is much clearer than the ever-changing semiconductor industry. At the same time, Netflix's stock has been stuck in neutral or worse for years while Nvidia's stock is skyrocketing in the five-year perspective.\nTherefore, Netflix is simply a fantastic buy today while Nvidia's stock might already have much of the upcoming business growth priced in.\n\n\n\nAnders Bylund owns Netflix.

In other words, this lowering in cost of 8 to 12% is something that gamers can expect to happen in the next few weeks (after adjusting for inventory buffers of retailers). This is something that hasn't happened in years (well, pretty much since the recent crypto boom began) and is a significant indicator of the first real price-easing since 2020.\nNVIDIA lowering the cost of GPUs by up to 12% for AICs, which will pass on the savings to gamers\nGPU prices have been steadily declining in the wake of the lackluster cryptocurrency market capitalization and with Ethereum contemplating the shift to Proof of Stake later this year. We have seen a month-on-month decline for almost three months now and NVIDIA is about to bring the price drop even more. While price declines so far have been dictated by the demand side of the equation, we have received word that NVIDIA has informed AICs that it saw a lowering in its cost of manufacturing by around 8 to 12% which it will pass on to AICs. AICs in return will pass this saving on to SIs where it should eventually end up saving a few dollars in the gamer's pocket.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostKeep in mind that a lowering in cost of GPUs does not mean that the supply will necessarily be improved simultaneously. GPUs are still very hard to find as cryptocurrency mining does remain profitable (and will continue to remain profitable), but there are several factors that will continue to bring down GPU prices throughout this year.\n\nYields at Samsung are improving and NVIDIA is exploring the option to tap both TSMC and Samsung simultaneously. If it chooses to go down this route, it will mean both the RTX 30 and RTX 40 series existing in harmony and basically twice the amount of wafer allocation (and supply). This will quite obviously help with the supply issues.\nIntel Alchemist GPUs are launching this year as well although the exact supply situation on that front remains to be seen. It is clear, however, that a third player in the market can only improve the prevailing under-supply situation of the market.\nEthereum's merge is now tentatively scheduled for Q2 2022: \"On its official roadmap, the Ethereum Foundation states that the Merge upgrade will be shipped by the end of Q2 2022.\" This will more or less kill the demand for Ethereum mining although another coin could rise to be the successor. In any eventuality (whether or not a viable Ethereum alternative exists), this will result in a significant decrease in cryptocurrency mining demand for GPUs.\n\nHowever, the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine could result in unforeseen price hikes once the foundries buffers of Neon (and other compounds) run out. It is worth noting here that all of the big players have a *lot* of Neon stored so unless the conflict enters a protracted stage (think months), this should not be a real issue.\nAll things considered, it does seem likely that GPU prices are going to keep coming down over the remaining year and we are going to see a massive influx of cheap second-hand GPUs and relatively-cheap new GPUs. If you are a gamer that wants to go with a DIY build, it might pay to wait a few more months for the prices to come down more.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n131\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n71\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n61\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n37\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n28\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

In this way, classical HPC systems are helping quantum researchers chart the right path forward.\nAs quantum computers improve, researchers share a vision of a hybrid computing model where quantum and classical computers work together, each addressing the challenges they\u2019re best suited to. To be broadly useful, these systems will need a unified programming environment that\u2019s efficient and easy to use.\nWe\u2019re building this onramp to the future of computing today. Starting with commercially available tools, like NVIDIA cuQuantum, we\u2019re collaborating with IBM, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Pasqal and many others.\nA Common Software Layer\nAs a first step, we\u2019re developing a new quantum compiler. Called nvq++, it targets the Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR), a specification of a low-level machine language that quantum and classical computers can use to talk to each other.\nResearchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Quantinuum, Quantum Circuits Inc., and others have embraced the QIR Alliance, led by the Linux Foundation. It enables an agnostic programming approach that will deliver the best from both quantum and classical computers.\nResearchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory will be among the first to use this new software.\nUltimately, we believe the HPC community will embrace this unified programming model for hybrid systems.\nReady-to-Use Quantum Tools\nYou don\u2019t have to wait for hybrid quantum systems. Any developer can start world-class quantum research today using accelerated computing and our tools.\nNVIDIA cuQuantum is now in general release. It runs complex quantum circuit simulations with libraries for tensor networks and state vectors.\nAnd our cuQuantum DGX Appliance, a container with all the components needed to run cuQuantum jobs optimized for NVIDIA DGX A100 systems, is available in beta release.\nResearchers are already using these products to tackle real-world challenges.\nFor example, QC Ware is running quantum chemistry and quantum machine learning algorithms using cuQuantum on the Perlmutter supercomputer at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The work aims to advance drug discovery and climate science.\nAn Expanding Quantum Ecosystem\nOur quantum products are supported by an expanding ecosystem of companies.\nFor example, Xanadu has integrated cuQuantum into PennyLane, an open-source framework for quantum machine learning and quantum chemistry. The Oak Ridge National Lab is using cuQuantum in TNQVM, a framework for tensor network quantum circuit simulations.\nIn addition, other companies now support cuQuantum in their commercially available quantum simulators and frameworks, such as the Classiq Quantum Algorithm Design platform from Classiq, and Orquestra from Zapata Computing.\nThey join existing collaborators including Google Quantum AI, IBM, IonQ and Pasqal, that announced support for our software in November.\nLearn More at GTC\nRegister free for this week\u2019s GTC, to hear QC Ware discuss its research on quantum chemistry.\nIt\u2019s among at least ten sessions on quantum computing at GTC. And to get the big picture, watch NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s GTC keynote here.\n\n\nCategories: SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | GTC 2022 | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Dave Altavilla is a Tech Analyst covering chips, compute and AI.Follow AuthorMar 22, 2022, 12:45pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 2 years old.NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang And HIs Digital Twin, In The NVIDIA Omniverse EnvironmentNVIDIA\nFrom AI Superchips to the engines and plumbing of the metaverse, robotics and autonomous vehicles, NVIDIA\u2019s execution machine of cutting-edge silicon, platforms and services rolls-on in high gear.\n\nAt NVIDIA\u2019s annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC) today, CEO Jensen Huang took to the stage in his usual passionate, leather-clad fashion. However, this GTC keynote was actually a live demo of sorts, delivered from the simulated constructs of the metaverse. In recent years, NVIDIA as a company has not only made great strides in AI (artificial intelligence) processing engines, but has also quickly emerged as quite literally the inventors and innovators of platforms for the creation of the metaverse. The metaverse, a tech term that is getting quickly worn out, is currently an almost mystical future destination where humankind will interact, collaborate and evolve together in experiences that exist beyond our physical world. AI and the metaverse seemingly go hand-in-hand, but NVIDIA is clearly all-in on both emerging markets and their enabling technologies. So, let\u2019s unpack a few of NVIDIA\u2019s top-line announcements today, as well as their impact on these burgeoning markets, though there\u2019s much more to digest with NVIDIA\u2019s many GTC announcements beyond this high-level synopsis, I assure you.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s Powerful New Hopper GPU Architecture Takes A Cue From Its NamesakeNVIDIA H100 Hopper GPU Comprised Of Over 80 Billion TransistorsNVIDIA\n\nFirst let\u2019s start with NVIDIA\u2019s bread and butter technology, and the GPU giant is definitely taking things up a notch again. Comprised of some 80 billion transistors and built on TSMC\u2019s bleeding-edge 4N (roughly 4 nanometer) chip fab process, NVIDIA\u2019s new H100 \u201cHopper\u201d GPU (loosely, \u201cGraphics Processing Unit\u201d though they do much more these days with many more resources on board) is named after the computer scientist pioneer and US Navy Admiral, Grace Hopper, and is the successor to the company\u2019s now 2 year-old Ampere GPU architecture. It\u2019s also strapped with the latest memory and IO innovations, with a PCI Express Gen 5 interface and up to 96GB of new HBM3 (memory) connected over a mile-wide 512-bit memory interface for gobs of memory bandwidth, up to 3TB/s.\n\nThe GPU itself is also massive, sporting 18,432 CUDA cores in its full implementation, which is over 2.5X more than the company\u2019s previous generation Ampere A100 AI and data science GPU. A full GH100 Hopper GPU also sports 576 4th Generation Tensor cores (specialized cores for machine learning calculation) versus 512 3rd Gen Tensor cores in Ampere A100. Here\u2019s a quick specs bullet list rundown from NVIDIA\u2026\n\n\n\nThe full implementation of the GH100 GPU includes the following:\n\n\n\n8 GPCs, 72 TPCs (9 TPCs/GPC), 2 SMs/TPC, 144 SMs per full GPU\n128 FP32 CUDA Cores per SM, 18432 FP32 CUDA Cores per full GPU\n4 Fourth-Generation Tensor Cores per SM, 576 per full GPU\n6 HBM3 or HBM2e stacks, 12 512-bit Memory Controllers\n60 MB L2 Cache\nFourth-Generation NVLink and PCIe Gen 5\n\n\nNVIDIA H100 Hopper SXM5 ModuleNVIDIA\n\n\nNVIDIA will also have SXM5 module form factors for H100 as well, which will support the PCIe Gen 5 interface as previously mentioned and come equipped with a few less resources, with 16,869 CUDA cores and only 80GB of HBM3, for example. The new NVIDIA GPU will also support new DPX instructions, that offer up to a 7X lift in performance over its previous-gen architecture, for accelerating workloads and applications from autonomous machines to genomics DNA and protein classification and folding.\nOf course, Hopper will also offer a powerful inference and training performance uplift, specifically optimized for the explosive growth in new transformer machine learning models. Transformers are capable of \u201cself-attention\u201d (knowing what part of training input is more important than others), like Megatron 530B, NVIDIA\u2019s natural language model that offers up to 30X higher throughput in real-time conversational AI chatbots, etc. The new GPU will also support NVIDIA\u2019s second gen Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology that will allow up to 7 secure compute instances to run on a single GPU, with fully encrypted confidential computing support.\nNeedless to say, NVIDIA\u2019s Hopper GH100 appears to have the compute resources, memory bandwidth and key optimizations to make it an absolute crusher accelerator for virtually any type of machine learning and HPC (High Performance Computing) workload, from data center AI, to healthcare research and big data analytics. The new GPU will be shipping in the 3rd quarter of this year.\nNVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip And NVLink C2C Complete A Powerful AI And HPC PlatformNVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip Utilizing NVLink C2C InterconnectNVIDIA\nA high-performance GPU also needs to pair with a powerful host CPU, and last year at GTC 2021 NVIDIA announced Grace, a new 72-core CPU based on the Arm Neoverse (Arm v9) architecture. This year, NVIDIA is quite literally doubling-down on Grace and combining two of the chips in a single MCM (multi-chip module) package for 144 cores total. Currently, NVIDIA\u2019s DGX AI supercomputers are shipping with X86 CPUs from Intel and AMD, but long-term NVIDIA aims to offer Grace-powered versions as well. The Grace CPU Superchip will support an LPDDR5x memory interface, and NVIDIA claims its new 144-core processor will deliver 1.5X higher performance compared to the X86 processors shipping in its DGX A100 (Ampere-based) systems now.\nNVIDIA notes the chip will run all of its software stack, including NVIDIA RTX, NVIDIA HPC, NVIDIA AI and Omniverse, and run in standalone servers as well as GPU-accelerated servers with up to 8 Hopper GPUs. However, how these many-core CPUs are linked together is a new announcement in and of itself for NVIDIA, known as NVLink C2C (chip-to-chip).NVIDIA NVLink C2C High Speed Chip-To-Chip InterconnectNVIDIA\nNVLink is NVIDIA\u2019s high speed serial interconnect that historically has connected GPU boards on a server blade or inside a rack. Now in its 4th generation, NVIDIA is announcing NVLink has gone chip-to-chip as well, and claims its 25x more power-efficient and 90x more area-efficient than PCIe Gen 5. The interface will be capable of supporting 900GB/sec of bi-directional bandwidth and is slated to allow not only CPUs and GPUs to talk but also DPU (Data Processing Units), NICs (Network Interfaces) and even external custom chips to be integrated into custom chiplet solutions. If this sounds familiar to the recently announced UCIe interconnect standard (backed by Intel, AMD, Arm, and others) it definitely is, and NVIDIA is opening the technology to customers to implement it for semi-custom silicon level integrations with its various technologies. Incidentally, NVIDIA also intends to support UCIe, and notes custom integrations can use either UCIe or NVLink C2C for higher bandwidth and better power efficiency.\nAs I mentioned, NVLink C2C is also the interconnect used to connect the two CPU complexes in NVIDIA\u2019s Grace CPU Superchip, but it will also connect a Grace CPU and Hopper GPU in a single MCM package as well, known as, you guessed it, a Grace Hopper CPU-GPU superchip combining the best of both worlds on a single module. NVIDIA notes both Grace CPU Superchip and Grace Hopper Superchip will arrive in the first half of 2023.\nAI Powered Platforms Bring Tools And Infrastructure For Cloud AI And The MetaverseNVIDIA Omniverse CloudNVIDIA\nIn addition, new DGX H100 enterprise AI servers and SuperPod data center supercomputers based on Hopper (and currently X86 CPUs) will be arriving in market this year. NVIDIA has multiple software and services platforms in support of them as well, including AI Enterprise 2.0, which brings support for on-prem and public cloud GPU accelerated services to a myriad of platform ecosystems from VMWare and RedHat containers to AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.\nAnother major announcement in the cloud for NVIDIA was the unveiling of Omniverse Cloud. You can think of NVIDIA Omniverse as the building blocks and computing platforms of the metaverse. Operating on the USD (Universal Scene Description) framework, an open standard developed by Pixar, Omniverse allows creators, developers, engineers and designers from virtually any discipline to collaborate in virtual worlds and with digital twins of projects, and even themselves, using their design tools of choice. So, whether your jam is rending in Blender, designing in SketchUp or FreeCAD, it can all be simulated in Omniverse and in collaboration with teams in different locations.\nOmniverse Cloud, however, is a new service that NVIDIA will stream on the same infrastructure and in the same data centers as its GeForce NOW game streaming services. So, like the GeForce NOW game streaming service, Omniverse Cloud is a software and infrastructure as a service play for NVIDIA, for teams that don\u2019t have the NVIDIA RTX systems, or resources to stand-up their own infrastructure for Omniverse. In addition, like GeForce NOW, Omniverse Cloud will run on literally any device, like a laptop or even a tablet, since workload processing is offloaded to the cloud and streamed to the device. NVIDIA hasn\u2019t noted when Omniverse Cloud will be officially be available or its cost structure, but to be sure this will afford the company a significant time-to-market edge versus future competitive platforms, as well as foster early adoption of its hardware, tools and other resources for building the AI-infused metaverse.\nLet\u2019s Not Forget Our Robot Overlords \u2013 Enter Jetson AGX Orin\nOf course, NVIDIA is also vigorously developing technologies for autonomous machines, from self-driving cars and robotaxis to all forms of robotics. And what enables autonomous machines to work their magic is a series of sensors and cameras for machine vision, backed up by a powerful AI processor that can process what its eyes (the cameras and sensors) are pulling in and then infer what to do with all that information so it can efficiently and safely navigate. Further, training and learning need to take place for continuous improvements in efficiency and safety. To that end, NVIDIA has announced a new powerful entry in its AI-infused robotics platform, known as Jetson AGX Orin.NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin Dev KitNVIDIA\nJetson AGX Orin is the follow-on to NVIDIA\u2019s Jetson AGX Xavier and the company claims it\u2019s the most powerful AI-accelerated robotics solution on the market currently with over 8X the processing power of Jetson AGX Xavier. Jetson AGX Orin combines a 12-core Arm A78 CPU complex, along with 2,048 NVIDIA Ampere GPU cores, 64 Tensor cores (think GeForce RTX 3050 class GPU) and 64GB of LPDDR 5 memory in its top-end configuration. With a 32GB memory-equipped dev kit priced at $1999, developers can work with Jetson AGX Orin with full backwards compatibility to previous generation platforms and support for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. With pre-trained AI models and support for NVIDIA\u2019s various frameworks in robotics, sensor analytics, computer vision and natural language processing, NVIDIA\u2019s Jetson Jetpack SDK is a complete platform enablement solution for cutting-edge robotics engineering.NVIDIA Jetson Jetpack Software Development Kit NVIDIA \nOnce in production, customers can choose from various NVIDIA Jetson Orin modules, priced as low as $399, to $1599 for the top end module with 64GB of RAM that\u2019s capable of pushing 275 TOPS (Tera Operations Per Second) of performance.\n\u201cWe are extending the powerful Microsoft Azure platform to the intelligent edge. Combining Azure\u2019s advanced capabilities with performance and software development tools such as NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin helps give developers a seamless experience to easily build, deploy and operate production-ready AI applications,\u201d notes Roanne Sones, corporate vice president, Microsoft Azure Edge + Platforms. NVIDIA notes Jetson AGX Orin is available for order now.\nNVIDIA DRIVE Orin Autonomous Vehicle Platform Hits ProductionLucid Announces Adoption Of NVIDIA DRIVE Orin Autonomous Vehicle PlatformNVIDIA\nNVIDIA also announced its DRIVE Orin autonomous vehicle platform has entered production, and new electric vehicle manufacturers BYD and Lucid Group have announced adoption of the system-on-a-chip technology to power their fleets. To date, more than 25 vehicle manufacturers have adopted the company\u2019s DRIVE Orin platform, and the company now has an $ 11 billion dollar design win pipeline (up from $8 billion this time last year) for the next generation of software defined, self-driving vehicles. You can dig in for more details in NVIDIA\u2019s blog post here.\nIn summary, there\u2019s just far too much to unpack and uncover at NVIDIA GTC this week to feature in just one article, so be sure to head over to the GTC event site and catch Jensen\u2019s keynote \u2014 registration is free.\nI personally can\u2019t think of another major chip player in the market that is doing so much and executing so well to advance machine learning, AI, high performance computing and autonomous machines. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and his team continue to deliver an innovation pipeline of technologies and platforms like no other in these fast-paced and relentlessly evolving markets.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Our spelling correction helps you find what you want even if you don\u2019t know the exact spelling of the intended words. In the past, we used classical machine learning (ML) algorithms with manual feature engineering for spelling correction. To make the next generational leap in spelling correction performance, we are embracing a number of deep-learning approaches, including sequence-to-sequence models. Deep learning (DL) models are compute-intensive both in training and inference, and these costs have historically made DL models impractical in a production setting at Amazon\u2019s scale. In this post, we present the results of an inference optimization experimentation where we overcome those obstacles and achieve 534% inference speed-up for the popular Hugging Face T5 Transformer.\nChallenge\nThe Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5, Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer, Reffel et al) is the state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model architecture. T5 is a promising architecture for spelling correction, that we found to perform well in our experiments. T5 models are easy to research, develop, and train, thanks to open-source deep learning frameworks and ongoing academic and enterprise research.\nHowever, it\u2019s difficult to achieve production-grade, low-latency inference with a T5. For example, a single inference with a PyTorch T5 takes 45 milliseconds on one of the four NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs equipping an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) p3.8xlarge instance. (All inference numbers reported are for an input of 9 tokens and output of 11 tokens. The latency of T5 architectures is sensitive to both input and output lengths.)\nLow-latency, cost-efficient T5 inference at scale is a known difficulty that has been reported by several AWS customers beyond Amazon Search, which boosts our motivation to contribute this post. To go from an offline, scientific achievement to a customer-facing production service, Amazon Search faces the following challenges:\n\nLatency \u2013 How to realize T5 inference in less than 50-millisecond P99 latency\nThroughput \u2013 How to handle large-scale concurrent inference requests\nCost efficiency \u2013 How to keep costs under control\n\nIn the rest of this post, we explain how the NVIDIA inference optimization stack\u2014namely the NVIDIA TensorRT compiler and the open source NVIDIA Triton Inference Server\u2014solves those challenges. Read NVIDIA\u2019s press release to learn about the updates.\nNVIDIA TensorRT: Reducing costs and latency with inference optimization\nDeep learning frameworks are convenient to iterate fast on the science, and come with numerous functionalities for scientific modeling, data loading, and training optimization. However, most of those tools are suboptimal for inference, which only requires a minimal set of operators for matrix multiplication and activation functions. Therefore, significant gains can be realized by using a specialized, prediction-only application instead of running inference in the deep learning development framework.\nNVIDIA TensorRT is an SDK for high-performance deep learning inference. TensorRT delivers both an optimized runtime, using low-level optimized kernels available on NVIDIA GPUs, and an inference-only model graph, which rearranges inference computation in an optimized order.\nIn the following section, we will talk about the details happening behind TensorRT and how it speeds performance.\n\n\nReduced Precision maximizes throughput with FP16 or INT8 by quantizing models while maintaining correctness.\nLayer and Tensor Fusion optimizes use of GPU memory and bandwidth by fusing nodes in a kernel to avoid kernel launch latency.\nKernel Auto-Tuning selects best data layers and algorithms based on the target GPU platform and data kernel shapes.\nDynamic Tensor Memory minimizes memory footprint by freeing unnecessary memory consumption of intermediate results and reuses memory for tensors efficiently.\nMulti-Stream Execution uses a scalable design to process multiple input streams in parallel with dedicated CUDA streams.\nTime Fusion optimizes recurrent neural networks over time steps with dynamically generated kernels.\n\nT5 uses transformer layers as building blocks for its architectures. The latest release of NVIDIA TensorRT 8.2 introduces new optimizations for the T5 and GPT-2 models for real-time inference. In the following table, we can see the speedup with TensorRT on some public T5 models running on Amazon EC2G4dn instances, powered by NVIDIA T4 GPUs and EC2 G5 instances, powered by NVIDIA A10G GPUs.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nModel\nInstance\nBaseline Pytorch Latency (ms)\nTensorRT 8.2 Latency (ms)\nSpeedup vs. the HF baseline\n\n\nFP32\nFP32\nFP16\nFP32\nFP16\n\n\nEncoder\nDecoder\nEnd to End\nEncoder\nDecoder\nEnd to End\nEncoder\nDecoder\nEnd to End\nEnd to End\nEnd to End\n\n\nt5-small\ng4dn.xlarge\n5.98\n9.74\n30.71\n1.28\n2.25\n7.54\n0.93\n1.59\n5.91\n407.40%\n519.34%\n\n\n\ng5.xlarge\n4.63\n7.56\n24.22\n0.61\n1.05\n3.99\n0.47\n0.80\n3.19\n606.66%\n760.01%\n\n\nt5-base\ng4dn.xlarge\n11.61\n19.05\n78.44\n3.18\n5.45\n19.59\n3.15\n2.96\n13.76\n400.48%\n569.97%\n\n\n\ng5.xlarge\n8.59\n14.23\n59.98\n1.55\n2.47\n11.32\n1.54\n1.65\n8.46\n530.05%\n709.20%\n\n\n\nFor more information about optimizations and replication of the attached performance, refer to Optimizing T5 and GPT-2 for Real-Time Inference with NVIDIA TensorRT.\nIt is important to note that compilation preserves model accuracy, as it operates on the inference environment and the computation scheduling, leaving the model science unaltered \u2013 unlike weight removal compression such as distillation or pruning. NVIDIA TensorRT allows to combine compilation with quantization for further gains. Quantization has double benefits on recent NVIDIA hardware: it reduces memory usage, and enables the use of NVIDIA Tensor Cores, DL-specific cells that run a fused matrix-multiply-add in mixed precision.\nIn the case of the Amazon Search experimentation with Hugging Face T5 model, replacing PyTorch with TensorRT for model inference increases speed by 534%.\nNVIDIA Triton: Low-latency, high-throughput inference serving\nModern model serving solutions can transform offline trained models into customer-facing ML-powered products. To maintain reasonable costs at such a scale, it\u2019s important to keep serving overhead low (HTTP handling, preprocessing and postprocessing, CPU-GPU communication), and fully take advantage of the parallel processing ability of GPUs.\nNVIDIA Triton is an inference serving software proposing wide support of model runtimes (NVIDIA TensorRT, ONNX, PyTorch, XGBoost among others) and infrastructure backends, including GPUs, CPU and AWS Inferentia.\nML practitioners love Triton for multiple reasons. Its dynamic batching ability allows to accumulate inference requests during a user-defined delay and within a maximal user-defined batch size, so that GPU inference is batched, amortizing the CPU-GPU communication overhead. Note that dynamic batching happens server-side and within very short time frames, so that the requesting client still has a synchronous, near-real-time invocation experience. Triton users also enjoy its concurrent model execution capacity. GPUs are powerful multitaskers that excel in executing compute-intensive workloads in parallel. Triton maximize the GPU utilization and throughput by using CUDA streams to run multiple model instances concurrently. These model instances can be different models from different frameworks for different use cases, or a direct copy of the same model. This translates to direct throughput improvement when you have enough idle GPU memory. Also, as Triton is not tied to a specific DL development framework, it allows scientist to fully express themselves, in the tool of their choice.\nWith Triton on AWS, Amazon Search expects to better serve Amazon.com customers and meet latency requirements at low cost. The tight integration between the TensorRT runtime and the Triton server facilitates the development experience. Using AWS cloud infrastructure allows to scale up or down in minutes based on throughput requirements, while maintaining the bar high or reliability and security.\nHow AWS lowers the barrier to entry\nWhile Amazon Search conducted this experiment on Amazon EC2 infrastructure, other AWS services exist to facilitate the development, training and hosting of state-of-the-art deep learning solutions.\nFor example, AWS and NVIDIA have collaborated to release a managed implementation of Triton Inference Server in Amazon SageMaker ; for more information, see Deploy fast and scalable AI with NVIDIA Triton Inference Server in Amazon SageMaker. AWS also collaborated with Hugging Face to develop a managed, optimized integration between Amazon SageMaker and Hugging Face Transformers, the open-source framework from which Amazon Search T5 model is derived ; read more at https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/hugging-face/.\nWe encourage customers with latency-sensitive CPU and GPU deep learning serving applications to consider NVIDIA TensorRT and Triton on AWS.

Well, never mind that. The software side will offer a more predictable revenue stream, Kress said.\n\nNot only does the hardware at the very beginning produce revenue, but software over the life of owning the car will\n\nThe CFO gave the example of how autonomous cars will drive a recurring software revenue. Mercedes-Benz, starting in 2024, and Jaguar Land Rover, starting in 2025, will ship self-driving vehicles with Nvidia's computers and DRIVE operating system.\n\"Their entire fleets will be operated with Nvidia software, and we will have the ability to share that software with those OEMs and monetize it over the life of the cars being on the road,\" Kress said, adding that she expected the number of such cars to reach about 10 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is working with Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar Land Rover to customize software for their vehicles. The GPU giant has been preaching the car-as-a-service model, in which automakers can remotely turn on car features, such as driver assistance, through subscription services. Nvidia could get a cut from such services delivered through its in-vehicle hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have the ability for the hardware to exist for the lifetime inside of the car [and] the software to be addressed each time with over-air updates. Not only does the hardware at the very beginning produce revenue, but software over the life of owning the car will,\" Kress said.\nThis is just the start of these kinds of opportunities, Kress said, adding: \"The pipelines are growing for this and we'll look to provide metrics when the software is relevant.\"\n\nLeaked stolen Nvidia key can sign Windows malware\nGlobalFoundries' new silicon photonics tech gets big buy-in\nNvidia, Apple noticeably absent from Intel-led chiplet interconnect collaboration\nData stolen from Nvidia, blueprints leak threatened\n\nNvidia is also expecting software revenue from the emerging opportunity of metaverse, for which it is providing the plumbing in the form of its graphics cards. The biz ultimately wants to tap into a market of millions of makers who will need tools to create avatars as well as the 3D worlds in which they'll collaborate and communicate, Kress said. The chip titan already offers Omniverse, which is a metaverse creation suite in which folks can build interactive virtual universes to work and play in. Kress didn't hesitate to put a potential dollar value on this opportunity.\n\"So for the 40 million different creatives that are out there, we can add about $1,000 a person per year ... That's one important piece,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmniverse can also be used by engineers and manufacturers to create and simulate products and machinery in collaborative virtual spaces. \"We've been able to do this by bringing both ray tracing to market, that is procuring real-time visual effects, but also bringing AI together and now simulating all of this together with just physics of those environments that they create,\" Kress said.\nTo that end, Nvidia is working on the necessary materials to design and simulate robots and cars in virtual-reality workshops. It's also making it possible to create interactive bots to answer people's queries in immersive 3D environments.\n\nCreating that bot, creating that digital twin, could be approximately about $1,000 a year for each one of these\n\n\"This could be used for service centers, call centers, as they are using these bots to have more of an interactive discussion with our customers. Creating that bot, creating that digital twin, could be approximately about $1,000 a year for each one of these,\" Kress spitballed.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is expected to make more announcements about Omniverse and related software offerings at the company's upcoming GPU Technology Conference on March 22.\nNv is a full-stack company with tightly integrated hardware and software. The US giant's parallel computing suite CUDA is not exactly open to competitors, and Huang has reiterated he will not open source it, calling it the centerpiece of his software strategy. He is, however, theoretically open to third parties designing chips tuned for CUDA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is known for its software: from AI framework code to applications to development kits. You buy its hardware, the software comes with it. \"Now we have an ability to monetize that separately,\" Kress said. \u00ae \nGet our Tech

While the COVID pandemic never seemed to end \u2013 and technically still hasn\u2019t \u2013 the last two years have whizzed by for the tech industry, and especially for NVIIDA. The company launched its Ampere GPU architecture just two years ago at GTC 2020, and after selling more of their chips than ever before, now in 2022 it\u2019s already time to introduce the next architecture. So without further ado, let\u2019s talk about the Hopper architecture, which will underpin the next generation of NVIDIA server GPUs.\nAs has become a ritual now for NVIDIA, the company is using its Spring GTC event to launch its next generation GPU architecture. Introduced just two years ago, Ampere has been NVIDIA\u2019s most successful server GPU architecture to date, with over $10B in data center sales in just the last year. And yet NVIDIA has little time to rest on their laurels, as the the growth and profitability of the server accelerator market means that there are more competitors than ever before aiming take a piece of NVIDIA\u2019s market for themselves. To that end, NVIDIA is ready (and eager) to use their biggest show of the year to talk about their next generation architecture, as well as the first products that will implement it.\nTaking NVIDIA into the next generation of server GPUs is the Hopper architecture. Named after computer science pioneer Grace Hopper, the Hopper architecture is a very significant, but also very NVIDIA update to the company\u2019s ongoing family of GPU architectures. With the company\u2019s efforts now solidly bifurcated into server and consumer GPU configurations, Hopper is NVIDIA doubling down on everything the company does well, and then building it even bigger than ever before.\nHyperbole aside, over the last several years NVIDIA has developed a very solid playbook for how to tackle the server GPU industry. On the hardware side of matters that essentially boils down to correctly identifying current and future trends as well as customer needs in high performance accelerators, investing in the hardware needed to handle those workloads at great speeds, and then optimizing the heck out of all of it. And for NVIDIA, the last step may very well be the most important bit: NVIDIA puts a lot of work into getting out of doing work.\nThat mentality, in turn, is front and center for NVIDIA\u2019s Hopper architecture. While NVIDIA has made investments across the board to improve performance, from memory bandwidth and I/O to machine learning and confidential computing, the biggest performance uplifts with Hopper are in the areas where NVIDIA has figured out how to do less work, making their processors all the faster.\nKicking things off for the Hopper generation is H100, NVIDIA\u2019s flagship server accelerator. Based on the GH100 GPU, GH100 is a traditional NVIDIA server-first launch, with the company starting at the high end to develop accelerator cards for their largest and deepest pocketed server and enterprise customers.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Accelerator Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nH100\nA100 (80GB)\nV100\n\n\nFP32 CUDA Cores\n16896\n6912\n5120\n\n\nTensor Cores\n528\n432\n640\n\n\nBoost Clock\n~1.78GHz\n\t\t\t(Not Finalized)\n1.41GHz\n1.53GHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n4.8Gbps HBM3\n3.2Gbps HBM2e\n1.75Gbps HBM2\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n5120-bit\n5120-bit\n4096-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n3TB/sec\n2TB/sec\n900GB/sec\n\n\nVRAM\n80GB\n80GB\n16GB/32GB\n\n\nFP32 Vector\n60 TFLOPS\n19.5 TFLOPS\n15.7 TFLOPS\n\n\nFP64 Vector\n30 TFLOPS\n9.7 TFLOPS\n\t\t\t(1/2 FP32 rate)\n7.8 TFLOPS\n\t\t\t(1/2 FP32 rate)\n\n\nINT8 Tensor\n2000 TOPS\n624 TOPS\nN/A\n\n\nFP16 Tensor\n1000 TFLOPS\n312 TFLOPS\n125 TFLOPS\n\n\nTF32 Tensor\n500 TFLOPS\n156 TFLOPS\nN/A\n\n\nFP64 Tensor\n60 TFLOPS\n19.5 TFLOPS\nN/A\n\n\nInterconnect\nNVLink 4\n\t\t\t18 Links (900GB/sec)\nNVLink 3\n\t\t\t12 Links (600GB/sec)\nNVLink 2\n\t\t\t6 Links (300GB/sec)\n\n\nGPU\nGH100\n\t\t\t(814mm2)\nGA100\n\t\t\t(826mm2)\nGV100\n\t\t\t(815mm2)\n\n\nTransistor Count\n80B\n54.2B\n21.1B\n\n\nTDP\n700W\n400W\n300W/350W\n\n\nManufacturing Process\nTSMC 4N\nTSMC 7N\nTSMC 12nm FFN\n\n\nInterface\nSXM5\nSXM4\nSXM2/SXM3\n\n\nArchitecture\nHopper\nAmpere\nVolta\n\n\n\nAhead of today\u2019s keynote presentation \u2013 which as this article goes up, is still going on \u2013 NVIDIA offered a press pre-briefing on Hopper. In traditional NVIDIA fashion, the company has been very selective about the details released thus far (least it gets leaked ahead of Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote). So we can\u2019t make a fully apples-to-apples comparison to A100 quite yet, as we don\u2019t have the full specifications. But based on this pre-briefing, we can certainly tease out some interesting highlights about NVIDIA\u2019s architecture.\nFirst and foremost, NVIDIA is once again building big for their flagship GPU. The GH100 GPU is comprised of 80 billion transistors and is being built on what NVIDIA is calling a \u201ccustom\u201d version of TSMC\u2019s 4N process node, an updated version of TSMC\u2019s N5 technology that offers better power/performance characteristics and a very modest improvement in density. So even at just two years after Ampere, NVIDIA is making a full node jump and then some for GH100. At this point NVIDIA is not disclosing die sizes, so we don\u2019t have exact figures to share. But given the known density improvements of TSMC\u2019s process nodes, GH100 should be close in size to the 826mm2 GA100. And indeed, it is, at 814mm2.\nLike NVIDIA\u2019s previous sever accelerators, the H100 card isn\u2019t shipping with a fully-enabled GPU. So the figures NVIDIA is providing are based on H100 as implemented, with however many functional units (and memory stacks) are enabled.\n\nIn regards to performance, NVIDIA isn\u2019t quoting any figures for standard vector performance in advance. They are however quoting tensor performance, which depending on the format is either 3x or 6x faster than the A100 accelerator. We\u2019ll see how this breaks down between clockspeed increases and either larger or additional tensor cores, but clearly NVIDIA is once again throwing even more hardware at tensor performance, a strategy that has worked out well for them so far.\nOfficially, NVIDIA likes to quote figures with sparsity enabled, but for the purposes of our spec sheet I\u2019m using the non-sparse numbers for a more apples-to-apples comparison with previous NVIDIA hardware, as well as competing hardware. With sparsity enabled, TF32 performance and on down can be doubled.\n\nMemory bandwidth is also improving significantly over the previous generation, with H100 offering 3TB/second of bandwidth there. The increase in bandwidth this time around comes thanks to the use of HBM3, with NVIDIA becoming the first accelerator vendor to use the latest-generation version of the high bandwidth memory. H100 will come with 6 16GB stacks of the memory, with 1 stack disabled. The net result is 80GB of HBM3 running at a data rate of 4.8Gbps/pin, and attached to a 5120-bit memory bus.\nNVIDIA will be offering H100 in their usual two form factors: SXM mezzanine for high performance servers, and a PCIe card for more mainstream servers. The power requirements for both form factors have gone up significantly over the previous generation. NVIDIA is quoting an eye-popping 700 Watt TDP for the SXM version of the card, 75% higher than the official 400W TDP of the A100. For better or worse, NVIDIA is holding nothing back here, though the ongoing decline in transistor power scaling is not doing NVIDIA any favors, either.\nCooling such a hot GPU will be an interesting task, though not beyond current technology. At these power levels we\u2019re almost certainly looking at liquid cooling, something the SXM form factor is well-suited for. Still, it\u2019s worth noting that the rival OAM form factor \u2013 essentially the Open Compute Project\u2019s take on SXM for use in accelerators \u2013 is designed to top out at 700W. So NVIDIA is seemingly approaching the upper limits of what even a mezzanine style card can handle, assuming that sever vendors don\u2019t resort to exotic cooling methods.\nMeanwhile the H100 PCie card will see its TDP raised to 350W, from 300W today. Given that 300W is the traditional limit for PCIe cards, it will be interesting to see how NVIDIA and their partners keep those cards cool. Otherwise, with just half the TDP of the SXM card, we\u2019re expecting the PCIe version to be clocked/configured noticeably slower in order to temper the card\u2019s power consumption.\nHopper Tensor Cores: Now With Transformer Engines\nMoving on to the big-ticket architectural features of the Hopper architecture, we\u2019re start with NVIDIA\u2019s Transformer Engines. Living up to their name, the transformer engines are a new, highly specialized type of tensor core, that are designed to further accelerate transformer ML models.\nIn keeping with NVIDIA\u2019s focus on machine learning, for the Hopper architecture the company has taken a fresh look at the makeup of the ML market, and what workloads are popular and/or the most demanding on existing hardware. The winner, in this regard, has been transformers, a type of deep learning model that have risen in popularity rather quickly due to their utility in natural language processing and computer vision. \u00a0Recent advancements in transformer technology, such as the GPT-3 model, along with demand from service operators for better natural language processing, have made transformers the latest big breakthrough in ML.\nBut at the same time, the processing requirements for transformers are also hampering the development of even better models. In short, better models require an ever-larger number of parameters, and at over 175 billion parameters for GPT-3 alone, training times for transformers are becoming unwieldy, even on large GPU clusters.\nTo that end, NVIDIA has developed a variant of the tensor core specifically for speeding up transformer training and inference, which they have dubbed the Transformer Engine. NVIDIA has optimized this new unit by stripping it down to just processing the lower precision data formats used by most transformers (FP16), and then scaling things down even more with the introduction of an FP8 format as well. The goal with the new units, in brief, is to use the minimum precision necessary at every step to train transformers without losing accuracy. In other words, to avoid doing more work than is necessary.\n\nWith that said, unlike more traditional neural network models which are trained at a fixed precision throughout, NVIDIA\u2019s latest hack for transformers is to vary the precision, since FP8 cannot be used throughout a model. As a result, Hopper\u2019s transformer engines can swap between FP16 and FP8 training on a layer by layer basis, utilizing NVIDIA-provided heuristics that work to select the lowest precision needed. The net benefit is that every layer that can be processed at FP8 can be processed twice as fast, as the transformer engines can pack and process FP8 data twice as quickly as FP16.\nCombined with the additional memory on H100 and the faster NVLink 4 I/O, and NVIDIA claims that a large cluster of GPUs can train a transformer up to 9x faster, which would bring down training times on today\u2019s largest models down to a more reasonable period of time, and make even larger models more practical to tackle.\nMeanwhile, on the inference side of matters, Hopper can also immediately consume its own FP8 trained models for inference use. This is an important distinction for Hopper, as it allows customers to otherwise skip converting and optimizing a trained transformer model down to INT8. NVIDIA isn\u2019t claiming any specific performance benefits from sticking with FP8 over INT8, but it means developers can enjoy the same performance and memory usage benefits of running inference on an INT8 model without the previously-required conversion step.\nFinally, NVIDIA is claiming anywhere between a 16x and 30x increase in transformer inference performance on H100 versus A100. Like their training claims, this is an H100 cluster versus an A100 cluster, so memory and I/O improvements are also playing a part here, but it none the less underscores that H100\u2019s transformer engines aren\u2019t just for speeding up training.\nDPX Instructions: Dynamic Programming for GPUs\nNVIDIA\u2019s other big smart-and-lazy improvement for the Hopper architecture comes courtesy of the field of dynamic programming. For their latest generation of technology, NVIDIA is adding support for the programming model by adding a new set of instructions just for dynamic programming. The company is calling these DPX Instructions.\nDynamic programming, in a nutshell, is a way of breaking down complex problems into smaller, simpler problems in a recursive manner, and then solving those smaller problems first. The key feature of dynamic programming is that if some of these sub-problems are identical, then those redundancies can be identified and eliminated \u2013 meaning a sub-problem can be solved once, and its results saved for future use within the larger problem.\nAll of which is to say that, like Sparsity and Transformer Engines, NVIDIA is implementing dynamic programming to allow their GPUs to get out of doing more work. By eliminating the redundant parts of workloads that can be broken up per the rules of dynamic programming, it\u2019s that much less work NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs need to do, and that much faster they can produce results.\nThough unlike Transformer Engines, adding dynamic programming support via the DPX Instructions is not so much about speeding up existing workloads on GPUs as it is enabling new workloads on GPUs. Hopper is the first NVIDIA architecture to support dynamic programming, so workloads that can be resolved with dynamic programming are normally run on CPUs and FPGAs. In that respect, this is NVIDIA finding one more workload they can steal from CPUs and run on a GPU instead.\nOverall, NVIDIA is claiming a 7x improvement in dynamic programming algorithm performance on a single H100 versus na\u00efve execution on an A100.\nAs for the real-world implications of DPX Instructions, NVIDIA is citing route planning, data science, robotics, and biology as all being potential beneficiaries of the new technology. These fields already use several well-known dynamic programming algorithms, such as Smith-Waterman and Flyod-Warshall, which score genetic sequence aligning and find the shortest distances between pairs of destinations respectively.\nOverall, dynamic programming is one of the more niche fields among high performance workloads. But it\u2019s one that NVIDIA believes can be a good fit for GPUs once the right hardware support is available.\nConfidential Computing: Protecting GPU Data From Prying Eyes\nShifting away from performance-focused features, NVIDIA\u2019s other big push with the Hopper architecture is on the security front. With the expansion of GPU usage in cloud computing environments \u2013 and especially shared VM environments \u2013 the company is taking a new focus on the security concerns that entails, and how to secure shared systems.\nThe end result of those efforts is that Hopper is introducing hardware support for trusted execution environments. Specifically, Hopper supports the creation of what NVIDIA is terming a confidential virtual machine, where all of the data within the VM environment is secure, and all of the data entering (and leaving) the environment is encrypted.\nNVIDIA didn\u2019t go over too many of the technical details underpinning their new security features in our-pre-briefing, but according to the company it\u2019s a product of a mix of new hardware and software features. Of particular note, data encryption/decryption when moving to and from the GPU is fast enough to be done at the PCIe line rate (64GB/sec), meaning there\u2019s no slowdown in terms of practical host-to-GPU bandwidth when using this security feature.\nThis trusted execution environment, in turn, is designed to resist all forms of tampering. The memory contents within the GPU itself are secured by what NVIDIA is terming a \u201chardware firewall\u201d, which prevents outside processes from touching them, and this same protection is extended to data in-flight in the SMs as well. The trusted environment is also said to be secured against the OS or the hypervisor accessing the contents of the GPU from above, restricting access to just the owner of the VM. Which is to say that, even with physical access to the GPU, it shouldn\u2019t be possible to access the data within a secure VM on hopper.\nUltimately, NVIDIA\u2019s aim here appears to be making/keeping their customers comfortable using GPUs to process sensitive data by making them much hardware to break into when they\u2019re working in a secured mode. This, in turn, is not only to protect traditionally sensitive data, such as medical data, but also to protect the kind of high-value AI models that some of NVIDIA\u2019s customers are now creating. Given all of the work that can go into creating and training a model, customers don\u2019t want their models getting copied, be it in a shared cloud environment or being pulled out of a physically insecure edge device.\nMulti-Instance GPU v2: Now With Isolation\nAs an extension of NVIDIA\u2019s security efforts with confidential computing, the company has also extended these protections to their Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) environment. MIG instances can now be fully isolated, with I/O between the instance and the host fully virtualized and secured as well, essentially granting MIG instances the same security features as H100 overall. Overall, this moves MIG closer to CPU virtualization environments, where the various VMs assume not to trust each other and are kept isolated.\nNVLink 4: Extending Chip I/O Bandwidth to 900GB/sec\nWith the Hopper architecture also comes a new rendition of NVIDIA\u2019s NVLink high-bandwidth interconnect for wiring up GPUs (and soon, CPUs) together for better performance in workloads that can scale out over multiple GPUs. NVIDIA has iterated on NVLink with every generation of their flagship GPU, and this time is no different, with the introduction of NVLink 4.\nWhile we\u2019re awaiting a full disclosure of technical specifications from NVIDIA, the company has confirmed that NVLink bandwidth on a per-chip basis has been increased from 600GB/second on A100 to 900GB/second for H100. Note that this is the sum total of all upstream and downstream bandwidth across all of the individual links that NVLink supports, so cut these figures in half to get specific transmit/receive rates.\n\n\n\nNVLink Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nNVLink 4\nNVLink 3\nNVLink 2\n\n\nSignaling Rate\n100 Gbps\n50 Gbps\n25 Gbps\n\n\nLanes/Link\n2\n4\n8\n\n\nBandwidth/Direction/Link\n25 GB/sec\n25 GB/sec\n25 GB/sec\n\n\nTotal Bandwidth/Link\n50 GB/sec\n50 GB/sec\n50 GB/sec\n\n\nLinks/Chip\n18\n\t\t\t(GH100)\n12\n\t\t\t(GA100)\n6\n\t\t\t(GV100)\n\n\nBandwidth/Chip\n900 GB/sec\n600 GB/sec\n300 GB/sec\n\n\n\n900GB/sec represents a 50% increase in I/O bandwidth for H100. Which is not as great an increase as H100\u2019s total processing throughput, but a realistic improvement given the ever-escalating complexities in implementing faster networking rates.\nGiven that NVLink 3 was already running at a 50 Gbit/sec signaling rate, it\u2019s not clear if the additional bandwidth is courtesy of an even faster signaling rate, or if NVIDIA has once again adjusted the number of links coming from the GPU. NVIDIA previously altered the NVLink lane configuration for A100, when they halved the lane width and doubled the number of lanes, all while doubling the signaling rate. Adding lanes on top of that means not having to figure out how to improve the signaling rate by even more, but it also means a 50% increase in the number of pins needed for NVLink I/O.\nAlong those lines, it\u2019s also worth noting that NVIDIA is adding PCIe 5.0 support with Hopper. As PCIe is still used for host-to-GPU communications (until Grace is ready, at least), this means NVIDIA has doubled their CPU-GPU bandwidth, letting them keep H100 that much better fed.\u00a0 Though putting PCIe 5.0 to good use is going to require a host CPU with PCIe 5.0 support, which isn\u2019t something AMD or Intel are providing quite yet. Presumably, someone will have hardware ready and shipping by the time NVIDIA ships H100 in Q3, especially since NVIDIA is fond of homogenization for their DGX pre-built servers.\nFinally, with the launch of H100/NVLink 4, NVIDIA is also using this time to announce a new, external NVLink switch. This external switch extends beyond NVIDIA\u2019s current on-board NVSwitch functionality, which is used to help build more complex GPU topologies within a single node, and allows H100 GPUs to directly communicate with each other across multiple nodes. In essence, it\u2019s a replacement for having NVIDIA GPUs go through Infiniband networks in order to communicate cross-node.\n\nThe external NVLInk Switch allows for up to 256 GPUs to be connected together within a single domain, which works out to 32 8-way GPU nodes. According to NVIDIA, a single, 1U NVLink Switch offers 128 lanes of NVLink via 32 Octal SFP (OSFP) transceivers. The full Switch, in turn, offers a total bisection bandwidth of 70.4TB/second.\nIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that the NVLink Switch is not a wholesale replacement for Infiniband \u2013 which of course, NVIDIA also sells through its networking hardware division. Infiniband connections between nodes are still needed for other types of communications (e.g. CPU to CPU), so external NVLink networks are a supplement to Infiniband, allowing H100 GPUs to directly chat amongst themselves.\nNVIDIA HGX Rides Again: HGX For H100\nLast, but not least, NVIDIA has confirmed that they\u2019re updating their HGX baseboard ecosystem for H100 as well. A staple of NVIDIA\u2019s multi-GPU designs since they first began using the SXM form factor for GPUs, HGX baseboards are NVIDIA-produced GPU baseboards for system builders to use in designing complete multi-GPU systems. The HGX boards provide the full connection and mounting environment for NVIDIA\u2019s SXM form factor GPUs, and then sever vendors can route power and PCIe data (among other things) from their motherboards to the HGX baseboard. For the current A100 generation, NVIDIA has been selling 4-way, 8-way, and 16-way designs.\n\nRelative to the GPUs themselves, HGX is rather unexciting. But it\u2019s an important part of NVIDIA\u2019s ecosystem. Server partners can pickup an HGX board and GPUs, and then quickly integrate that into a server design, rather than having to design their own server from scratch. Which in the case of H100, means that status quo will (largely) reign, and that NVIDIA\u2019s server partners will be able to assemble systems in the same manner as before.\nHopper H100 Accelerators: Shipping In Q3 2022\nWrapping things up, NVIDIA is planning on having H100-equipped systems available in Q3 of this year. This will include NVIDIA\u2019s full suite of self-built systems, including DGX and DGX SuperPod servers, as well as servers from OEM partners using HGX baseboards and PCIe cards. Though in typical fashion, NVIDIA is not announcing individual H100 pricing, citing the fact that they sell this hardware through server partners. We\u2019ll have a bit more insight once NVIDIA announces the prices of their own DGX systems, but suffice it to say, don\u2019t expect H100 cards to come cheap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n88 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nbrucethemoose - Tuesday, March 22, 2022 - link\nThose \"Dual Gen 5 CPUs\" in HGX can't be Nvidia Grace-based CPUs, can they?

Second obvious reason is that their customers aren't on RISC-V, and it's a bad move to get too far ahead of your customers. Finally, it runs completely counter to their attempt to buy ARM, which only ended just a couple months ago.Now that the ARM acquisition fell through, perhaps they're a little more circumspect about tying their future prospects to the ARM ISA, but they still can't afford to get ahead of their customers.  For Nvidia, it's going to be x86 and ARM, for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\nRyan Smith - Tuesday, March 22, 2022 - link\nGrace won't be shipping until 2023.

What It Does, and Why It MattersAn in-depth look at the next generation hardware platform for AI.Max Smolaks, Senior EditorMarch 23, 20226 Min ReadNvidiaThis week at GTC 2022, Nvidia launched a broad range of data center products based on the new Hopper architecture.At the center of the range is the H100 \u2013 a hardware accelerator featuring 80 billion transistors and two types of cores, built using the industry-leading 4 nanometer manufacturing process.The H100 is much more than an incremental upgrade: it promises up to 9x faster AI training and up to 30x faster AI inference in popular machine learning models over the previous generation\u2019s A100, released just two years ago. This represents an IT foundation that could help make artificial intelligence applications truly mainstream.Much of the speedup is down to the new Transformer Engine, designed to accelerate specific machine learning tech originally developed at Google, and now used to create the world\u2019s largest and most complex ML models.\u201cOf course, we are going to get more transistors, and it's going to be faster. But when we look at function-specific optimizations, we asked, what would really make a difference to our customers and to where the industry was going? And that's where the Tensor core support for Transformer really comes to life,\u201d Charlie Boyle, VP and GM of DGX Systems at Nvidia, told Data Center Knowledge.Meanwhile, Nvidia\u2019s advancements on the server side enable any business (with deep enough pockets) to achieve supercomputer-class performance with off-the-shelf parts, using the new DGX H100 servers.Related:For Its Next Trick, Nvidia Is Doing Software-Defined StorageYet another exciting announcement is the expansion of the proprietary NVLink interconnect, which is now able to link together individual server nodes, enabling the creation of what the company describes as a \u201cdata center-sized GPU.\u201dThe age of the acceleratorThe Hopper architecture is named after Rear Admiral Grace Hopper, who worked on some of the first general-purpose computers and was responsible for major advances in programming languages.The most basic building block of Nvidia\u2019s Hopper ecosystem is the H100 \u2013 the ninth generation of Nvidia\u2019s data center GPU.The device is equipped with more Tensor and CUDA cores, and at higher clock speeds, than the A100. There\u2019s 50MB of Level 2 cache and 80GB of familiar HBM3 memory, but at twice the bandwidth of the predecessor \u2013 reaching 3 TB/sec.Then, there are the new DPX instructions that most customers won\u2019t care about, but which can be used to considerably speed up dynamic programming algorithms in fields like healthcare, robotics, quantum computing, and data science.By tradition, Nvidia still calls the H100 a graphics processing unit, but the term is clearly on its last legs: just two out of the 50+ texture processing clusters (TPCs) in the device are actually cable of running vertex, geometry, and pixel shader maths required to render 3D graphics.In terms of GPU virtualization, every H100 can be carved into up to seven isolated instances with a \u2018shared nothing\u2019 approach, making this the first multi-instance GPU with native support for Confidential Computing \u2013 i.e. able to protect data in use, and not just during storage or transfer.The DGX H100 serverThe newly-announced DGX H100 is Nvidia\u2019s fourth generation AI-focused server system. The 4U box packs eight H100 GPUs connected through NVLink (more on that below), along with two CPUs, and two Nvidia BlueField DPUs \u2013 essentially SmartNICs equipped with specialized processing capacity.If you combine nine DGX H100 systems together in a single rack, along with some third-party storage and networking equipment, you\u2019ll get a DGX POD: a reference design that can be used to deliver AI-based services at scale.The DGX SuperPOD takes this a step further: it links together 32 DGX systems and 256 H100 GPUs to deliver one Exaflops of AI performance with FP8 precision \u2013 a number that was reserved for the world\u2019s fastest machines just a few years ago.Nvidia itself will combine 18 SuperPODs, or 4,608 H100 GPUs, to build Eos, which is expected to become the world\u2019s fastest AI supercomputer when it is switched on later this year.The importance of NVLink for these systems cannot be understated: originally designed to connect several GPUs together while bypassing the relatively slow and bulky PCIe slot, the interface has evolved into a versatile tool for chip-to-chip connectivity.A single H100 supports up to 18 fourth generation NVLink connections (cards based on Pascal and Volta architectures had six) for a total bandwidth of 900 GB/s \u2013 about seven times more than what is possible with PCIe Gen 5.The most recent iteration of NVLink can deliver this level of bandwidth between up to 256 GPUs, or 32 DGX H100 systems, thanks to the addition of a dedicated chip called NVSwitch.\u201cThis effort has been going on for a number of years, to optimally work NVLink inside the box, as well as outside the box,\u201d Boyle told Data Center Knowledge.\u201cWhen you think about it, that\u2019s 32 servers, and they're all running their own OS, they're all running their own stack. And you have to coordinate between all of them to run a single job. And that's a fairly big computer science problem. How do I ensure the back-end communication is working, and synchronized correctly, when the actual system may be doing something else?\u201dAt GTC, the company announced that NVlink would be now considered default for all future Nvidia chips \u2013 including CPUs, GPUs, DPUs and SOCs. And yes, Nvidia is set to release a Hopper family CPU called Grace next year, based on Arm cores.The company also said it would share NVLink specifications with the customer and partner ecosystem, enabling them to build compatible silicon products.It is important to note that Nvidia is not trying to replace the popular InfiniBand interconnect, widely used in HPC \u2013 the Hopper architecture leverages both, and there are eight InfiniBand networking adapters in every DGX H100.\u201cThere are some operations that are best done on the InfiniBand fabric that all the programmers know how to use. And then there are certain high-speed operations that you want to reserve for the NVLink part,\u201d Boyle said.Hot and botheredFor server manufacturing partners, the H100 comes with new and unusual design constraints. The board consumes much more power, and produces more heat than its predecessors\u2014it might have higher performance per watt, but the H100 is rated at a sweltering 700W TDP, while the A100 would max out at 400-450W.On the upside, data centers physically able to power and cool these things are easy to identify thanks to \u2018DGX-Ready\u2019 badge introduced in 2019.\u201cThe power is going up, but that's not necessarily a bad thing,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cBecause what we try to optimize for is total work done.\u201cAnd yes, I deal with customers who are power-limited in places, even with current-generation [hardware], which is why we have a great program called \u2018DGX-ready\u2019 where we pre-qualify colocation partners around the world.\u201cFor the most part, if customers are buying a couple of systems, they can always find a place to put them in their data center. Yes, they take up a little more power than the average server, but you can always find a place. But when you're talking about building an AI center of excellence, you're talking about putting in 40 to a few hundred of these things, almost nobody \u2013 including us at Nvidia \u2013 just has that data center lying around.\u201cAnd that's why we've got a great partner network around the world, so no matter where you are, we've got a bit at least one, if not multiple data center partners in your area, so that you can quickly get online.\u201cAnd we do that with a lot of our customers who are looking at our larger configurations; we'll work with them on data center airflow analysis, the cooling analysis.\u201dThe Nvidia H100 GPU and DGX H100 servers are expected to appear on sale in the third quarter of 2022.About the AuthorMax SmolaksSenior Editor, InformaMax Smolaks is senior editor at Data Center Knowledge, a leading online publication dedicated to the data center industry.

Greg Corke looks at how the RTX A4500 stacks up in real-time viz, GPU rendering and VR workflows\n\nWhen Nvidia launched the 20 GB Nvidia RTX A4500 professional workstation GPU in November 2021, it took us a bit by surprise. We didn\u2019t really see a need for a product to sit between the RTX A4000 (16 GB) and RTX A5000\u00a0 (24 GB). The gap simply wasn\u2019t that big.\nBut these are no ordinary times. The ongoing global semiconductor shortage has meant supply of the RTX A4000 and RTX A5000 has been patchy to say the least. Since these \u2018Ampere\u2019 GPUs launched in Spring 2021 they have been very hard to get hold of. And some of the inflated prices we have seen online have been quite eye watering.\nThe Nvidia RTX A4500 is a cut down version of the RTX A5000. Its launch appears to have been driven largely by the silicon and components that Nvidia had at its disposal. In fact, this week at Nvidia\u2019s GTC event, the company launched another new GPU, the Nvidia RTX A5500, a cut down version of the RTX A6000.\nNvidia told AEC Magazine that the A5500 not only gives customers a bit of a performance boost over the A5000, but improves the \u2018overall availability of supply\u2019. The company admits that it would have been limited if it was only producing the RTX A5000 all year long.\nWhat is the Nvidia RTX A4500?\nWith a dual slot PCIe form factor, the Nvidia RTX A4500 looks identical to the Nvidia RTX A5000 and it is much closer in specs than it is to the single slot Nvidia RTX A4000.\nCompared to the RTX A5000, it has 4 GB less memory, but features the same GA102 graphics processor, albeit with some cores disabled, a slightly lower clock speed and a slightly lower power draw (200 Watts vs 230 Watts via a single 8-pin PCIe power connector).\nThe feature set of the RTX A4500 and A5000 is virtually identical \u2013 four DisplayPort 1.4a connectors, 3D stereo, and NVLink \u2014 so two A4500 GPUs can be physically connected to scale performance and double the memory to 40 GB in supported applications. This could be to boost 3D frame rates in pro viz applications like Autodesk VRED Professional, or to render large scenes, faster in GPU renderers like Chaos V-Ray.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nThe one main difference between the GPUs is that the RTX A4500 does not support Nvidia virtual GPU (vGPU) software. So, if you want to virtualise the graphics card to serve multiple users in a virtual workstation, you\u2019ll need the RTX A5000, A5500 or A6000.\n\u00a0\n\nOn test\nWe put the RTX A4500 through a series of real-world application benchmarks, for GPU rendering and real-time visualisation.\nAll tests were carried out using the Intel Core i9-12900K-based Scan 3XS GWP-ME A124C workstation at 4K (3,840 x 2,160) resolution using the latest 511.09 Nvidia driver.\nA summary of the specs can be seen below. You can read our full review of the workstation here.\n\nIntel Core i9 12900K CPU\n128 GB memory\n2 TB Samsung 980 Pro NVMe SSD\nMicrosoft Windows 11 Pro 64-bit\n\nFor comparison we tested an Nvidia RTX A4000 GPU in the same workstation. We did not have an Nvidia RTX A5000 in our possession, so took results from our June 2021 review. Back then our test machine was different, a Scan 3XS GWP-ME A132R with an AMD Ryzen 5950X CPU, running Windows 10 Professional.\nWith the AMD Ryzen 5950X having a different architecture and lower Instructions Per Clock (IPC), and the workstation running a different OS, there\u2019s a hint of comparing apples and pears here. However, the results should still give a pretty good indication of relative performance.\nOne might expect the AMD CPU to bring down scores slightly in some of our real-time 3D tests. However, as most of these benchmarks are very GPU limited, rather than CPU limited, we wouldn\u2019t expect the CPU to influence the results that much.\nIn our GPU rendering tests, as the role of the CPU is minimal, the comparison should be more precise.\nReal-time performance\nThere wasn\u2019t a huge performance difference between the RTX A4500 and A5000 in our real time 3D tests. With our automotive test model in Autodesk VRED Professional, for example, the A5000 was between 1.75% and 3.10% faster than the A4500, depending on the level of anti-aliasing applied.\nWe experienced similar in arch viz tool Enscape with a difference of 2.85% when testing our large office scene\nThe RTX A5000 pulled ahead more in Unreal Engine, especially when real time ray tracing was enabled on the Audi automotive model.\nThe gap between the RTX A4000 and A4500 was much bigger. This isn\u2019t entirely surprising, as the RTX A4000 is a single slot card, draws up to 140 W of power and features the lower spec GA104 processor. The RTX A4500 was around 20-25% faster than the A4000 across the board.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU rendering\nIn our GPU rendering benchmarks, the lead of the RTX A5000 over the RTX A4500 was much bigger.\nIn the Chaos V-Ray RTX benchmark, for example, it was 9.5% faster, rising to 26% in KeyShot 10. This may be because these benchmarks use all three types of processing cores \u2013 CUDA, Tensor and RT (see box out below).\nThe RTX A4500 was consistently faster than the RTX A4000, between 20% and 26% in most of our tests.\nYou can read more about our testing process in our June 2021 review of the Nvidia RTX A4000 and RTX A5000.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIt\u2019s a very interesting time for professional workstation GPUs, and GPUs in general. While you might have your eye on a specific model in terms of features and price/performance, what you end up buying might be dictated more by what\u2019s available in the channel. UK workstation manufacturer Scan, for example, currently has a \u2018significant quantity\u2019 of RTX A4500s available for workstation builds, while the RTX A5000 remains in short supply.\nThe introduction of the RTX A4500 (and, this week, the RTX A5500) certainly gives customers options. If you\u2019re looking for a powerful viz focused GPU with lots of memory, then the RTX A4500 and RTX A5000 both pack a real punch. The price differential isn\u2019t huge. And, with a little bit of luck, you may find one that fits your budget and workflows precisely.\n\nWhat are Nvidia RTX GPUs?\nNvidia RTX GPUs are professional graphics cards designed specifically for workstations. They are standard in most HP Z, Dell Precision, Fujitsu Celsius and Lenovo ThinkStation workstations, and are also offered in workstations from smaller manufacturers such as BOXX, Scan and Workstation Specialists.\nNvidia RTX GPUs tend to have more memory than their consumer \u2018GeForce RTX\u2019 counterparts, so they can handle larger datasets, both in terms of geometry and textures. In the higher-end models this is Error Correcting Code (ECC) memory to protect against crashes.\nThere\u2019s also a difference in software. With special drivers, Nvidia RTX GPUs are certified for a range of professional applications and are tested by independent software vendors (ISVs) and the major workstation manufacturers.\n\nNvidia RTX GPUs feature three types of processing cores:\n\nNvidia \u2018Ampere\u2019 CUDA cores for general purpose processing.\n3rd Gen Nvidia Tensor cores for AI and Machine Learning.\n2nd Gen Nvidia RT cores which are dedicated to ray tracing.\n\nDifferent applications support these cores in different ways. Most CAD and BIM applications, for example, simply use the CUDA cores for rasterisation, to turn vector data into pixels (a raster image).\nOn the other hand, an increasing number of visualisation tools can use all three types of cores. Real time arch viz software Enscape, for example, can use CUDA for rasterisation, RT cores to accelerate ray tracing calculations and Tensor cores for Nvidia Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS).\nDLSS allows scenes to be rendered in real time at lower resolutions and then deep learning-based upscaling techniques are used to output \u2018a clean and sharp high-resolution image\u2019. The aim is to boost 3D performance or cut render times.\nOther applications that can be accelerated by Nvidia\u2019s RT and Tensor cores include Chaos V-Ray, Chaos Vantage, Solidworks Visualize, Luxion KeyShot, Unity, Nvidia Omniverse, Unreal Engine, Autodesk VRED and others.\nRelated articles:REVIEW: HP ZBook StudioReview: Dell Precision 7540 [Nvidia Quadro RTX 5000]Twinmotion 2025.1 adds realism to exterior scenesReview: CL3VER 3DPreview: HP Reverb VR Headset Professional EditionREVIEW: Dell Precision M3800Cloud workstations for AutoCAD, PTC Creo and beyondAMD Radeon ProRender for Rhino\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPrevious Post \n\nNext Post \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStay informed\nJoin the AEC community\nNewsletter \u2022 FREE digital magazine \u2022 print magazine\nGo\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLatest content \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAI and the future of arch viz\n\nFebruary 21, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWorkstation Special Report \u2013 Winter 2025\n\nFebruary 9, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMotif to take on Revit: exclusive interview\n\nFebruary 7, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAllplan acquires Manufacton to boost offsite\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nD5 Render 2.10 introduces real-time path tracing\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \u00a9 2008 - 2024 X3DMedia\r\n19 Leyden Street, London, E1 7LE, UK\r\nTel: +44(0)20 3355 7310                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Cookie Consent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.

Thanks to the cloud, organizations can now collect data at an unprecedented scale and use it to train complex models and generate insights.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile this increasing demand for data has unlocked new possibilities, it also raises concerns about privacy and security, especially in regulated industries such as government, finance, and healthcare. One area where data privacy is crucial is patient records, which are used to train models to aid clinicians in diagnosis. Another example is in banking, where models that evaluate borrower creditworthiness are built from increasingly rich datasets, such as bank statements, tax returns, and even social media profiles. This data contains very personal information, and to ensure that it\u2019s kept private, governments and regulatory bodies are implementing strong privacy laws and regulations to govern the use and sharing of data for AI, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (opens in new tab) (GDPR) and the proposed EU AI Act (opens in new tab). You can learn more about some of the industries where it\u2019s imperative to protect sensitive data in this Microsoft Azure Blog post (opens in new tab).\nCommitment to a confidential cloud\n\n\n\nPublication\n\n\t\t\t\tOblivious Multi-Party Machine Learning on Trusted Processors\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft recognizes that trustworthy AI requires a trustworthy cloud\u2014one in which security, privacy, and transparency are built into its core. A key component of this vision is confidential computing (opens in new tab)\u2014a set of hardware and software capabilities that give data owners technical and verifiable control over how their data is shared and used. Confidential computing relies on a new hardware abstraction called trusted execution environments (TEEs). In TEEs, data remains encrypted not just at rest or during transit, but also during use. TEEs also support remote attestation, which enables data owners to remotely verify the configuration of the hardware and firmware supporting a TEE and grant specific algorithms access to their data.\u00a0\u00a0\nAt Microsoft, we are committed to providing a confidential cloud (opens in new tab), where confidential computing is the default for all cloud services. Today, Azure offers a rich confidential computing platform comprising different kinds of confidential computing hardware (Intel SGX, AMD SEV-SNP), core confidential computing services like Azure Attestation (opens in new tab) and Azure Key Vault managed HSM, (opens in new tab) and application-level services such as Azure SQL Always Encrypted (opens in new tab), Azure confidential ledger (opens in new tab), and confidential containers on Azure (opens in new tab). However, these offerings are limited to using CPUs. This poses a challenge for AI workloads, which rely heavily on AI accelerators like GPUs to provide the performance needed to process large amounts of data and train complex models.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nPublication\n\n\t\t\t\tGraviton: Trusted Execution Environments on GPUs\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe Confidential Computing (opens in new tab) group at Microsoft Research identified this problem and defined a vision for confidential AI (opens in new tab) powered by confidential GPUs, proposed in two papers, \u201cOblivious Multi-Party Machine Learning on Trusted Processors (opens in new tab)\u201d and \u201cGraviton: Trusted Execution Environments on GPUs (opens in new tab).\u201d In this post, we share this vision. We also take a deep dive into the NVIDIA GPU technology that\u2019s helping us realize this vision, and we discuss the collaboration among NVIDIA, Microsoft Research, and Azure that enabled NVIDIA GPUs to become a part of the Azure confidential computing (opens in new tab) ecosystem.\n\n\nSpotlight: AI-POWERED EXPERIENCE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft research copilot experience\nDiscover more about research at Microsoft through our AI-powered experience\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStart now\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nOpens in a new tab \nVision for confidential GPUs\nToday, CPUs from companies like Intel and AMD allow the creation of TEEs, which can isolate a process or an entire guest virtual machine (VM), effectively eliminating the host operating system and the hypervisor from the trust boundary. Our vision is to extend this trust boundary to GPUs, allowing code running in the CPU TEE to securely offload computation and data to GPUs.\u00a0\u00a0\nFigure 1: Vision for confidential computing with NVIDIA GPUs.\nUnfortunately, extending the trust boundary is not straightforward. On the one hand, we must protect against a variety of attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks where the attacker can observe or tamper with traffic on the PCIe bus or on a NVIDIA NVLink (opens in new tab) connecting multiple GPUs, as well as impersonation attacks, where the host assigns an incorrectly configured GPU, a GPU running older versions or malicious firmware, or one without confidential computing support for the guest VM. At the same time, we must ensure that the Azure host operating system has enough control over the GPU to perform administrative tasks. Furthermore, the added protection must not introduce large performance overheads, increase thermal design power, or require significant changes to the GPU microarchitecture.\u00a0\u00a0\nOur research shows that this vision can be realized by extending the GPU with the following capabilities:\nA new mode where all sensitive state on the GPU, including GPU memory, is isolated from the hostA hardware root-of-trust on the GPU chip that can generate verifiable attestations capturing all security sensitive state of the GPU, including all firmware and microcode\u00a0Extensions to the GPU driver to verify GPU attestations, set up a secure communication channel with the GPU, and transparently encrypt all communications between the CPU and GPU\u00a0Hardware support to transparently encrypt all GPU-GPU communications over NVLink\u00a0\u00a0Support in the guest operating system and hypervisor to securely attach GPUs to a CPU TEE, even if the contents of the CPU TEE are encrypted\nConfidential computing with NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs\nNVIDIA and Azure have taken a significant step toward realizing this vision with a new feature called Ampere Protected Memory (APM) in the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. In this section, we describe how APM supports confidential computing within the A100 GPU to achieve end-to-end data confidentiality.\u00a0\u00a0\nAPM introduces a new confidential mode of execution in the A100 GPU. When the GPU is initialized in this mode, the GPU designates a region in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) as protected and helps prevent leaks through memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) access into this region from the host and peer GPUs. Only authenticated and encrypted traffic is permitted to and from the region.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn confidential mode, the GPU can be paired with any external entity, such as a TEE on the host CPU. To enable this pairing, the GPU includes a hardware root-of-trust (HRoT). NVIDIA provisions the HRoT with a unique identity and a corresponding certificate created during manufacturing. The HRoT also implements authenticated and measured boot by measuring the firmware of the GPU as well as that of other microcontrollers on the GPU, including a security microcontroller called SEC2. SEC2, in turn, can generate attestation reports that include these measurements and that are signed by a fresh attestation key, which is endorsed by the unique device key. These reports can be used by any external entity to verify that the GPU is in confidential mode and running last known good firmware.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen the NVIDIA GPU driver in the CPU TEE loads, it checks whether the GPU is in confidential mode. If so, the driver requests an attestation report and checks that the GPU is a genuine NVIDIA GPU running known good firmware. Once confirmed, the driver establishes a secure channel with the SEC2 microcontroller on the GPU using the Security Protocol and Data Model (SPDM)-backed Diffie-Hellman-based key exchange protocol to establish a fresh session key. When that exchange completes, both the GPU driver and SEC2 hold the same symmetric session key.\u202f\u00a0\nThe GPU driver uses the shared session key to encrypt all subsequent data transfers to and from the GPU. Because pages allocated to the CPU TEE are encrypted in memory and not readable by the GPU DMA engines, the GPU driver allocates pages outside the CPU TEE and writes encrypted data to those pages. On the GPU side, the SEC2 microcontroller is responsible for decrypting the encrypted data transferred from the CPU and copying it to the protected region. Once the data is in high bandwidth memory (HBM) in cleartext, the GPU kernels can freely use it for computation.\nFigure 2: The GPU driver on the host CPU and the SEC2 microcontroller on the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU work together to achieve end-to-end encryption of data transfers.\nAccelerating innovation with confidential AI\n\n\n\nBlog\n\n\t\t\t\tAzure confidential computing with NVIDIA GPUs for trustworthy AI\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe implementation of APM is an important milestone toward achieving broader adoption of confidential AI in the cloud and beyond. APM is the foundational building block of Azure Confidential GPU VMs (opens in new tab), now in private preview (opens in new tab). These VMs, designed in collaboration with NVIDIA, Azure, and Microsoft Research, feature up to four A100 GPUs with 80 GB of HBM and APM technology and enable users to host AI workloads on Azure with a new level of security.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut this is just the beginning. We look forward to taking our collaboration with NVIDIA to the next level with NVIDIA\u2019s Hopper architecture, which will enable customers to protect both the confidentiality and integrity of data and AI models in use. We believe that confidential GPUs can enable a confidential AI platform where multiple organizations can collaborate to train and deploy AI models by pooling together sensitive datasets while remaining in full control of their data and models. Such a platform can unlock the value of large amounts of data while preserving data privacy, giving organizations the opportunity to drive innovation.\u00a0\u00a0\nA real-world example involves Bosch Research (opens in new tab), the research and advanced engineering division of Bosch (opens in new tab), which is developing an AI pipeline to train models for autonomous driving. Much of the data it uses includes personal identifiable information (PII), such as license plate numbers and people\u2019s faces. At the same time, it must comply with GDPR, which requires a legal basis for processing PII, namely, consent from data subjects or legitimate interest. The former is challenging because it is practically impossible to get consent from pedestrians and drivers recorded by test cars. Relying on legitimate interest is challenging too because, among other things, it requires showing that there is a no less privacy-intrusive way of achieving the same result. This is where confidential AI shines: Using confidential computing can help reduce risks for data subjects and data controllers by limiting exposure of data (for example, to specific algorithms), while enabling organizations to train more accurate models.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAt Microsoft Research, we are committed to working with the confidential computing ecosystem, including collaborators like NVIDIA and Bosch Research, to further strengthen security, enable seamless training and deployment of confidential AI models, and help power the next generation of technology.\nAbout confidential computing at Microsoft Research\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Confidential Computing team at Microsoft Research Cambridge conducts pioneering research in system design that aims to guarantee strong security and privacy properties to cloud users. We tackle problems around secure hardware design, cryptographic and security protocols, side channel resilience, and memory safety.

Powered by GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX GPUs, they dramatically accelerate 3D creative workflows.\nNew Omniverse Connections are expanding the ecosystem and are now available in beta: Unreal Engine 5 Omniverse Connector and the Adobe Substance 3D Material Extension, with the Adobe Substance 3D Painter Omniverse Connector very close behind.\nMaxon\u2019s Cinema 4D now has Universal Scene Description (USD) support. Unlocking Cinema 4D workflows via OmniDrive brings deeper integration and flexibility to the Omniverse ecosystem.\nLeveraging the hydra render delegate feature, artists can now use Pixar HDStorm, Chaos V-Ray, Maxon Redshift and OTOY Octane Hydra render delegates within the viewport of all Omniverse apps, with Blender Cycles coming soon.\nWhether refining 3D scenes or exporting final projects, artists can switch between the lightning-fast Omniverse RTX Renderer or their preferred renderer, giving them ultimate freedom to create however they like.\nThe Junk Shop by Alex Trevi\u00f1o. Original Concept by Ana\u00efs Maamar. Note Hydra render delegates displayed in the renderer toggle menu.\nThese updates and more are available today in the Omniverse launcher, free to download, alongside the March NVIDIA Studio Driver release.\nTo celebrate the Machinima app update, we\u2019re kicking off the #MadeInMachinima contest, in which artists can remix iconic characters from Squad, Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord and Mechwarrior 5 into a cinematic short in Omniverse Machinima to win NVIDIA Studio laptops. The contest runs through June 27. Visit the contest landing page for details.\nCan\u2019t Wait to Create\nOmniverse Create allows users to interactively assemble full-fidelity scenes by connecting to their favorite creative apps. Artists can add lighting, simulate physically accurate scenes and choose to render with Omniverse\u2019s advanced RTX Renderer, or their favorite Hydra Render delegate.\nCreate version 2022.1 includes USD support for NURBS curves, a type of curve modeling useful for hair, particles and more. Scenes can now be rendered in passes with arbitrary output variables, or AOVs, delivering more control to artists during the compositing stage.\nAnimation curve editing is now possible with the addition of a graph editor. The feature helps animators feel comfortable working in creative apps such as Autodesk Maya and Blender. They can iterate simpler, faster and more intuitively.\nThe new ActionGraph feature unlocks keyboard shortcuts and user-interface buttons to trigger complex events simultaneously.\nApply different colors and textures with ease in Omniverse Create.\nNVIDIA PhysX 5.0 updates provide soft and deformable body support for objects such as fabric, jelly and balloons, adding further realism to scenes with no animation necessary.\nVMaterials 2.0, a curated collection of MDL materials and lights, now has over 900 physical materials for artists to apply physically accurate, real-world materials to their scenes with just a double click, no shader writing necessary.\nSeveral new Create features are also available in beta:\n\nAnimGraph based on OmniGraph brings characters to life with a new graph editor for simple, no-code, realistic animations.\nNew animation retargeting allows artists to map animations from one character to another, automating complex animation tasks such as joint mapping, reference post matching and previewing. When used with AnimGraph, artists can automate character rigging, saving artists countless hours of manual, tedious work.\nUsers can drag and drop assets they own, or click on others to purchase directly from the asset\u2019s product page. Nearly 1 million assets from TurboSquid by Shutterstock, Sketchfab and Reallusion ActorCore are directly searchable in the Omniverse asset browser.\n\n\nThis otherworldly set of features is Create-ing infectious excitement for 3D workflows.\nMachinima Magic\nOmniverse Machinima 2022.1 beta provides tools for artists to remix, recreate and redefine animated video game storytelling through immersive visualization, collaborative design and photorealistic rendering.\nThe integration of NVIDIA Maxine\u2019s body pose estimation feature gives users the ability to track and capture motion in real time using a single camera \u2014 without requiring a MoCap suit \u2014 with live conversion from a 2D camera capture to a 3D model.\nPrerecorded videos can now be converted to animations with a new easy-to-use interface.\nThe retargeting feature applies these captured animations to custom-built skeletons, providing an easy way to animate a character with a webcam. No fancy, expensive device necessary, just a webcam.\nSequencer functionality updates include a new user interface for easier navigation; new tools including splitting, looping, hold and scale; more drag-and-drop functionality to simplify pipelines; and a new audio graph display.\nStitching and building cinematics is now as intuitive as editing video projects.\nStep Into the Showroom\nOmniverse Showroom 2022.1 includes seven new scenes that invite the newest of users to get started and embrace the incredible possibilities and technology within the platform.\nArtists can engage with tech demos showcasing PhysX, rigid and soft body dynamics, flow, combustible fluid, smoke and fire, and blast, featuring destruction and fractures.\nEnjoy the View\nOmniverse View 2022.1 will enable non-technical project reviewers to collaboratively and interactively review 3D design projects in stunning photorealism, with several astonishing new features.\nMarkup gives artists the ability to add 2D feedback based on their viewpoint, including shapes and scribbles, for 3D feedback in the cloud.\nTurntable places an interactive scene on a virtual table that can be rotated to see how realistic lighting conditions affect the scene in real time, advantageous for high-end movie production and architects.\nTeleport and Waypoints allow artists to easily jump around their scenes and preset fully interactive views of Omniverse scenes for sharing.\n\nOmniverse Ecosystem Expansion Continues\nNew beta Omniverse Connectors and extensions add variety and versatility to 3D creative workflows.\nNow available, an Omniverse Connector for Unreal Engine 5 allows live-sync workflows.\nThe Adobe Substance 3D Material extension is now available, with a beta Substance 3D Painter Omniverse Connector coming soon, enabling artists to achieve more seamless, live-sync texture and material workflows.\nMaxon\u2019s Cinema4D now supports USD and is compatible with OmniDrive, unlocking Omniverse workflows for visualization specialists.\nFinally, a new CAD importer enables product designers to convert 26 popular CAD formats into Omniverse USD scenes.\n\nMore Machinima Magic \u2014 With Prizes\nThe #MadeInMachinima contest asks participants to build scenes and assets \u2014 composed of characters from Squad, Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord and Mechwarrior 5 \u2014 using Omniverse Machinima.\n\nLegendary Halo Red vs. Blue Studio, Rooster Teeth, produced this magnificent cinematic short in Machinima. Take a look to see what\u2019s possible.\n\nMachinima expertise, while welcome, is not required; this contest is for creators of all levels. Three talented winners will get an NVIDIA Studio laptop, powerful and purpose-built with vivid color displays and blazing-fast memory and storage, to boost future Omniverse sessions.\nMachinima will be prominently featured at the Game Developers Conference, where game artists, producers, developers and designers come together to exchange ideas, educate and inspire. At the show, we also launched Omniverse for Developers, providing a more collaborative environment for the creation of virtual worlds.\nNVIDIA offers sessions at GDC to assist content creators featuring virtual worlds and AI, real-time ray tracing, and developer tools.

Al and machine learning bring many benefits to manufacturing use cases, including:\u00a0\n\nProduct research, development and production\u00a0\nInventory management\u00a0\nProcess and quality control\u00a0\nPredictive maintenance\u00a0\n\nLeading companies are already integrating advanced AI solutions into their workflows. For example, Foxconn Group has implemented AI for automated high-precision inspection of its products\u2019 components and tools using NVIDIA software libraries and the NVIDIA EGX platform for accelerated computing. \u00a0\nA recent survey conducted by Peerless Research Group, including responses from over 300 product designers, engineers, researchers and other professionals in aerospace, automotive and industrial machinery, has identified Al and simulation as the two key technologies that will have the biggest impact on product design and development over the next five years. \u00a0\nEnhanced Workflows for Design and Engineering\u00a0\nWhen it comes to applying AI in product development, generative design is a common use case, as the organic shapes generated by computer-aided design and engineering tools with this capability are striking compared to conventional designs. \u00a0\nImage courtesy of ANSYS.\nThe use of AI and machine learning in CAE is increasing, allowing engineers and analysts to:\u00a0\n\nGain near-real-time insights for design exploration \u2013 similar to how ANSYS Discovery, with its NVDIA CUDA-based GPU-accelerated solver, has reduced simulation time from days to minutes.\u00a0\nBetter manage time-consuming simulation tasks such as geometry preparation, meshing, management of the result data and identification of trends and anomalies in the vast amount of post-processing data.\u00a0\nUse data from previous simulations to train machine learning models to narrow the design space and identify the key design parameters. \u00a0\n\nMonolith AI, a member of the NVIDIA Inception program designed to support the global startup ecosystem, has helped manufacturing companies optimize research and development processes by reducing the numbers of simulations, tests and prototypes. This enables companies to deliver faster and better products by applying machine learning to data generated during the engineering design process.\u00a0\u00a0\nA New AI Framework for Physics\u00a0\nThe need for physics-driven AI models is growing fast \u2013 especially in industries like energy, climate science and life sciences. With a framework like NVIDIA Modulus, manufacturers and design engineers can create physics-driven AI models and unleash new capabilities in industrial simulation. \u00a0\nNVIDIA Modulus is a neural network framework that blends the power of physics and partial differential equations with AI to build more robust models for better analysis. Modulus trains neural networks to learn from data and use the laws of physics to model the behavior of complex systems. The surrogate model can then be used in various applications, from industrial use cases to climate science. Once a model is trained, Modulus can do the inference in near real time or interactively.\u00a0\nNVIDIA Modulus.\nWith Modulus, professionals in manufacturing and product development can explore different configurations and scenarios of a model by changing its parameters, allowing them to gain deeper insights about the system or product.\u00a0\u00a0\nDigital Twins That Go Beyond Simulations\u00a0\nDigital twin technology is also increasingly being adopted across manufacturing and product development. Using NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise, a virtual world simulation and collaboration platform for 3D workflows, designers and engineers can develop and operate physically accurate digital twins that support a wide range of AI-enabled use cases.\u00a0\nWith AI and digital twins, companies can better predict and optimize operational performance, resulting in faster production times, enhanced efficiency and improved products or processes.\u00a0\nExplore AI Further at GTC\u00a0\nHear from NVIDIA partners and customers to get insights on how they\u2019re using AI in manufacturing workflows. Featured GTC sessions include:\u00a0\n\nUsing AI in Engineering Simulation [S41563] \u00a0\nNew Era of Digital Twins With Omniverse [SE2644] \u00a0\nGet Started With AI for Engineering Simulations Using NVIDIA Modulus on Rescale Platform [S42087]\nBreakout Session: Building Industrial Digital Twins on Omniverse\u00a0[SE2311]\u00a0\nToward a Synchronized Manufacturing Digital Twin: NVIDIA Omniverse Has the Building Blocks [S41632]\u00a0\nA Vision of the Metaverse: How Will We Build Connected Virtual Worlds [S42114]\u00a0\n\nCheck out additional manufacturing and product development sessions at GTC.

To do so, the studio worked across multiple locations with remote artists using virtual workstations powered by NVIDIA RTX.\nDNEG was the first studio to implement NVIDIA virtual GPU software at scale. Now, DNEG continues its pioneering efforts with NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise as the studio looks to the future of connected, collaborative workflows.\n\u201cEvery show we get is different from the last, and NVIDIA RTX with vGPU lets us scale the memory and performance characteristics up or down to meet the needs of our artists,\u201d said Daire Byrne, global head of systems at DNEG.\nAll images courtesy of DNEG.\nExhilarating Visuals Go Beyond for Bond\nDNEG secured a second Academy Award nomination with the latest James Bond installment, No Time to Die. This is the first Bond film to receive a VFX Oscar nomination since 1979\u2019s Moonraker.\nTo create the film\u2019s action-packed scenes, explosions and massive environments, DNEG delivered over 500 VFX shots. Its team used detailed references and scans to help design everything \u2014 from a glider and a sinking ship, to the island headquarters and thrilling car chases.\nBreaking Out of Virtual and Parallel Universes\nThree-time Oscar-winning studio Digital Domain received two VFX nominations this year for Free Guy and Spider-Man: No Way Home.\nIts team created almost 350 VFX shots for Free Guy, for assets like digital doubles to entire computer graphics-based cities. Free Guy is also one of the first feature films that used Digital Domain\u2019s face-swapping tool, Charlatan.\nCharlatan replaces the face of a character with a hand-created facial model, and then combines it with the original performance using AI. This provides much more realistic results when working with digital doubles. Digital Domain also helped build the visuals for \u201cFree City,\u201d the game environment where the film takes place.\nFor Spider-Man: No Way Home, Digital Domain digitally recreated 2.5 square miles of New York City, one of the biggest computer graphics environments the studio has ever built.\nA dramatic fight sequence \u2014 which shows the web-slinging hero battling the villainous Doc Ock and his mechanical arms \u2014 takes place on a bridge, with visuals and computer graphics elements that include various people, vehicles and weather conditions.\nDigital Domain also used a digital double for Doc Ock, a character that actor Alfred Molina first played 18 years ago in the film Spider-Man 2.\nMarvelous Characters Clash on Big Screen\nAnother one of Disney\u2019s most recent Marvel films, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, showcased magical visuals from creative studio Weta Digital.\nWeta worked on 300 shots and VFX sequences that included an epic dragon battle, realistic water simulations and the magical rings themselves. One of Weta\u2019s challenges was to create the breathtaking sequences with the Great Protector, a wingless dragon, and the Dweller-in-Darkness, a creature made up of 128 million polygons.\nWeta created custom rigs to deliver performances that emphasized the massive scale and weight of each creature. The team also developed a new AI system to assist with facial performances on the digital double of Shang-Chi\u2019s father and main antagonist, Xu Wenwu.\nExplore More VFX and Virtual Productions at GTC\nWhile only one team will accept the award for Best Visual Effects, millions of artists create stunning visuals and cinematics with NVIDIA RTX technology.

Heavily supported by autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), warehouses can span 1 million square feet, expanding and reconfiguring to meet demands. It\u2019s an obstacle course of workers and bottlenecks for hospitals, retailers, airports, manufacturers and others.\nTo accelerate development of these AMRs, we\u2019ve introduced Isaac Nova Orin, a state-of-the-art compute and sensor reference platform. It\u2019s built on the powerful new NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin edge AI system, available today. The platform includes the latest sensor technologies and high-performance AI compute capability.\nNew Isaac Software Arrives for AMR Ecosystem\nIn addition to Nova Orin, which will be available later this year, we\u2019re delivering new software and simulation capabilities to accelerate AMR deployments \u2014 including hardware-accelerated modules, or Isaac ROS GEMs, that are essential for enabling robots to visually navigate. That\u2019s key for mobile robots to better perceive their environment to safely avoid obstacles and efficiently plan paths.\nNew simulation capabilities, available in the NVIDIA Isaac Sim April release, will help save time when building virtual environments to test and train AMRs. Using 3D building blocks, developers can rapidly create realistic complex warehouse scenes and configurations to validate the robot\u2019s performance on a breadth of logistics tasks.\n\nIsaac Nova Orin Key Features\u00a0\nNova Orin comes with all of the compute and sensor hardware needed to design, build and test autonomy in AMRs.\nIts two Jetson AGX Orin units provide upto 550 TOPS of AI compute for perception, navigation and human-machine interaction. These modules process data in real time from the AMR\u2019s central nervous system \u2014 essentially the sensor suite comprising up to six cameras, three lidars and eight ultrasonic sensors.\nNova Orin includes tools necessary to simulate the robot in Isaac Sim on Omniverse, as well as support for numerous ROS software modules designed to accelerate perception and navigation tasks. Tools are also provided for accurately mapping the robots\u2019 environment using NVIDIA DeepMap.\nThe entire platform is calibrated and tested to work out of the box and give developers valuable time to innovate on new features and capabilities.\n3D sensor field of Nova Orin\nEnabling the Future\nSimulation is the key enabler of the future of robotics. However, to be broadly adopted, a robotics simulator must close the gap between the virtual and real world. This video shows how NVIDIA is closing the sim2real gap on three very different but amazing robots being developed by our growing Isaac Sim ecosystem. You can view GTC22 presentations of the three robots in action here: Fraunhofer (Obelix AMR), Festo (Cobot using Isaac Cortex), and ETH/Swiss-Mile (AnyMAL trained on Isaac Gym).\n\nMuch is at stake in intralogistics for AMRs, a market expected to top $46 billion by 2030, up from under $8 billion in 2021, according to estimates from ABI Research.\nThe old method of designing the AMR compute and sensor stack from the ground up is too costly in time and effort. Tapping into an existing platform allows manufacturers to focus on building the right software stack for the right robot application.\nImproving productivity for factories and warehouses will depend on AMRs working safely and efficiently side by side at scale. High levels of autonomy driven by 3D perception from\u00a0 Nova Orin will help drive that revolution.\nAs AMRs evolve, the need for secure deployment and management of the critical AI software on board is paramount. Over-the-air software management support is already preintegrated in Nova Orin.\nLearn more about Nova Orin and the complete Isaac for AMR platform.\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | GTC 2022 | Isaac | Jetson | Omniverse Enterprise \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Its drumming, dancing data center isn\u2019t just for kicks \u2014 it celebrates the ability of NVIDIA data center solutions to orchestrate unprecedented AI performance.\n\nCutting-edge AI is tackling the world\u2019s biggest challenges \u2014 but to do so, it needs the most advanced data centers, with thousands of hardware and software components working in perfect harmony.\nAt GTC, NVIDIA is showcasing the latest data center technologies to accelerate next-generation applications in business, research and art. To keep up with the growing demand for computing these applications, optimization is needed across the entire computing stack, as well as innovation at the level of distributed algorithms, software and systems.\nPerformance growth at the bottom of the computing stack, based on Moore\u2019s law, can\u2019t keep pace with the requirements of these applications. Moore\u2019s law, which predicted a 2x growth in computing performance every other year, has yielded to Huang\u2019s law \u2014 that GPUs will double AI performance every year.\nAdvancements across the entire computing stack, from silicon to application-level software, have contributed to an unprecedented million-x speedup in accelerated computing in the last 20 years. It\u2019s not just about faster GPUs, DPUs and CPUs. Computing based on neural network models, advanced network technologies and distributed software algorithms all contribute to the data center innovation needed to keep pace with the demands of ever-growing AI models.\n\nThrough these innovations, the data center has become the single unit of computing. Thousands of servers work seamlessly as one, with NVIDIA Magnum IO software and new breakthroughs like the NVIDIA NVLink Switch System unveiled at GTC combining to link advanced AI infrastructure.\nOrchestrated to perfection, an NVIDIA-powered data center will support innovations that are yet to be even imagined.\nDeveloping a Digital Twin of the Data Center\nThe GTC video performance showcases a digital twin NVIDIA is building of its own data centers \u2014 a virtual representation of the physical supercomputer that NVIDIA designers and engineers can use to test new configurations or software builds before releasing updates to the physical system.\nIn addition to enabling continuous integration and delivery, a digital twin of a data center can be used to optimize operational efficiency, including response time, resource utilization and energy consumption.\nDigital twins can help teams predict equipment failures, proactively replace weak links and test improvement measures before applying them. They can even provide a testing ground to fine-tune data centers for specific enterprise users or applications.\nApplicable across industries and applications, digital twin technology is already being used as a powerful tool for warehouse optimizations, climate simulations, smart factory development and renewable energy planning.\nIn NVIDIA\u2019s data center digital twin, viewers can spot flagship technologies including NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD and EGX-based NVIDIA-Certified systems with BlueField DPUs and InfiniBand switches. The performance also features a special appearance by Toy Jensen, an application built with Omniverse Avatar.\nThe visualization was developed in NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for real-time world simulation and 3D design collaboration. Omniverse connects science and art by bringing together creators, developers, engineers and AIs across industries to work together in a shared virtual world.\n\nOmniverse digital twins are true to reality, accurately simulating the physics and materials of their real counterparts. The realism allows Omniverse users to test out processes, interactions and new technologies in the digital space before moving to the physical world.\nEvery factory, neighborhood and city could one day be replicated as a digital twin. With connected sensors powered by edge computing, these sandbox environments can be continuously updated to reflect changes to the corresponding real-world assets or systems. They can help develop next-generation autonomous robots, smart cities and 5G networks.\nA digital twin can learn the laws of physics, chemistry, biology and more, storing this information in its computing brain.\nJust as kingdoms centuries ago sent explorers to travel the world and return with new knowledge, edge sensors and robots are today\u2019s explorers for digital twin environments. Each sensor brings new observations back to the digital twin\u2019s brain, which consolidates the data, learns from it and updates the autonomous systems within the virtual environment. This collective learning will tune digital twins to perfection.\nHear about the latest innovations in AI, accelerated computing and virtual world simulation at GTC, streaming online through March 24.

In total they generate over 100 gigawatts of wind power, enough to power nearly 87 million households annually.\nVirtual representations of Siemens Gamesa\u2019s wind farms will be built using NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo, which together comprise NVIDIA\u2019s digital twin platform for scientific computing.\n\nThe platform will help Siemens Gamesa achieve quicker calculations to optimize wind farm layouts, increasing overall production while reducing loads and operating costs.\nWith the global level of annual wind power installations likely to quadruple between 2020 and 2025, it\u2019s more important than ever to maximize the power produced by each turbine.\nThe global trillion-dollar renewable energy industry is turning to digital twins, like those of Siemens Gamesa\u2019s wind farms \u2014 and one of Earth itself \u2014 to further climate research and accelerate the clean energy transition.\nAnd the world\u2019s rapid clean energy technology improvements mean that a dollar spent on wind and solar conversion systems today results in 4x more electricity than a dollar spent on the same systems a decade ago. This has tremendous bottom-line implications for the transition towards a greener Earth.\nWith NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo, an AI framework for developing physics-informed machine learning models, and Omniverse, a 3D design collaboration and world simulation platform, researchers can now simulate computational fluid dynamics up to 4,000x faster than traditional methods \u2014 and view the simulations at high fidelity.\n\u201cThe collaboration between Siemens Gamesa and NVIDIA has meant a great step forward in accelerating the computational speed and the deployment speed of our latest algorithms development in such a complex field as computational fluid dynamics,\u201d said Sergio Dominguez, onshore digital portfolio manager at Siemens Gamesa.\nMaximizing Wind Power\nAdding a turbine next to another on a farm can change the wind flow and create wake effects \u2014 that is, decreases in downstream wind speed \u2014 which lead to a reduction in the farm\u2019s production of electricity.\nOmniverse digital twins of wind farms will help Siemens Gamesa to accurately simulate the effect that a turbine might have on another when placed in close proximity.\nUsing NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo and physics-ML models running on GPUs, researchers can now run computational fluid dynamics simulations orders of magnitude faster than with traditional methods, like those based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations or large eddy simulations, which can take over a month to run, even on a 100-CPU cluster.\nThis up to 4,000x speedup allows the rapid and accurate simulation of wake effects.\nAnalyzing and minimizing potential wake effects in real time, while simultaneously optimizing wind farms for a variety of other wind and weather scenarios, require hundreds or thousands of iterations and simulation runs, which were traditionally prohibited by time constraints and costs.\nNVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo\u00a0enable accurate simulations of the complex interactions between the turbines, using high-fidelity and high-resolution models that are based on low-resolution inputs.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo at GTC, running through March 24.\nWatch NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s GTC keynote address in replay:\n\nDiscover how AI is powering the future of clean energy.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Pro GraphicsTags: Climate | Digital Twin | Energy | GTC 2022 | NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo | Omniverse | Science | Simulation and Design | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They\u2019ll help manage power flows for solar panels and electric vehicle chargers.\nLike smartphones, they\u2019ll run apps. And they\u2019ll give utilities a clearer picture of the grid, including warnings if a component on a nearby powerline could fail soon.\nA Tale of Two Innovators\nDevices from startup Anuranet will switch on in hundreds, perhaps thousands, of homes starting this fall using the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform.\nUtilidata, a Rhode Island-based company developing grid software for a decade, is working with NVIDIA to develop a Jetson-based smart grid chip. It will be used in meters to bring real-time AI applications to the edge.\nThe efforts are part of a vision for a smarter, cleaner, safer grid that NVIDIA and partners are helping make a reality.\n\u201cToday\u2019s smart meters are not very smart, but with the edge-computing power of the Jetson GPU and our software platform we will create truly intelligent meters that will change the energy-control network one home and one building at a time,\u201d said Diane Zuckerman (pictured above), co-founder of Austin, Texas-based Anuranet, the latest of a half-dozen startups she has launched worldwide.\nEngaging Simplicity\nAnuranet is developing the Bullfrog brand of smart meters and circuit panels powered by the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform. They can connect to the grid as well as smart appliances, home energy hubs, solar panels, electric-vehicle chargers and their batteries to help customers save on energy bills while decreasing their carbon footprint in real time.\n\u201cTheir simplicity will engage consumers, creating value with high performance and security,\u201d Zuckerman said.\nAlthough it\u2019s just eight months old, the startup has signed contracts with two companies that will start deploying its devices this year in new homes.\nRichland Partners, in Nashville, will use the Anuranet Bullfrog energy ecosystem in homes and apartments it\u2019s building. Neu Communities in Austin will use them to manage private microgrids in new residential neighborhoods it\u2019s constructing.\nJetson Reshapes Edge Computing\nToday\u2019s smart meters throw away most of the energy-related data in the home because they lack the compute muscle to process it. It\u2019s a treasure trove of real-time data that Anuranet, Utilidata and others will use to improve the grid.\nFor example, NVIDIA Jetson-powered smart meters can take measurements tens of thousands of times a second.\n\u201cEncoded in that data is information about the quality of the power flow and what might be interfering with it,\u201d explained Marissa Hummon, CTO of Utilidata, an NVIDIA Inception partner that\u2019s already built applications for some of the world\u2019s largest metering companies.\n\u201cA tree branch might impact the wave form and if we can see that we can predict an outage \u2014 that kind of insight is something lots of apps can use, so it\u2019s creating an environment for others to innovate,\u201d she said.\nDeploying the Best Algorithms\nBacked by investments from Microsoft and NVIDIA, Utilidata aims to understand power flows in ways that benefit both consumers and utilities. That requires machine learning and the compute horsepower to run it.\nHummon shows a prototype device containing Utilidata\u2019s smart grid chip.\n\u201cNo human can look at all these patterns to find the key insights, but computers can, and our software running on the Jetson-based smart grid chip will let us deploy the best algorithms,\u201d added Hummon.\nUtilidata and the U.S. National Renewable Energy Lab are collaborating to run the lab\u2019s real-time power flow software on Utilidata\u2019s smart grid chip. And several utilities are in discussions with Utilidata to pilot its chip in smart meter deployments.\nWhy the Grid Needs AI\nSmart meters are well positioned for tracking and responding to the two-way power flows rapidly coming to the edge of the grid.\nHomes and businesses are installing batteries and solar panels that make them power generators. At the same time, they\u2019re putting in electric-vehicle chargers that draw more than three times the power of the large air conditioners that used to drive grid demand. And with recent funding in the U.S. many more chargers and their grid demands will be coming online fast.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t write a good physics model to track all this, it requires a different approach to the problem that\u2019s incredibly well geared to GPU computation,\u201d said Hummon, who holds a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why edge AI has gone from a nice-to-have to an urgent need for utilities preparing for what their customers are doing,\u201d she added.\nStartups Get Accelerated\nProducts from both startups will rely on NVIDIA full-stack technologies and an open platform for third-party app developers.\nHummon, of Utilidata, praised NVIDIA Inception, which nurtures technology startups, providing investor introductions, expertise and technology.\nAs part of the work developing the software-defined smart grid chip with NVIDIA, Inception gave her team access to GPUs in the cloud and training on how to make the best use of them. Inception also provided connections to other innovators across the power sector.\nSmart Meters Get a Voice\nFor its part, Anuranet will make its Bullfrog devices come alive with conversational AI that combines its internal code for natural-language understanding with the automatic speech recognition in NVIDIA Riva, a GPU-accelerated software development kit for building speech AI applications.\n\u201cThe accuracy of our code is already double that of rival offerings, and with Riva I expect we will outperform anything on the market by an order of magnitude,\u201d said Anuranet CTO David L. Brock, a Ph.D. in robotics and AI from MIT, who developed a novel approach to natural language understanding.\n\u201cRiva is very exciting, and we will expect to expand our use of it in the future,\u201d he added.\nIt\u2019s one more way NVIDIA is fueling the transition to a more resilient grid and sustainable future.\nIn separate sessions at GTC, Utilidata will share how edge AI is redefining grid operations and tackling climate change.

Last month we announced NVIDIA DLSS accelerates performance with uncompromised image quality in over 150 games. This month, ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS comes to Ghostwire: Tokyo when it launches March 25th and is available now in Paradise Killer. We\u2019re also announcing the inclusion of DLSS in Evil Dead: The Game when it arrives May 13.\nRead on to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhostwire: Tokyo Launching With Ray Tracing & NVIDIA DLSS On March 25th\nTango Gameworks\u2019 Ghostwire: Tokyo is a highly anticipated supernatural first-person action game set in a modern-day Tokyo, where the entire populace has vanished without a trace.\nWhen Ghostwire: Tokyo launches March 25th, GeForce RTX gamers will be able to enjoy beautiful ray-traced reflections and shadows, and can activate NVIDIA DLSS for an up to 2X performance boost.\nCheck out new, exclusive Ghostwire: Tokyo footage, with ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS enabled, in the video below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvil Dead: The Game Gets NVIDIA DLSS On May 13\nThe Evil Dead franchise needs little introduction, having entertained audiences with its unique blend of action-horror-comedy since the original film\u2019s release in 1981. On May 13, 2022, take control of Ash and other key franchise characters in Evil Dead: The Game, an over-the-top co-op and PVP multiplayer action game from Saber Interactive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrandish your boomstick and fight the army of darkness at the highest possible detail levels and frame rates thanks to the addition of NVIDIA DLSS, which will be available day one for all GeForce RTX gamers. For a preview, check out our exclusive new Evil Dead: The Game NVIDIA DLSS video, which features footage from the game\u2019s bonus single-player missions that pay homage to classic Evil Dead scenes and lore!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParadise Killer Update Introduces NVIDIA DLSS & Ray-Traced Reflections - Available Now\nKaizen Game Works\u2019 Paradise Killer is a highly-rated open-world detective game set on Paradise Island, a world outside reality. There\u2019s been a murder that only \"investigation freak\" Lady Love Dies can solve. Gather evidence and interrogate suspects in this open world adventure. You can accuse anyone, but you\u2019ll have to prove your case in trial. It\u2019s up to you to decide who\u2019s guilty.\nParadise Killer players can experience the game\u2019s vibrant island with ray-traced reflections and performance-accelerating NVIDIA DLSS. When both are enabled, image quality is dramatically improved, and performance increases by up to 60% at 4K:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee RTX in action in our latest 4K DLSS comparison video:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial Upscaling For All Games With NVIDIA Image Scaling\nNVIDIA also offers a driver-based spatial upscaler called NVIDIA Image Scaling (NIS) to help boost performance for all your games. It boosts performance by rendering your game at a lower resolution, and then upscales and sharpens to match your monitor\u2019s native resolution. You can enable this feature manually in the Control Panel and then set the in-game resolution to match, or simply enable it automatically through GeForce Experience.\nNVIDIA Control Panel\n\nTo activate NVIDIA Image Scaling in the NVIDIA Control Panel, open the NVIDIA Control Panel, click onto \u201cManage 3D Settings\u201d, and activate \u201cImage Scaling\u201d\nLaunch your game, and under resolution, set it lower than that of your display monitor. Also set your game to full-screen mode\nYou can also enable the overlay indicator, and a \u201cNIS\u201d text label will appear in the upper left corner of the screen. A green text color indicates that NVIDIA Image Scaling is scaling and sharpening the game. If the text is colored blue, then NVIDIA Image Scaling is sharpening but not scaling\n\n*For games that don\u2019t offer Full Screen mode or Image Scaling is not getting engaged, you can set the resolution of your desktop equal to in-game resolution, which will enable NVIDIA Image Scaling. It is recommended to use the NVIDIA Control Panel to set or switch between scaling resolutions on the desktop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Experience\n1. To activate NVIDIA Image Scaling in GeForce Experience, go to Settings (Cog wheel), scroll down under General, and select \u201cImage Scaling\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. A pop-up will request to optimize all your games at the target render resolution and desired sharpness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. In your game, bring up the In-Game-Overlay by hitting Alt+F2 to adjust sharpness on a per game basis \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Scaling requires that the display is driven by an NVIDIA GPU, so if you are running MSHybrid/Optimus notebook configurations, you will have to first set the notebook to discrete GPU mode. To enable NVIDIA Image Sharpening for an external monitor, please disable the notebook\u2019s internal display panel.

And in Chorus, Jurassic World Evolution 2 and No Man\u2019s Sky we\u2019re bringing you support for NVIDIA DLAA, enabling players to further improve image quality.\nPlus, there\u2019s day-0 support for Tiny Tina\u2019s Wonderlands, and support for 11 new G-SYNC Compatible gaming monitors.\nRead on to learn more, and to download and install on Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems, simply fire up GeForce Experience and click the \"Drivers\" tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Ghostwire: Tokyo\nTokyo is overrun by deadly supernatural forces, perpetrated by a dangerous occultist, causing Tokyo\u2019s population to vanish in an instant. Ally with a powerful spectral entity on their\u202fquest for vengeance\u202fand master a powerful arsenal of abilities to unravel the\u202fdark\u202ftruth behind the disappearance as you face the unknown in Tango Gameworks and Bethesda Softworks\u2019 Ghostwire: Tokyo.\nWhen Ghostwire: Tokyo launches March 25th, GeForce RTX gamers will be able to enjoy beautiful ray-traced reflections and shadows, and can activate NVIDIA DLSS for an up to 2X performance boost. Check out new, exclusive Ghostwire: Tokyo footage, with ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS enabled, in the video below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Shadow Warrior 3\nFallen corporate shogun Lo Wang and his former employer, turned nemesis, turned sidekick, Orochi Zilla, embark on an improbable mission to recapture an ancient dragon they unwillingly unleashed from its eternal prison. Armed with a punishing mix of blades and bullets, Lo Wang must traverse uncharted parts of the world to track down the dark beast and push the apocalypse back yet again. All it will take is the mask of a dead god, a dragon's egg, a touch of magic, and enough firepower to hold off the impending cataclysm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Shadow Warrior 3 GeForce RTX gamers can accelerate performance by up to 68% at 4K using NVIDIA DLSS. When activated, all GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs can max out Shadow Warrior 3 at over 60 FPS, with top-end cards blasting past 120 FPS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd players equipped with a GeForce GTX 900 Series or newer GPU can activate NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency by up to 56%, making gameplay smoother and more responsive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable both NVIDIA DLSS and NVIDIA Reflex for the fastest, smoothest, most responsive Shadow Warrior 3 gameplay possible, giving you the ultimate experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For NVIDIA DLAA In Three More Titles\nMany gamers want higher frame rates. But others have plenty of FPS and want to maximize image quality. NVIDIA DLAA (Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing) is an AI-based anti-aliasing mode for users who have spare GPU headroom and want higher levels of image quality. DLAA uses the same technology developed for DLSS, but works on a native resolution image to maximize image quality instead of boosting performance.\nBoot up Chorus, Jurassic World Evolution 2, and No Man\u2019s Sky today to activate NVIDIA DLAA, giving you an even richer, more detailed experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial Upscaling For All Games With NVIDIA Image Scaling\nIf you want a boost in performance, and your GPU or games don\u2019t yet support NVIDIA DLSS, check out NVIDIA Image Scaling, a spatial upscaler that\u2019s built into the Game Ready Driver. It boosts performance by rendering your game at a lower resolution, and then upscales and sharpens to match your monitor\u2019s native resolution. You can enable this feature manually in the Control Panel and then set the in-game resolution to match, or simply enable it automatically through GeForce Experience.\u00a0\nNVIDIA Control Panel\n\nTo activate NVIDIA Image Scaling in the NVIDIA Control Panel, open the NVIDIA Control Panel, click onto \u201cManage 3D Settings\u201d, and activate \u201cImage Scaling\u201d\nLaunch your game, and under resolution, set it lower than that of your display monitor. Also set your game to full-screen mode\nYou can also enable the overlay indicator, and a \u201cNIS\u201d text label will appear in the upper left corner of the screen. A green text color indicates that NVIDIA Image Scaling is scaling and sharpening the game. If the text is colored blue, then NVIDIA Image Scaling is sharpening but not scaling\n\n*For games that don\u2019t offer Full Screen mode or Image Scaling is not getting engaged, you can set the resolution of your desktop equal to in-game resolution, which will enable NVIDIA Image Scaling. It is recommended to use the NVIDIA Control Panel to set or switch between scaling resolutions on the desktop.\nGeForce Experience\n\nTo activate NVIDIA Image Scaling in GeForce Experience, go to Settings (Cog wheel), scroll down under General, and select \u201cImage Scaling\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA pop-up will request to optimize all your games at the target render resolution and desired sharpness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn your game, bring up the In-Game-Overlay by hitting Alt+F2 to adjust sharpness on a per game basis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Scaling requires that the display is driven by an NVIDIA GPU, so if you are running MSHybrid/Optimus notebook configurations, you will have to first set the notebook to discrete GPU mode. To enable NVIDIA Image Sharpening for an external monitor, please disable the notebook\u2019s internal display panel. Further support is located here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport For Newly Validated G-SYNC Compatible Displays\nOur newest Game Ready Driver also adds support for 11 new G-SYNC Compatible displays that deliver a baseline Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) experience that makes your gaming smoother and more enjoyable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMANUFACTURER\nMODEL\nHDR\nSIZE\nLCD Type\nResolution\nVRR Range\n\n\nAcer\nXB283KV\nYes\n28\u201d\nIPS\n3840x2160 (4K)\n48-144Hz\n\n\nASUS\nVG27AC1A\nYes\n27\u201d\nIPS\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n48-170Hz\n\n\nAOC\nAG274QS8R1B\nYes\n27\u201d\nIPS\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n48-240Hz\n\n\nI-O DATA\nGC241UXD\nYes\n24\u201d\nIPS\n1920x1080 (FHD)\n60-240Hz\n\n\nMSI\nG274\nNo\n27\u201d\nIPS\n1920x1080 (FHD)\n60-165Hz\n\n\nMSI\nMAG281URF\nYes\n28\u201d\nIPS\n3840x2160 (4K)\n60-144Hz\n\n\nPhilips\n32M1N5800\nYes\n32\u201d\nIPS\n3840x2160 (4K)\n60-144Hz\n\n\nPhilips\nPHL276M1RPE\nYes\n27\u201d\nIPS\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n48-240Hz\n\n\nPhilips\nPHL32M1N5500Z\nYes\n32\u201d\nIPS\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n48-170Hz\n\n\nPhilips\nPHL32M1N5800A\nYes\n32\u201d\nIPS\n3840x2160 (4K)\n60-144Hz\n\n\nViewSonic\nVP2776\nYes\n27\u201d\nIPS\n3840x2160 (4K)\n48-144Hz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThese newly-validated monitors give gamers even more choice when searching for a great gaming display.

The 5 billion-parameter model is the largest language generator in healthcare.\n\u201cSynthetic data isn\u2019t actually linked to a real human being, but it has similar characteristics to real patients,\u201d said Dr. Duane Mitchell, an assistant vice president for research and director of the UF Clinical and Translational Science Institute. \u201cSynGatorTron can, for example, create health records of digital diabetes patients that have features just like a real population.\u201d\nUsing this synthetic data, researchers can create tools, models and tasks without risks or privacy concerns. These can then be used on real data to ask clinical questions, look for associations and even explore patient outcomes.\nWorking with synthetic data also makes it easier for different research institutions to collaborate and share models. And since the amount of data that can be synthesized is virtually limitless, researchers can use SynGatorTron-generated data to augment small datasets of rare disease patients or minority populations to reduce model bias.\nSynGatorTron was developed using the open-source NVIDIA Megatron-LM and NeMo frameworks. It\u2019s based on UF Health\u2019s GatorTron model, announced last year at NVIDIA GTC. The models were trained on HiPerGator-AI, the university\u2019s in-house NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD system, which ranks among the world\u2019s top 30 supercomputers.\nGatorTron-S, a BERT-style transformer model trained on synthetic data generated by SynGatorTron, will be available for developers next month on the NGC software hub.\u00a0\nSynGatorTron Opens Gate to Robust Training Data\nTo a doctor, an AI-generated doctor\u2019s note can appear impractical at first glance \u2014 it doesn\u2019t represent a real patient and won\u2019t read as logical to an expert eye. So a clinician can\u2019t make a direct analysis or diagnosis from it. But to an untrained AI, real and synthetic clinical data are both highly valuable.\n\u201cSynGatorTron\u2019s generative capability is a great enabler of natural language processing for medicine,\u201d said Dr. Mona Flores, global head of medical AI at NVIDIA. \u201cSynthesizing different types of clinical records will democratize the ability to create all sorts of applications dependent on such data by addressing data sparsity and privacy.\u201d\nOnce it\u2019s available, research institutions outside UF Health could fine-tune the pretrained SynGatorTron model with their own localized data and apply it to their AI projects. For example, if a given condition or a patient population is underrepresented in a health system\u2019s clinical data, SynGatorTron can be prompted to generate additional data with characteristics of that disease or population.\nThese AI-generated records could then be used to supplement and balance out real healthcare datasets used to train other neural networks, so that they better represent the population.\nSince synthetic training datasets mimic real medical notes without being associated with specific patients, they can also be more readily shared across research institutions without raising privacy concerns.\n\u201cWhen you have the ability to mimic population characteristics without being tethered to real patients, it opens the imagination to see if we can generate realistic datasets that allow us to answer questions we couldn\u2019t otherwise, due to constraints on access to data or limited information on patients of interest,\u201d Mitchell said.\nOne potential application is in clinical trials, which often divide patients into treatment and control groups to measure the effectiveness of a new medication. An application derived from SynGatorTron-generated data could parse through real records and create a digital twin of patient records. These records could then be used as the control group in a clinical trial, instead of having a control group derived by giving real patients a placebo treatment.\nResearchers developing a deep learning model to study a rare disease, or the effects of a treatment on a specific population, could also use SynGatorTron for data augmentation, generating more training data to supplement the limited amount of real medical records available.\nHealthcare at GTC\u00a0\nRegister free for GTC, running online March 21-24, to discover the latest in AI and healthcare.

OVX will be used to simulate complex digital twins for modeling entire buildings, factories, cities and even the world.\n\u201cPhysically accurate digital twins are the future of how we design and build,\u201d said Bob Pette,\u00a0vice president of Professional Visualization at NVIDIA. \u201cDigital twins will change how every industry and company plans. The OVX portfolio of systems will be able to power true, real-time, always-synchronous, industrial-scale digital twins across industries.\u201d\nOVX will enable designers, engineers and planners to build physically accurate digital twins of buildings or create massive, true-to-reality simulated environments with precise time synchronization across physical and virtual worlds. Companies can evaluate and test complex systems and processes with multiple autonomous systems interacting in the same space-time to optimize, expand or create more efficient factories and warehouses or train robots and autonomous vehicles before deploying them in the physical world.\nDeveloping Digital Twins\r\nWithin the sector initiative \u201cDigitale Schiene Deutschland\u201d (Digital Rail for Germany), DB Netze is building in Omniverse a digital twin of Germany's national railway network to train systems for automatic train operation and enable AI-enhanced predictive analysis for unforeseen situations in railway operations.\n\u201cUsing a photorealistic digital twin to train and test AI-enabled trains will help us develop more precise perception systems to optimally detect and react to incidents,\u201d said Annika Hundertmark, head of Railway Digitization at DB Netze. \u201cIn our current project, NVIDIA OVX will provide the scale, performance and compute capabilities that we need to generate data for intensive machine learning development and operate these highly complex simulations and scenarios.\u201d\nComputing System Specifications\r\nThe OVX server consists of eight NVIDIA A40 GPUs, three NVIDIA ConnectX\u00ae-6 Dx 200Gbps NICs, 1TB system memory and 16TB NVMe storage. The OVX computing system scales from a single pod of eight OVX servers, to an OVX SuperPOD consisting of 32 OVX servers connected with NVIDIA Spectrum-3 switch fabric or multiple OVX SuperPODs to accelerate massive digital twin simulations.\nAvailability\r\nOVX solutions are NVIDIA-Certified Systems\u2122, tested and validated to provide the necessary performance, manageability, security and scalability. Comprehensive enterprise-grade support for NVIDIA OVX solutions and Omniverse software will be provided jointly by NVIDIA and OEM system builders.\nNVIDIA OVX will be available later this year through Inspur, Lenovo and Supermicro.\nTo learn more about NVIDIA Omniverse, watch the GTC 2022 keynote from NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang.

And with more people than ever in video calls or live streaming from their home offices, rich audio free from echo hiccups and background noises like barking dogs is key to better sounding online experiences.\nNVIDIA Maxine offers GPU-accelerated, AI-enabled software development kits to help developers build scalable, low-latency audio and video effects pipelines that improve call quality and user experience.\nToday, NVIDIA announced at GTC that Maxine is adding acoustic echo cancellation and AI-based upsampling for better sound quality.\nAcoustic Echo Cancellation eliminates acoustic echo from the audio stream in real time, preserving speech quality even during double-talk. With AI-based technology, Maxine achieves more effective echo cancellation than that achieved via traditional digital signal processing algorithms.\nAudio Super Resolution improves the quality of a low-bandwidth audio signal by restoring the energy lost in higher frequency bands using AI-based techniques. Maxine Audio Super Resolution supports upsampling the audio\u00a0 from 8 kHz (narrowband) to 16 kHz (wideband), from 16 kHz to 48 kHz (ultra-wideband) and from 8 kHz to 48 kHz. Lower sampling rates such as 8 kHz often result in muffled voices and emphasize artifacts such as sibilance and make the speech difficult to understand.\nModern film and television studios often use 48 kHz (or higher) sampling rate for recording audio, in order to maintain fidelity of the original signal and preserve clarity. Audio Super Resolution can help restore the fidelity of old audio recordings, derived from magnetic tapes or other low bandwidth media.\nBridging the Sound Gap\u00a0\nMost modern telecommunication takes place using wideband or ultra-wideband audio. Since NVIDIA Audio Super Resolution can upsample and restore the narrowband audio in real-time, the technology can effectively be used to bridge the quality gap between traditional copper wire phone lines and modern VoIP-based wideband communication systems.\nReal-time communication \u2014 whether for conference calls, call centers or live streaming of all kinds \u2014 is taking a big leap forward with Maxine.\nSince its initial release, Maxine has been adopted by many of the world\u2019s leading providers for video communications, content creation and live streaming.\n\nThe worldwide market for video conferencing is expected to increase to nearly $13 billion in 2028, up from about $6.3 billion in 2021, according to Fortune Business Insights.\nWFH: A Way of Life\u00a0\nThe move to work from home, or WFH, has become an accepted norm across companies, and organizations are adapting to the new expectations.\nAnalyst firm Gartner estimates that only a quarter of meetings for enterprises will be in person in 2024, a decline from 60 percent pre-pandemic.\nVirtual collaboration in the U.S. has played an important role as people have taken on hybrid and remote positions in the past two years amid the pandemic.\nBut as organizations seek to maintain company culture and workplace experience, the stakes have risen for higher-quality media interactivity.\nSolving the Cocktail Party Problem\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBut sometimes work and home life collide. As a result, meetings are often filled with background noises from kids, construction work outside or emergency vehicle sirens, causing brief interruptions in the flow of conference calls.\nMaxine helps solve an age-old audio issue known as the cocktail party problem. With AI, it can filter out unwanted background noises, allowing users to be better heard, whether they\u2019re in a home office or on the road.\nThe Maxine GPU-accelerated platform provides an end-to-end deep learning pipeline that integrates with customizable state-of-the-art models, enabling high-quality features with a standard microphone and camera.\nSound Like Your Best Self\nIn addition to being impacted by background noise, audio quality in virtual activities can sometimes sound thin, missing low- and mid-level frequencies, or even be barely audible.\nMaxine enables upsampling of audio in real time so that voices sound fuller, deeper and more audible.\nLogitech: Better Audio for Headsets and Blue Yeti Microphones\nLogitech, a leading maker of peripherals, is implementing Maxine for better interactions with its popular headsets and microphones.\nTapping into AI libraries, Logitech has integrated Maxine directly inside G Hub audio drivers to enhance communications with its devices without the need for additional software. Maxine takes advantage of the powerful Tensor Cores in NVIDIA RTX GPUs so consumers can enjoy real-time processing of their mic signal.\nLogitech is now utilizing Maxine\u2019s state-of-the-art denoising in its G Hub software. That has allowed it to remove echoes and background noises \u2014 such as fans, as well as keyboard and mouse clicks \u2014 that can distract from video conferences or live-streaming sessions.\n\u201cNVIDIA Maxine makes it fast and easy for Logitech G gamers to clean up their mic signal and eliminate unwanted background noises in a single click.\u201d said Ujesh Desai, GM of Logitech G. \u201cYou can even use G HUB to test your mic signal to make sure you have your Maxine settings dialed in.\u201d\nTencent Cloud Boosts Content Creators\nTencent Cloud is helping content creators with their productions by offering technology from NVIDIA Maxine that makes it quick and easy to add creative backgrounds.\nNVIDIA Maxine\u2019s AI Green Screen feature enables users to create a more immersive presence with high-quality foreground and background separation \u2014 without the need for a traditional green screen. Once the real background is separated, it can easily be replaced with a virtual background, or blurred to create a depth-of-field effect. Tencent Cloud is offering this new capability as a software-as-a-service package for content creators.\nNVIDIA Maxine\u2019s AI Green Screen technology helps content creators with their productions by enabling more immersive high quality experiences, without the need for specialized equipment and lighting\u201d said Director of the Product Center, Vulture Li at Tencent Cloud audio and video platform.\nMaking Virtual Experiences Better\nNVIDIA Maxine provides state-of-the-art real-time AI audio, video and augmented reality features that can be built into customizable, end-to-end deep learning pipelines.\nThe AI-powered SDKs from Maxine help developers to create applications that include audio and image denoising, super resolution, gaze correction, 3D body pose estimation and translation features.\nMaxine also enables real-time voice-to-text translation for a growing number of languages. At GTC, NVIDIA demonstrated Maxine translating between English, French, German and Spanish.\nThese effects will allow millions of people to enjoy high-quality and engaging live-streaming video across any device.\n\n\u00a0\nJoin us at GTC this week to learn more about Maxine in the following session:\n\nPut Your Body into It!

NVAIE is\u202fa cloud-native software suite that is optimized, certified and supported by NVIDIA to streamline AI development and deployment. NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise positions startups to build high-quality 3D tools or to simplify and accelerate complex 3D workflows. NVIDIA Riva Enterprise helps easily develop real-time applications like virtual assistants, transcription services and chatbots.\nThese discounts provide Inception members greater access to NVIDIA software tools to build computing applications in alignment with their own solutions.\nAnother new benefit for Inception members is access to special leasing for NVIDIA DGX systems. Available now for members in the U.S., this offers an enhanced opportunity for startups to leverage DGX to deliver leading solutions for enterprise AI infrastructure at scale.\nInception members continue to receive credits and exclusive discounts for technical self-paced courses and instructor-led workshops through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute. Upcoming DLI workshops include \u201cBuilding Conversational AI Applications\u201d and \u201cApplications of AI for Predictive Maintenance\u201d and courses include \u201cBuilding Real-TIme Video AI Applications\u201d and \u201cDeploying a Model for Inference at Production Scale.\u201d\nA Growing Ecosystem\nNVIDIA Inception is home for startups to do all types of interesting work, and welcomes developers in every field, area and industry.\nWithin the program, healthcare is a leading field, with over 1,600 healthcare startups. This is followed closely by over 1,500 IT services startups, more than 825 media and entertainment (M&E) startups and upwards of 800 video analytics startups. More than 660 robotics startups are members of Inception, paving the next wave of AI, through digital and physical robots.\nAn indicator of Inception\u2019s growing popularity is the increase in startups who are doing work in emerging areas, such as NVIDIA Omniverse, a development platform for 3D design collaboration and real-time, physically accurate simulation, as well as climate sciences and more. Several Inception startups are already developing on the Omniverse platform.\nInception member Charisma is leveraging Omniverse to build digital humans for virtual worlds, games and education. The company enters interactive dialogue into the Omniverse Audio2Face app, tapping into NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs in the cloud.\nAnother Inception member, RIOS, helps enterprises automate factories, warehouses and supply chain operations by deploying AI-powered end-to-end robotic workcells. The company is harnessing Isaac Sim on Omniverse, which it also uses for customer deployments.\nAnd RADiCAL is developing computer vision technology focused on detecting and reconstructing 3D human motion from 2D content. The startup is already developing on Omniverse to accelerate its work.\nIn the field of climate science, many Inception members are also doing revolutionary work to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible.\nInception member TrueOcean is running NVIDIA DGX A100 systems to develop AI algorithms for predicting quantification of carbon dioxide capture within seagrass meadows as well as for understanding subsea geology. Seagrass meadows can absorb and store carbon in the oxygen-depleted seabed, where it decomposes much slower than on land.\nIn alignment with NVIDIA\u2019s own plans to build the world\u2019s most powerful AI supercomputer for predicting climate change, Inception member Blackshark provides a semantic, photorealistic 3D digital twin of Earth as a plugin for Unreal Engine, relying on Omniverse as one its platforms for building large virtual geographic environments.\nIf you\u2019re a startup doing disruptive and exciting development, join NVIDIA Inception today.\nCheck out GTC sessions on Omniverse and climate change from NVIDIA Inception members. Registration is free. And watch NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s GTC keynote address, which features a new I AM AI video with Inception members HeartDub and PRENAV.\n\n\nCategories: CorporateTags: GTC 2022 | Inception | Omniverse \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The programmable architecture, slated for 2027, will be built on the DRIVE Thor central computer to achieve automated driving.\nDRIVE Hyperion is designed to be compatible across generations, with the same computer form factor and NVIDIA DriveWorks APIs. Partners can leverage current investments in the DRIVE Orin platform and seamlessly migrate to NVIDIA DRIVE Thor and beyond.\nThe platform includes the computer architecture, sensor set and software. It is designed to be open and modular, so customers can select what they need. Hyperion 9 will enable level 3 urban and level 4 highway driving capabilities.\u00a0\nCore Compute\nDRIVE Hyperion incorporates redundancy into the compute architecture.\nWith the DRIVE Thor superchip, the next-generation platform will feature 8x the performance of the current DRIVE Orin-based architecture at the same power envelope. DRIVE Thor is a technical marvel for safe and secure computing, harnessing the advanced AI capabilities first deployed in NVIDIA Grace CPUs and Hopper and Ada Lovelace architecture-based GPUs.\nIt provides 2,000 teraflops of performance \u2014 more than ample compute horsepower for redundant and diverse deep neural networks and leaving headroom for developers to continue adding features and improvements.\nDRIVE Hyperion is the nervous system of the vehicle, and DRIVE Thor serves as the brain.\nHeightened Sensing\nWith DRIVE Thor\u2019s compute performance, DRIVE Hyperion 9 can process even more sensor data as the car drives, improving redundancy and diversity.\nThis upgraded sensor suite includes an array of high-resolution cameras, radars, lidars and ultrasonics.\nBy incorporating a rich sensor set and high-performance compute, the entire system is architected to the highest levels of functional safety and cybersecurity.\nDRIVE Hyperion 9 will give the industry continuous access to the cutting edge in AI technology as it begins to roll out more intelligent transportation.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC 2022 | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

That\u2019s too slow for businesses.\u00a0\nAnd AI, high performance computing and data analytics have grown in complexity; some large language models and others now include trillions of parameters.\u00a0\nThe NVIDIA Hopper architecture is built from the ground up to accelerate these next-generation AI workloads with massive compute power and fast memory to handle growing networks and datasets.\u00a0\nTransformer Engine, first introduced with the NVIDIA Hopper architecture and then incorporated in the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, significantly speeds up AI performance and capabilities, and helps train large models within days or even hours.\u00a0\nTraining AI Models With Transformer Engine\nTransformer models are the backbone of LLMs used widely today, such as BERT and GPT. Initially developed for natural language processing use cases, their versatility is increasingly being applied to computer vision, drug discovery and more.\u00a0\nHowever, model size has continued to increase exponentially, now reaching trillions of parameters. This trend is causing training times to stretch into months due to huge amounts of computation, which is impractical for many business needs.\u00a0\nTransformer Engine uses 16-bit floating-point precision and a newly added 8-bit floating-point data format combined with advanced software algorithms that will further speed up AI performance and capabilities.\u00a0\nAI training relies on floating-point numbers, which have fractional components, like 3.14. Introduced with the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, the TensorFloat-32 (TF32) floating point format is the default 32-bit format used in NVIDIA\u2019s TensorFlow and PyTorch containers.\u00a0\nMost AI floating-point math is done using 16-bit \u201chalf\u201d precision (FP16) and 32-bit \u201csingle\u201d precision (FP32). By reducing the math operations to just eight bits, Transformer Engine makes it possible to train larger networks faster without compromising accuracy.\u00a0\nWhen coupled with other new features in the Hopper architecture \u2014 like the NVLink Switch system, which provides a direct high-speed interconnect between nodes \u2014 H100-accelerated server clusters can train enormous networks that were nearly impossible to train at the speed necessary for enterprises.\nDiving Deeper Into Transformer Engine\nTransformer Engine uses software and custom NVIDIA fourth-generation Tensor Core technology designed to accelerate training for models built from the prevalent AI model building block, the transformer. These Tensor Cores can apply mixed FP8 and FP16 formats to dramatically accelerate AI calculations for transformers. Tensor Core operations in FP8 have twice the computational throughput of 16-bit operations.\nThe challenge for models is to intelligently manage the precision to maintain accuracy while gaining the performance of smaller, faster numerical formats. Transformer Engine enables this with custom, NVIDIA-tuned heuristics that dynamically choose between FP8 and FP16 calculations and automatically handle re-casting and scaling between these precisions in each layer of a neural network.\nTransformer Engine uses per-layer statistical analysis to determine the optimal precision (FP16 or FP8) for each layer of a model, achieving the best performance while preserving model accuracy.\nThe NVIDIA Hopper architecture in particular also advances fourth-generation Tensor Cores by tripling the floating-point operations per second compared with prior-generation TF32, FP64, FP16 and INT8 precisions. Combined with Transformer Engine and fourth-generation NVLink, Hopper Tensor Cores enable an order-of-magnitude speedup for HPC and AI workloads.\nRevving Up Transformer Engine\nMuch of the cutting-edge work in AI revolves around LLMs like Megatron 530B. The chart below shows the growth of model size in recent years, a trend that\u2019s widely expected to continue. Many researchers are already working on trillion-plus parameter models for natural language understanding and other applications, showing an unrelenting appetite for AI compute power.\u00a0\nGrowth in natural language understanding models continues at a vigorous pace. Source: Microsoft.\nMeeting the demands of these growing models requires a combination of computational power and a ton of high-speed memory. The NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU delivers on both fronts, with the speedups made possible by Transformer Engine to take AI training to the next level.\u00a0\nCombined, these innovations deliver higher throughput and a 9x reduction in time to train, from seven days to just 20 hours on the Mixture of Experts 395B model:\nNVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU delivers up to 9x more training throughput compared to previous generation, making it possible to train large models in reasonable amounts of time.\nTransformer Engine can also be used for inference without any data format conversions. Previously, INT8 was the go-to precision for optimal inference performance. However, it requires that the trained networks be converted to INT8 as part of the optimization process, something the NVIDIA TensorRT inference optimizer makes easy.\u00a0\nUsing models trained with FP8 will allow developers to skip this conversion step altogether and do inference operations using that same precision. And like INT8-formatted networks, deployments using Transformer Engine can run in a much smaller memory footprint.\u00a0\nOn Megatron 530B, NVIDIA H100 inference per-GPU throughput is up to 30x higher than with the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU, with a one-second response latency, showcasing it as the optimal platform for AI deployments:\nTransformer Engine will also increase inference throughput by as much as 30x for low-latency applications.\nTransformer Engine can also boost inference even on smaller transformer-based networks that are already highly optimized. For example, on industry-standard MLPerf Inference 3.0 benchmarks, NVIDIA H100 delivered up to 4.3x higher inference performance compared to the prior-generation NVIDIA A100 on BERT, a popular network for natural language understanding.\u00a0\nTo learn more about the NVIDIA H100 GPU and the Hopper architecture, read this NVIDIA Technical Blog post, the Hopper architecture whitepaper and NVIDIA\u2019s most recent results on MLPerf Inference and Training.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | GTC 2022 | High-Performance Computing | Inference | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

These tools are enabled by breakthroughs from NVIDIA Research that leverage technologies such as NVIDIA Omniverse platform and NVIDIA DRIVE Map.\nHuang demonstrated the methods side-by-side, showing how developers can easily test multiple scenarios in rapid iterations:\n\nOnce any scenario is reconstructed in simulation, it can act as the foundation for many different variations \u2014 from changing the trajectory of an oncoming vehicle, or adding an obstacle to the driving path \u2014 giving developers the ability to improve the AI driver.\nHowever, reconstructing real-world driving scenarios and generating realistic data from it in simulation is a time- and labor-intensive process. It requires skilled engineers and artists, and even then, can be difficult to do.\nNVIDIA has implemented two AI-based methods to seamlessly perform this process: virtual reconstruction and neural reconstruction. The first replicates the real-world scenario as a fully synthetic 3D scene, while the second uses neural simulation to augment real-world sensor data.\nBoth methods are able to expand well beyond recreating a single scenario to generating many new and challenging scenarios. This capability accelerates the continuous AV training, testing and validation pipeline.\nVirtual Reconstruction\u00a0\nIn the keynote video above, an entire driving environment and set of scenarios around NVIDIA\u2019s headquarters are reconstructed in 3D using NVIDIA DRIVE Map, Omniverse and DRIVE Sim.\nWith DRIVE Map, developers have access to a digital twin of a road network in Omniverse. Using tools built on Omniverse, the detailed map is\u00a0 converted into a drivable simulation environment that can be used with NVIDIA DRIVE Sim.\nWith the reconstructed simulation environment, developers can recreate events, like a close call at an intersection or navigating a construction zone, using camera, lidar and vehicle data from real-world drives.\nThe platform\u2019s AI helps reconstruct the scenario. First, for each tracked object, an AI looks at camera images and finds the most similar 3D asset available from the DRIVE Sim catalog and color that most closely matches the color of the object from the video.\nFinally, the actual path of the tracked object is recreated; however, there are often gaps because of occlusions. In such cases, an AI-based traffic model is applied to the tracked object to predict what it would have done and fill in the gaps in its trajectory.\nCamera and lidar data from real drives are used with AI to reconstruct scenarios.\nVirtual reconstruction enables developers to find potentially challenging situations to train and validate the AV system with high-fidelity data generated by physically based sensors and AI behavior models that can create many new scenarios. Data from the scenario can also train the behavior model.\n\nNeural Reconstruction\u00a0\nThe other approach relies on neural simulation rather than synthetically generating the scene, starting with real sensor data then modifying it.\nSensor replay \u2014 the process of playing back recorded sensor data to test the AV system\u2019s performance \u2014 is a staple of AV development. This process is open loop, meaning the AV stack\u2019s decisions don\u2019t affect the world since all of the data is prerecorded.\nA preview of neural reconstruction methods by NVIDIA Research turn this recorded data into a fully reactive and modifiable world \u2014 as in the demo, when the originally recorded van driving past the car could be reenacted to swerve right instead. This revolutionary approach allows closed-loop testing and full interaction between the AV stack and the world it\u2019s driving in.\nThe process starts with recorded driving data. AI identifies the dynamic objects in the scene and removes them to create an exact replica of the 3D environment that can be rendered from new views. Dynamic objects are then reinserted into the 3D scene with realistic AI-based behaviors and physical appearance, accounting for illumination and shadows.\n\nThe AV system then drives in this virtual world and the scene reacts accordingly. The scene can be made more complex through augmented reality by inserting other virtual objects, vehicles and pedestrians which are rendered as if they were part of the real scene and can physically interact with the environment.\nEvery sensor on the vehicle, including camera and lidar, can be simulated in the scene using AI.\n\nA Virtual World of Possibilities\u00a0\nThese new approaches are driven by NVIDIA\u2019s expertise in rendering, graphics and AI.\nAs a modular platform, DRIVE Sim supports these capabilities with a foundation of deterministic simulation. It provides the vehicle dynamics, AI-based traffic models, scenario tools and a comprehensive SDK to build any tool needed.\nWith these two powerful new AI methods, developers can easily move from the real world to the virtual one for faster AV development and deployment.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC 2022 | NVIDIA DRIVE | NVIDIA DRIVE Sim | NVIDIA Research | Omniverse | Rendering | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They\u2019re driving a wave of advances in machine learning some have dubbed transformer AI.\nStanford researchers called transformers \u201cfoundation models\u201d in an August 2021 paper because they see them driving a paradigm shift in AI. The \u201csheer scale and scope of foundation models over the last few years have stretched our imagination of what is possible,\u201d they wrote.\nWhat Can Transformer Models Do?\nTransformers are translating text and speech in near real-time, opening meetings and classrooms to diverse and hearing-impaired attendees.\nThey\u2019re helping researchers understand the chains of genes in DNA and amino acids in proteins in ways that can speed drug design.\nTransformers, sometimes called foundation models, are already being used with many data sources for a host of applications.\nTransformers can detect trends and anomalies to prevent fraud, streamline manufacturing, make online recommendations or improve healthcare.\nPeople use transformers every time they search on Google or Microsoft Bing.\nThe Virtuous Cycle of Transformer AI\nAny application using sequential text, image or video data is a candidate for transformer models.\nThat enables these models to ride a virtuous cycle in transformer AI. Created with large datasets, transformers make accurate predictions that drive their wider use, generating more data that can be used to create even better models.\nStanford researchers say transformers mark the next stage of AI\u2019s development, what some call the era of transformer AI.\n\u201cTransformers made self-supervised learning possible, and AI jumped to warp speed,\u201d said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang in his keynote address this week at GTC.\nTransformers Replace CNNs, RNNs\nTransformers are in many cases replacing convolutional and recurrent neural networks (CNNs and RNNs), the most popular types of deep learning models just five years ago.\nIndeed, 70 percent of arXiv papers on AI posted in the last two years mention transformers. That\u2019s a radical shift from a 2017 IEEE study that reported RNNs and CNNs were the most popular models for pattern recognition.\nNo Labels, More Performance\nBefore transformers arrived, users had to train neural networks with large, labeled datasets that were costly and time-consuming to produce. By finding patterns between elements mathematically, transformers eliminate that need, making available the trillions of images and petabytes of text data on the web and in corporate databases.\nIn addition, the math that transformers use lends itself to parallel processing, so these models can run fast.\nTransformers now dominate popular performance leaderboards like SuperGLUE, a benchmark developed in 2019 for language-processing systems.\nHow Transformers Pay Attention\nLike most neural networks, transformer models are basically large encoder/decoder blocks that process data.\nSmall but strategic additions to these blocks (shown in the diagram below) make transformers uniquely powerful.\nA look under the hood from a presentation by Aidan Gomez, one of eight co-authors of the 2017 paper that defined transformers.\nTransformers use positional encoders to tag data elements coming in and out of the network. Attention units follow these tags, calculating a kind of algebraic map of how each element relates to the others.\nAttention queries are typically executed in parallel by calculating a matrix of equations in what\u2019s called multi-headed attention.\nWith these tools, computers can see the same patterns humans see.\nSelf-Attention Finds Meaning\nFor example, in the sentence:\nShe poured water from the pitcher to the cup until it was full.\u00a0\nWe know \u201cit\u201d refers to the cup, while in the sentence:\nShe poured water from the pitcher to the cup until it was empty.\nWe know \u201cit\u201d refers to the pitcher.\n\u201cMeaning is a result of relationships between things, and self-attention is a general way of learning relationships,\u201d said Ashish Vaswani, a former senior staff research scientist at Google Brain who led work on the seminal 2017 paper.\n\u201cMachine translation was a good vehicle to validate self-attention because you needed short- and long-distance relationships among words,\u201d said Vaswani.\n\u201cNow we see self-attention is a powerful, flexible tool for learning,\u201d he added.\nHow Transformers Got Their Name\nAttention is so key to transformers the Google researchers almost used the term as the name for their 2017 model. Almost.\n\u201cAttention Net didn\u2019t sound very exciting,\u201d said Vaswani, who started working with neural nets in 2011.\n.Jakob Uszkoreit, a senior software engineer on the team, came up with the name Transformer.\n\u201cI argued we were transforming representations, but that was just playing semantics,\u201d Vaswani said.\nThe Birth of Transformers\nIn the paper for the 2017 NeurIPS conference, the Google team described their transformer and the accuracy records it set for machine translation.\nThanks to a basket of techniques, they trained their model in just 3.5 days on eight NVIDIA GPUs, a small fraction of the time and cost of training prior models. They trained it on datasets with up to a billion pairs of words.\n\u201cIt was an intense three-month sprint to the paper submission date,\u201d recalled Aidan Gomez, a Google intern in 2017 who contributed to the work.\n\u201cThe night we were submitting, Ashish and I pulled an all-nighter at Google,\u201d he said. \u201cI caught a couple hours sleep in one of the small conference rooms, and I woke up just in time for the submission when someone coming in early to work opened the door and hit my head.\u201d\nIt was a wakeup call in more ways than one.\n\u201cAshish told me that night he was convinced this was going to be a huge deal, something game changing. I wasn\u2019t convinced, I thought it would be a modest gain on a benchmark, but it turned out he was very right,\u201d said Gomez, now CEO of startup Cohere that\u2019s providing a language processing service based on transformers.\nA Moment for Machine Learning\nVaswani recalls the excitement of seeing the results surpass similar work published by a Facebook team using CNNs.\n\u201cI could see this would likely be an important moment in machine learning,\u201d he said.\nA year later, another Google team tried processing text sequences both forward and backward with a transformer. That helped capture more relationships among words, improving the model\u2019s ability to understand the meaning of a sentence.\nTheir Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model set 11 new records and became part of the algorithm behind Google search.\nWithin weeks, researchers around the world were adapting BERT for use cases across many languages and industries \u201cbecause text is one of the most common data types companies have,\u201d said Anders Arpteg, a 20-year veteran of machine learning research.\nPutting Transformers to Work\nSoon transformer models were being adapted for science and healthcare.\nDeepMind, in London, advanced the understanding of proteins, the building blocks of life, using a transformer called AlphaFold2, described in a recent Nature article. It processed amino acid chains like text strings to set a new watermark for describing how proteins fold, work that could speed drug discovery.\nAstraZeneca and NVIDIA developed MegaMolBART, a transformer tailored for drug discovery. It\u2019s a version of the pharmaceutical company\u2019s MolBART transformer, trained on a large, unlabeled database of chemical compounds using the NVIDIA Megatron framework for building large-scale transformer models.\nReading Molecules, Medical Records\n\u201cJust as AI language models can learn the relationships between words in a sentence, our aim is that neural networks trained on molecular structure data will be able to learn the relationships between atoms in real-world molecules,\u201d said Ola Engkvist, head of molecular AI, discovery sciences and R&D at AstraZeneca, when the work was announced last year.\n\nSeparately, the University of Florida\u2019s academic health center collaborated with NVIDIA researchers to create GatorTron. The transformer model aims to extract insights from massive volumes of clinical data to accelerate medical research.\nTransformers Grow Up\nAlong the way, researchers found larger transformers performed better.\nFor example, researchers from the Rostlab at the Technical University of Munich, which helped pioneer work at the intersection of AI and biology, used natural-language processing to understand proteins. In 18 months, they graduated from using RNNs with 90 million parameters to transformer models with 567 million parameters.\nRostlab researchers show language models trained without labeled samples picking up the signal of a protein sequence.\nThe OpenAI lab showed bigger is better with its Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT). The latest version, GPT-3, has 175 billion parameters, up from 1.5 billion for GPT-2.\nWith the extra heft, GPT-3 can respond to a user\u2019s query even on tasks it was not specifically trained to handle. It\u2019s already being used by companies including Cisco, IBM and Salesforce.\nTale of a Mega Transformer\nNVIDIA and Microsoft hit a high watermark in November, announcing the Megatron-Turing Natural Language Generation model (MT-NLG) with 530 billion parameters. It debuted along with a new framework, NVIDIA NeMo Megatron, that aims to let any business create its own billion- or trillion-parameter transformers to power custom chatbots, personal assistants and other AI applications that understand language.\nMT-NLG had its public debut as the brain for TJ, the Toy Jensen avatar that gave part of the keynote at NVIDIA\u2019s November 2021 GTC.\n\u201cWhen we saw TJ answer questions \u2014 the power of our work demonstrated by our CEO \u2014 that was exciting,\u201d said Mostofa Patwary, who led the NVIDIA team that trained the model.\n\u201cMegatron helps me answer all those tough questions Jensen throws at me,\u201d TJ said at GTC 2022.\nCreating such models is not for the faint of heart. MT-NLG was trained using hundreds of billions of data elements, a process that required thousands of GPUs running for weeks.\n\u201cTraining large transformer models is expensive and time-consuming, so if you\u2019re not successful the first or second time, projects might be canceled,\u201d said Patwary.\nTrillion-Parameter Transformers\nToday, many AI engineers are working on trillion-parameter transformers and applications for them.\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly exploring how these big models can deliver better applications. We also investigate in what aspects they fail, so we can build even better and bigger ones,\u201d Patwary said.\nTo provide the computing muscle those models need, our latest accelerator \u2014 the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU \u2014 packs a Transformer Engine and supports a new FP8 format. That speeds training while preserving accuracy.\nWith those and other advances, \u201ctransformer model training can be reduced from weeks to days\u201d said Huang at GTC.\nMoE Means More for Transformers\nLast year, Google researchers described the Switch Transformer, one of the first trillion-parameter models. It uses AI sparsity, a complex mixture-of experts (MoE) architecture and other advances to drive performance gains in language processing and up to 7x increases in pre-training speed.\nThe encoder for the Switch Transformer, the first model to have up to a trillion parameters.\nFor its part, Microsoft Azure worked with NVIDIA to implement an MoE transformer for its Translator service.\nTackling Transformers\u2019 Challenges\nNow some researchers aim to develop simpler transformers with fewer parameters that deliver performance similar to the largest models.\n\u201cI see promise in retrieval-based models that I\u2019m super excited about because they could bend the curve,\u201d said Gomez, of Cohere, noting the Retro model from DeepMind as an example.\nRetrieval-based models learn by submitting queries to a database. \u201cIt\u2019s cool because you can be choosy about what you put in that knowledge base,\u201d he said.\nIn the race for higher performance, transformer models have grown larger.\nThe ultimate goal is to \u201cmake these models learn like humans do from context in the real world with very little data,\u201d said Vaswani, now co-founder of a stealth AI startup.\nHe imagines future models that do more computation upfront so they need less data and sport better ways users can give them feedback.\n\u201cOur goal is to build models that will help people in their everyday lives,\u201d he said of his new venture.\nSafe, Responsible Models\nOther researchers are studying ways to eliminate bias or toxicity if models amplify wrong or harmful language. For example, Stanford created the Center for Research on Foundation Models to explore these issues.\n\u201cThese are important problems that need to be solved for safe deployment of models,\u201d said Shrimai Prabhumoye, a research scientist at NVIDIA who\u2019s among many across the industry working in the area.\n\u201cToday, most models look for certain words or phrases, but in real life these issues may come out subtly, so we have to consider the whole context,\u201d added Prabhumoye.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a primary concern for Cohere, too,\u201d said Gomez. \u201cNo one is going to use these models if they hurt people, so it\u2019s table stakes to make the safest and most responsible models.\u201d\nBeyond the Horizon\nVaswani imagines a future where self-learning, attention-powered transformers approach the holy grail of AI.\n\u201cWe have a chance of achieving some of the goals people talked about when they coined the term \u2018general artificial intelligence\u2019 and I find that north star very inspiring,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe are in a time where simple methods like neural networks are giving us an explosion of new capabilities.\u201d\nTransformer training and inference will get significantly accelerated with the NVIDIA H100 GPU.\nLearn more about transformers on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ExplainerTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | GPU | Machine Learning | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA Research | Parallel Computing | Science \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The SDKs make it easy for developers, researchers and data scientists to tap into the power of NVIDIA\u2019s advanced platform, tackling the immense complexity at the intersection of computing, algorithms and science.\nThese updates make the NVIDIA systems that developers already use across science, AI and data processing even faster. Highlights include:\n\ncuQuantum, for accelerating quantum circuit simulation, is now in general availability and, for the first time, available in the cuQuantum DGX Appliance, which provides HPC researchers a full quantum simulation stack optimized for deployment on the NVIDIA DGX\u2122 platform. A key element in a rapidly expanding ecosystem, cuQuantum is now integrated as a backend in popular simulators from Google Quantum AI, Xanadu and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. It is also now being offered as a part of quantum application development platforms from Classiq and Zapata Computing, and is being used by QC Ware, Xanadu and others to power quantum research at scale in areas from chemistry to climate modeling.\nSionna\u2122, for 6G physical-layer research, is a new, GPU-accelerated, open-source library, with native support for the integration of neural networks and machine learning. Sionna enables rapid prototyping of complex communication system architectures and adds to NVIDIA\u2019s investment in the wireless domain, which includes Aerial, a unified software-defined platform for delivering AI-on-5G.\r\n\t\n\u201cSionna will transform the way AI/ML-based communication systems are developed in the future,\u201d said Christoph Studer, professor in the Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at ETH Z\u00fcrich. \u201cEven better, it runs incredibly fast on our NVIDIA DGX Station.\u201d\n\n\nRAPIDS\u2122, data science libraries to accelerate drug discovery, social connections, fraud detection and more, is one of NVIDIA\u2019s most popular SDKs with 2 million downloads and leveraged in over 5,000 projects on GitHub. The RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark speeds processing by over 3x with no code changes. With 80 percent of the Fortune 500 using Apache Spark in production, data engineers can transparently accelerate Spark dataframe and SQL operations.\ncuOpt, formerly ReOpt, for logistics optimization research focused on vehicle routing, enables users to route thousands of packages to thousands of locations in \u200bmere seconds with record accuracy \u2014 enabling real-time rerouting and saving potentially billions in delivery costs each year.\nMorpheus, for cybersecurity applications, makes it possible to analyze up to 100 percent of one\u2019s data in real time, for more accurate detection and faster remediation of threats as they occur. F5 achieved 200x performance improvements to its malware detection model, going from 1,013 messages per second to 208,333 messages per second, with just 136 lines of code.\nDGL container, for training graph neural networks, adds algorithm improvements delivering 4x faster end-to-end ETL and training workflows than CPUs in areas such as drug discovery and fraud detection.\nNsight\u2122 Systems, for system-wide visualization of an application\u2019s performance, allows developers to see how GPU-accelerated libraries use system resources, interact with the application and identify optimization opportunities to reduce bottlenecks.\n\nAmong other libraries being updated are MONAI, for medical imaging; NVIDIA FLARE\u2122, for federated learning, with nearly 300,000 downloads; Maxine, for reinventing communications; Riva, for speech AI; Merlin, for recommender systems; and Isaac\u2122, for robotics.\nJoin the 3 million developers already enjoying benefits, such as access to training courses and materials through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, technical talks and tools, by registering for the NVIDIA Developer program.\nTo learn more about CUDA-X libraries, watch the GTC 2022 keynote from NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang.

It consists of the NVIDIA Spectrum-4 switch family, NVIDIA ConnectX\u00ae-7 SmartNIC, NVIDIA BlueField\u00ae-3 DPU\u00a0and the DOCA\u2122 data center infrastructure software to supercharge cloud-native applications at scale.\nBuilt for AI, NVIDIA Spectrum-4 arrives as data centers are growing exponentially and demanding extreme performance, advanced security and powerful features to enable high-performance, advanced virtualization and simulation at scale. The Spectrum-4 Ethernet platform includes key features needed for the uncompromising requirements of these technologies.\nSpectrum-4 switches allow nanosecond timing precision \u2014 which is an improvement of five to six orders of magnitude compared to typical, millisecond-based data centers. They also accelerate, simplify and secure the network fabric with 2x faster per-port bandwidth, 4x fewer switches and 40 percent lower power consumption compared to the previous generation.\nThe Spectrum platform enables the simulation of precise space and time in the NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 platform for 3D design collaboration and simulation and the Spectrum-3 switch fabric connects 32 OVX servers to form the OVX SuperPOD.\n\u201cA new era of massive-scale cloud technologies, such as Omniverse, requires a transformation of data center architecture,\u201d said Kevin Deierling, vice president of Networking at NVIDIA. \u201cThe Spectrum-4 platform\u2019s extreme performance and robust security will equip data centers to power breakthrough discoveries that push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible for the benefit of society.\u201d\nNVIDIA Spectrum-4 Switch Performance and Innovation\r\nThe NVIDIA Spectrum-4 ASIC and SN5000 switch family is based on a 4N process and contains over 100 billion transistors along with a simplified transceiver design that leads to best-in-class power efficiency and total cost of ownership. With 51.2Tbps aggregate ASIC bandwidth supporting 128 ports of 400GbE, combined with adaptive routing and enhanced congestion control mechanisms, Spectrum-4 optimizes RDMA over Converged Ethernet fabrics and dramatically accelerates data centers.\nThe Spectrum-4 ASIC features state-of-the-art security features such as support for MACsec and VXLANsec, plus secure boot as default via hardware root of trust to help ensure the security and integrity of data flows and network management.\nWith 12.8Tbps of encrypted bandwidth and these security features \u2014 also found in BlueField-3 DPUs and ConnectX-7 SmartNICs \u2014 Spectrum-4 is the fastest, most secure end-to-end Ethernet networking platform on the market.\nThe Spectrum platform, inclusive of Spectrum switches, BlueField and ConnectX, boosts performance and scalability for AI applications, digital twins and cloud infrastructure, enabling the highest efficiency and availability for modern data centers.\nGrowing Ecosystem of Spectrum Support\r\nThe speed, security and functionality of the Spectrum platform is ideal for building state-of-the-art data centers and is being adopted by a growing number of partners.\nBlueField DPUs now offload and accelerate Red Hat OpenShift, including an end-to-end cloud-native architecture that integrates tenant and infrastructure clusters with automation and deployment tools capable of running complex containerized workloads.\nBlueField is also central to VMware\u2019s Project Monterey, which includes a collaboration between VMware and NVIDIA that aims to improve the performance, manageability and security of data centers.\nNow select enterprises can get immediate access to VMware\u2019s Project Monterey Early Access with BlueField on NVIDIA LaunchPad. LaunchPad equips IT administrators to deploy data-driven applications for quick testing and prototyping entire workflows on the same complete stack.\nBlueField-2 DPU integration with Palo Alto Networks VM-Series virtual next-generation firewalls and Intelligent Traffic Offload service delivers best-in-class security innovation that results in up to a 5x performance boost to virtual firewalls for enterprise and service provider networks.\nThe Spectrum platform accelerates state-of-the-art data center networking infrastructure for industry-leading customers and software vendors that include Akamai, Baidu, Canonical, Criteo, DDN, F5, Kuaishou, NetApp, Nutanix, OVHcloud, Pure Storage, Pluribus Networks, Red Hat, StackPath, VAST Data, VMware, WEKA and others.\nIndustry-leading server manufacturers integrating Spectrum switches into their systems include Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Lenovo and Supermicro.\nNVIDIA BlueField DPUs are being offered in solutions from innovators that include ASUS, Atos, Dell Technologies, GIGABYTE, H3C, IBM, Inspur, Lenovo, Nettrix, Pluribus Networks, Quanta/QCT and Supermicro.\nThe BlueField-3 DPU and Spectrum-4 switch systems will be available later this year. ConnectX-7 is available now.\nTo learn more about NVIDIA Spectrum, watch the GTC 2022 keynote from NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang.

Fire up your favorite streaming service. Grab a Coke. A demo of the most important visual technology of our time is as close as your living room couch.\nPropelled by an explosion in computing power over the past decade and a half, path tracing has swept through visual media.\nIt brings big effects to the biggest blockbusters, casts subtle light and shadow on the most immersive melodramas and has propelled the art of animation to new levels.\nMore\u2019s coming.\nPath tracing is going real time, unleashing interactive, photorealistic 3D environments filled with dynamic light and shadow, reflections and refractions.\nSo what is path tracing? The big idea behind it is seductively simple, connecting innovators in the arts and sciences over the span half a millennium.\nWhat\u2019s the Difference Between Rasterization and Ray Tracing?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s define some terms, and how they\u2019re used today to create interactive graphics \u2014 graphics that can react in real time to input from a user, such as in video games.\nThe first, rasterization, is a technique that produces an image as seen from a single viewpoint. It\u2019s been at the heart of GPUs from the start. Modern NVIDIA GPUs can generate over 100 billion rasterized pixels per second. That\u2019s made rasterization ideal for real-time graphics, like gaming.\nRay tracing is a more powerful technique than rasterization. Rather than being constrained to finding out what is visible from a single point, it can determine what is visible from many different points, in many different directions. Starting with the NVIDIA Turing architecture, NVIDIA GPUs have provided specialized RTX hardware to accelerate this difficult computation. Today, a single GPU can trace billions of rays per second.\nBeing able to trace all of those rays makes it possible to simulate how light scatters in the real world much more accurately than is possible with rasterization. However, we still must answer the questions, how will we simulate light and how will we bring that simulation to the GPU?\nWhat\u2019s Ray Tracing? Just Follow the String\nTo better answer that question, it helps to understand how we got here.\nDavid Luebke, NVIDIA vice president of graphics research, likes to begin the story in the 16th century with Albrecht D\u00fcrer \u2014 one of the most important figures of the Northern European Renaissance \u2014 who used string and weights to replicate a 3D image on a 2D surface.\nD\u00fcrer made it his life\u2019s work to bring classical and contemporary mathematics together with the arts, achieving breakthroughs in expressiveness and realism.\nThe string\u2019s the thing: Albrecht D\u00fcrer was the first to describe what\u2019s now known as \u201cray tracing,\u201d a technique for creating accurate representations of 3D objects on a 2D surfaces in Underweysung der Messung (Nuremberg, 1525),f15\nIn 1525 with Treatise on Measurement, D\u00fcrer was the first to describe the idea of ray tracing. Seeing how D\u00fcrer described the idea is the easiest way to get your head around the concept.\nJust think about how light illuminates the world we see around us.\nNow imagine tracing those rays of light backward from the eye with a piece of string like the one D\u00fcrer used, to the objects that light interacts with. That\u2019s ray tracing.\nRay Tracing for Computer Graphics\nTurner Whitted\u2019s 1979 paper, \u201cAn improved illumination model for shaded display,\u201d jump-started a ray-tracing renaissance.\nIn 1969, more than 400 years after D\u00fcrer\u2019s death, IBM\u2019s Arthur Appel showed how the idea of ray tracing could be brought to computer graphics, applying it to computing visibility and shadows.\nA decade later, Turner Whitted was the first to show how this idea could capture reflection, shadows and refraction, explaining how the seemingly simple concept could make much more sophisticated computer graphics possible. Progress was rapid in the following few years.\nIn 1984, Lucasfilm\u2019s Robert Cook, Thomas Porter and Loren Carpenter detailed how ray tracing could incorporate many common filmmaking techniques \u2014 including motion blur, depth of field, penumbras, translucency and fuzzy reflections \u2014 that were, until then, unattainable in computer graphics.\nJim Kajiya\u2019s 1986 paper, \u201cThe Rendering Equation,\u201d not only outlined an elegant, physics-based equation for describing how light moves around in a scene, it outlined an efficient way to put it to work.\nTwo years later, CalTech professor Jim Kajiya\u2019s crisp, seven-page paper, \u201cThe Rendering Equation,\u201d connected computer graphics with physics by way of ray tracing and introduced the path-tracing algorithm, which makes it possible to accurately represent the way light scatters throughout a scene.\nWhat\u2019s Path Tracing?\nIn developing path tracing, Kajiya turned to an unlikely inspiration: the study of radiative heat transfer, or how heat spreads throughout an environment. Ideas from that field led him to introduce the rendering equation, which describes how light passes through the air and scatters from surfaces.\n\nThe rendering equation is concise, but not easy to solve. Computer graphics scenes are complex, with billions of triangles not being unusual today. There\u2019s no way to solve the rendering equation directly, which led to Kajiya\u2019s second crucial innovation.\nKajiya showed that statistical techniques could be used to solve the rendering equation: even if it isn\u2019t solved directly, it\u2019s possible to solve it along the paths of individual rays. If it is solved along the path of enough rays to approximate the lighting in the scene accurately, photorealistic images are possible.\nAnd how is the rendering equation solved along the path of a ray? Ray tracing.\nThe statistical techniques Kajiya applied are known as Monte Carlo integration and date to the earliest days of computers in the 1940s. Developing improved Monte Carlo algorithms for path tracing remains an open research problem to this day; NVIDIA researchers are at the forefront of this area, regularly publishing new techniques that improve the efficiency of path tracing.\nBy putting these two ideas together \u2014 a physics-based equation for describing the way light moves around a scene \u2014 and the use of Monte Carlo simulation to help choose a manageable number of paths back to a light source, Kajiya outlined the fundamental techniques that would become the standard for generating photorealistic computer-generated images.\nHis approach transformed a field dominated by a variety of disparate rendering techniques into one that \u2014 because it mirrored the physics of the way light moved through the real world \u2014 could put simple, powerful algorithms to work that could be applied to reproduce a large number of visual effects with stunning levels of realism.\nPath Tracing Comes to the Movies\nIn the years after its introduction in 1987, path tracing was seen as an elegant technique \u2014 the most accurate approach known \u2014 but it was completely impractical. The images in Kajiya\u2019s original paper were just 256 by 256 pixels, yet they took over 7 hours to render on an expensive mini-computer that was far more powerful than the computers available to most other people.\nBut with the increase in computing power driven by Moore\u2019s law \u2014 which described the exponential increase in computing power driven by advances that allowed chipmakers to double the number of transistors on microprocessors every 18 months \u2014 the technique became more and more practical.\nBeginning with movies such as 1998\u2019s A Bug\u2019s Life, ray tracing was used to enhance the computer-generated imagery in more and more motion pictures. And in 2006, the first entirely path-traced movie, Monster House, stunned audiences. It was rendered using the Arnold software that was co-developed at Solid Angle SL (since acquired by Autodesk) and Sony Pictures Imageworks.\nThe film was a hit \u2014 grossing more than $140 million worldwide. And it opened eyes about what a new generation of computer animation could do. As more computing power became available, more movies came to rely on the technique, producing images that are often indistinguishable from those captured by a camera.\nThe problem: it still takes hours to render a single image and sprawling collections of servers \u2014 known as \u201crender farms\u201d \u2014 are running continuously to render images for months in order to make a complete movie. Bringing that to real-time graphics would take an extraordinary leap.\nWhat Does This Look Like in Gaming?\nFor many years, the idea of path tracing in games was impossible to imagine. While many game developers would have agreed that they would want to use path tracing if it had the performance necessary for real-time graphics, the performance was so far off of real time that path tracing seemed unattainable.\nYet as GPUs have continued to become faster and faster, and now with the widespread availability of RTX hardware, real-time path tracing is in sight. Just as movies began incorporating some ray-tracing techniques before shifting to path tracing \u2014 games have started by putting ray tracing to work in a limited way.\nRight now a growing number of games are partially ray traced. They combine traditional rasterization-based rendering techniques with some ray-tracing effects.\nSo what does path traced mean in this context? It could mean a mix of techniques. Game developers could rasterize the primary ray, and then path trace the lighting for the scene.\nRasterization is equivalent to casting one set of rays from a single point that stops at the first thing they hit. Ray tracing takes this further, casting rays from many points in any direction. Path tracing simulates the true physics of light, which uses ray tracing as one component of a larger light simulation system.\nThis would mean all lights in a scene are sampled stochastically \u2014 using Monte Carlo or other techniques \u2014 both for direct illumination, to light objects or characters, and for global illumination, to light rooms or environments with indirect lighting.\nTo do that, rather than tracing a ray back through one bounce, rays would be traced over multiple bounces, presumably back to their light source, just as Kajiya outlined.\nA few games are doing this already, and the results are stunning.\nMicrosoft has released a plugin that puts path tracing to work in Minecraft.\nQuake II, the classic shooter \u2014 often a sandbox for advanced graphics techniques \u2014 can also be fully path traced, thanks to a new plugin.\n\nThere\u2019s clearly more to be done. And game developers will need to know customers have the computing power they need to experience path-traced gaming.\nGaming is the most challenging visual computing project of all: requiring high visual quality and the speed to interact with fast-twitch gamers.\nExpect techniques pioneered here to spill out to every aspect of our digital lives.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nAs GPUs continue to grow more powerful, putting path tracing to work is the next logical step.\nFor example, armed with tools such as Arnold from Autodesk, V-Ray from Chaos Group or Pixar\u2019s Renderman \u2014 and powerful GPUs \u2014 product designers and architects use ray tracing to generate photorealistic mockups of their products in seconds, letting them collaborate better and skip expensive prototyping.\nAs GPUs offer ever more computing power, video games are the next frontier for ray tracing and path tracing.\nIn 2018, NVIDIA announced NVIDIA RTX, a ray-tracing technology that brings real-time, movie-quality rendering to game developers.\nNVIDIA RTX, which includes a ray-tracing engine running on NVIDIA Ampere and Turing architecture GPUs, supports ray-tracing through a variety of interfaces.\nAnd NVIDIA has partnered with Microsoft to enable full RTX support via Microsoft\u2019s new DirectX Raytracing (DXR) API.\nSince then, NVIDIA has continued to develop NVIDIA RTX technology, as more and more developers create games that support real-time ray tracing.\nMinecraft even includes support for real-time path tracing, turning the blocky, immersive world into immersive landscapes swathed with light and shadow.\nThanks to increasingly powerful hardware, and a proliferation of software tools and related technologies, more is coming.\nAs a result, digital experiences \u2014 games, virtual worlds and even online collaboration tools \u2014 will take on the cinematic qualities of a Hollywood blockbuster.\nSo don\u2019t get too comfy. What you\u2019re seeing from your living room couch is just a demo of what\u2019s to come in the world all around us.\n\nLearn more about the NVIDIA RTX Path Tracing SDK.\nWatch our \u201cResearch Advances Toward Real-time Path Tracing\u201d session on demand.\u00a0\nFor a deep dive into ray tracing, dig into Ray Tracing Gems and Ray Tracing Gems II.\u00a0\nCheck out \u201cPhysically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation,\u201d by Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob and Greg Humphreys.

In memoization, the answers to these sub-problems \u2014 which are reused several times when solving the main problem \u2014 are stored. Memoization increases efficiency, so sub-problems don\u2019t need to be recomputed when needed later on in the main problem.\nDPX instructions accelerate dynamic programming algorithms by up to 7x on an NVIDIA H100 GPU, compared with NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based GPUs. In a node with four NVIDIA H100 GPUs, that acceleration can be boosted even further.\nUse Cases Span Healthcare, Robotics, Quantum Computing, Data Science\nDynamic programming is commonly used in many optimization, data processing and omics algorithms. To date, most developers have run these kinds of algorithms on CPUs or FPGAs \u2014 but can unlock dramatic speedups using DPX instructions on NVIDIA Hopper GPUs.\nOmics\u00a0\nOmics covers a range of biological fields including genomics (focused on DNA), proteomics (focused on proteins) and transcriptomics (focused on RNA). These fields, which inform the critical work of disease research and drug discovery, all rely on algorithmic analyses that can be sped up with DPX instructions.\nFor example, the Smith-Waterman and Needleman-Wunsch dynamic programming algorithms are used for DNA sequence alignment, protein classification and protein folding. Both use a scoring method to measure how well genetic sequences from different samples align.\nSmith-Waterman produces highly accurate results, but takes more compute resources and time than other alignment methods. By using DPX instructions on a node with four NVIDIA H100 GPUs, scientists can speed this process 35x to achieve real-time processing, where the work of base calling and alignment takes place at the same rate as DNA sequencing.\nThis acceleration will help democratize genomic analysis in hospitals worldwide, bringing scientists closer to providing patients with personalized medicine.\nRoute Optimization\nFinding the optimal route for multiple moving pieces is essential for autonomous robots moving through a dynamic warehouse, or even a sender transferring data to multiple receivers in a computer network.\nTo tackle this optimization problem, developers rely on Floyd-Warshall, a dynamic programming algorithm used to find the shortest distances between all pairs of destinations in a map or graph. In a server with four NVIDIA H100 GPUs, Floyd-Warshall acceleration is boosted 40x compared to a traditional dual-socket CPU-only server.\nPaired with the NVIDIA cuOpt AI logistics software, this speedup in routing optimization could be used for real-time applications in factories, autonomous vehicles, or mapping and routing algorithms in abstract graphs.\n\nQuantum Simulation\nCountless other dynamic programming algorithms could be accelerated on NVIDIA H100 GPUs with DPX instructions. One promising field is quantum computing, where dynamic programming is used in tensor optimization algorithms for quantum simulation. DPX instructions could help developers accelerate the process of identifying the right tensor contraction order.\nSQL Query Optimization\nAnother potential application is in data science. Data scientists working with the SQL programming language often need to perform several \u201cjoin\u201d operations on a set of tables.\u00a0 Dynamic programming helps find an optimal order for these joins, often saving orders of magnitude in execution time and thus speeding up SQL queries.\nLearn more about the NVIDIA Hopper GPU architecture.

It also includes Omniverse Create, an app for technical designers, artists and creators to interactively build 3D worlds in real time; and View, an app for non-technical users to view Omniverse scenes streaming full simulation and rendering capabilities using the NVIDIA GeForce NOW\u2122 platform, powered by NVIDIA RTX\u2122 GPUs in the cloud.\n\u201cDesigners working remotely collaborate as if in the same studio. Factory planners work inside a digital twin of the real plant to design a new production flow. Software engineers test a new software build on the digital twin of a self-driving car before releasing it to the fleet. A new wave of work is coming that can only be done in virtual worlds,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cOmniverse Cloud will connect tens of millions of designers and creators, and billions of future AIs and robotic systems.\u201d\nUsing Omniverse Cloud, creators can iterate, share and collaborate on models stored in Nucleus Cloud from anywhere, and instantly invite other collaborators to join a session by sending a link. Users or teams without high-end GeForce\u00ae or NVIDIA RTX systems \u2014 or the desire to stand up IT infrastructure \u2014 can take advantage of the full powers of Omniverse Create and View simply by subscribing to the Omniverse Cloud program.\nIn his keynote address at NVIDIA GTC, Huang showed a demo of the future of design featuring three human designers and one specialist Omniverse Avatar AI designer collaborating virtually in Omniverse Cloud, making design changes to an architectural project.\nThe team conversed using a standard web conferencing tool, while connected in a scene hosted in Nucleus Cloud. One human designer ran the Omniverse View app on their RTX-powered workstation, while the other two streamed Omniverse View from GeForce NOW to their laptop and tablet.\n\u201cAt KPF, a global leader in architectural design, we value the ability of our designers to collaborate as seamlessly as possible by making cloud-first technologies available to them when they need it,\u201d said Cobus Bothma, director of Applied Research at Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates. \u201cOmniverse Cloud fits perfectly into that practice with the promise of excelling our visual and 3D design collaboration abilities by enabling our teams to work in Omniverse from any device, anywhere.\u201d\nThe full Omniverse Cloud collection of services is under development. Nucleus Cloud for one-click simple sharing is accepting applications for early access.\nTo learn more about NVIDIA Omniverse, watch Huang\u2019s GTC 2022 keynote.

NVLink-C2C is now open for semi-custom silicon-level integration with NVIDIA technology.\nNVIDIA NVLink-C2C supports the Arm\u00ae AMBA\u00ae Coherent Hub Interface (AMBA CHI) protocol. NVIDIA and Arm are working closely together to enhance AMBA CHI to support fully coherent and secure accelerators with other interconnected processors.\n\u201cAs the future of CPU design is increasingly accelerated and multichip, it is critical to support chiplet-based SoCs across the ecosystem,\u201d said Chris Bergey, senior vice president and general manager of the Infrastructure Line of Business at Arm. \u201cArm is supporting a broad set of connectivity standards and designing our AMBA CHI protocol to support these future technologies, including collaborating with NVIDIA on NVLink-C2C to address use cases like coherent connectivity between CPUs, GPUs and DPUs.\u201d\nNVIDIA NVLink-C2C is built on top of NVIDIA\u2019s world-class SERDES and LINK design technology, and it is extensible from PCB-level integrations and multichip modules to silicon interposer and wafer-level connections, delivering extremely high bandwidth while optimizing for energy and die area efficiency.\nIn addition to NVLink-C2C, NVIDIA will also support the developing Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) standard announced earlier this month. Custom silicon integration with NVIDIA chips can either use the UCIe standard or NVLink-C2C, which is optimized for lower latency, higher bandwidth and greater power efficiency.\nSome of NVLink-C2C\u2019s key features include:\n\nHigh Bandwidth \u2013 supporting high-bandwidth coherent data transfers between processors and accelerators\nLow Latency \u2013 supporting atomics between processors and accelerators to perform fast synchronization and high-frequency updates to shared data\nLow Power and High Density \u2013 using advanced packaging, it is 25x more energy efficient and 90x more area-efficient than PCIe Gen 5 on NVIDIA chips\nIndustry-Standard Support \u2013 works with Arm\u2019s AMBA CHI or CXL industry-standard protocols for interoperability between devices\n\nTo learn more about NVIDIA NVLink C2C, watch NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote address at GTC 2022.

Block storage also has an important role to play inside the DOCA software framework that runs on our DPUs.\n\u201cThe Excelero team is joining NVIDIA as demand is surging for high-performance computing and AI,\u201d said Yaniv Romem, CEO and co-founder of Excelero. \u201cWe\u2019ll be working with NVIDIA to ensure our existing customers are supported, and going forward we\u2019re thrilled to apply our expertise in block storage to NVIDIA\u2019s world-class AI and HPC platforms,\u201d he added.\nFounded in 2014, Excelero developed NVMesh, software that manages and secures virtual arrays of NVMe flash drives as block storage available across public and private clouds.\nExcelero\u2019s software has won praise from users for its high throughput, low latency and support for Kubernetes containers. It\u2019s also attracted collaborations with major cloud service providers.\nThe company has been an NVIDIA partner since its early days, attracting the former Mellanox, now part of NVIDIA, as an investor. We collaborated on accelerating storage with RDMA, a key technology at the heart of both InfiniBand and RoCE (Ethernet) networks.\nNVIDIA will continue to support Excelero\u2019s customers by honoring its contracts. Looking ahead, Excelero\u2019s technology will be integrated into NVIDIA\u2019s enterprise software stack.\nWe welcome this world-class engineering team to NVIDIA.\n\n\nCategories: CorporateTags: High-Performance Computing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It enables researchers to model complex systems, such as extreme weather events, with higher speed and accuracy when compared to previous AI models.\nThe company showed two example applications of the technology. The NVIDIA FourCastNet physics-ML model emulates global weather patterns and predicts extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, with greater confidence and up to 45,000x faster than traditional numerical prediction models. In addition, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy is using AI to optimize wind turbine design.\n\u201cAccelerated computing with AI at data center scale has the potential to deliver millionfold increases in performance to tackle challenges, such as mitigating climate change, discovering drugs and finding new sources of renewable energy,\u201d said Ian Buck, vice president of Accelerated Computing at NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s AI-enabled framework for scientific digital twins equips researchers to pursue solutions to these massive problems.\u201d\nNVIDIA Modulus and Omniverse\r\nNVIDIA Modulus takes both data and the governing physics into account to train a neural network that creates an AI surrogate model for digital twins. The surrogate can then infer new system behavior in real time, enabling dynamic and iterative workflows. Integration with Omniverse brings visualization and real-time interactive exploration.\nThe latest release of Modulus allows data-driven training using the Fourier neural operator, a framework enabling AI to solve related partial differential equations simultaneously. It also integrates ML models with weather and climate data, such as the ERA5 dataset from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.\nComplementing Modulus, NVIDIA Omniverse is a real-time virtual world simulation and 3D design collaboration platform. It enables the real-time visualization and interactive exploration of digital twins using the output surrogate model from Modulus.\nNVIDIA FourCastNet \r\nFourier neural operators and transformers enable the NVIDIA FourCastNet physics-ML model, trained on 10TB of Earth system data. As a step toward Earth-2 \u2013 the system announced by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang to create a digital twin of Earth in Omniverse \u2013 FourCastNet emulates and predicts the behavior and risks of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and atmospheric rivers with greater confidence and up to 45,000x faster.\n\u201cDigital twins allow researchers and decision-makers to interact with data and rapidly explore what-if scenarios, which are nearly impossible with traditional modeling techniques because they\u2019re expensive and time consuming,\u201d said Karthik Kashinath, senior developer technology scientist and engineer at NVIDIA. \u201cCentral to Earth-2, NVIDIA\u2019s FourCastNet enables the development of Earth\u2019s digital twin by emulating the physics and dynamics of global weather faster and more accurately.\u201d\nSiemens Gamesa Renewable Energy\r\nThe digital twins platform is also turbocharging simulation research for the layout of wind farms equipped with Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy wind turbines, making it possible for the first time to use AI to accurately model the effects of turbine placement on their performance in a wide variety of weather scenarios. This is expected to lead to optimized wind park layouts capable of producing up to 20 percent more power than previous designs.\n\u201cThe collaboration between Siemens Gamesa and NVIDIA has meant a great step forward in accelerating both the computational speed and the deployment speed of our latest algorithms development in such a complex field as computational fluid dynamics, and set the foundations for a strong partnership in the future,\u201d said Sergio Dominguez, onshore digital portfolio manager at Siemens Gamesa.\nTo learn more about NVIDIA\u2019s digital twins platform for scientific computing, watch the GTC 2022 keynote from Jensen Huang.

New features for game developers include updates to Omniverse Audio2Face\u2122, Omniverse Nucleus Cloud and Omniverse DeepSearch, as well as the introduction of Unreal Engine 5 Omniverse Connector.\n\u201cOmniverse provides a powerful development pipeline that addresses the challenges of doing business in today\u2019s world,\u201d said Frank DeLise, vice president of Omniverse at NVIDIA. \u201cIts ability to unify artists, art, tools and applications under a single platform can inspire collaboration among even the most dispersed game development organization.\u201d\nA Powerful, More Collaborative Game Creation Environment\r\nGame development pipelines are becoming increasingly complex as artists and designers work to exceed gamers\u2019 expectations for enormous, immersive worlds. Global teams of artists work to build massive libraries of 3D content \u2014 a labor-intensive, time-consuming process made more challenging when incorporating realistic lighting, life-like physics and AI-powered technologies.\nOmniverse addresses these challenges and helps game developers build photorealistic, physically accurate games more seamlessly by connecting artists, their assets, and software tools in one powerful platform. The collaborative aspect of Omniverse can dramatically decrease iteration time on critical design decisions, expediting project completion.\nOmniverse is a multi-GPU-enabled open platform for 3D design collaboration and real-time physically accurate simulation. It runs on any NVIDIA RTX device \u2014 from a laptop to a server \u2014 transforming complex 3D production workflows. Omniverse is built on Pixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description (USD), an easily extensible, open-source 3D scene description and file format for content creation and interchange among most popular major game development tools. NVIDIA has expanded upon USD by developing new tools, integrating technologies and providing samples and tutorials.\nGame creators, designers, artists and developers can unite their assets, libraries, software applications and game engines within Omniverse, freely iterate on design concepts in real time, build tools to enhance productivity and instantly share breathtaking, high-fidelity models.\nOmniverse for Game Developers\r\nThe Omniverse platform is designed for maximum flexibility and scalability. Developers can easily build their own tools using the platform\u2019s modular building blocks. Game developers can use the ready-made Omniverse Apps, with many more being built by third parties.\nComponents featured in the Omniverse platform for game developers include:\n\nOmniverse Audio2Face, an NVIDIA AI-powered application that enables character artists to generate high-quality facial animation from just an audio file. Audio2Face now supports full facial animation and artists will have the ability to control the emotion of the performance as well. With Audio2Face game developers can quickly and easily add realistic expressions to their game characters, which can facilitate a stronger emotional connection between the gamer and the game characters, expanding immersion.\nOmniverse Nucleus Cloud, now in early access, enables one-click simple sharing of Omniverse scenes, removing the need to deploy Nucleus locally or in a private cloud. With Nucleus Cloud, game developers can easily share and collaborate in real time on 3D assets among internal and external development teams.\nOmniverse DeepSearch, an AI-enabled service now available for Omniverse Enterprise subscribers, that allows game developers to use natural language inputs and imagery to instantly search through their entire catalog of untagged 3D assets, objects and characters.\nOmniverse Connectors are plugins that enable \u201clive sync\u201d collaborative workflows between third-party design tools and Omniverse. The new Unreal Engine 5 Omniverse Connector allows game artists to exchange USD and material definition language data between the game engine and Omniverse.\n\nLearn more about NVIDIA Omniverse.

A Civmec-led consortium, Civmec SWC WSP Alliance, has been selected as the preferred proponent for the design and construction of The Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridge in the Perth metropolitan area. The project comprises two cable-stayed bridges and approach embankments, connecting Victoria Park foreshore with Heirisson Island and the Perth central business district.  The scope of work includes the completion of the architectural and engineering design, community and stakeholder engagement as well as fabrication and transportation to site of approximately 1,500 tons of complex steel structure from Civmec\u2019s heavy engineering facility in Henderson, among others. The company said the project will be delivered in an alliance model, directly involving the consortium and the related state government body. The consortium will continue to work with Main Roads Western Australia to finalise the project alliance agreement and negotiate remaining outstanding matters with the final award targeted in the coming months. The anticipated share of the works attributable to Civmec is approximately $55 million. Site works are planned to commence in Q32022 with project completion anticipated for Q32024 (calendar year). \u201cHaving already been extensively involved in so many of Perth\u2019s iconic structures, we look forward to working with our client and our consortium partners to deliver this important piece of infrastructure, while ensuring the community has a bridge that will be enjoyed by so many for future generations and will recognise the important Aboriginal history of the area,\u201d said Civmec CEO Patrick Tallon.  Once the contract is finalised and awarded, coupled with other recent maintenance contract wins and extensions, the group\u2019s order book will remain over A$1.1 billion. Shares in Civmec closed flat at 65 cents on March 17.

Today, AI researchers are working on the opposite: turning a collection of still images into a digital 3D scene in a matter of seconds.\nKnown as inverse rendering, the process uses AI to approximate how light behaves in the real world, enabling researchers to reconstruct a 3D scene from a handful of 2D images taken at different angles. The NVIDIA Research team has developed an approach that accomplishes this task almost instantly \u2014 making it one of the first models of its kind to combine ultra-fast neural network training and rapid rendering.\nNVIDIA applied this approach to a popular new technology called neural radiance fields, or NeRF. The result, dubbed Instant NeRF, is the fastest NeRF technique to date, achieving more than 1,000x speedups in some cases. The model requires just seconds to train on a few dozen still photos\u00a0 \u2014 plus data on the camera angles they were taken from \u2014 and can then render the resulting 3D scene within tens of milliseconds.\n\u201cIf traditional 3D representations like polygonal meshes are akin to vector images, NeRFs are like bitmap images: they densely capture the way light radiates from an object or within a scene,\u201d says David Luebke, vice president for graphics research at NVIDIA. \u201cIn that sense, Instant NeRF could be as important to 3D as digital cameras and JPEG compression have been to 2D photography \u2014 vastly increasing the speed, ease and reach of 3D capture and sharing.\u201d\nShowcased in a session at NVIDIA GTC this week, Instant NeRF could be used to create avatars or scenes for virtual worlds, to capture video conference participants and their environments in 3D, or to reconstruct scenes for 3D digital maps.\nIn a tribute to the early days of Polaroid images, NVIDIA Research recreated an iconic photo of Andy Warhol taking an instant photo, turning it into a 3D scene using Instant NeRF.\n\nWhat Is a NeRF?\u00a0\nNeRFs use neural networks to represent and render realistic 3D scenes based on an input collection of 2D images.\nCollecting data to feed a NeRF is a bit like being a red carpet photographer trying to capture a celebrity\u2019s outfit from every angle \u2014 the neural network requires a few dozen images taken from multiple positions around the scene, as well as the camera position of each of those shots.\nIn a scene that includes people or other moving elements, the quicker these shots are captured, the better. If there\u2019s too much motion during the 2D image capture process, the AI-generated 3D scene will be blurry.\nFrom there, a NeRF essentially fills in the blanks, training a small neural network to reconstruct the scene by predicting the color of light radiating in any direction, from any point in 3D space. The technique can even work around occlusions \u2014 when objects seen in some images are blocked by obstructions such as pillars in other images.\nAccelerating 1,000x With Instant NeRF\nWhile estimating the depth and appearance of an object based on a partial view is a natural skill for humans, it\u2019s a demanding task for AI.\nCreating a 3D scene with traditional methods takes hours or longer, depending on the complexity and resolution of the visualization. Bringing AI into the picture speeds things up. Early NeRF models rendered crisp scenes without artifacts in a few minutes, but still took hours to train.\nInstant NeRF, however, cuts rendering time by several orders of magnitude. It relies on a technique developed by NVIDIA called multi-resolution hash grid encoding, which is optimized to run efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs. Using a new input encoding method, researchers can achieve high-quality results using a tiny neural network that runs rapidly.\nThe model was developed using the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit and the Tiny CUDA Neural Networks library. Since it\u2019s a lightweight neural network, it can be trained and run on a single NVIDIA GPU \u2014 running fastest on cards with NVIDIA Tensor Cores.\nThe technology could be used to train robots and self-driving cars to understand the size and shape of real-world objects by capturing 2D images or video footage of them. It could also be used in architecture and entertainment to rapidly generate digital representations of real environments that creators can modify and build on.\nBeyond NeRFs, NVIDIA researchers are exploring how this input encoding technique might be used to accelerate multiple AI challenges including reinforcement learning, language translation and general-purpose deep learning algorithms.\nVisit the NVIDIA Technical Blog for a tutorial on getting started with Instant NeRF.\nTo hear more about the latest NVIDIA research, watch the replay of CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote address at GTC below.\n\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ResearchTags: 3D | Artificial Intelligence | GTC 2022 | NVIDIA Research | Rendering \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The transacted price works out to $2,364 psf, which is the highest psf price achieved to date in the private landed housing enclave that includes Chee Hoon Avenue, Jalan Asuhan and University Road-University Walk. This quiet residential enclave is located just off Dunearn Road-Bukit Timah Road in prime District 11.  According to a property title search, the buyer of the bungalow at Jalan Bahasa is Sandeep Malik, Asia Pacific executive chairman for British-American insurance brokers and risk managers Aon. He previously served as CEO of the firm's Commercial Risk, Health, and Affinity businesses in Asia Pacific from September 2018 to July 2021. He had joined Aon in 2010 as CEO Asia for Aon Risk Solutions. Before joining Aon, Malik was based in Hong Kong, where he was CFO Asia for Prudential Corporation Asia.    Swimming pool on the first level of the house (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Stephen Ho, vice-president of residential services at CBRE Singapore, the exclusive marketing agent for the property, represented the sellers in the deal. He declined to comment on the identity of the buyer. The bungalow at Jalan Bahasa was placed on the market for sale last November at an asking price of $27 million. The transacted price is therefore just 6.48% below the asking price. \u201cPersonally, I think it\u2019s a fair price,\u201d says Ho. \u201cThere currently isn\u2019t any property on the market of such a calibre in terms of design, finishing and location.\u201d Read more: Bungalow at Jalan Bahasa on the market for $27 mil    Source: EdgeProp Inspector  The bungalow at Jalan Bahasa has a built-up area of 8,531 sq ft and sits on an elevated freehold site of 10,682 sq ft, the result of the amalgamation of two smaller plots. The house was designed by award-winning Singapore-based architectural firm K2LD and completed in 2014. Besides a spacious living and dining area, the house comes with an entertainment and recreational area in the basement which has a courtyard garden. The swimming pool is on the first level, accessible directly from the living room. There is a private wing of the house with rooms that can be turned into a library, study or home office on the first level and four en suite bedrooms, including the master bedroom on the second level.   Story continues   The living room of the house with a view of the pool (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)According to Ho, the buyer is unlikely to redevelop or undertake extensive additions and alterations to the property as it has been well-maintained by the sellers. \u201cFrom my understanding, the new owners are going to keep the house untouched as it is what they have been looking for,\u201d he says.Check out the latest listings near Jalan Bahasa, University Road, University WalkSee Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) Bungalow plot at 5 Oxley Rise on the market for $300 mil Conservation bungalow at Mountbatten Road, now Sing Hoe Hotel, for sale at $27 mil  Rare colonial-style bungalow filled with English and oriental antiques En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

As such, many people are probably thinking of ways to minimise the downpayment of a dream home, such as taking up a bigger mortgage, as property prices can be extremely high.  This is especially true in scenarios where one fails to meet the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) and is looking at alternative ways to increase their borrowing capacity. In such cases, pledging an asset can be a handy option to augment your income and increase your borrowings, bringing them a step closer to their dream home. But even when pledging assets, there are different ways to go about this too. In this article, we sought the expertise of PropertyGuru Finance mortgage experts Ethan Ng and Ben Goh to learn more about the role of asset pledging in home loans, with a specific focus on unpledged assets. The Role of Asset Pledging in Home Loans   pledging-asset-to-boost   Essentially, the main point of pledging an asset is to boost your borrowing capacity so that you can minimise the upfront downpayment by borrowing a larger amount to finance your dream property. There are four kinds of assets that you can pledge to qualify for home loans:  Classification of assetsExample Eligible financial assetsCash deposits, bonds, unit trusts, listed company shares Liquid assetsUn-encumbered funds to draw on at any time Pledged assetsCash deposited in a fixed deposit with the mortgage lender for 48 months (from the start of the loan) Unpledged assetsCash deposits that do not have to be placed with the mortgage lender for 48 months  Particularly after the latest property cooling measures were announced in December 2021, and with the TDSR further reduced to 55%, you may find yourself experiencing some difficulties when trying to meet the TDSR criteria. You may calculate your TDSR based on the formula below: TDSR = (Total monthly debt obligations* / gross monthly income**) x 100% *Monthly debt obligations to be included: Property-related loans (including the loan being applied for) Car loans Student loans Renovation loans Credit card loans Any other secured or unsecured loans (including revolving loans)   **Before tax and excluding any CPF contributions made by the employer. As Ethan shares, some find that their \u201cincome may not be sufficient to take up a loan at times. However, with assets such as liquid cash, stocks, and equities on hand, you would be able to present these assets to the bank to obtain a higher loan amount\u201d. In this case, asset pledging is beneficial as they are computed as a source of \u2018additional\u2019 income for you to meet the 55% TDSR criteria.   Story continues Haircut on Asset TypesA haircut refers to a \u2018discount\u2019 in the value of your assets and can range from 0% to 70%, depending on the tenure of your pledging. For example, if you pledge your liquid assets with the bank for a minimum of four years, it is recognised at 100% of its value with no haircut, provided the bank is financing your property.On the other hand, if you pledge your assets for less than four years or opt for unpledged assets, you will incur a hefty 70% haircut on your asset value! The following table summarises the types of eligible assets and their respective haircuts: Eligible financial assetsPledged for a minimum of 4 yearsPledged for less than 4 years or unpledged Liquid assets(e.g. Singapore dollars and coins, including deposits)Minimum 0% haircutMinimum 70% haircut Other financial assets:Foreign currency notes and coins, including deposits Collective investment schemes Business trusts Debentures Stocks Structured deposits Gold Minimum 30% haircutMinimum 70% haircut Source: Monetary Authority of SingaporeHowever, do keep in mind that not all banks accept asset pledging, with some preferring conventional downpayment and income. So, remember to check with your bank to avoid any late surprises!The Case for Unpledged Assets in Qualifying for Home LoansAt first glance, unpledged assets may seem more advantageous than pledged assets, given the flexibility of cash flow without locking in your deposits for 48 months. This may be an option if you have plans to use the funds in the near future and cannot commit for the duration. As Ben shares, \u201cindividuals can explore the option of unpledged assets if they have available cash in hand\u201d. This flexibility will afford you more room to plan for your other financial commitments and obligations!However, the trade-off for this financial flexibility is that unpledged assets will only constitute up to 30% of \u2018additional\u2019 income compared to pledged assets, meaning that your monthly gross income will see a meagre growth compared to pledging it with your lender.Additionally, while unpledged assets \u201cdo not require a lock-in of funds, banks would generally require to see the funds twice: during the loan application, and before loan disbursement,\u201d mentions Ethan.Let us look at the formulas for converting pledged and unpledged assets to income.Pledged assets: Monthly gross income derived from asset = Asset Value / 48Hence, if you decide to pledge $20,000 in assets with a bank for four years, no haircut is applied, so its full value will be recognised when computing your income, which translates to an additional $416 per month, that can be used to meet the 55% TDSR criteria.For unpledged assets, the formula is as follows:Monthly gross income derived from asset = (Asset Value x 30%) / 48For the same $20,000 deposit, your monthly income will be increased by only $125 because of the 30% haircut.Here, we have an example to see the different amounts needed for pledged and unpledged assets in the event an applicant fails to meet the TDSR:Say you are jointly purchasing a private property with your spouse and drawing a fixed monthly salary of $3,000, with a personal loan of $500 per month. Your spouse earns a fixed monthly salary of $9,000 and has a car loan repayment of $1,200 per month. Both of you are taking up a 75% loan for your first property of $2,000,000, with a monthly instalment of $7,329.TDSR = ($500 + $1,200 + $7,329 / $3,000 + $9,000) x 100%= ($9,029 / $12,000) x 100%= 75%As your TDSR exceeds the 55% threshold, you are not eligible to borrow that amount unless you do something.However, if you and your spouse decide to pledge cash with the bank to qualify for the home loan, the amount of money you will need to pledge can be calculated by reducing the TDSR percentage from 75% to 55%.Income required to pass TDSR = $9,029 / 0.55= $16,416Income shortfall = $16,416 \u2013 $12,000= $4,416Cash (pledged) = $4,416 x 48= $211,968Therefore, you and your spouse will need to pledge a minimum of $211,968 to qualify for the mortgage loan. While, the unpledged method will amount to $706,560 ($211,968 / 0.3) and have to be shown to the bank twice, as mentioned earlier.Although not pledging your deposits may permit greater flexibility in deploying your funds in the future, it will have little help on your home loan application. This is because the calculation for unpledged deposits only recognises up to 30% of its value, which will result in a marginal increase.To Pledge or Not Pledge Assets for Home Loans?  securing-ideal-home-loan  When it comes to securing your ideal home loan, the various restrictions and limits can be perplexing. Depending on the TDSR, your financial obligations like your debts and personal income will determine whether you may need to tap on your assets (pledged or unpledged) to augment your borrowing capacity.Alternatively, if you manage to pay off and reduce the size of your debts or increase your income, you may be able to qualify for the TDSR, having no need to use your assets to augment your income.But should you decide to tap into your assets to boost your financial standings to qualify for a larger loan, you can choose to pledge your assets or trade that off for more financial flexibility but at a lower borrowing quantum via the unpledged option.Ultimately, the case of pledging or not pledging and the type of assets used in obtaining your home loan is up to you. As Ben also points out, this \u201cdepends largely on the cash liquidity of individuals as every situation is different.\u201d However, if you\u2019re still feeling a little confused at this point, fret not, as our friendly PropertyGuru Finance Mortgage Experts are here to offer you their relevant expertise and input.Still unsure of whether to refinance or which refinancing plan suits you best?

The GCB sits on a freehold site of 15,094 sq ft, which translates to a transacted price of about $3,900 psf. The deal was said to be done just a fortnight ago, although a caveat has yet to be lodged.  See also: Jervois Mansion \u2013 most affordable CCR project launch of the year? Word on the street is that the asking price of the GCB was $65 million or $4,306 psf. It would have hit a new all-time high of $4,306 psf for GCBs had that price been achieved. The record price in psf terms held by the GCB at 2 Cluny Hill, which was sold last May for $63.7 million or $4,291 psf, remains unbroken for now. Still, the purchase price of the GCB at Jervois Hill at under $60 million is just 8% to 10% below the asking price. And at $3,900 psf, the GCB at Jervois Hill has certainly set a new benchmark for luxury bungalows in the Bishopsgate, Chatsworth and Jervois GCB enclave.

The GCB was newly completed then, having obtained its Temporary Occupation Permit in December 2017. It was developed by Singaporean investor-owner-entrepreneur George Lim and designed in collaboration with architect Pau Loh, managing partner of Tellus Design.  The 12,000 sq ft house has three levels, including the basement. Besides the living and dining room as well as the family room on the first level, the house has a dry and wet kitchen fully fitted with Gaggenau appliances. The main feature of the house is the floating sculptural staircase. The second level has five en suite bedrooms, which come with walk-in wardrobes too. In the basement is a wall aquarium, large enough for 800 fish. There is also a wine cellar, a home theatre, a dedicated games room, and a carpark that can fit 10 cars.    Source: EdgeProp Inspector The GCB was designed with sustainable features, including 300 solar panels on the roof and outdoor decks made of renewable wood. Back in 2018, the buyer of the GCB at Jervois Hill was Alan Chong, founder of Wah Loon Engineering, who had purchased it for his daughter, Eileen Chong, according to a property title search. Having sold it for under $60 million a fortnight ago, Chong would have made a 43% gain in less than four years.   Story continues Prior to his purchase of the GCB, Chong and Dymon Asia Private Equity Fund had sold Wah Loon Engineering to Vinci Energies, a subsidiary of Vinci, that specialises in energy and information communication technology services in April 2018. Vinci is a global concessions, construction and energy company founded in France and listed on Euronext Paris with revenue of EUR 49.4 billion in FY2021.

This is the third consecutive time that landed residential property has seen a hike in DC rates, according to property consultants. (Check all latest Singapore property Market Trends)The DC rate for landed residential property increased by 4.8% on average. The largest increase of 10% was seen in the prime districts of Cluny Road/Napier Road/Tanglin Road/Ander- son Road/Stevens Road/Dalvey Road.The significant increase in DC rate was due to strong demand and higher transacted prices of landed property, in particular GCBs, says Lee Sze Teck, senior director of research, Huttons Asia. Landed residential property prices increased 6.6% in 2H2021, and 3.9% in 4Q2021 alone, he adds.

Colliers has been appointed the exclusive marketing agent for the deal. The 999-year leasehold factories offer a combined site area of 11,131sq m (119,813 sq ft), which can be amalgamated with its adjoining access road and electrical sub-station to form a larger site area of 14,636 sq m (157,540 sq ft) for redevelopment. The site, zoned for residential use under the 2019 Master Plan, has an allowable gross plot ratio (GPR) of 1.62. Additionally, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has granted a one-off, time-limited bonus residential GPR of 0.3, thus raising the allowable GPR from 1.62 to 1.92. Including the bonus GPR, the maximum allowable gross floor area (GFA) of the site is approximately 302,478 sq ft, allowing the site to yield up to approximately 330 units, subject to approval from the authorities. To enjoy the bonus GPR, the land must be redeveloped in accordance with the parcellation plan prescribed by the URA. Based on the reserve price of $255.4 million, this translates into a land rate of $1,336 psf per plot ratio (psf ppr), which is inclusive of an estimated development charge of $116.8 million and an estimated alienation cost of $31.9 million for the road and the sub-station.  Factoring in an additional 7% of bonus GFA for the balcony incentive scheme, the land rate will be lowered to $1,289 psf ppr. A search on property intelligence tool LandLens shows that the most recent sales transaction in the immediate vicinity was in March 2019, when a unit at Hillview Terrace sold for $961 psf.    LandLens screenshot showing recent sales transactions for Hillview Terrace (Source: LandLens) John Bin, director, capital markets & investments services, Singapore at Colliers, says that the site at 26\u201338D is ideal for residential development given its north-south orientation with views of the Bukit Gombak Hill, Bukit Batok Town Park and Little Guilin to the north. He also notes that the site offers a rare opportunity for developers to own 999-year leasehold land in an attractive residential location. \u201cWith the favourable news of the bonus plot ratio incentive and possibilities of a regular parcellation, developers will enjoy more flexibility in designing their vision and concept for the site,\u201d he adds.   Story continues The site is located in the Hillview estate and is accessible by major roads including Upper Bukit Timah Road, Pan Island Expressway, Bukit Timah Expressway and Kranji Expressway. Nearby MRT stations are Hillview, Bukit Batok, and Bukit Gombak, as well as the upcoming Hume Station on the Downtown Line, scheduled to open by 2025.Numerous primary schools are also located within 2km of the site, including Bukit View Primary School, Keming Primary School, Princess Elizabeth Primary School and St Anthony\u2019s Primary School.Residential properties within a 1km vicinity of the site have transacted at prices between $802 psf to $1,481 psf since the start of the year.  LandLens screenshot showing recent sales transactions for private properties within a 1km radius of the Hillview Terrace site (Source: LandLens)Toh Khai Yeow, chairman of the joint sale committee for 26\u201338D Hillview Terrace, notes that the bonus plot ratio granted by the URA has helped unified the owners of the 23 factory units in making the decision to collectively put up their properties for sale.Last October, a smaller group of owners - making up 14 factory sites located at 32\u201338D Hillview Terrace \u2014 had jointly put up their properties for sale by tender at a price of $106 million. The tender was subsequently withdrawn in January.Colliers points out that the successful buyer of 26\u201338D Hillview Terrace can also consider purchasing the adjoining parcel to the south, comprising 31\u201335 and 50\u201364 Hillview Terrace as well as Hillview Building and Hillview Warehouse, to develop into a single enlarged residential development.The owners of 31\u201335 and 50\u201364 Hillview Terrace \u2014 comprising 11 freehold factory units with a combined site are 62,213 sq ft \u2014 had jointly put up their properties for sale for $122 million last November, before the tender was also subsequently withdrawn in January.The public tender for 26\u201338D Hillview Terrace will close on April 12 at 3pm.Check out the latest listings near Hillview Terrace, Hillview MRT station, Bukit Batok MRT station, Bukit Gombak MRT station, Bukit View Primary School, Keming Primary School, Princess Elizabeth Primary School, St Anthony\u2019s Primary SchoolSee Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) Singapore real estate investment sales to stay in high gear in 2022, led by commercial deals: Colliers Baode Building in Geylang sold for $27 million to Amitabha Buddhist Society (Singapore) Colliers appoints Catherine He as head of research for Singapore En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Both superchips share the same underlying CPU architecture, as well as the NVLink-C2C interconnect.\n\u201cA new type of data center has emerged \u2014 AI factories that process and refine mountains of data to produce intelligence,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cThe Grace CPU Superchip offers the highest performance, memory bandwidth and NVIDIA software platforms in one chip and will shine as the CPU of the world\u2019s AI infrastructure.\u201d\nIntroducing NVIDIA\u2019s CPU Platform\r\nCreated to provide the highest performance, Grace CPU Superchip packs 144 Arm cores in a single socket, offering industry-leading estimated performance of 740 on the SPECrate\u00ae2017_int_base benchmark.(1) This is more than 1.5x higher compared to the dual-CPU shipping with the DGX\u2122 A100 today, as estimated in NVIDIA\u2019s labs with the same class of compilers.(2)\nGrace CPU Superchip also provides industry-leading energy efficiency and memory bandwidth with its innovative memory subsystem consisting of LPDDR5x memory with Error Correction Code for the best balance of speed and power consumption. The LPDDR5x memory subsystem offers double the bandwidth of traditional DDR5 designs at 1 terabyte per second while consuming dramatically less power with the entire CPU including the memory consuming just 500 watts.\nThe Grace CPU Superchip is based on the latest data center architecture, Arm\u00aev9. Combining the highest single-threaded core performance with support for Arm\u2019s new generation of vector extensions, the Grace CPU Superchip will bring immediate benefits to many applications.\nThe Grace CPU Superchip will run all of NVIDIA\u2019s computing software stacks, including NVIDIA RTX\u2122, NVIDIA HPC, NVIDIA AI and Omniverse. The Grace CPU Superchip along with NVIDIA ConnectX\u00ae-7 NICs offer the flexibility to be configured into servers as standalone CPU-only systems or as GPU-accelerated servers with one, two, four or eight Hopper-based GPUs, allowing customers to optimize performance for their specific workloads while maintaining a single software stack.\nDesigned for AI, HPC, Cloud and Hyperscale Applications\r\nThe Grace CPU Superchip will excel at the most demanding HPC, AI, data analytics, scientific computing and hyperscale computing applications with its highest performance, memory bandwidth, energy efficiency and configurability.\nThe Grace CPU Superchip\u2019s 144 cores and 1TB/s of memory bandwidth will provide unprecedented performance for CPU-based high performance computing applications. HPC applications are compute-intensive, demanding the highest performing cores, highest memory bandwidth and the right memory capacity per core to speed outcomes.\nNVIDIA is working with leading HPC, supercomputing, hyperscale and cloud customers for the Grace CPU Superchip. Both it and the Grace Hopper Superchip are expected to be available in the first half of 2023.\nTo learn more about the Grace CPU Superchip, watch Huang\u2019s GTC 2022 keynote.\u00a0Register for GTC for free to attend sessions with NVIDIA and industry leaders.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing and artificial intelligence. The company\u2019s pioneering work in accelerated computing and AI is reshaping trillion-dollar industries, such as transportation, healthcare and manufacturing, and fueling the growth of many others.

The system then fills in the blanks by predicting how light would behave in the real world.\n3 free tickets to TNW Conference?

That includes right now, and NVIDIA is \"hopped up\" to discuss what's next at its upcoming GTC 2022 event. Sensing a theme here? If not, we're 'hoppy' to tell you what it is.\n\n\nIn a word, Hopper. In more words, Hopper is the rumored codename of an unreleased GPU architecture, though not for the consumer sector. That's to say, Hopper isn't expected to power the eventual GeForce RTX 4000 series (that's what Ada Lovelace is for), and will instead find a home in the data center where it will accelerate high performance computing (HPC) workloads.\n\n\nNVIDIA's careful wording strongly suggests it will unveil Hopper in the coming days.\n\n\n\"Each GTC, Huang introduces powerful new ways to accelerate computing of all kinds, and tells a story that puts the latest advances in perspective. Expect Huang to introduce new technologies, products, and collaborations with some of the world's leading companies,\" NVIDIA states in a blog post.\n\n\nNVIDIA's GTC 2022 event runs from March 21-24. It's a virtual conference this year, with a keynote scheduled to be livestreamed on Tuesday, March 22 at 8:00am PT (11:00am ET). Registration is not required to view it (current and recent graduates should register anyway, though, for a chance to win a free GeForce RTX 3090 graphics card autographed by Huang), and if you miss the livestream, you can still catch it after-the-fact in on-demand form.\n\n\nThe entire event will span 900 sessions from a whole bunch of partners, such as Amazon, DeepMind, Epic Games, Google Brain, Microsoft, NASA, NFL, Walt Disney, and many more. Topics of coverage include accelerated computing, deep learning, data science, digital twins, networking, quantum computing, data center computing, and cloud and edge computing. And of course AI will figure prominently during the conference.\n\n\n\r\n\"As part of NVIDIA\u2019s commitment to making AI accessible for all developer communities and emerging markets, numerous sessions will showcase how developers and startups in emerging economies are building and scaling AI and data science,\" NVIDIA says.\nAlleged NVIDIA GH100 Hopper GPU Details Leak Ahead Of GTC 2022\n\nSource: Twitter (@Locuza_)\n\n\n\nSo, what do we know about Hopper? Nothing concrete, though previous rumors suggest NVIDIA's GH100 Hopper GPU could be its biggest GPU by far. And just ahead of the event, a fresh leak claims GH100 will feature eight GPCs, with each cluster sporting nine TPCs with two streaming multiprocessors (SMs) per TPC. That could equate to 144 SMs and 18,432 CUDA cores.\n\n\nThe same leak also claims GH100 will have 48MB of L2 cache (up from 40MB on NVIDIA's GA100 Ampere GPU), and a monolithic design rather than an multi-chip module (MCM) approach. The latter could possible be reserved for GH202.\n\n\nAssuming a Hopper reveal is imminent, we'll find out more details later this week at GTC 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, GPU, hopper, (nasdaq:nvda), gtc2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

This is a massive GPU and is likely the peak Ampere-generation GPU on the market. We have been eagerly awaiting this for months. This is a relatively small bump, but a positive one nonetheless.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti 24GB Launched\nInstead of going into crazy amounts of detail, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 has been the top consumer-level GPU for some time now. The RTX 3090 Ti takes that a step further than the RTX 3090 with:\n\n10752 vs. 10496 CUDA cores\n21Gbps vs. 19.5Gbps GDDR6X\n1.86GHz vs. 1.7GHz boost clock\nRoughly 12% higher operations per second\n450W vs. 350W TDP\n$1999 vs. $1499 Fantasy MSRP\n\nWe are using \u201cFantasy\u201d MSRP because the street price for the GeForce RTX 3090 has not been $1499 for most of the product\u2019s lifetime.\nNVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti\nWhile we are getting 12% more performance for 33% more, the bigger spec change is that that 12% additional performance comes at a 100W higher TDP or around 29% higher TDP. So we get roughly 30% higher costs (initial purchase and power), but 12% more performance. While this probably is not the deal of the century, we have no doubt this card will sell well.\nFinal Words\nPerhaps the bigger implication is the lack of competition. This is going to be a flagship part for months/ quarters not years since the RTX 3000 series came out in 2020. This is a late-cycle upgrade. Even with 10% inflation, and a 12% bump in performance, it is quite easy to see that NVIDIA is charging a lot more for its cards. The RTX 3080 Ti was another example going from $699 to $1199. While AMD, and soon Intel, will be discussing value parts, NVIDIA\u2019s lack of competition at the higher end, even on a ~2-year-old architecture (launched in the data center first) is really shown by NVIDIA massively raising prices and still having demand. NVIDIA has built such a dominant position that it can pass along major hikes.\nWhile some may lament at these prices not being good for gamers, the GeForce RTX 3090 and now RTX 3090 Ti are more of thinly veiled professional cards without the Titan or other monikers. These are designed for those who make money from GPU accelerated work where the cost of the hardware is a lot less than the value derived. Given this trend, our readers should also be a bit nervous of the next-generation data center GPU pricing and associated support options.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSAmpereNVIDIARTX 3090 Ti \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleInspur NF5180M6 Review 1U Mainstream Dual Intel Xeon ServerNext articleFS SFP-10G-T Review \u2013 Another SFP+ to 10Gbase-T Option Cliff RobinsonThey call me \"the STH news guy\" for a reason.  \n \nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAcemagic F3A an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 Mini PC with up to 128GB of RAM \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASUS ESC8000A-E13P Review an 8x PCIe GPU Server \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASRock Rack 4U8G-TURIN2 A Fresh Take on a Classic AI Server Design \n\n  \n\n\n\n3 COMMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRob\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            March 29, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            5:48 pm                                            \n\n\n\nWith the ATX 3.0 and AD102 / RTX 4090 coming our wallets have never hurt more, save for memory prices.\nGotta save up for next year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEric Olson\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            March 29, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            7:01 pm                                            \n\n\n\nI think another reason prices have gone up is related to the supply chain.  Since there is a limit on how many total can be manufactured, the RTX 3090 Ti would sell out in a week if the price were too low.  After that no stock would be available for the rest of the year.\nNo stock is even worse publicity than high prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteffen\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            June 14, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            5:55 am                                            \n\n\n\nHow is this a GPGPU-focused card? It probably has 1/32 the FP64 performance, like GeForce, no ECC, like GeForce, and is focused to be installed in a workstation/normal PC case, and without a Quadro sync port so that all your monitors actually light up properly, like GeForce.\nThis is a GeForce card with 2x GeForce but 1/3 Quadro price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEAVE A REPLY\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\n\n\nPlease enter your name here\n\n\n\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\n\n\n\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign me up for the STH newsletter! \n\n\u0394 \nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Five months later AMD hit back with the 6700 XT at $480, which was another paper MSRP that never reached most prospective buyers. The point is though, these two GPUs are meant to be direct competitors, though current pricing is more favorable towards the 6700 XT as demand for Nvidia GPUs is usually higher.\n\nAs of writing, it's possible to purchase a Radeon 6700 XT for as little as $600, though most models are priced between $700 and $800. That's still well over MSRP, but pricing has come down considerably in recent weeks. Similarly, only three months ago the lowest price on an RTX 3070 was $1,100 and now they are closer to $900, with a Gigabyte model selling for just $850.\nThat means the 3070 is priced ~40% higher than the 6700 XT right now, which is obviously a significant markup, even if the GeForce GPU was ~10% faster last time we compared them over a year ago in a 45 game benchmark.\n\nA lot has changed since then, we've seen numerous driver updates from both camps, along with significant game updates and new releases such as Forza Horizon 5, God of War, Dying Light 2, Warhammer III, Halo Infinite, Rainbow Six Extraction, and the list goes on. We're also testing with Resizable Bar enabled for these head to heads, so it will be interesting to see how much of a difference all these changes make.\n\nFor testing we're using a Ryzen 9 5950X test system with 32GB of DDR4-3200 CL14 dual-rank, dual-channel memory. Both GPUs were tested at 1080p, 1440p, and 4K across 50 games, using Windows 11. The driver used were Radeon Adrenalin 22.2.3 and GeForce Game Ready Driver 511.79.\n\nLet's now take a closer look to some of the result highlights of about a dozen of games and then we'll show you how these two GPUs compare head-to-head across all 50 games tested in a single graph.\nBenchmarks\nStarting with Dying Light 2, we find very competitive performance between these two GPUs and quite surprisingly it's the RTX 3070 that does best at 1080p, winning by a 7% margin. The margin comes down to just 4% at 1440p and almost the same at 4K, which is to say there's no noticeable performance difference.\n\n\nThe 6700 XT gets slapped about in Total War Warhammer III. Here the RTX 3070 was 21% faster at 1080p, 27% faster at 1440p, and a massive 35% faster at 4K.\nThe 1440p results are the most troubling for AMD as they struggled to get anywhere near 60 fps, which we'd consider an ideal frame rate for this game. Of course, lowering quality settings will do the trick, but you won't need to do that with the RTX 3070 for a 60 fps experience.\n\nPerformance in Call of Duty Warzone is far more competitive. We're looking at basically identical performance at 1080p. The 3070 does creep ahead by 10% at 1440p, and this was maintained at 4K. A reasonable performance uplift for the GeForce at higher resolutions.\n\nForza Horizon 4 heavily favored AMD graphics cards and Forza Horizon 5 is no different. The RTX 3070 manages to pull ahead at 4K, and then 1080p and 1440p results were neck and neck, at least when looking at the average frame rate. The RTX 3070 did perform a little better when it came to the 1% lows.\n\nGod of War is a recently released title on PC that looks amazing when using the ultra quality settings. The game plays well on both GPUs despite the RTX 3070 clearly being the faster solution with 17% greater performance at 1080p, 18% at 1440p, and 24% at 4K.\nAn easy win for Nvidia, helping justify the price premium.\n\nFar Cry 6 results are very interesting. We're not using the 'ultra' quality preset, but the dialed down 'high' preset with the HD texture pack enabled. This results in competitive performance at 1080p and 1440p with a ~5% or less margin between the two GPUs. However, it all goes horribly wrong for the RTX 3070 at 4K as we run out of VRAM and frame stuttering becomes a major issue, resulting in 1% lows of just 9 fps.\nAlthough the Radeon 6700 XT is seen to be 43% faster when comparing the average frame rate, for Nvidia it's a complete fail under these conditions. We're starting to see a few scenarios where 8GB of VRAM isn't enough for driving the latest titles, at least without compromising on visuals such as high-res textures.\n\nF1 2021 enables ray tracing by default when using the ultra high quality preset, which we've done for this test. This hurts the Radeon and as a result we see the RTX 3070 running 13% faster at 1080p, 20% faster at 1440p, and 29% faster at 4K. Another big win for Nvidia and not something that we used to see in the previous F1 2020 title.\n\nMetro Exodus Enhanced requires ray tracing, so this is another game that we tested with ray tracing enabled, opting for the 'normal' quality mode with VRS set to 4x. This heavily favors the RTX 3070, allowing it to pull ahead at 1080p by a 51% margin, 55% at 1440p, and 68% at 4K where the 6700 XT was unusable. This is an Nvidia sponsored title that was developed before the existence of RDNA2, so clearly it heavily favors the GeForce architecture, but it's also a real game you can play.\n\nRainbow Six Extraction performance is somewhat close, though less so at 4K. The RTX 3070 was 7% faster at 1080p, 10% faster at 1440p, and 21% faster at 4K. Things do get away from the Radeon at 4K, but at 1440p and 1080p it'd be hard to tell them apart.\n\nBoth GPUs perform well in Apex Legends, though the RTX 3070 delivers 11% greater performance at 1080p and 9% at 1440p, but still both pumped out well over 100 fps.\nWhere the margin could be felt is at 4K where the 6700 XT managed 79 fps to the RTX 3070's 96fps, a rather massive 22% advantage for the GeForce GPU.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 is the faster GPU for playing Fortnite, offering 12% more frames at 1080p, 16% more at 1440p, and a massive 58% more at 4K. The Radeon 6700 XT really crumbles at 4K, showing it's better suited for 1440p gaming in this title.\nA few testing notes worth mentioning: the Fortnite data shown here isn't directly comparable with previous benchmarks we've run on RTX 3080 vs. 6800 XT comparisons as the game has received major updates which broke older replays, so we're testing a completely different match.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is the last game we're going to look at. The RTX 3070 offers 10% more fps at 1080p, 12% more at 1440p, and 22% more at 4K, though neither GPU was entirely suitable at 4K with well under 60 fps on average, which isn't what you'll want from a GPU at this kind of prices.\n50 Game Head-to-Head\nBased on the first dozen or so games we just looked at, the RTX 3070 looks to be well ahead of the 6700 XT except for Far Cry 6. The GeForce has also shown the most advantage at 4K, but before we draw any conclusions, let's take a look at the data across all 50 games tested...\nStarting with the 1080p data we find that the RTX 3070 was 11% faster on average, providing superior performance in the majority of the games tested. The 3070 was slower by a margin greater than 5% in just two of the games tested: Doom Eternal and Assassin's Creed Valhalla.\n\nMeanwhile, it was 5% faster or more in 34 of the 50 games tested, meaning there were just 14 games where the margin was less than 5% in either direction. The really big RTX wins came in Metro Exodus EE, War Thunder, Resident Evil Village, Vermintide 2, PUBG, Kingdom Come Deliverance, Control, Serious Sam 4, Warhammer III, and Microsoft Flight Simulator.\n\nMoving to 1440p, the margin increases in Nvidia's favor, so now the RTX 3070 is 13% faster on average. That's a slight increase over the 45 game test from a year ago. If you were to remove the two best games for Nvidia (Metro and PUG), the RTX 3070 was still 12% faster on average, and that's the beauty of testing such an extreme range of games.\n\nThe RTX 3070 is 19% faster on average at 4K. That's a big performance advantage for those targeting this resolution. The only potential issue for the RTX 3070 here is VRAM usage, which was clearly a problem in Far Cry 6. Disabling the HD texture pack solves it, but we feel disabling high quality textures when spending $500+ on a GPU for that premium experience, isn't something most will want to do. Far Cry aside, for the vast majority of games available today, the RTX 3070 offers a far better 4K gaming experience.\nAnd the Winner is...\nWhen revisiting this shootout, it appears the GeForce RTX 3070 seems to be doing a little better than the Radeon RX 6700 XT. Numerous driver and game developments have helped the RTX 3070 in the past year. For example, GeForce performance in Assassin's Creed Valhalla was recently addressed, reducing the margin from 10% in favor of the 6700 XT to just 4%.\n\nThere's also a number of new releases that clearly favor Nvidia GPUs, such as Warhammer III, God of War, and Halo Infinite. That's all very positive for the RTX 3070. There's still the matter of VRAM. Although 8GB remains enough for the most part, we're starting to see examples where it isn't. On the upside, you can work around the issue with minimal impact to visuals at least for now.\nBefore we continue, we thought it'd be interesting to see what we said a year ago when comparing these two GPUs...\n\nIf you had the luxury of buying either GPU at or near the MSRP, which one should you get? Between the two, our pick would be the GeForce RTX 3070. It just happens to be the case I'm a Fortnite player and the GeForce GPU is already faster before you even enable DLSS, making it the obvious choice for me. I also only play multiplayer games and typically opt for competitive-type quality settings, so memory capacity is not an issue.\nWe also like the higher recording quality when using NVENC. It's a small improvement when recording, but it is better and if you stream it's a lot better.\nRay tracing support keeps maturing, but as you likely know by now, that's of zero interest to me. It's nonetheless an additional feature of the GeForce RTX series which you may care about. DLSS support is also rather limited, but if you can take advantage of it in the games you play, the performance benefits can be quite substantial.\n\nLooking back, our opinion hasn't changed all that much. DLSS quality and game support has only improved and the same is also true for ray tracing. However, what has changed is the pricing and as mentioned earlier, the 6700 XT can now be had for $600, while the RTX 3070 costs more like $850. It's a moving target, but that's a 42% price premium for the GeForce GPU.\n\nDespite the benefits of superior ray tracing performance, DLSS, NVENC and overall better rasterization performance, we don't think the RTX 3070 is worth the 40% premium. Somewhere around 20% extra, sure, but not double that figure. It's also hard to justify spending the extra money on a GPU with just 8GB of VRAM. It's our opinion that Nvidia messed up with VRAM capacity on their initial Ampere GPUs, but in this crazy market they had no issues selling them at all.\nIf we had to purchase one of these two GPUs at these prices right now, we'd go with the Radeon RX 6700 XT. If the RTX 3070 was just $100 more than the 6700 XT, that'd likely change my mind. As it turns out, both AMD and Nvidia made out extremely well with both products, selling literally anything they could produce, well, anything but the 6500 XT.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nGeForce RTX 3070 on Amazon\nRadeon RX 6700 XT on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3080 on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3070 Ti on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti on Amazon\nRadeon RX 6900 XT on Amazon\nRadeon RX 6800 on Amazon\nRyzen 9 5950X on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 37\n\n\n Got something to say?

The group has also asked for money to be transferred to them via a cryptocurrency transaction so that they can receive money without it being traced by traditional financial authorities.\nThese asks may seem ridiculous, but the hackers have an enormous amount of Nvidia\u2019s internal information. Laspus$ claims to have stolen 1Terebyte of data that includes a hardware folder that is a mighty 250GB, and contains information on \u201call recent Nvidia graphics processing unit (GPUs)\u201d\u00a0including the highly anticipated RTX 3090 Ti.\nThe hackers have already leaked the company\u2019s Deep Learning Super Sampling, which is AI rendering technology, source code, upcoming architectures, and there are also rumors that the leaks have given insight into Nintendo\u2019s upcoming hardware.\nThis is because Nintendo uses Nvidia\u2019s technology in its systems. One of the leaks suggests the new technology that could be leveraged in a new iteration of the Nintendo Switch.\nThe damage of this cyberattack\nThe financial implications of this attack are concerning for Nvidia who are now being held ransom by the hackers. However, this loss of data could itself damage the company going forward.\nNvidia may lose its ability to unveil its upcoming products and the accompanying messaging that is essential for the items to resonate with its intended market. Moreover, Nvidia\u2019s hardware information becoming commonplace could lead to replicas of its work.\nOn top of this, if the hackers have information on Nvidia\u2019s upcoming projects with third parties then hard-earned\u00a0client relationships could be at risk; including Xbox.\nPreventing cyberattacks\nGiven the scale of this attack, many organizations will begin to reflect inwardly about the impact of similar cybersecurity challenges on\u00a0their organization. Fortunately, there is a number of ways that companies can protect their data.\nA key part of ensuring cybersecurity is training. While this might not sound like a great response to an attack, it can stop a breach from occurring\u00a0in the first place.\nWriting for UNLEASH, Don Mowbray, who leads Skillsoft\u2019s technology and developer specialization in Europe, Middle East & Africa said: \u201cDedicating time and resources to ensuring that technical staff are given the skills and know-how to proactively build increased resilience to cyber incidents and minimize the impact of incidents when these occur is just the start.\u201d\nTraining must\u00a0be extended well beyond the cybersecurity teams, and be given to all staff so that they can minimize risk for their organization. Mike Fenna, chief technology officer of Avado, wrote for UNLEASH: \u201cWhen we restrict data analysts and IT security skills to a singular team at the back of the office, we do both our organizations and employees a huge disservice.\u201d\nNonetheless, some organizations will want to enforce security measures rather than hoping staff will remember what they have learned.\nPaul Keely, 12-time Microsoft MVP, explained to UNLEASH that multifactor authentication (MFA) was essential. Noting that \u201cHR has an obligation to protect people data\u201d and that extra authentication layer was the best way to do this, Keely wait on to use a poignant analogy.\nKeely said: \u201cIf you won the lottery tomorrow, and you opened a bank account and put in $2 million, and the bank had no MFA, and they said \u2018just log on with a username and password\u2019, you wouldn\u2019t want to keep your money there. So why would you treat HR data like that?\u201d\nOf course, the way devices are used also needs a layer of protection. Using services such as Domain Name System (DNS) protection and a permanently working virtual private network (VPN)\u00a0back into the office or data center, will help verify legitimate websites and mitigate the risk of successful phishing attacks.\nEach company will approach its cybersecurity measures differently. Nonetheless, all businesses are unified in the possible damage a successful cyberattack can do. The ongoing incident with Nvidia highlights the challenges and shows the need for active security measures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up to the UNLEASH Newsletter\nGet the Editor\u2019s picks of the week delivered straight to your inbox!\nSIGN UP NOW\n\n\n\n    Read next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview\n\n|\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n \n\n\nGE Healthcare: \u2018If you\u2019re curious about AI, everything else flows from that\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n|\n\nUNLEASH America\n\n \n\n\nThe Road to Vegas: What\u2019s coming up ahead of UNLEASH America 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview\n\n|\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n \n\n\nEY: Here\u2019s where HR leaders should be focusing now for long-term AI success\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview\n\n|\n\nHR Technology\n\n \n\n\nTech vendors must support HR in becoming a strategic partner for the business, says MHR\u2019s CEO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n|\n\nPayroll\n\n \n\n\nDeel acquires Safeguard Global\u2019s payroll division to better manage \u2018large, complex global payroll projects\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n|\n\nChange Management\n\n \n\n\nCombating change fatigue: How HR can build a resilient workforce\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBy:   Daniel Richardson\nSenior Journalist\nDan combines his first-hand experience alongside the latest news and opinions in the HR Technology space.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpens in a new tab  \n\n\n\nOpens in a new tab  \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n                Data and Analytics            \n\n                HR Technology            \n\n                Risk, Compliance and Regulation            \n\n                Talent Management            \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNLEASH Ltd\n180 Borough High Street\nFORA, London\nSE1 1LB\nUnited Kingdom\n\n\n\nLATEST NEWS\nEVENTS\n\nUNLEASH America 2025\nUNLEASH World 2025\nFuture Live Events\nHR Webinars\n\n\nPARTNER WITH US\n \n\nLATEST\n\nHR Technology\nLearning and Development\nTalent Acquisition\nFuture of Work\nPodcasts\n\n\nRESEARCH\n\nReports\nCase Studies\nInfographics\nHow to guides\nTopics glossary\n\n\nEVENTS\n\nUNLEASH America 2025\nUNLEASH World 2025\nEvents Calendar\nRoundtables\nWebinars\nOn Demand\n\n\nABOUT\n\nAbout UNLEASH\nPartner with Us\nCareers\nContact Us\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpens in a new tab  \n\n\n\nOpens in a new tab  \n\n\n\nOpens in a new tab  \n\n\n\nOpens in a new tab  \n\n\n\nOpens in a new tab  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\nSUSTAINABILITY POLICY\nPRIVACY POLICY\nCOOKIE MANAGEMENT\n\n\n\u00a9 UNLEASH Group Ltd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n\nReason for contacting*\n\n\nI'm interested in sponsorship opportunties\n\n\n\nI'm interested in attending an UNLEASH event as a delegate\n\n\n\nI'm interested in speaking at an UNLEASH event or submitting an article\n\n\n\nI'm having a technical problem\n\n\n\nI'd like to speak to a member of Team UNLEASH\nName*\n\n\nFirst Name\n\n\n\nLast Name\n\nProfessional Email Address*\n\nPlease enter a work or professional email address.Work/Mobile Phone Number*Job Title*Company Name*Please briefly let us know a bit more about how we can help you*Terms and Conditions*UNLEASH will use your information to respond to your inquiry and share relevant marketing communications.\nYou can unsubscribe at anytime by clicking the unsubscribe link in the footer of any email.

Then Came the Ransomware Attack.\n\n\nBy\n      \nJosephine Wolff\n\n\nMarch 30, 20225:45 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto illustration by Slate.

The incident highlights some of the underlying tensions around cryptocurrency mining that have worsened in the past two years as cryptocurrencies have come in for considerable scrutiny related to their environmental impacts and ties to criminal activity.\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has been at the center of that conflict as one of a very small number of tech manufacturers in a position to make cryptocurrency mining more difficult and thereby potentially reduce some of the energy costs and illegal uses. Nvidia traditionally manufacturers graphics processing units, or GPUs, that are designed for computer games but have been co-opted by cryptocurrency miners because they can do mining computations so much faster than traditional computer central processing units, or CPUs. Nvidia\u2019s GeForce GPUs have been in such high demand by Ethereum cryptocurrency miners that it\u2019s become difficult for anyone else to get them for playing computer games or processing graphics. So Nvidia, very sensibly, decided to redesign their GPUs to make them much less efficient at the specific operations required for mining Ethereum. The updated GPUs were released in February 2021.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are lots of reasons to try to make it harder for people to mine cryptocurrencies with GPUs\u2014for one thing, cryptocurrencies play a central role in many forms of cybercrime, most notably ransomware, by providing attackers with a difficult-to-trace payment method. Additionally, people who weren\u2019t miners were having tremendous trouble getting access to Nvidia\u2019s graphics cards, creating another problem for the company. And on top of that, the computational operations required to mine cryptocurrencies are massively power-intensive, with the mining of bitcoins alone consuming roughly 121.36 terawatt-hours per year, or slightly more than the annual power consumption of Argentina or the Netherlands, according to a 2021 analysis by researchers at the University of Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nSo Nvidia\u2019s decision to engineer its graphics cards to be less useful for cryptocurrency mining was a good one, with many benefits not just for the company but for all of us. Unfortunately, Nvidia accidentally distributed code that allowed customers to get around the new restrictions built into its GPUs in March 2021. That same month, several miners and journalists noticed the mistake. The company later tried (largely unsuccessfully) to remove that code from circulation, but it further undermined its efforts to limit cryptocurrency mining last year by deliberately adding a new product specifically designed for Ethereum mining to its line-up. Meanwhile, AMD, Nvidia\u2019s main competitor in the graphics card industry, has announced it is not planning to take any steps to redesign its processors to prevent cryptocurrency mining.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies like it, such as Ethereum, require computers to perform computations in order to generate more of them. That\u2019s because there\u2019s no centralized authority controlling how many Bitcoins exist, but to prevent people from creating an unlimited number of them, there are technical restrictions built into their source code. For instance, there can only ever be 21 million Bitcoins total, of which nearly 19 million have already been mined. The \u201cmining\u201d terminology comes from the fact that computers have to do a series of computational tasks before they are rewarded with Bitcoins, just as actual miners have to do significant work to extract minerals from the earth.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we get closer to reaching the 21 million limit, computers have to do more and more computational work to receive smaller and smaller quantities of bitcoins. That\u2019s why miners started using Nvidia and AMD GPUs instead of the less powerful CPUs, so they could perform more computations more quickly. Operating all of the computers that perform those computational tasks and keeping them cool enough so that they don\u2019t overheat therefore requires a tremendous amount of energy particularly at times when popular cryptocurrencies are worth a lot of money and have already been largely mined.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Popular in\n        \n          Technology\n        \n\n\n\n\n                        \n            Want to Protect Your Stock Market Investments? Do This One Very Boring Thing.\n          \n\n\n\n                        \n            Yes, RFK Jr., Some Studies Suggest That Vitamin A Protects Against Measles. But There\u2019s a Major Catch That Parents Need to Know.\n          \n\n\n\n                        \n            I Spent a Day Looking Only at What Donald Trump Fans See Online. Sure Does Look Nice From Here.\n          \n\n\n\n                        \n            He Used to Make Videos About NYC Real Estate. Then He Became Radicalized by the Right.\n          \n\n\n\nBetween them, Nvidia and AMD own pretty much the entire market for GPUs, though Nvidia\u2019s are significantly more popular. If the two companies were both willing to limit the computational operations that are used for mining popular cryptocurrencies so that their graphics cards were less efficient at those tasks, they could single-handedly deal cryptocurrency speculators a larger setback than any government or other entity is capable of doing. We know these types of technical constraints are possible to design because Nvidia has already done it. More than that, we know that those technical constraints are having a real impact on people\u2019s ability to mine cryptocurrencies, because otherwise why would the perpetrators of the Nvidia breach be demanding that Nvidia undo the protections it built into its graphics cards in 2021?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that the people making these demands are themselves cybercriminals\u2014in this case the hacking group Lapsus$\u2014and are currently leaking the stolen data online is a reminder of just who is most invested in being able to mine cryptocurrencies. To its credit, Nvidia has so far shown no signs of caving to the attackers\u2019 demands and has even said it does not expect the breach to disrupt its business. But with the hackers leaking Nvidia\u2019s proprietary data online, it\u2019s hard to imagine why any company would want to open itself up to this kind of attack by trying to counter cryptocurrency mining through better-designed technology. Technological restrictions on mining of the sort Nvidia implemented last year could potentially counteract much of the harm cryptocurrency mining causes but companies may need greater incentives\u2014or pressure\u2014from regulators to be willing to accept the risks associated with angering cryptocurrency-fueled cybercriminals.\n\nFuture Tense\n    is a partnership of\n    Slate,\n    New America, and\n    Arizona State University\n    that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society.\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n              Cryptocurrency\n            \n\n\n              Cybersecurity\n            \n\n\n              Energy\n            \n\n\n              Environment\n            \n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nWork With Us\nContact\nPitch Guidelines\nSend Us Tips\nCorrections\nCommenting\nReprints\n\n\n\nSubscriptions\n\nSubscribe\nGroup Subscriptions\nSign In\nAccount\nSubscription FAQs\nPodcast FAQs\nNewsletters\nCustomer Support\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdChoices\nCookie Preferences\n\n\n\n\nThe Slate Group logo\n\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n            Facebook\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Twitter\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Instagram\n          \n\n\n\n\n            YouTube\n          \n\n\n\n\n            RSS Feed\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s Lovelace graphics cards have been spotted in HWiNFO, suggesting that these next-gen products \u2013 expected later this year \u2013 are maybe inching closer to release (and backing up another recent rumor in that respect \u2013 more on that later).Tom\u2019s Hardware reports that a beta version (v7.21, build 4725) of system monitoring utility HWiNFO mentions support for five Lovelace GPUs (along with a couple of Hopper, Pro-targeted models, and possibly future Blackwell cards \u2013 that\u2019s the theoretical successor to Hopper, so again, not consumer graphics products).For Lovelace, which should be the RTX 4000 series \u2013 unless Nvidia makes a radical departure from its current naming convention \u2013 the following GPUs are listed: AD102, AD103, AD104, AD106, and AD107.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5050 to 5090 laptop GPUs spotted, suggesting next-gen graphics cards are ready for rumored CES 2025 launch\n\n\n\n\nWhat to expect from Nvidia in 2025\n\n\n\nGoing by the current thinking from the rumor mill \u2013 and of course, this is just speculation (all of this is, for that matter) \u2013 AD102 would be the chip in Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4090 flagship and RTX 4080 (and Ti), with AD103 driving the RTX 4070, and AD104 being the engine of the mid-range products, with the budget cards using the chips below that.Analysis: Nvidia Lovelace might beat AMD RDNA 3 to the punch?As we noted at the outset, this sighting of Lovelace graphics cards could indicate that maybe we\u2019re getting closer to their launch. The exciting thing about this possibility is that it tallies with another rumor which popped up a few days back, namely that Nvidia could be on track to beat AMD with the release of its next-gen GPUs.In other words, Team Green is looking like it could get a head-start with RTX 4000 products hitting shelves before RX 7000 (RDNA 3) cards, and the appearance of GPU support within this hardware utility adds a little more weight to that suggestion.That said, this is obviously another rather tenuous strand of speculation, and we definitely shouldn\u2019t get carried away with this idea. Another possibility regarding this leak is that HWiNFO is just slotting in these Lovelace GPUs as placeholders based on the recent info spilled via the Nvidia hack (that\u2019s plausible, for sure).Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Both next-gen families from Nvidia and AMD are expected to achieve big things, though the latest we\u2019ve heard is that Team Red could have really nailed a double blow in terms of not just major performance gains, but also capacious strides on the efficiency front (as ever, add your own salt, and a ton of it \u2013 though better efficiency from AMD wouldn\u2019t be a surprise, of course).Today\u2019s best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $39.99 $34.99ViewDeal ends Tue, Apr 1, 2025 $99.99 $79.99ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesFind the best Nvidia GPU for you\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I cover emerging technologies with a focus on infrastructure and AIFollow AuthorMar 27, 2022, 07:37am EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 2 years old.At the Graphics Technology Conference (GTC), NVIDIA unveiled the latest AI accelerator - the H100 Tensor Core GPU. It\u2019s a successor to the wildly successful A100 GPU launched two years ago. With 9X faster AI training and 30X faster inference, it\u2019s more than just an incremental upgrade to A100.\nHopper ArchitectureNVIDIA\n\nHere are ten facts about NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation GPU:\n\n1) The GPU is based on Hopper architecture, a successor to the Ampere architecture that powers A100 and A30 GPUs. The A100 GPUs are available through NVIDIA\u2019s DGX A100 and EGX A100 platforms.\n\n2) Compared to A100 GPUs that support 6912 CUDA Cores, the H100 boasts 16896 CUDA Cores. NVIDIA GPUs have CUDA cores, which are equivalent to the CPU cores. They can run many calculations simultaneously, something essential for modern AI and graphics workloads.\n\nH100 GPUNVIDIA\n3) The H100 GPU is packed with 80 billion transistors, while the previous generation of GPUs based on A100 had 54.2 billion transistors. Ths increase in transistors results in faster calculations and processing.\n\n\n4) H100 GPU features a 2nd-generation secure Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) with capabilities extended by 7x the previous version. NVIDIA claims the new GPU architecture provides approximately 3x more compute capacity and nearly 2x more memory bandwidth per GPU instance than A100.\n\n5) Confidential computing support in H100 protects user data, defends against hardware and software attacks, and provides better isolation and protection to virtual machines (VMs) from each other in virtualized and MIG environments.\n\n\n6) The H100 GPUs come with the 4th generation NVLink that delivers a 3x bandwidth increase on all-reduce operations and a 50% general bandwidth increase over the prior generation NVLink. NVIDIA\u2019s NVLink is a direct GPU-to-GPU interconnect that scales multi-GPU input/output (IO) within the server.\n7) The H100 GPU comes with inbuilt support for DPX instructions that accelerate dynamic programming algorithms by up to 7x over the A100 GPU. Dynamic programming was developed in the 1950s to solve complex problems using two key techniques based on recursion and memoization. Applications that rely on complex SQL queries, quantum simulation, route optimization can take advantage of the DPX instruction set available in H100.\n8) The H100 GPU is optimized for transformers. The inbuilt transformer engine uses a combination of software and custom NVIDIA Hopper Tensor Core technology explicitly designed to accelerate transformer model training and inference. Transformers represent the latest developments in neural networks architecture for training computer vision and conversational AI models. They are used in large language models such as Google\u2019s BERT and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.\n9) NVIDIA is updating the HGX AI supercomputing platform with H100 GPUs. The HGX platform enables hardware vendors to design servers optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. The timeline for the availability of the HGX platform based on H100 GPUs is yet to be announced.\n10) Systems based on H100 GPUs will become available in Q3 2022. These include NVIDIA\u2019s own DGX and DGX SuperPod servers, along with the servers and hardware from OEM partners using HGX baseboards and PCIe cards.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft's\u00a0DirectStorage\u00a0application programming interface (API) promises to improve the efficiency of GPU-to-SSD data transfers for games in a Windows environment, but Nvidia and its partners have found a way to make GPUs seamlessly work with SSDs without a proprietary API. The method, called Big Accelerator Memory (BaM), promises to be useful for various compute tasks, but it will be particularly useful for emerging workloads that use large datasets. Essentially, as GPUs get closer to CPUs in terms of programmability, they also need direct access to large storage devices.\n\nModern graphics processing units aren't just for graphics; they're also used for various heavy-duty workloads like analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and high-performance computing (HPC). To process large datasets efficiently, GPUs either need vast amounts of expensive special-purpose memory (e.g., HBM2, GDDR6, etc.) locally, or efficient access to solid-state storage. Modern compute GPUs already carry 80GB\u2013128GB of HBM2E memory, and next-generation compute GPUs will expand local memory capacity. But dataset sizes are also increasing rapidly, so optimizing interoperability between GPUs and storage is important.\n\nThere are several key reasons why interoperability between GPUs and SSDs has to be improved. First, NVMe calls and data transfers put a lot of load on the CPU, which is inefficient from an overall performance and efficiency point of view. Second, CPU-GPU synchronization overhead and/or I/O traffic amplification significantly limits the effective storage bandwidth required by applications with huge datasets.\n\n\"The goal of Big Accelerator Memory is to extend GPU memory capacity and enhance the effective storage access bandwidth while providing high-level abstractions for the GPU threads to easily make on-demand, fine-grain access to massive data structures in the extended memory hierarchy,\" a\u00a0description\u00a0of the concept by Nvidia, IBM, and Cornell University cited by\u00a0The Register\u00a0reads.(Image credit: The Register)BaM essentially enables Nvidia GPU to fetch data directly from system memory and storage without using the CPU, which makes GPUs more self-sufficient than they are today. Compute GPUs continue to use local memory as software-managed cache, but will move data using a PCIe interface, RDMA, and a custom Linux kernel driver that enables SSDs to read and write GPU memory directly when needed. Commands for the SSDs are queued up by the GPU threads if the required data is not available locally. Meanwhile, BaM does not use virtual memory address translation and therefore does not experience serialization events like TLB misses. Nvidia and its partners plan to open-source the driver to allow others to use their BaM concept.\n\n\"BaM mitigates the I/O traffic amplification by enabling the GPU threads to read or write small amounts of data on-demand, as determined by the compute,\" Nvidia's document reads. \"We show that the BaM infrastructure software running on GPUs can identify and communicate the fine-grain accesses at a sufficiently high rate to fully utilize the underlying storage devices, even with consumer-grade SSDs, a BaM system can support application performance that is competitive against a much more expensive DRAM-only solution, and the reduction in I/O amplification can yield significant performance benefit.\"\n\nTo a large degree, Nvidia's BaM is a way for GPUs to obtain a large pool of storage and use it independently from the CPU, which makes compute accelerators much more independent than they are today.Astute readers will remember that AMD attempted to wed GPUs with solid-state storage with its\u00a0Radeon Pro SSG graphics card several years ago. While bringing additional storage to a graphics card allows the hardware to optimize access to large datasets, the Radeon Pro SSG board was designed purely as a graphics solution and was not designed for complex compute workloads. Nvidia, IBM, and others are taking things a step further with BaM.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nMicrosoft\nIBM\nAPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (8)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

For workstations it is put marginally under the premium RTX A6000, in the laptop as RTX A5500 integrated GPU it is itself the new leading model. Commonly, there is little likeness between the two.\nNVIDIA RTX A5500 for workstations, using NVIDIA GeForce 3080 Ti technology to guide its ray tracing and more along with added support\nThe graphics cards of the RTX-A series, previously called Quadro, are utilized for 3D graphics rendering (with ray tracing), video altering, AI computations, and other workflows. They utilize extraordinary drivers and offer additional aid to users.\n\nThe NVIDIA RTX A5500 for workstations with a dual-slot cooling architecture involves a similar GA102 setup as the\u00a0GeForce RTX 3080 Ti engineering samples\u00a0and hence offers five percent fewer execution units than the past top model RTX A6000 with a full GA102 configuration.\u00a0With 24 GB GDDR6 including ECC error correction, the graphics card offers half as much memory as the premium offering, memory interfacing and clock remain untouched.\u00a0Two RTX A5500 can be interconnected by means of the company's proprietary NVLink.\n\nThe grouping makes sense of why NVIDIA is sending off a marginally more modest adaptation 18 months after the RTX A6000 and toward the finish of Ampere's term, basically with the strained delivery system. It is said NVIDIA couldn't convey an adequate number of graphics cards with GA102 full development and 48 GB GDDR6X and attempts to fulfill a portion of the closely involved SKUS with the option put beneath.\nThe new RTX A5500 graphics card is also available for mobile workstations as the RTX A5500 laptop GPU which corresponds to the configurations of the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti.\n\n\n\nRTX A6000RTX A5500RTX 3090RTX 3080 Ti\n\n\n\n\nArchitectureamp\n\n\nGPUGA102\n\n\nprocessSamsung 8 nm custom process\n\n\nChip size628.4mm\u00b2\n\n\nTransistors28.3 billion\n\n\nGPC7\n\n\nSM84808280\n\n\nFP32 ALUs per SM128\n\n\nFP32 ALUs10,75210,24010,49610,240\n\n\nRT cores84 2nd gen80 2nd Gen82 2nd Gen80 2nd Gen\n\n\nRT cores + ALUs in syncYes\n\n\nTensor cores336 3rd Gen320 3rd.\u00a0gene328 3rd Gen320 3rd Gen\n\n\nFP32 performance38.7 TFLOPS?35.7 TFLOPS34.1 TFLOPS\n\n\nFP16 performance38.7 TFLOPS?35.7 TFLOPS34.1 TFLOPS\n\n\nTexture units336320328320\n\n\nROPs112\n\n\nStorage48GB GDDR6 + ECC24GB GDDR6 + ECC24GB GDDR6X12GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory speed16.0 Gbps16.0 Gbps19.5 Gbps19.0 Gbps\n\n\nMemory interface384 bits\n\n\nMemory bandwidth768 GB/s936 GB/s912 GB/s\n\n\nL2 cache6 MB\n\n\nTDP300 W--350 W350 W\n\n\nSlot connectionPCIe 4.0 x16\n\n\nMSRP$5,566.70*--$1,652.70$1,322.38\n\n\n*Estimated market price\n\n\n\nAs between the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti notebook GPU, the distinction between the RTX A5500 and the RTX A5500 notebook GPU is additionally hefty.

It will also offer three times higher performance for a range of other precisions, including double precisions needed by some of the HPC applications. H100 will be the first product with HBM3 (high bandwidth memory) memory, and will deliver an astonishing three terabytes per second of memory bandwidth,\u2019 says Paresh Kharya, Nvidia\u2019s senior director of data center computing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia Tuesday used its virtual Nvidia GTC conference to unveil a new accelerated computing platform named for pioneering computer scientist Grace Hopper.\nAlong with the new Nvidia Hopper architecture, which succeeds the current two-year-old Nvidia Ampere architecture, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company also introduced the Nvidia H100 GPU, the first GPU based on the Hopper platform.\nNvidia also introduced the Grace CPU Superchip, the company\u2019s first new data center CPU based on the Arm Neoverse design, and also introduced major updates to its Nvidia AI platform.\n\n\nid\nunit-1659132512259\n\n\ntype\nSponsored post\n\n\n[Related: 6 Boldest Statements From Jensen Huang And Eyal Waldman On Nvidia-Mellanox Deal]\nNvidia remains dedicated to providing technology to meet the demanding requirements of AI-focused applications, said Paresh Kharya, senior director of data center computing at Nvidia, during a pre-GTC press conference.\n\u201cAI has transformed every industry, and the use cases of AI are everywhere from image classifications to recommendation systems to natural language understanding,\u201d Kharya said.\nAs an example, Kharya cited Google Transformer, a neural network architecture for deep learning for such areas as natural language processing and computer vision.\n\u201c[Google] brought unsupervised learning, and removed the need for label data,\u201d he said. \u201cThis dramatically expanded the volume of data that could be used to train AI models. With Transformer models, AI learned natural human language. And today it's powering conversational AI applications everywhere. Transformers also helped AI learn other complex tasks like predicting the structure of proteins from the sequence of amino acids.\u201d\nWith Transformers, models grow in size and complexity as they become more accurate while learning via enormous amounts of unlabeled data, leading to increasing computing power to manage the loads.\nTo enable hardware to keep up with the performance requirements of such AI workloads, Nvidia Tuesday introduced what it called the next engine for AI infrastructures, the Nvidia Hopper GPU architecture and the Nvidia H100 GPU, which Kharya said were named after pioneering computer scientist and U.S. Navy vice admiral Grace Hopper.\nThe H100 GPU features 80 billion transistors on a single chip, and was manufactured by advanced semiconductor manufacturer TSMC using a 4-nanometer process. The H100 also includes a new Transformer engine aimed at accelerating Transformer modeling by six times over previous architectures. Its fourth-generation NVLink accelerates PCIe performance by seven times over previous versions, and allows it to work with systems outside the server, he said\nHopper is also the world's first confidential computing GPU, a technology that previously was only available in CPUs, Kharya said. Confidential computing encrypts data while in use to protect it from unauthorized access, he said.\nHopper also features the next generation of multi-instance GPU technology, which was originally introduced with Ampere to fractionalize and isolate a GPU into many instances, along with new instructions to accelerate dynamic programming to break complex problems into simpler sub problems.\nPerformance in AI and other advanced workloads is significantly increased with the Hopper platform, Kharya said.\n\u201cFor AI training, H100 will offer four petaflops of performance, six times more than even the A100 [GPU],\u201d he said. \u201cIt will also offer three times higher performance for a range of other precisions, including double precisions needed by some of the HPC applications. H100 will be the first product with HBM3 (high bandwidth memory) memory, and will deliver an astonishing three terabytes per second of memory bandwidth. It'll also support PCIe Gen 7 and the fourth generation of Nvidia NVLink.\u201d\nAlso new are the first systems to feature the Hopper architecture, the Nvidia DGX H100.\nA single DGX H100 system will provide 32 petaflops of AI performance, which Kharya said is six times more than the previous DGX A100. By using the NVLink, enterprises can create a 32-node DGX Superpod with one exaflops of AI performance, with a bisection bandwidth of 70 terabytes per second, or 11 times higher than a comparable DGX A100 Superpod.\n\u201cThe bandwidth of the entire Internet is 100 terabytes per second,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you can imagine the amount of data flowing through.\u201d\nThe company also introduced the Nvidia EOS, a new supercomputer built with 18 DGX H100 Superpods featuring 4,600 H100 GPUs, 360 NVLink switches and 500 Quantum-2 InfiniBand switches to perform at 18 exaflops.\n\u201cWe expect it to be the world's fastest AI supercomputer when it\u2019s deployed,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it uses Nvidia's Quantum-2 technology. It\u2019ll also be a cloud native supercomputer. EOS will provide bare metal performance with multi-tenant isolation, as well as performance isolation to ensure that one application does not impact any other. And finally, the third generation of SHARP (Scalable Hierarchical Aggregation and Reduction Protocol) technology will ensure that in-network computing is available in multi-tenant environments.\u201d\nThe H100 and its systems will provide a new level of performance for AI analytics, Kharya said.\n\u201cThe H100 will offer up to nine times higher performance [than previously available],\u201d he said. \u201cTraining in days, what used to take weeks. And it'll also enable the next generation of advanced data models to be created because they\u2019ll be within the reach for the practical amount of time it takes to train them. And when these models are deployed for inference, H100 will offer an incredible 30 times more throughput.\u201d\nThe H100 platform will also be available on mainstream servers via the new H100 CNX Converged Accelerator, Kharya said.\nCurrent mainstream servers are limited in how much data they can feed to powerful GPUs, and high bandwidth situations can overload a CPU and system memory, he said.\n\u201cH100 CNX combines our most advanced H100 GPU with the most advanced ConnectX-7 NIC (network interface card) into a single module that can be deployed in mainstream servers via the PCIe connection to the CPU,\u201d he said. \u201cData from the network uses GPU Direct RDMA technology, and it can completely bypass the CPU bottlenecks. In a mainstream server with four GPUs, H100 CNX will boost the bandwidth to the GPU by four times, and at the same time freeing up the CPU to process other parts of the application.\u201d\nH100 and related systems will be available starting in the third quarter of 2022, Kharya said.\nOne custom system builder, who spoke to CRN on condition of anonymity, said customers have been waiting for the debut of the H100 GPUs for deployment in their data centers.\n\u201cCustomers are looking at the latest and greatest for their HPC and AI compute needs,\u201d the system builder said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been waiting to hear what content will be available, pricing, and what systems they will be available for.\u201d\nThe Hopper platform will also power NVidia's Grace CPUs which the company unveiled last year, Kharya said. The Grace CPU Superchip, the first Arm-based CPUs from Nvidia, are based on the Arm Neoverse-based discrete data center CPU designed for AI infrastructure and high performance computing. The Nvidia Grace CPU Superchip includes two CPU chips connected over NVLink-C2C, a newly-introduced high-speed, low-latency, chip-to-chip interconnect, he said.\nHopper is also powering Nvidia's Grace Hopper accelerated CPU module, the company\u2019s first data center CPU purpose-built for giant-scale high performance computing and AI, Kharya said.\n\u201cIt has a breakthrough coherent chip-to-chip interconnect that enables us to create a super chip by connecting the Grace CPU with the Hopper GPU at 900 gigabytes per second,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're talking about two really powerful chips connected together. This allows us to provide 30-times higher system memory bandwidth to the GPUs in a server compared to DGX A100.\u201d\nThe custom system builder told CRN that customers have been waiting for the Grace CPU since it was first revealed last year.\n\u201cWe were told it would be available in 2022, and we\u2019re still waiting,\u201d the system builder said. \u201cMost of our customers still use Intel and AMD processors. ARM-based processors will likely be used for more specific applications.\u201d\nNvidia also made some big additions to its AI software stack.\nNvidia is unique in its full-stack AI, the foundation of which is an accelerated AI infrastructure available in all public clouds, said Eric Pounds, senior director of enterprise computing for the company.\n\u201cAt the top of the stack are AI skills to help enterprises and organizations solve some of the world's toughest challenges,\u201d Pounds said. Within each of these skills and beyond, there\u2019s a thriving ecosystem to create many AI-powered solutions for a broad range of enterprises and organizations.\u201c\nNvidia at GTC unveiled Nvidia AI accelerator program, which helps Nvidia software and solution ecosystem partners build and deliver optimized applications on top of the Invidia AI platform, Pounds said. The Nvidia AI Accelerator program has over 100 members at launch, he said.\nNvidia also introduced three new Nvidia AI solutions.\nNvidia AI Enterprise is a software suite that enables organizing to harness the power of AI, even if they do not have AI expertise today, with proven open source containers and frameworks. With Nvidia AI Enterprise 2.0, the software is certified to run on common data center platforms from VMware and Red Hat, including virtualized environments, bare metal environments, and environments orchestrated for their modern cloud native workloads, Pounds said.\n\u201cAnd they leverage mainstream Nvidia-certified servers configured with GPUs or with CPUs only,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, yes, this is the first time we\u2019re going to be supporting Nvidia AI Enterprise on CPU-only systems. And the software will also run across all major public clouds. ... With Nvidia AI enterprise software, AI is accessible to organizations of any size, providing the compute power, tools, and support so they can focus on creating business value from AI versus managing infrastructure stacks.\u201d\nThe second is an enhancement to Nvidia RIVA, the company's accelerated speech software development kit, Pounds said. The new version, Nvidia RIVA 2.0, which is available now, provides automatic speech recognition in seven languages, human-like text-to-speech with professional male and female voices, and custom fine tuning with the Nvidia Tao toolkit.\nThe third is Invidia Merlin 1.0, an accelerated end-to-end recommender framework for data science and machine learning engineers to help them quickly build, optimize, and deploy high performing recommenders at scale, Pounds said. It is currently available.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

[+] virtual version of his kitchenNvidia\nNvidia\u2019s spring GPU Technology Conference (GTC) is back again next week (March 21 to 24, 2022) and for the third year in a row, it\u2019s going to be all virtual and free of charge. As always, company founder and CEO Jensen Huang will be delivering his signature keynote to announce the latest technical advances in areas ranging from graphic rendering to artificial intelligence for health care and automated driving. While the keynote is happening at 8:00 am PDT on Tuesday March 22, the real value of the conference for most people is in the educational sessions and presentations going on all week.\n\n\nThere will be more than 900 online sessions with over 1,400 speakers running at various times throughout the day for anyone that wants to watch from different time zones. Registrants will also be able to catch up with the sessions on-demand after the conference.\n\nAmong those sessions are more than 50 devoted to automotive topics as part of the DRIVE Developer Days. Over the past several years, Nvidia has been aggressively expanding its focus on the automotive market, trying to be at the heart of what has become known as the software defined vehicle (SDV).\n\n\nWhen Tesla\nTSLA\n launched what was arguably one of the first SDVs a decade ago with the first Model S, Nvidia was a big part of that. While Tesla has turned to developing its own chips for Autopilot and FSD, Nvidia has been gaining a lot of traction across the industry with Drive Xavier and Orin chips and its extensive software portfolio which are now packaged under the Drive Hyperion brand. Nvidia Drive tools have been widely used by most of the startups in the automated driving sector and both Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar Land Rover have announced plans to use the full Drive Hyperion software and hardware stacks while companies including Volvo, Nio, Xpeng and TuSimple are using Nvidia chips.\n\nThe GTC automotive sessions cover far more than just creating automated driving systems software and using the hardware, but a wide range of related areas. That includes topics like creating synthetic datasets for use in the simulation system that runs on Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse technology, Concierge personalized user experience, the mapping platform that came from the acquisition of Deepmap and lots more.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\nHD maps are a key enabler to help automated vehicles calculate their position on the road in real ...

We already covered the RTX 3080 Ti, so in this review we'll see how the more mainstream tier model compares to Nvidia's flagship along the rest of the laptop GPU landscape across a range of games.\nThe RTX 3070 Ti is based on Nvidia's Ampere GA104 silicon. It increases the number of SMs from 40 in the older RTX 3070, up to 46 with the Ti model, getting very close to the full 48 SMs available with the RTX 3080 Laptop GPU. This brings with it 5888 CUDA cores.\n\nHowever, to fit this larger core count into the same 80-125W power range, clock speeds have been reduced down to a maximum of 1485 MHz rated boost in the 125W configuration. The memory subsystem, offering 8 GB of GDDR6 clocked up to 14 Gbps, remains identical to the RTX 3070.\nOn paper, the RTX 3070 Ti Laptop sits between the RTX 3080 and 3070 as you'd expect, getting very close to the 3080 in terms of core configuration, but featuring power options in line with the 3070.\n\nIt's also important to note the laptop 3070 Ti GPU is not the same as the desktop card: the desktop model has 2 more SMs, higher clock speeds, and faster GDDR6X memory. Because the desktop card is not as power constrained, it will perform a lot better.\nThe test platform for today's review was provided by XMG and their partner Uniwill. The GM5AG7Y chassis we have on hand features a 15-inch 1440p 240Hz display, an Intel Core i7-12700H processor and 32GB of DDR5 memory in a dual-stick configuration.\n\nThe RTX 3070 Ti is configured at the maximum power rating as offered by Nvidia, that's 125W plus 5W of Dynamic Boost. To be clear, there are multiple configurations of the RTX 3070 Ti that will all have the same advertised name, but different power limits.\nAn 80W configuration in a slimmer, smaller laptop will be significantly slower than the results we show today, which are representative of higher power laptops that have more cooling capacity and usually are not as svelte or lightweight.\n\nFor testing, we'll be benchmarking and comparing GPUs at 1080p, with the display connected to the iGPU. This is the most limited configuration and is how many laptops are run in a hybrid or Optimus mode. Then we also have 1440p results with the GPU connected directly to the display, which is the most GPU limited and representative of laptops with a mux switch or external display use.\n\nGaming Benchmarks\nWe're going to kick off the testing with Watch Dogs Legion. This game performs really well on the 3070 Ti at 1080p using ultra settings, outperforming the RTX 3080 by a few percent, though still sitting 8% behind the new 3080 Ti.\nIn total, we're seeing 16 percent better performance than the 115-130W configuration of the RTX 3070, which has essentially shifted this class of laptop up a tier compared to the previous generation, giving us a more comfortable buffer above 60 FPS on average.\n\n\nAt 1440p, the results aren't as favorable for the 3070 Ti, with the new model now slipping a few percent behind the RTX 3080 and much closer to the previous-generation RTX 3070. However the gap to the 3080 Ti remains similar at a 10 percent deficit, so among this grouping of higher end GPUs it's quite a close battle between the various options and you can't really go wrong for this game.\n\nLike with the 3080 Ti vs 3080, the RTX 3070 Ti struggles a little compared to the 3070 in Metro Exodus. Average performance with the configurations we tested was roughly the same, but 1% low performance was a bit behind at 1080p. The 3070 Ti ended up 6 percent slower than the 3080 Ti in this game using Ultra settings.\n\nAnd the situation doesn't really change all that much when benchmarking at 1440p using an external display. The 3070 Ti and 3070 are still very close in overall performance, with the 3070 Ti just marginally behind. Meanwhile the gap to the 3080 Ti has grown somewhat, now sitting 9 percent behind Nvidia's flagship tier of laptop GPUs. Unfortunately the new Ti model isn't offering much here.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 is a good result for the 3070 Ti, coming in only a few FPS behind the RTX 3080 Laptop and RX 6800M from AMD on average. At 1080p the new Ti model was 11 percent faster than the non-Ti model from last year, and just 3 percent slower than the 3080. However with a 12% gap to the 3080 Ti, you're not quite getting flagship levels of performance here.\n\nAt 1440p, the 3070 Ti sits a lot closer to the 3070 than the 3080 and 3080 Ti. It's only 5 percent faster than the older 3070 model, and 14% behind the 3080 Ti. This GPU is still very capable of playing RDR2 at 1440p though, easily achieving a 60 FPS average using High settings.\n\nIn Cyberpunk 2077, the new 3070 Ti is faster than the RTX 3070, claiming a 5% margin at 1080p. Like in Red Dead, there's roughly a 12 percent gap to the higher RTX 3080 Ti which in this title is about a 10 FPS difference, not earth shattering but enough of a gap so that the 3080 Ti makes sense. But on the other hand you can see a sizable gap when comparing the 3070 Ti to the 3060 so there's various ways to look at this result.\n\nAt 1440p though, the 3070 Ti is a lot less impressive only able to match the 3070 in overall performance. It doesn't fall behind like we see when comparing the 3080 Ti to the 3080, but I would have expected to see a performance gain with this new laptop model.\n\nIn Horizon Zero Dawn the 3070 Ti is decently faster than the 3070 and this is one of the largest margins we've seen so far: 16 percent in favor of the new model. It's still slower than the 3080 Ti to the tune of 12 percent, but this appears to be a game that scales well to the higher CUDA core count available with the 3070 Ti.\n\nAnd while the margin between various GPUs tends to shrink at 1440p, the 3070 Ti is still 11 percent head of the 3070 in this game. However it doesn't close the gap much to the 3080 and 3080 Ti configurations, with those GPUs benefiting from a higher maximum allowed power configuration of 150W, vs just 125W for the 3070 Ti.\n\nWith this generation of laptops, you're generally going to be getting both a GPU and CPU upgrade, and this is evident in a couple of games like Hitman 3. Using the Dubai benchmark at 1080p, the 3070 Ti configuration is significantly faster than previous models, 28% faster when paired with the Core i7-12700H compared to the RTX 3070 with Ryzen 9 5900HX. This is a combination of both CPU and GPU performance gains, helping to alleviate the bottleneck at high framerates while also delivering more GPU headroom.\n\nAs you can see this margin falls away significantly when comparing at 1440p, which is less CPU limited. It's still a great result for the 3070 Ti, 14% faster than the 3070, but the margin to the 3080 Ti using the same 12700H CPU is no different to other games we've looked at.\n\n\nSimilar story when looking at Rainbow Six Siege, the game is fully CPU limited at 1080p but when we focus exclusively on 1440p numbers we see the 3070 Ti fall pretty comfortably between the 3070 and 3080 configurations. The 3070 Ti is able to crank out over 240 FPS using medium settings in this title, which is perfect for the latest generation of 1440p 240Hz laptop panels.\n\nThe rest of the benchmarks we're showing are using new data we've collected over the last few months, so we're going to focus on the GPU limited 1440p results because they make the most sense for this class of GPU.\nKicking off this section is Assassin's Creed Valhalla, we had to throw out our old data for this game as Ubisoft released a major update that significantly improved performance on Nvidia GPUs. In this title there's not much of a gap between the 3070 Ti and 3080 Ti, so my recommendation would be to get the 3070 Ti if you're a big Valhalla player.\n\nIn Far Cry 6 the 3070 Ti ends up 9 percent behind the 3080 Ti, but either configuration is good for over 60 FPS on average using Ultra settings. The 8GB VRAM buffer is right on the edge with this title using the HD Texture Pack, so ideally the 3070 Ti would include more VRAM for 1440p gaming, but most of the time this isn't a significant issue.\n\nIn Guardians of the Galaxy, the 3070 Ti is a strong performer, offering over 100 FPS on average. It does end up 12 percent slower than the RTX 3080 Ti, but this is a very common performance margin between these GPUs. If you're really keen you can enable DLSS to further improve performance.\n\nDeathloop is another title where there's about a 10 FPS gap between the 3070 Ti and 3080 Ti when playing at 1440p. Both GPUs are capable of a 60 FPS experience using Ultra settings at this resolution though which is very much a high end experience on a laptop.\n\nForza Horizon 5 was a bit of a surprise, as the performance delta between the 3070 Ti and 3080 Ti configuration is quite small, most similar to what was seen in Assassin's Creed Valhalla. I'm not too sure why this would be the case, but I triple checked the results and this same small margin came up each time, and I don't believe it's a CPU limitation. Might be due to some other aspect of the design.\n\nResident Evil Village showcases the 10 FPS margin between the 3080 Ti and 3070 Ti once again, although in this instance the percentage difference sees the 3070 Ti end up 9 percent slower. There's probably not too much point detailing more games as we've seen this sort of margin on more than one occasion, so let's finish off the review with a look at ray tracing performance.\n\nFar Cry 6 uses fairly modest ray tracing effects which are easy to run on most GPUs. In the case of the RTX 3070 Ti, even when we continue using the Ultra preset and turn on all the ray tracing effects, the GPU is still capable of over a 60 FPS average and that's without using image scaling techniques like FSR. We're only 8 percent slower than the 3080 Ti, too, which isn't too bad.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy ray tracing isn't so favorable, using the maximum ray tracing effects in conjunction with the Ultra preset leads to an average frame rate below 60 FPS, 15 percent slower than the RTX 3080 Ti. However as mentioned previously, this game supports DLSS, so when using the Quality mode it's quite easy to get that frame rate back up over 60 FPS with only a small loss to visual quality (which is especially hard to spot on a laptop-size display)\n\nLastly, we have Deathloop, a game with ray traced shadows. Decent results on show in this game as well, with the 3070 Ti keeping its average frame rate up over 60 FPS without using DLSS or FSR. However, the performance delta to the 3080 Ti is rather large, so for the best experience you might want to consider Nvidia's top of the line GPU.\nHow Fast is this Laptop GPU?\nFrom a standalone performance perspective, the RTX 3070 Ti Laptop GPU performs quite well, and is well suited to the latest generation of laptops with 1440p displays. Even when gaming using ultra settings, or with ray tracing enabled, the RTX 3070 Ti is capable of a ~60 FPS experience or better, across a variety of titles, which we think is very decent for a laptop GPU.\nCompared to other GPUs, there's a few good things and a few disappointing things.\nOn the positive side, the 3070 Ti is able to close the gap to Nvidia's best laptop GPU, relative to previous generations. With the 3080 vs 3070 we were getting about a 20% margin at 1440p. That has dropped to just a 12 percent margin when comparing 3080 Ti vs 3070 Ti, albeit with a different selection of games.\n\nA lot of this is down to the 3080 Ti being an unimpressive upgrade on the 3080, while the 3070 Ti is slightly better in that area. But we say slightly for a reason: the RTX 3070 Ti is hardly an earth-shattering upgrade on the RTX 3070 that came before it. It's a little over 10 percent faster at 1080p, and a little under 10 percent faster at 1440p.\nAs is always the case with laptops, the value equation is tricky to pin down as we're looking across different generations and the way GPUs are configured by each manufacturer and paired with different CPUs, displays, and so on. Nvidia claims that the RTX 3070 Ti should start in $1,500 laptops, versus $1,300 for the RTX 3070, $2,000 for the RTX 3080, and $2,500 for the RTX 3080 Ti.\n\nAt these \"MSRPs,\" it's an absolute no brainer to go with the 3070 Ti over the 3080 and 3080 Ti. It's only 10 percent slower or so, for at least 25% less cash. The 3080 Ti looks like a particularly horrible value going on Nvidia's numbers, and a quick check of real world laptop pricing confirms this to be the case.\nIt's harder to make a recommendation between the 3070 Ti and 3070. Nvidia says 3070 Ti laptops should be 15% more expensive, but we wouldn't want to pay anything over 10% more for a pure gaming system. To justify a larger margin, we'd also be wanting a faster CPU, more storage space or some other system configuration upgrade.\n\nThere's also AMD GPUs to consider. The nearest competitor we've tested is the Radeon RX 6800M and we're set to get a refreshed line of 6000M series GPUs soon-ish. The 6800M is now only available in prev-gen laptops at this point, but it is a fair bit cheaper than 3070 Ti models. Nvidia does have superior ray tracing performance and DLSS in their favor, but AMD's pricing is pretty aggressive as a result, so they're not to be immediately discarded.\nShopping Shortcuts\n\nGeForce RTX 3070 Ti Laptops on Amazon\nIntel Core i7-12700H Laptops on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3080 Ti Laptops on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6800M Laptops on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 9 6900HS Laptops on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3060 Laptops on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3070 Laptops on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 3\n\n\n Got something to say?

Capable of four exaflops of AI performance, it features 6,159 Nvidia A100 GPUs and 1,536 AMD Epyc CPUs.Facebook/Meta are currently building what it expects to be the world's fastest AI supercomputer, the AI Research SuperCluster, based on the third-gen Nvidia DGX A100 system.But Eos will outperform both Perlmutter and the RSC, as well as Nvidia's existing Selene supercomputer, which will be retired.Nvidia said that for \"traditional scientific computing,\" Eos is capable of 275 petaflops of performance. Assuming Nvidia is referring to the standard Linpack benchmark, that puts it behind the 442 petaflops Fugaku supercomputer, officially the world's fastest supercomputer.However, China is believed to have secretly launched two exascale supercomputers last year.Later this year, the US expects to launch two systems capable of more than an exaflops of performance - under the LINPACK benchmark, not the AI benchmark used by Meta.The first, Frontier, is expected to be capable of more than 1.5 exaflops, and will feature 9,000 AMD Epyc CPUs and 36,000 AMD Radeon Instinct MI200 GPUs.It will be followed by Aurora, an oft-delayed system that could exceed 2 exaflops. It will boast 18,000 Intel Xeon Sapphire Rapids CPUs, and 54,000 Intel Xe GPUs.\n\n\n\n Subscribe to our daily newsletters\n\n\n Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in HPC & Quantum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nIonQ acquires majority stake in ID Quantique, signs MoU with SK Telecom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24 Oct 2024\n\n\n\n\nPurdue University unveils new Gautschi supercomputing cluster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nThe architecture of a supercomputer: A journey into advanced HPC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nEos\n\n\nDGX H100 SuperPod\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\nH100 GPU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

Rather than relying on things like virtual address translation, page-fault-based on-demand loading of data, and other traditional CPU-centric mechanisms for handling large amounts of information, BaM instead provides software and a hardware architecture that allows Nvidia GPUs to fetch data direct from memory and storage and process it without needing a CPU core to orchestrate it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaM has two main parts: a software-managed cache of GPU memory; and a software library for GPU threads to request data straight from NVMe SSDs by talking directly to the drives. The job of moving information between storage and GPU is handled by the threads on the GPU cores, using RDMA, PCIe interfaces, and a custom Linux kernel driver that allows SSDs to read and write GPU memory directly when needed. Commands for the drives are queued up by the GPU threads if the requested data isn't in the software-managed cache.\nThis means algorithms running on the GPU to perform intensive workloads can get at the information they need quickly and \u2013 crucially \u2013 in a way that's optimized for their data access patterns. See the aforementioned paper for the full technical details.\n\nDiagrams from the paper comparing the traditional CPU-centric approach to accessing storage (a) to the GPU-led BaM approach (b) and how said GPU would be physically wired to the storage devices (c).

Click to enlarge\n\nThe researchers tested a prototype Linux-powered BaM system using off-the-shelf GPUs and NVMe SSDs to demonstrate it is a viable alternative to today's approach of having the host processor direct everything. Storage access can be parallelized, synchronization hurdles are removed, and I/O bandwidth is more efficiently used to boost application performance, we're told.\n\u201cA CPU-centric strategy causes excessive CPU-GPU synchronization overhead and/or I/O traffic amplification, diminishing the effective storage bandwidth for emerging applications with fine-grain data-dependent access patterns like graph and data analytics, recommender systems, and graph neural networks,\u201d the researchers stated in their paper this month.\n\nWhy Nvidia sees a future in software and services: Recurring revenue\nNvidia, Apple noticeably absent from Intel-led chiplet interconnect collaboration\nIntel reveals GPU roadmap with hybrid integrated discrete graphics\n2021 in storage: We waited for a flash price revolution that never came. But about creativity? We can't complain\n\n\u201cWith the software cache, BaM does not rely on virtual memory address translation and thus does not suffer from serialization events like TLB misses,\u201d the authors, including Nvidia's chief scientist Bill Dally, who previously led Stanford's computer science department, noted.\n\"BaM provides a user-level library of highly concurrent NVMe submission/completion queues in GPU memory that enables GPU threads whose on-demand accesses miss from the software cache to make storage accesses in a high-throughput manner,\" they continued. \"This user-level approach incurs little software overhead for each storage access and supports a high-degree of thread-level parallelism.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team plans to open-source details of their hardware and software optimization for others to build such systems. We're reminded of AMD's Radeon Solid State Graphics (SSG) card that placed flash next to a GPU. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                IBM\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                IBM\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Storage\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                AIX\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Apple M1\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Backup\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Blu-Ray\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                DRAM\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                HDD\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                IBM Power\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                IBM Watson\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                IBM Z\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                In-Memory\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                i OS\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Network Attached Storage\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                OS/2\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Semiconductor Memory\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Snowflake Inc.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                Alder Lake\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Hardware\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n                    COMMENTS\n            \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                IBM\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                IBM\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Storage\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                AIX\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Apple M1\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Backup\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Blu-Ray\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                DRAM\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                HDD\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                IBM Power\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                IBM Watson\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                IBM Z\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                In-Memory\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                i OS\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Network Attached Storage\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                OS/2\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Semiconductor Memory\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Snowflake Inc.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                Alder Lake\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Hardware\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNvidia won the AI training race, but inference is still anyone's game\n\nComment\u00a0When it's all abstracted by an API endpoint, do you even care what's behind the curtain?\n\nSystems12 Mar 2025 | 5\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCoreWeave rides AI wave with IPO filing \u2013 but its fate hinges on Microsoft\nGPU farm discloses 77% of revenue tied to just two customers, putting Redmond giant front and center\n\nAI + ML4 Mar 2025 | \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAMD looks to undercut Nvidia, win gamers' hearts with RX 9070 series\nThe question is whether we can find them in stock and at MSRP\n\nSystems28 Feb 2025 | 51\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHow legacy storage infrastructure could endanger your future\nYour data is critical to AI success.

2022 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0U Power today announced it will\u00a0build a high-performance vehicle computer (HPVC) for its UP SUPER BOARD, which integrates the high-performance compute architecture of the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion AV platform. Tapping the power of the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin system-on-chip, U Power plans to develop one of the industry's first open vehicle supercomputers for scalable computing power.\n\n\nContinue Reading\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU Power's UP SUPER BOARD pushes the boundary significantly beyond the industry's current Skateboard chassis capabilities. Developed to meet the rapidly changing requirements for a customized experience, it integrates core capabilities of smart EVs, including E-propulsion, suspension, steering, smart driving and thermal management. At the core of the smart driving system is the pluggable HPVC, to which chips can be added or removed, delivering computing power of up to 1,000 trillion operations per second (TOPS) and beyond.\u00a0 \n\nThis highly scalable compute power enables the UP SUPER BOARD to address Level 2 to Level 4 autonomous driving needs.

Using NVIDIA RTX and CloudXR, the creative team elevated the AR experience and delivered high-fidelity, photorealistic virtual environments over a 5G network.\n\n\nNatural, Immersive AR Over 5G \u2014 It\u2019s a Stream Come True\nThe Green Planet AR Experience\u2019s mission is to inspire, educate and motivate visitors toward positive change by showcasing how plants are vital to all life on earth. Through the project, Factory 42 and the BBC help audiences gain a deeper understanding of ecosystems, the importance of biodiversity and what it means to protect our planet.\nTo create an immersive environment that captured the rich, vivid colors and details of natural worlds, the Factory 42 team needed high-quality imagery and graphics power. Using mobile edge computing allowed them to deliver the interactive experience to a large number of users over EE\u2019s private 5G network.\nThe AR experience runs on a custom, on-premises GPU edge-rendering stack powered by NVIDIA RTX 8000 professional GPUs. Using NVIDIA RTX, Factory 42 created ultra-high-quality 3D digital assets, environments, interactions and visual effects that made the natural elements look as realistic as possible.\n\nWith the help of U.K.-based integrator The GRID Factory, the GPU edge-rendering stack is connected to EE\u2019s private 5G network using the latest Ericsson Industry Connect solution for a dedicated wireless cellular network. Using NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation (RTX vWS) on VMware Horizon, and NVIDIA\u2019s advanced CloudXR streaming solution, Factory 42 can stream all the content from the edge of the private 5G network to the Samsung S21 mobile handsets used by each visitor.\n\u201cNVIDIA RTX vWS and CloudXR were a step ahead of the competitive products \u2014 their robustness, ability to fractionalize the GPU, and high-quality delivery of streamed XR content were key features that allowed us to create our Green Planet AR Experience as a group experience to thousands of users,\u201d said Stephen Stewart, CTO at Factory 42.\nThe creative team at Factory 42 designed the content in the AR environment, which is rendered in real time with the Unity game engine. The 3D hologram of Sir David was created using volumetric capture technology provided by Dimension Studios. Spatial audio provides a surround-sound setup, which guides people through the virtual environment as digital plants and animals react to the presence of visitors in the space.\nCombining these technologies, Factory42 created a new level of immersive experience \u2014 one only made possible through 5G networks.\n\u201cNVIDIA RTX and CloudXR are fundamental to our ability to deliver this 5G mobile edge compute experience,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cThe RTX 8000 GPU provided the graphics power and the NVENC support required to deploy into an edge rendering cluster. And with CloudXR, we could create robust connections to mobile handsets.\u201d\n\nSustainability was considered at every level of construction and operation. The materials used in building The Green Planet AR Experience will be reused or recycled after the event to promote circularity. And combining NVIDIA RTX and CloudXR with 5G, Factory 42 can give audiences interactive experiences with hundreds of different trees, plants and creatures inside an eco-friendly, virtual space.\nExperience the Future of Streaming at GTC\nLearn more about how NVIDIA is helping companies create unforgettable immersive experiences at GTC, which runs from March 21-24.\nRegistration is free. Sign up to hear from leading companies and professionals across industries, including Factory 42, as they share insights about the future of AR, VR and other extended reality applications.\nAnd watch the keynote address by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, on March 22 at 8 a.m. Pacific, to hear the latest news on NVIDIA technologies.\n\n\nCategories: Pro Graphics | Virtual RealityTags: 5G | CloudXR | NVIDIA RTX | Rendering | Social Impact | Virtual Reality | Virtualization \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

That includes the new Hopper architecture and H100 GPUs. \nRich MillerRows of NVIDIA DGX systems supported by NVIDIA Spectrum-4 , a  400Gbps end-to-end networking platform. (Image: NVIDIA)      NVIDIA today unveiled powerful new hardware to serve as the key building blocks for its vision to transform data centers into \u201cAI factories,\u201d unleashing new frontiers in technical computing.In the keynote of NVIDIA\u2019s GTC 2022 conference, CEO Jensen Huang said AI applications are driving fundamental changes in data center design.\u201cAI data centers process mountains of continuous data to train and refine AI models,\u201d Huang said. \u201cRaw data comes in, is refined, and intelligence goes out \u2014 companies are manufacturing intelligence and operating giant AI factories.\u201dTo power this transformation, NVIDIA unveiled its new Hopper GPU architecture and H100 GPU, along with new systems that will optimize the new hardware for massive computing tasks \u2013 like creating digital twins of million square foot Amazon warehouses, which will make it easier to train robotic systems to manage these facilities.Huang is a key visionary in high performance computing, who sees technical computing as a world-changing undertaking. That came across in his GTC keynote, as Huang shared a vision of a future in which intelligence is created on an industrial scale and woven into real and virtual worlds.That includes climate change, as Huang shared an update on NVIDIA\u2019s plan to create Earth-2 \u2013 a digital twin for the entire earth that can be used to model climate solutions at unprecedented scale.\u201cScientists predict that a supercomputer a billion times larger than today\u2019s is needed to effectively simulate regional climate change,\u201d Huang said. \u201cNVIDIA is going to tackle this grand challenge with our Earth-2, the world\u2019s first AI digital twin supercomputer, and invent new AI and computing technologies to give us a billion-X before it\u2019s too late.\u201dHopper Architecture Succeeds Ampere GPUsIt\u2019s a big vision, but Huang and NVIDIA have a track record of major innovation in high performance computing (HPC). NVIDIA\u2019s graphics processing (GPU) technology has been a key driver in the rise of specialized computing, enabling new workloads in supercomputing, artificial intelligence (AI) and connected cars.The adoption of NVIDIA GPUs has also boosted the power density of racks inside data centers, which in many cases has required additional cooling to manage the heat within IT environments.NVIDIA has been investing heavily in innovation in AI, which it sees as a pervasive technology trend that will bring its GPU technology into every area of the economy and society. The company\u2019s AI platform is now used by 25,000 companies around the globe.The NVIDIA H100, the first CPU chip using the new Hopper architecture. (Image: NVIDIA)NVIDIA\u2019s Hopper architecture, named for pioneering computer scientist Grace Hopper, brings new levels of computing power. Hopper succeeds the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, launched two years ago.The first Hopper-based GPU is the H100, featuring more than 80 billion transistors. It was created using the 4-nanometer process technology from chip foundry TSMC.\u00a0 \u201cHopper H100 is the biggest generational leap ever \u2014 9x at-scale training performance over A100 and 30x large-language-model inference throughput,\u201d Huang said.Hopper is optimized to accelerate workloads using Transformer, a deep learning model developed by Google that enables researchers to work with larger datasets in tasks like natural language processing and computer vision. The H100 includes a Transformer Engine that NVIDIA says can dramatically speed these projects without losing accuracy.\u201cThe Transformer model is now the dominant building block for neural networks,\u201d said Paresh Kharya, senior director of product management and marketing for accelerated computing at NVIDIA. \u201cThe computing required to train large Transformer models has been exploding.\u201dCloud platforms planning to integrate the Hopper architecture into their offerings Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud, along with Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent Cloud.Leading systems makers planning servers with H100 accelerators including Cisco, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Inspur, Lenovo, Supermicro and a wide range of HPC-focused server venders.More Powerful DGX Systems Coming to Data CentersThe H100 will be integrated into the fourth-generation NVIDIA DGX, the \u201csupercomputer in a box\u201d designed for deployments in traditional data center environments, including colocation providers in NVIDIA\u2019s DGX-Ready program. Each DGX system will feature eight H100 GPUs per system, providing 32 petaflops of AI performance, the company said.The DGX H100 will be available in late 2022, and is expected to require up to 10.2 kilowatts of power in a 6 rack unit system, a meaningful increase from the 6.5 kWs in its predecessor, the DGX A100. A typical data center rack would be able to physically support up to five DGX units, but only if its environment can handle up to 50 kWs of density.That\u2019s why Huang\u2019s vision of data centers as \u201cAI factories\u201d will require advanced cooling technologies, which could include optimized air-cooled containment systems, or a range of liquid cooling options.In other announcements from GTC:\nNVIDIA is developing Omniverse Cloud, a suite of cloud services that gives artists, creators, designers and developers access to the NVIDIA Omniverse platform for 3D design and simulation.\u00a0 The service is currently under development, and NVIDIA did not share a launch date, or indicate where its cloud infrastructure would reside. NVIDIA operates online operations through both in-house data centers and leased space at wholesale providers. Industry reports\u00a0indicate NVIDIA leased about 14 megawatts of new data center capacity in 2021.\nNVIDIA announced NVIDIA Spectrum-4, the next generation of its Ethernet platform. The 400Gbps end-to-end networking platform provides 4x higher switching throughput than previous generations, with 51.2 terabits per second, the company said.\nExpanded configurations are in development for the NVIDIA Grace CPU, which was announced last year, is based on the energy-efficient Arm microarchitecture found in billions of smartphones and edge computing devices. At GTC 2022, NVIDIA said Grace will be available as a \u201csuperchip\u201d with two CPU chips connected over a low-latency chip-to-chip interconnect.\nThe company announced NVIDIA OVX a computing system designed to power large-scale digital twin simulations that will run within NVIDIA Omniverse.\nWith its focus on digital twins, NVIDIA is offering a different and specific vision for the metaverse technologies, which have been a hot topic since Facebook rebranded to Meta last fall. As analysts and users struggle with the value proposition of a virtual social network, NVIDIA\u2019s vision for Omniverse-powered digital twins comes with a clearer vision for how 3D worlds can translate into concrete gains in business and science.NVIDIA says OVX will enable designers and engineers to build physically accurate digital twins of buildings. Companies can evaluate and test complex systems and processes, with multiple autonomous systems interacting to optimize factories and warehouses, or train robots and autonomous vehicles before deploying them in the physical world.\u201cPhysically accurate digital twins are the future of how we design and build,\u201d said Bob Pette, vice president of Professional Visualization at NVIDIA. \u201cDigital twins will change how every industry and company plans. The OVX portfolio of systems will be able to power true, real-time, always-synchronous, industrial-scale digital twins across industries.\u201dIn his keynote, Huang shared how Amazon uses Omniverse Enterprise to design and optimize their fulfillment operations.\u201cModern fulfillment centers are evolving into technical marvels \u2014 facilities operated by humans and robots working together,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAI will revolutionize all industries.\u201d About the Author Rich MillerI write about the places where the Internet lives, telling the story of data centers and the people who build them.

Unusual demands. The latest extortion gang is on an unorthodox rampage.Illustration: Elena Lacey; Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveRansomware gangs have become well-oiled moneymaking machines in their quest for criminal profit. But since December, a seemingly new group called Lapsus$ has added chaotic energy to the field, cavorting about with a strong social media presence on Telegram, a string of high-profile victims\u2014including Samsung, Nvidia, and Ubisoft\u2014calamitous leaks, and dramatic accusations that add up to a reckless escalation in an already unlawful industry.What makes Lapsus$ noteworthy, too, is that the group isn't really a ransomware gang. Instead of exfiltrating data, encrypting target systems, and then threatening to leak the stolen information unless the victim pays up, Lapsus$ seems to exclusively focus on the data theft and extortion. The group gains access to victims through phishing attacks, then steals the most sensitive data it can find without deploying data-encrypting malware.\u201cIt\u2019s all been quite erratic and unusual,\u201d says Brett Callow, a threat analyst at the antivirus company Emsisoft. \u201cMy sense is that they are a talented but inexperienced operation. Whether they will seek to expand and bring on affiliates or keep it small and lean remains to be seen.\u201dLapsus$ emerged just a few months ago, at first focused almost exclusively on Portuguese-language targets. In December and January, the group hacked and attempted to extort Brazil\u2019s health ministry, the Portuguese media giant Impresa, the South American telecoms Claro and Embratel, and Brazilian car rental company Localiza, among others. In some cases, Lapsus$ also mounted denial-of-service attacks against victims, making their sites and services unavailable for a period of time.\u00a0Even in those early campaigns, Lapsus$ got creative; it set Localiza's website to redirect to an adult media site for a couple of hours until the company could revert it.\u00a0As the attackers have ramped up and gained confidence, they've expanded their reach. In recent weeks, the group has hit Argentine ecommerce platforms MercadoLibre and MercadoPago, claims to have breached the British telecom Vodafone, and has begun leaking sensitive and valuable source code from Samsung and Nvidia.\u00a0\u201cRemember: The only goal is money, our reasons are not political,\u201d Lapsus$ wrote in its Telegram channel in early December. And when the group announced its Nvidia breach on Telegram at the end of February, it added, \u201cPlease note: We are not state sponsored and we are not in politics AT ALL.\u201dResearchers say, though, that the truth about the gang's intentions are more murky. Unlike many of the most prolific ransomware groups, Lapsus$ seems to be more of a loose collective than a disciplined, corporatized operation. \u201cAt this point it's difficult to say with certainty what the group\u2019s motivations are,\u201d says Xue Yin Peh, a senior cyber-threat intelligence analyst at the security firm Digital Shadows. \u201cThere are no indications yet that the group uses ransomware to extort victims, so we can\u2019t confirm that they\u2019re financially motivated.\u201d\u201cThis group operates on street cred and clout.\u201dCharles Carmakal, MandiantLapsus$ breached Nvidia in mid-February, stealing 1 terabyte of data, including a significant amount of sensitive information about the designs of Nvidia graphics cards, source code for an Nvidia AI rendering system called DLSS, and the usernames and passwords of more than 71,000 Nvidia employees. The group threatened to release more and more data if Nvidia didn't meet a series of unusual demands. At first the gang told the chipmaker to remove an anti-crypto-mining feature called Lite Hash Rate from its GPUs. Then Lapsus$ demanded that the company release certain drivers for its chips.\u201cThe focus on cryptocurrency mining suggests that the group may ultimately be financially driven, however they are certainly taking a different approach than other groups in soliciting financial rewards,\u201d Digital Shadows' Peh says.In a tumultuous turn, Lapsus$ also accused Nvidia of \u201chacking back\u201d\u2014lashing out against the group in retaliation for the attacks. A source close to the Nvidia incident disputed the claims, though, telling WIRED that the company did not hack back or deploy malware against Lapsus$.\u201cIt's difficult to say. The only source we've had for it is the ransomware group themselves,\u201d says independent security researcher Bill Demirkapi of the claims. \u201cThe explanation they gave for how Nvidia hacked back does make sense, but I always take such statements with a grain of salt, because Lapsus$ has an incentive to make Nvidia look as bad as possible.\u201dNvidia said in a statement that it learned about the breach on February 23 and quickly \u201cfurther hardened our network, engaged cybersecurity incident response experts, and notified law enforcement.\u201d The company acknowledged that the attackers stole employee authentication credentials and some proprietary data.In a blithe, even rash move, Lapsus$ also included two sensitive Nvidia code-signing certificates in its leaks. Other attackers quickly abused them to make their malware look more authentic and trustworthy in certain scenarios.\u00a0\u201cThis group operates on street cred and clout,\u201d says Charles Carmakal, senior vice president and chief technical officer of the cybersecurity firm Mandiant. \u201cThey're bragging to their friends, and if they get money, they'll take it, but money doesn't seem to be the sole or even primary driver. So a victim company that wants to negotiate with them and may think about paying them likely won\u2019t get the outcome they\u2019re hoping for.\u201dThat thirst for notoriety makes Lapsus$ particularly reckless and disruptive. While they don\u2019t encrypt systems, Lapsus$ has deleted files and virtual machines, and generally caused \u201ca whole lot of chaos,\u201d as Carmakal puts it.Just a few days after it began leaking Nvidia data, Lapsus$ also announced that it had stolen 190 gigabytes of data from Samsung, including boot-loader source code and algorithms for the Galaxy smartphone line's biometric authentication system. Samsung confirmed last week that it suffered a breach.A few days later, Ubisoft joined the fray. \u201cLast week, Ubisoft experienced a cyber security incident that caused temporary disruption to some of our games, systems, and services,\" the company wrote in a statement on Thursday. \u201cAs a precautionary measure we initiated a company-wide password reset \u2026 There is no evidence any player personal information was accessed or exposed as a by-product of this incident.\u201dSpecific details about the group remain scarce for now. Researchers suspect that Lapsus$ is based in South America, potentially in Brazil, and say it may have a few members in Europe as well, perhaps in Portugal. Lapsus$ doesn't have a homepage on the dark web for posting samples of leaked data and negotiating with victims. Instead, in an unorthodox move for ransomware groups, the gang uses Telegram for most of its public-facing operations.\u201cOne unusual tendency of Lapsus$ is their use of Telegram to broadcast victims\u2019 identities,\u201d Digital Shadows' Peh says. \u201cAbusing a legitimate tool like Telegram ensures Lapsus$\u2019s data leak channel will see minimum disruption, and that their victims\u2019 identities can be exposed to anyone with an internet connection.\u201dOne of Lapsus$'s trademark antics is to run polls on its Telegram channel where onlookers can vote for whose data the gang should publish next.\u201cIt\u2019s very reminiscent of the Lulzsec folks and even Anonymous back in the day,\u201d Mandiant's Carmakal says of the two hacktivist collectives that rose to prominence in the early 2010s. \u201cThose folks had political motivations, or pretended to, but were also doing it for the fame and glory, and Lulzsec in particular was more overt about doing it for fun. With Lapsus$ it's a very dangerous thing for people to do for fun, and they will be arrested at some point in time.\u201dIn the meantime, though, the question for Big Tech is, who will be in Lapsus$'s crosshairs next? It seems that no target is too big or influential to be out of reach\u2014and that the demands may be just as hard to predict.More Great WIRED Stories\ud83d\udce9 The latest on tech, science, and more: Get our newsletters!Driving while baked?

This week at the company's GPU Technology Conference (GTC) they demonstrated how several high-profile companies are bringing digital twins into production via their all-encompassing Omniverse hardware and software platforms.\nNvidia showed off a number of new products and features for its Omniverse digital twinning platform at GTC. Included in the list of updates was Omniverse Cloud, as well as the new Nvidia OVX systems designed for building such worlds.\u00a0\nAlongside announcements were several demonstrations of Omniverse implementations from companies including Amazon, Siemens Gamesa, Kroger, Pepsi and Lowes. The basics of each setup was the same, but the purposes and goals varied greatly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiemens Gamesa digitally twins wind farms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiemens Gamesa, the wind energy subsidiary of Siemens Energy, already has thousands of wind turbines located around the world.\nUsing Omniverse and Modulus, Nvidia's framework for physics-based machine learning networks, Siemens Gamesa built models of its wind farms to maximize their efficiency. In particular, the company was trying to find a way to better model the wake effect produced by added turbines.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWake effects generated by newly placed turbines can disrupt the flow of air and make an entire farm less productive. Current wake effect simulation methods on a 100-CPU cluster can still take more than a month to run, Nvidia said.\u00a0\n\nHow Nvidia is overcoming slowdown issues in GPU clusters\nMicrosoft, Nvidia extend Azure confidential computing to GPUs\nNvidia: Better parallelism coming to standard C++ lib\nHow Pfizer used AI and supercomputers to design COVID-19 vaccine, tablet\n\nUsing Omniverse sped Siemens Gamesa's wake effect simulations by 4,000x, Nvidia claimed.\u00a0\n\nKroger builds an Omniverse research lab\n\nMidwestern US-based grocery chain Kroger is partnering with Nvidia to build \"a state-of-the-art AI lab and demonstration center to expand Kroger's freshness initiatives, improve shipping logistics and create a better shopping experience,\" Nvidia said.\u00a0\nThe lab will be located in Cincinnati, Ohio, and will use Nvidia Omniverse Enterprise running on nine Nvidia DGX A100 systems with Nvidia's InfiniBand networking and RTX-capable workstations.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKroger's particular goals for its Omniverse project include identifying early indicators of food spoilage using computer vision and analytics, using dynamic routing for last-mile inventory delivery and optimizing store processes.\n\nAmazon, Pepsi and Lowes\n\n\nYoutube Video\n\nAmazon VP of engineering and robotics, Parris Wellman, said that Omniverse digital twins were a key part of its move to deploy \"hundreds of thousands of mobile drive robots\" that enabled it to condense warehouse storage into pods that could be stacked far more densely than if humans were responsible for retrieving items.\nWellman said that Amazon has built digital twins of its warehouses that allow it to optimize warehouse design, train more efficient robots, and make Amazon's entire fulfillment process smoother.\n\nYoutube Video\n\nPepsiCo used digital twinning to simulate its distribution centers with the key goal of improving efficiency and sustainability. PepsiCo said it built simulations of its packaging centers to determine the most efficient layout and make additional changes virtually before investing in physical changes.\u00a0\n\"When we're looking at new products and processes, we will use digital twins to simulate and test models and environments in real time before applying changes to the physical distribution centers,\" \"said Qi Wang, vice president of research and development at PepsiCo.\nLowe's is using Omniverse at its Innovation Labs to \"unlock the next generation of its stores,\" which it said involves removing friction points for customers and employees. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Virtual Reality\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n                    COMMENTS\n            \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Virtual Reality\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNvidia won the AI training race, but inference is still anyone's game\n\nComment\u00a0When it's all abstracted by an API endpoint, do you even care what's behind the curtain?\n\nSystems12 Mar 2025 | 5\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAMD looks to undercut Nvidia, win gamers' hearts with RX 9070 series\nThe question is whether we can find them in stock and at MSRP\n\nSystems28 Feb 2025 | 51\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCoreWeave rides AI wave with IPO filing \u2013 but its fate hinges on Microsoft\nGPU farm discloses 77% of revenue tied to just two customers, putting Redmond giant front and center\n\nAI + ML4 Mar 2025 | \n\n\n\n\n\n \nData resilience and data portability\nWhy organizations should protect everything, everywhere, all at once\nSponsored Feature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCash torrent pouring into Nvidia slows \u2013 despite booming Blackwell adoption\nMay we all have problems like annual revenue growth dropping from 126 to 114 percent\n\nNvidia GTC27 Feb 2025 | 9\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRunning hot?

At the time, NVIDIA told us to expect more information later in January, only for January (and February) to come and go without further mention of the card. But now, in the waning days of March, the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti\u2019s day has come, as NVIDIA is launching their new flagship video card today.\nSo what is the RTX 3090 Ti? In short, it\u2019s every last bit of performance that NVIDIA can muster out of their Ampere architecture \u2013 the swan song for an architecture that has carried NVIDIA through the last 18 months. Whereas the original RTX 3090 left a bit of performance on the table for yield or performance reasons, such as a couple of SMs or keeping TDPs to just 350 Watts, RTX 3090 Ti leaves all of that behind. It\u2019s all the Ampere that Ampere can be, with a fully-enabled GA102 GPU, better GDDR6X memory, and few (if any) limits on performance.\nBut Ampere unconstrained is going to cost you. While the original RTX 3090 launched at an already high $1499, RTX 3090 Ti ratchets that up further to $1999. And ongoing market distortions (i.e. the chip crunch) will likely compound that further, judging from RTX 3090 prices. But regardless, the RTX 3090 Ti isn\u2019t priced to be competitive; it\u2019s priced to be elite. NVIDIA never did produce a true Titan card for this generation, so the RTX 3090 Ti is set to be the next best thing.\nThis launch also reflects a more recent tendency from NVIDIA to release one last, speed-bumped card towards the latter part of an architecture\u2019s lifecycle as memory technologies improve. The GTX 1080 received a low-key variant with 11Gbps GDDR5X, and now the RTX 3090 Ti is taking a similar tack with its 21Gbps GDDR6X. Neither of these bumps immensely changed the performance calculus for their respective cards, but as video cards are nothing if not perpetually bandwidth starved, the extra bandwidth is one more way to unlock just a bit more performance from these cards.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nRTX 3090 Ti\nRTX 3090\nRTX 3080 Ti\nRTX 3080\nTitan RTX\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n10752\n10496\n10240\n8704\n4608\n\n\nROPs\n112\n112\n112\n96\n96\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1.86GHz\n1.7GHz\n1.67GHz\n1.71GHz\n1.77GHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n21Gbps GDDR6X\n19.5Gbps GDDR6X\n19Gbps GDDR6X\n19Gbps GDDR6X\n14Gbps GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n384-bit\n384-bit\n384-bit\n320-bit\n384-bit\n\n\nVRAM\n24GB\n24GB\n12GB\n10GB\n24GB\n\n\nSingle Precision Perf.\n40 TFLOPS\n35.7 TFLOPS\n34.1 TFLOPS\n29.8 TFLOPS\n16.3 TFLOPS\n\n\nTensor Perf.

There are no disabled SMs here or cut-down memory busses. All 28 billion transistors are finally in play.\nWith that said, the net change over the RTX 3090 is 2 SMs \u2013 NVIDIA is going from 82 of 84 SMs enabled to all 84 up and running. So the number of additional SMs is not particularly significant from a performance perspective, amounting to a roughly 2.5% increase in SM hardware. Rather, it\u2019s a good illustration of how NVIDIA is employing every technique they can to wring out every last bit of performance from the card, and how they\u2019re comfortable enough with GA102 yields to finally base a product around the fully-enabled chip.\n\nThe bigger factor influencing GPU performance is arguably clockspeeds. NVIDIA has raised the base clockspeed to 1.56GHz, and meanwhile the boost clock rating \u2013 the average clockspeed of the card in gaming workloads \u2013 is now 1.86GHz. That\u2019s a roughly 160Mhz (9%) improvement over the RT 3090\u2019s boost clock, and it applies to all aspects of the chip equally, from the CUDA cores to the ROPs. So everything is getting faster throughout.\nIn order to keep the even hungrier beast fed, NVIDIA has also stepped up their game with respect to memory technology, and marking one of the few true technological improvements between the original RTX 3090 and the new RTX 3090 Ti. For their new flagship card, NVIDIA is using second generation, 16Gbit GDDR6X memory chips, which have only recently become available. These higher capacity chips can run faster, and they allow NVIDIA to outfit all 24GB of memory using just 12 chips along the front of the card, instead of having to use the 24 chip clamshell configuration that was employed by the original RTX 3090.\nThe reduction in memory chip counts not only improves power consumption, but it means NVIDIA and partners no longer have to worry about cooling toasty GDDR6X chips on the back of their cards, which was one of the original RTX 3090\u2019s design drawbacks. Instead, everything is on the same side as the GPU, and can be cooled by the card\u2019s massive vapor chamber and heatsink setup.\nNVIDIA is also using this opportunity to crank up the memory clockspeeds, going from 19.5Gbps on the RTX 3090 to a flat 21Gbps on the new card. To be sure, this isn\u2019t a massive clockspeed bump, but the extra 8% in memory bandwidth helps to ensure the similarly faster GPU is kept fed, at least to the same degree as the original RTX 3090. However, it does mean that NVIDIA has invested most of their power savings from halving the GDDR6X chip count on higher memory clockspeeds, so there is little overall change in GDDR6X power consumption.\nAnd more so than anything else about the RTX 3090 Ti, \u201cpower\u201d is the operative word for the new card. The original RTX 3090, despite its then chart-topping 350W TDP, is still prone to throttling to stay at TDP. In fact, this goes for most Ampere cards; NVIDIA\u2019s GA10x GPUs can generally exceed 2GHz, but they require a whole lot of power to get there. And no card chugs power more than the RTX 3090.\nSo for their ultimate variant of the card, NVIDIA has updated the RTX 3090 Ti to support a TDP of 450 Watts, a full 100 Watts (29%) higher than the original card. By significantly raising the power limits of the card, the RTX 3090 Ti is designed to be able to run the GA102 GPU at its highest turbo clockspeeds more often \u2013 though even then, it\u2019s telling that the game clock is only 1.86GHz. This, above all else, underscores how NVIDIA is looking to wring out nearly every last bit of performance out of GA102; power consumption limits have very nearly been thrown out the window. And yet even then, there are going to be add-in-board partner designs for the RTX 3090 Ti that call for almost 500W.\n\nThe fact that NVIDIA is going to be shipping a 450W video card is certainly an interesting choice, and one I find a bit worrying. This is almost certainly not going to be the last card to ship with such a high TDP, so this is very much a sign of things to come. And while we\u2019ve long grown accustomed to flagship cards that push things to ridiculous levels, I am very concerned about what this may mean for more mainstream video cards down the line. Video card TDPs have been going up across the board for the last several years, and a 450W flagship card is a sign that it won\u2019t be stopping any time soon. But that\u2019s a discussion for another day.\nIn order to support this higher TDP, in turn, NVIDIA has updated both their power delivery and cooling systems. On the power delivery front, the RTX 3090 Ti will be the first card to use the new 12VHPWR connector from the just-launched ATX 3.0 power supply specification. The 12VHPWR connector is designed to deliver up to 600W over 16 pins, paving the way for some very high-powered video cards and other accelerators. The 12VHPWR connector replaces the similar 12-pin connector NVIDIA has been using on the other RTX 30 series cards, serving the same function. Though it should be noted that while NVIDIA is using the physical connector, they aren\u2019t making full use of it; RTX 3090 Ti will not be using the variable power delivery aspects, and instead will be operating in 450W mode at all times.\n\nAs for cooling a 450W video card, NVIDIA will once more be setting the tempo here with their Founders Edition (reference) card. NVIDIA is once again using their 3-slot cooler from the original RTX 3090, though according to the company they have made unspecified tweaks to their their vapor chamber cooler to improve the cooler\u2019s performance. Still, any improvements in cooling efficiency are almost certainly going to be overshadowed by the card\u2019s greatly increased TDP, so at the end of the day the solution is going to involve moving a whole lot of air to constantly dissipate 450W of heat.\nTarget Market & Partner Cards\nThroughout the entire lifetime of the current RTX 3090, NVIDIA\u2019s flagship GeForce video card has always sat on an odd spot between being a gaming card and being a content creation or compute card. While NVIDIA has a separate line of cards specifically for professional visualization (the A-series cards, aka the former Quadro family), the fastest GeForce (or GeForce-adjacent card) has always served to fill the gap between GeForce and Quadro, for users who need a top-tier card with lots of memory, but not necessarily the extra bells and whistles that come from a ProViz card. In recent years that gap has been covered by the Titan cards, and this generation it\u2019s been the RTX 3090.\nUnsurprisingly then, NVIDIA is going the same route with the RTX 3090 Ti, aiming it at both gamers and content creators. For gamers who need the fastest NVIDIA card available (and money is no object), then the RTX 3090 Ti will fill that role. Meanwhile NVIDIA is also chasing content creators who need more than the 12GB of VRAM available on the RTX 3080 Ti, but aren\u2019t ready to step up to a ProViz card. And in fact, NVIDIA is pushing the latter a lot more than the former; while the RTX 3090 Ti is a fast gaming card, NVIDIA themselves admit that \u201ctoday's most graphically intense games don't take full advantage of the horsepower the RTX 3090 Ti offers. And that's fine.\u201d\nConsequently, NVIDIA\u2019s published performance estimates for the new card are chiefly aimed around content creation. Gaming performance is expected to be 9% ahead of the original RTX 3090 and 52% faster than the Turing-based Titan RTX, while rendering performance is anywhere between 42%-102% faster than that same Titan RTX. So along with content creation being a higher priority for NVIDIA, the company is also clearly trying to entice current creators on RTX Titan/2080 Ti to upgrade to the fastest Ampere card.\n\nAs for the card supply, both NVIDIA and its partners will be supplying cards. NVIDIA is once again producing a \u201climited edition\u201d Founders Edition version of this card, which in the US will be sold exclusively through Best Buy. And, since the RTX 3090 Ti requires a new power connector and more power overall, NVIDIA\u2019s FE card will come with a 3x8pin adapter, up from the 2x8-pin adapter included with the regular RTX 3090.\nGallery: GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Partner Cards\nMeanwhile the board partners will be doing their own things, as is usually the case with well-established GPUs. The power requirements are going to be similarly high \u2013 and the coolers similarly beefy. According to NVIDIA, all of the usual suspects will have cards, and we\u2019ve already seen designed from EVGA, Colorful, and Asus. This includes listings for $1999 base-model cards, but as the GPU market continues to be weird, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how many of those are available and how long they\u2019ll last, even at these prices.\nOtherwise, sizing up NVIDIA and AMD\u2019s product stacks, the RTX 3090 Ti all but stands alone in terms of price and positioning. Backstopping it will be the original RTX 3090, which according to NVIDIA will remain in full production (and will need to fall in price to accommodate the new card). And below that will be the RTX 3080 Ti, followed by AMD\u2019s top Radeon part, the Radeon RX 6900 XT.\n\n\n\nQ2 2022 GPU Product Lineups\n\t\t\t(Theoretical MSRPs, Please Check eBay For Actual Availabiltiy)\n\n\nAMD\nPrice\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\u00a0\n$1999\nGeForce RTX 3090 Ti\n\n\n\u00a0\n$1499\nGeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\u00a0\n$1199\nGeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n\n\n\u00a0\nN/A\nGeForce RTX 3080 12GB\n\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XT\n$999\n\u00a0\n\n\nRadeon RX 6800 XT\n$649/$699\nGeForce RTX 3080\n\n\nRadeon RX 6800\n$579/$599\nGeForce RTX 3070 Ti\n\n\nRadeon RX 6700 XT\n$479/$499\nGeForce RTX 3070\n\n\n\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n88 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nFlunk - Tuesday, March 29, 2022 - link\nI hear the 4090 TI will require you to hook up a power station directly to the card.\n\n\n\nblppt - Tuesday, March 29, 2022 - link\n\"Requires one vintage RBMK-1000 power supply.\"\n\n\n\nSamus - Wednesday, March 30, 2022 - link\nSeriously...450 Watt TDP (and likely much higher TBP) for ONE video card is really unbelievable.

The A40 is a 48GB GPU that is passively cooled, yet also has video outputs making it a very interesting card. Furthermore, it has a 300W TDP making it a PCIe Gen4 GPU with a relatively high TDP that can be used in professional workstations and servers. We have already seen the A40 in a number of STH system reviews, but today, we decided it was time to give the unit its own piece.\nNVIDIA A40 48GB GPU Hardware Overview\nThe A40 card itself is a double-width full-height full-length PCIe Gen4 GPU. This uses NVIDIA\u2019s gold theme and looks similar to many of the other NVIDIA PCIe GPUs of this generation that we have used.\nNVIDIA A40 Front View\nAs we expect, this is a newer PCIe Gen4 generation GPU, so it is likely to be paired with 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable \u201cIce Lake\u201d or AMD EPYC 7002 \u201cRome\u201d or EPYC 7003 \u201cMilan\u201d CPUs. We still get a standard PCIe Gen4 x16 edge connector on the card.\nNVIDIA A40 PCIe Connector\nCooling on the GPU is passive, but NVIDIA says that the card is able to handle airflow in either direction so air can be pushed or pulled through the heatsink. As some frame of reference, the GPU with its PCIe I/O plate is around 1kg/ 2.2lbs so the heatsink has significant heft. We also get a standard 8-pin data center GPU power connector on the rear of the unit. That section also includes holes for vendor-specific mounting support brackets.\nNVIDIA A40 Ariflow Bracket Mounting And 8 Pin\nOn the top of the unit, we get something that is fairly interesting in that we get\u00a0a NVLINK connector. We did not have the bridge for this one when we had multiple A40\u2019s but the feature is present.\nNVIDIA A40 NVLINK And Stereo 2\nOn the I/O faceplate of the unit, we get three display outputs. These outputs are actually disabled by default. NVIDIA does this so SR-IOV support works out-of-the-box for NVIDIA Virtual GPU software, such as the editions used for VDI. One can also enable the display outputs for other software configurations and can also span multiple A40 cards for display using Quadro Sync II.\nNVIDIA A40 3x DisplayPort Outputs\nThis is a big deal since we can get SR-IOV on this GPU, but we do not get NVIDIA MIG, or Multi-Instance GPU on this card as we would on something like the A100. We have looked at MIG a number of times in NVIDIA A100 system reviews. Here is what a dense configuration of 8x NVIDIA A40\u2019s looks like:\nASUS ESC8000A E11 Rear Expansion\nThe Ampere-generation GPU itself is a GA102-895 with a 1305MHz base and a 1740MHz boost clock and 10,752 CUDA cores. The 48GB of memory is GDDR6 at 7250MHz and with a 384-bit wide bus width for a total of 696GB/s of peak memory bandwidth. We also get ECC memory in this class of GPU. Here are the full specs:\nNVIDIA A40 Specs\nNext, we are going to take a quick look at performance before we move on to power consumption and topology.\n\n\n\n \n\n 1 2 \n\n TAGSAmpereNVIDIA \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleThe Apple M1 Ultra Shows the Future of Chip DesignNext articleInexpensive 4x 2.5GbE Fanless Router Firewall Box Review Eric Smithhttps://www.servethehome.comEric has been in the IT industry for over 15 years and specializes in infrastructure projects.  \n \nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAcemagic F3A an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 Mini PC with up to 128GB of RAM \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASUS ESC8000A-E13P Review an 8x PCIe GPU Server \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASRock Rack 4U8G-TURIN2 A Fresh Take on a Classic AI Server Design \n\n  \n\n\n\n5 COMMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEric Olson\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            March 18, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            9:29 pm                                            \n\n\n\nThis GPU is rated 0.5 TFlops double precision with single precision an astonishing 64 times faster than double.\nFor reference a lowly Radeon VII yields 3.3 TFlops of double precision which is about 6 times faster than the A40.\nIn my opinion the level of market segmentation that Nvidia is practicing with their GPUs right now can\u2019t be good for anyone but Nvidia.\nSince the main advantage GPGPU computing has over special-purpose neural network hardware is that GP stands for general purpose, it would be useful to test a comprehensive selection of general application domains in the GPU reviews.  Such tests are especially important for GPUs with intentionally lopsided capabilities that target very specific market segments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhoohoo\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            March 19, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            8:26 am                                            \n\n\n\nWhat your pair of bar charts are supposed to mean?\nAre you comparing the A40 cards on hand to past A40s you\u2019ve tested? Are you comparing the same cards running in different servers (ie the charts are actually server comparisons?)\nAnyway, A40 (A10, A6000) have negligible FP64 ability but superior FP32. A100 is an FP64 monster with relatively modest FP32.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            March 19, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            10:00 am                                            \n\n\n\nIronically, you seem to think you are complaining about too much market segmentation but in fact you are complaining about not enough. Additionally, more segmentation of the type you are looking for would result in more expensive parts, or simply the market not being served at all. Most GPU domains do not require FP64 operations. The A40 is based on the GA102 GPU which is the top-of-the-line graphics/gaming oriented GPU from NVIDIA. By including full FP64 on it, it would lose performance in its core markets: gaming and professional graphics. If you want FP64 on a data center NVIDIA GPU less powerful than an A100 then you have to go for the A30 or for an older generation Gx100 GPU. If you want both ray tracing and full FP64 on the same GPU then you must either go to another manufacturer or convince NVIDIA that the size of your market is large enough to either 1) warrant NVIDIA spending hundreds of millions of dollars to make a special GPU for the market or 2) warrant NVIDIA spending money to add ray tracing to all data center GPUs and reducing the CUDA performance somewhat in the process due to the loss of die area and sacrifices that must be made to optimize for a greater set of constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteffen\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            March 20, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            12:35 am                                            \n\n\n\n@Matt I don\u2019t think OP was thinking that FP64 uses dedicated silicon, and I don\u2019t think so either. In the earlier days of Quadro (think Kepler) the Titan used the same chip, but had FP64 cut by 2/3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            March 20, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            11:05 am                                            \n\n\n\n@steffen It does use dedicated silicon as NVIDIA architects it now. If I remember, in Kepler FP64 also used dedicated silicon. They cut the FP64 rate in firmware for differentiation purposes, as did AMD. In the Tesla (architecture, not product line) generation, and maybe in Fermi, NVIDIA had FP32 units built into their FP64 units and so didn\u2019t use as much extra die area for the FP64. However, I believe that\u2019s less energy efficient and that\u2019s why they changed it. Or perhaps they changed it for some other reason, such as easier optimization or ability to reach higher clock speeds. Regardless, AMD followed suit. Also, the fact that AMD produced the Radeon VII (in extremely low quantities) has no bearing on the fundamental physics. AMD was looking for markets for chips. The card sucked for most use cases and, as noted, was produced in very low quantities. If anything it can be used as evidence that use case differentiation in the GPU space is very real. There\u2019s so much \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d online when it comes to Nvidia. It\u2019s tiresome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEAVE A REPLY\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\n\n\nPlease enter your name here\n\n\n\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\n\n\n\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign me up for the STH newsletter! \n\n\u0394 \nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

See our ethics statement.The H100 die.  Image: NvidiaJames Vincent is a senior reporter who has covered AI, robotics, and more for eight years at The Verge.Nvidia has announced a slew of AI-focused enterprise products at its annual GTC conference. They include details of its new silicon architecture, Hopper; the first datacenter GPU built using that architecture, the H100; a new Grace CPU \u201csuperchip\u201d; and vague plans to build what the company claims will be the world\u2019s fastest AI supercomputer, named Eos.Nvidia has benefited hugely from the AI boom of the last decade, with its GPUs proving a perfect match for popular, data-intensive deep learning methods. As the AI sector\u2019s demand for data compute grows, says Nvidia, it wants to provide more firepower.In particular, the company stressed the popularity of a type of machine learning system known as a Transformer. This method has been incredibly fruitful, powering everything from language models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 to medical systems like DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold. Such models have increased exponentially in size over the space of a few years. When OpenAI launched GPT-2 in 2019, for example, it contained 1.5 billion parameters (or connections). When Google trained a similar model just two years later, it used 1.6 trillion parameters.As AI demands more computer, Nvidia wants to deliver it\u201cTraining these giant models still takes months,\u201d said Nvidia senior director of product management Paresh Kharya in a press briefing. \u201cSo you fire a job and wait for one and half months to see what happens. A key challenge to reducing this time to train is that performance gains start to decline as you increase the number of GPUs in a data center.\u201dNvidia says its new Hopper architecture will help ameliorate these difficulties. Named after pioneering computer scientist and US Navy Rear Admiral Grace Hopper, the architecture is specialized to accelerate the training of Transformer models on H100 GPUs by six times compared to previous-generation chips, while the new fourth-generation Nivida NVlink can connect up to 256 H100 GPUs at nine times higher bandwidth than the previous generation.The H100 GPU itself contains 80 billion transistors and is the first GPU to support PCle Gen5 and utilize HBM3, enabling memory bandwidth of 3TB/s. Nvidia says an H100 GPU is three times faster than its previous-generation A100 at FP16, FP32, and FP64 compute, and six times faster at 8-bit floating point math.\u201cFor the training of giant Transformer models, H100 will offer up to nine times higher performance, training in days what used to take weeks,\u201d said Kharya.The company also announced a new data center CPU, the Grace CPU Superchip, which consists of two CPUs connected directly via a new low-latency NVLink-C2C. The chip is designed to \u201cserve giant-scale HPC and AI applications\u201d alongside the new Hopper-based GPUs, and can be used for CPU-only systems or GPU-accelerated servers. It has 144 Arm cores and 1TB/s of memory bandwidth.The new Grace CPU \u201csuperchip\u201d consists of two CPUs connected together.  Image: NvidiaIn addition to hardware and infrastructure news, Nvidia also announced updates to its various enterprise AI software services, including Maxine (an SDK to deliver audio and video enhancements, intended to power things like virtual avatars) and Riva (an SDK used for both speech recognition and text-to-speech).The company also teased that it was building a new AI supercomputer, which it claims will be the world\u2019s fastest when deployed. The supercomputer, named Eos, will be built using the Hopper architecture and contain some 4,600 H100 GPUs to offer 18.4 exaflops of \u201cAI performance.\u201d The system will be used for Nvidia\u2019s internal research only, and the company said it would be online in a few months\u2019 time.Over the past few years, a number of companies with strong interest in AI have built or announced their own in-house \u201cAI supercomputers\u201d for internal research, including Microsoft, Tesla, and Meta. These systems are not directly comparable with regular supercomputers as they run at a lower level of accuracy, which has allowed a number of firms to quickly leapfrog one another by announcing the world\u2019s fastest.However, during his keynote address, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang did say that Eos, when running traditional supercomputer tasks, would rack 275 petaFLOPS of compute \u2014 1.4 times faster than \u201cthe fastest science computer in the US\u201d (the Summit). \u201cWe expect Eos to be the fastest AI computer in the world,\u201d said Huang. \u201cEos will be the blueprint for the most advanced AI infrastructure for our OEMs and cloud partners.\u201dSee More: AINewsNvidiaTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Drive Map isn\u2019t only open to existing Nvidia customers, but it does augment the company\u2019s existing solutions for the AV industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same event, the company announced its next generation of Drive Hyperion, Nvidia\u2019s sensor and compute self-driving toolkit which is used by the likes of Mercedes, Volvo, JiDu and, as of Tuesday, BYD and Lucid Motors, to provide a variety of smart driving and advanced driving assistance features.\nAV companies like TuSimple, WeRide, Zoox and DeepRoute.ai are also Hyperion customers.\nDrive Map represents the fruits of Nvidia\u2019s acquisition last year of DeepMap, a high-definition mapping startup. The tool provides centimeter-level accuracy by combining DeepMap\u2019s accurate survey mapping with anonymous mapping data that\u2019s been crowdsourced from all the vehicles that use Nvidia\u2019s Hyperion architecture. The mapping tool features three localization layers \u2014 camera, lidar and radar \u2014 to provide the redundancy needed for autonomy.\nAll of the data pulled from Nvidia customers is being constantly uploaded to the cloud as vehicles drive. It\u2019s then aggregated and loaded onto Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse, the company\u2019s open platform built for virtual collaboration and real-time physically accurate simulation, and used to update the map so vehicles can achieve proper localization. In the process, Nvidia is able to more quickly scale its mapping footprint.\nIn addition, Omniverse uses automated content generation tools to build a detailed map, which is then converted into a drivable simulation environment that can be used with Nvidia Drive Sim, an end-to-end simulation platform for autonomous vehicles.\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nAI, autonomous vehicles, deepmap, Hardware, nvidia, nvidia drive hyperion, Transportation, transportation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRebecca Bellan\t\n\n\n\nSenior Reporter, Transportation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRebecca Bellan covers transportation for TechCrunch.

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.Last week, AMD promised a new technology that should let you blow up your games to higher resolutions or increase their framerates without requiring the fancy machine learning hardware of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs like Nvidia\u2019s lauded DLSS. Now at GDC 2022, it\u2019s revealing how the new FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.0 actually works \u2014 and that it\u2019s coming to Microsoft\u2019s Xbox game consoles too.While AMD says it can\u2019t actually say when Xbox game developers might take advantage of FSR 2.0, it says it \u201cwill also be fully supported on Xbox and will be available in the Xbox GDK for registered developers to use in their games.\u201dAnd it\u2019s also giving the community a list of both AMD and Nvidia GPUs where you can expect FSR 2.0 to run \u2014 if you\u2019ve got an Nvidia GeForce RTX 1070 or higher, the company suggests, you might be able to take advantage of FSR 2.0 at least on a 1080p monitor, the same way you with an AMD Radeon RX 590, RX 6500 XT or higher.What we\u2019ve been wondering since day one is: what\u2019s the catch? How can AMD nearly double the framerate of a demanding game like Deathloop, at a 4K-equivalent resolution with the kind of image quality it showed us last week, all without dedicated machine learning cores like Nvidia\u2019s DLSS?The answer is complicated, but a short version is that it can\u2019t unless you have a relatively powerful graphics card to begin with.While the FSR 2.0 algorithm is remarkably fast \u2014 under 1.5ms in all of AMD\u2019s examples \u2014 it still takes time to run, and it takes more time on lower-end GPUs where AMD freely admits that some of its optimizations don\u2019t work quite as well.In that under 1.5ms period, FSR 2.0 does all sorts of things, though \u2014 AMD says it replaces a full temporal anti-aliasing pass (getting rid of a bunch of your game\u2019s jagged edges) by calculating motion vectors; reprojecting frames to cancel out jitter; creating \u201cdisocclusion mask\u201d that compare one frame to the next to see what did and didn\u2019t move so it can cancel out ghosting effects; locking thin features in place like the barely-visible edges of staircases and thin wires; keeping colors from drifting; and sharpening the whole image, among other techniques.Unlike FSR 1.0, this requires some work on the part of the game developer, so it\u2019s not something you\u2019re going to see every game developer take advantage of \u2014 but AMD confirms that both Deathloop and Forspoken (a tech showcase that\u2019s also going to use Microsoft\u2019s DirectStorage) will take advantage of it.AMD says games that already support Nvidia\u2019s DLSS should be easy to set up, though, with just a few days of work to integrate, and that games running on Unreal Engine 4 and Unreal Engine 5 will have a plugin to make it work. Games that already use temporal anti-aliasing also have a development advantage. But if a developer hasn\u2019t built their game with some of these things in mind, AMD says it could take four or more weeks of work.We\u2019re still waiting to try out FSR 2.0 for ourselves to see how it actually looks in motion, but should developers take advantage, the quality looks to be far better than FSR 1.0.See More: EntertainmentGamingNewsPC GamingTechXboxMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

That\u2019s 3.3x faster at 60 percent lower cost than any prior test.\nA Wow Moment\n\u201cIt was a wow moment because on CPU clusters it takes more than 48 hours to process just seven days of data \u2014 in the past, we had the data but couldn\u2019t use it because it took such a long time to process it,\u201d he said.\nSpecifically, the test benchmarked what\u2019s called ETL, the extract, transform and load process that cleans up data before it can be used to train the AI models that uncover fresh insights.\n\u201cNow we\u2019re thinking GPUs can be used for ETL and all sorts of batch-processing workloads we do in Spark, so we\u2019re exploring other RAPIDS libraries to extend work from feature engineering to ETL and machine learning,\u201d he said.\nToday, AT&T runs ETL on CPU servers, then moves data to GPU servers for training. Doing everything in one GPU pipeline can save time and cost, he added.\nPleasing Customers, Speeding Network Design\nThe savings could show up across a wide variety of use cases.\nFor example, users could find out more quickly where they get optimal connections, improving customer satisfaction and reducing churn. \u201cWe could decide parameters for our 5G towers and antennas more quickly, too,\u201d he said.\nIdentifying what area in the AT&T fiber footprint to roll out a support truck can require time-consuming geospatial calculations, something RAPIDS and GPUs could accelerate, said Chris Vo, a senior member of the team who supervised the RAPIDS tests.\n\u201cWe probably get 300-400 terabytes of fresh data a day, so this technology can have incredible impact \u2014 reports we generate over two or three weeks could be done in a few hours,\u201d Dabholkar said.\nThree Use Cases and Counting\nThe researchers are sharing their results with members of AT&T\u2019s data platform team.\n\u201cWe recommend that if a job is taking too long and you have a lot of data, turn on GPUs \u2014 with Spark, the same code that runs on CPUs runs on GPUs,\u201d he said.\nSo far, separate teams have found their own gains across three different use cases; other teams have plans to run tests on their workloads, too.\nDabholkar is optimistic business units will take their test results to production systems.\n\u201cWe are a telecom company with all sorts of datasets processing petabytes of data daily, and this can significantly improve our savings,\u201d he said.\nOther users including the U.S. Internal Revenue Service are on a similar journey. It\u2019s a path many will take given Apache Spark is used by more than 13,000 companies including 80 percent of the Fortune 500.\nRegister free for GTC to hear AT&T\u2019s Chris Vo talk about his work, learn more about data science at these sessions and hear NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | Data Science | GTC 2022 | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | RAPIDS | Telecommunications \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"
