This will enable an industrial metaverse with physics-based digital models from Siemens and real-time AI from NVIDIA in which companies make decisions faster and with increased confidence.\n\nThe addition of Omniverse to the open Siemens Xcelerator partner ecosystem will accelerate the use of digital twins that can deliver productivity and process improvements across the production and product lifecycles. Companies of all sizes will be able to employ digital twins with real-time performance data; create innovative industrial IoT-solutions; leverage actionable insights from analytics at the edge or in the cloud; and tackle the engineering challenges of tomorrow by making visually rich, immersive simulations more accessible.\n\"Photorealistic, physics-based digital twins embedded in the industrial metaverse offer enormous potential to transform our economies and industries by providing a virtual world where people can interact and collaborate to solve real-world problems. Through this partnership, we will make the industrial metaverse a reality for companies of all sizes,\" said Roland Busch, President and Chief Executive Officer, Siemens AG. \"For over a decade,\u00a0our digital twin technology has been helping\u00a0customers across all industries to boost their productivity and today offer the industry's most comprehensive digital twin. When Siemens Xcelerator is connected to Omniverse, we will enable a real-time, immersive metaverse that connects hardware and software, from the edge to the cloud with rich data from Siemens' software and solutions.\"\"Siemens and NVIDIA share a common vision that the industrial metaverse will drive digital transformation. This is just the first step in our joint effort to make this vision real for our customers and all parts of the global manufacturing industry,\" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO, NVIDIA. \"The connection to Siemens Xcelerator will open NVIDIA's Omniverse and AI ecosystem to a whole new world of industrial automation that is built using Siemens' mechanical, electrical, software, IoT and edge solutions.\"This partnership brings together complementary technologies and ecosystems to realize the industrial metaverse. Siemens is uniquely positioned at the intersections of the real and digital world, information technology and operational technology. The Siemens Xcelerator platform connects mechanical, electrical and software domains across the product and production processes and enables the convergence of IT and OT.NVIDIA Omniverse is an AI-enabled, physically simulated and industrial-scale virtual-world engine that enables for the first time full-fidelity live digital twins. NVIDIA AI, used by more than 25,000 companies worldwide, is the intelligence engine of Omniverse in the cloud and autonomous systems at the edge. NVIDIA Omniverse and AI are ideal computation engines to represent the comprehensive digital twin from Siemens Xcelerator.This press release is available at https://sie.ag/3bv6EwEFollow us on Twitter: www.twitter.com/siemens_pressAbout NVIDIASince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

These statements may be identified by words such as \"expect,\" \"look forward to,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"seek,\" \"estimate,\" \"will,\" \"project\" or words of similar meaning. We may also make forward-looking statements in other reports, in prospectuses, in presentations, in material delivered to shareholders and in press releases. In addition, our representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on the current expectations and certain assumptions of Siemens' management, of which many are beyond Siemens' control. These are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and factors, including, but not limited to those described in disclosures, in particular in the chapter Report on expected developments and associated material opportunities and risks in the Combined Management Report of the Siemens Report (siemens.com/siemensreport), and in the Interim Group Management Report of the Half-year Financial Report (provided that it is already available for the current reporting year), which should be read in conjunction with the Combined Management Report. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, should decisions, assessments or requirements of regulatory authorities deviate from our expectations, should events of force majeure, such as pandemics, unrest or acts of war, occur or should underlying expectations including future events occur at a later date or not at all or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results, performance or achievements of Siemens may (negatively or positively) vary materially from those described explicitly or implicitly in the relevant forward-looking statement.

For comparison, the S&P 500 nearly doubled over the same period. It is worth noting that Nvidia faced tough times in 2018 and 2022, but its overall performance has been solid enough to multiply investors' initial investment several times, if they held on.\nHowever, shares of Nvidia have dropped\u00a040% in the past six months, and it is trading at a much more reasonable valuation now as compared to where it was last year. Does this mean investors should buy Nvidia stock now and expect it to deliver similar returns in the long run? Let's find out.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs now a good time to buy Nvidia stock?\nNvidia is currently trading at 50 times trailing earnings, which represents a discount to its five-year average earnings multiple of 58 and 2021 earnings multiple of 90. However, Nvidia was trading at just 30 times in 2015. But a closer look indicates that Nvidia's rich valuation is justified right now.\n\nThe company finished fiscal 2015 (the year ended Jan. 25, 2015) with $4.7 billion in revenue, an increase of 13% over the prior year. In fiscal 2022, Nvidia's revenue jumped\u00a061% year over year to $26.9 billion. The chipmaker has started fiscal 2023 on a solid note as well, reporting a 46% year-over-year increase in revenue in the first quarter.\nNvidia's addressable revenue opportunity has grown at a red-hot pace over the years, and the company has done well to capitalize on that. According to one estimate, the size of the global graphics processing unit (GPU) market increased from just $8 billion in 2015 to $23 billion last year, thanks to the growing demand for these chips in computers for video gaming and content creation.\nNvidia sold\u00a0$12.5 billion worth of PC (personal computer) graphics cards last year, which means that it has cornered a nice share of this market. Global GPU sales are expected to hit\u00a0$35 billion in 2025, and Nvidia can be expected to maintain its leadership position in this space thanks to a large installed base of users in an upgrade window as well as the company's product development moves.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the more important thing to note is that Nvidia is now more than just a supplier of PC graphics cards. The adoption of GPUs in the data center to accelerate computing workloads has been a big growth driver for Nvidia in the past few years. The GPU business was Nvidia's biggest source of revenue in Q1 fiscal 2023. The segment's revenue jumped\u00a083% year over year to $3.75 billion and accounted for 45% of the top line.\nGaming, on the other hand, produced $3.62 billion in revenue and was up 31% year over year. This indicates that Nvidia now has two solid catalysts and there are  lucrative opportunities in other emerging areas that could lead to terrific revenue and earnings growth in the long run,.\nNew catalysts can supercharge the chip giant's growth\nThe data center business was yet to become a critical growth driver for Nvidia in 2015, and the same can be said about the company's automotive and professional visualization businesses right now.\nLast quarter, the automotive business produced $138 million in revenue and accounted for just 1.7% of Nvidia's top line. Revenue from this segment was down 10% year over year, but don't be surprised to see the automotive business step on the gas in the long run. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe chipmaker pointed out on its May earnings conference call that it \"has great traction in the marketplace with over 35 customer wins from automakers, truck makers, and robotaxi companies.\" What's more, Nvidia has a design win pipeline of $11 billion in the automotive business that spans a six-year period, which means that its chips have been selected for deployment by automotive companies in their applications. As these design wins move into actual production, Nvidia's automotive business should start gaining critical mass.\nMeanwhile, the professional visualization business has already started picking up. Revenue from this segment was up 67% year over year to $622 million last quarter, accounting for 7.5% of the top line. The chipmaker is witnessing strong traction in this business thanks to the growing demand for graphics cards used in workstations, as well as the demand for its Omniverse platform that's allowing companies to make 3D models and digital twins, which are  expected to gain traction on account of emerging tech trends like the metaverse. \nAll this indicates that Nvidia can grow at a terrific pace in the next seven years as well, since it will be able to tap multiple growth markets. That's why it may be a good idea to buy now.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no positions in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Nvidia.

This has been largely due to the shift from growth to value stocks as well as the changing macroeconomic picture. A series of rate hikes from central banks on both sides of the Atlantic have\u00a0been aggressively priced in by equity markets. Inflation and supply chain issues have also caused a rotational shift from growth to value and from tech to defensive stocks. We surmise that this reduction in Nvidia's stock price presents a more sustainable entry point with risks of a valuation re-rating offset by continued strong revenue growth.\u00a0We will outline our DCF model with revenue assumptions leading to a fair value share price for Nvidia as well as comparative models versus its peer group and index members.\u00a0\nContents\nNvidia: Company overview\nKey valuation\u00a0rating metrics\nPeer value comparison\nMacroeconomic backdrop, market cycle\u00a0and sector analysis\nRecent news and earnings\nNVDA forecasts\nNVDA technical analysis\nExecutive summary, recommendation and price target\n \nNvidia: Company overview\nNvidia\u00a0is part of\u00a0the global semiconductor industry\u00a0with operations spanning graphics cards and gaming, automotive applications\u00a0and data centers. Nvidia was founded in 1993 by three US computer scientists:\u00a0Jen Hsun Huang, Curtis Priem\u00a0and Christopher Malachowsky. The initial focus of the company was on the gaming industry with the production of high-end graphics processing units (GPU), which helped power the explosion in gaming culture that took off in the 1990s.\nAlso read:\u00a0Apple Stock Deep Dive: AAPL price target at $100 on falling 2023 revenues\nThe GeForce was the company's first blockbuster gaming card and elevated the company to global prominence. The success of this led to Microsoft selecting Nvidia for its Xbox console. Currently, Nvidia operates across gaming, streaming via GeForce NOW, automotive applications for onboard display and infotainment units, and also provides units\u00a0for cloud-based applications. The company splits its revenue according to automotive, datacentre applications, gaming and intellectual property, and professional visualizations. Nvidia\u00a0has invested heavily in the omniverse with 3D virtual worlds and sees this as a key component of its future strategy.\nNvidia has been deriving a significant share of its revenue from Asia. This has been largely due to the growth of manufacturing hubs in Asia as well as the growing Chinese middle class.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2019\n2018\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n30-Jan-2022\u00a0\n31-Jan-2021\u00a0\n26-Jan-2020\u00a0\n27-Jan-2019\u00a0\n28-Jan-2018\u00a0\n\n\nChina \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n26%\n23%\n25%\n24%\n20%\n\n\nTaiwan \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n32%\n27%\n28%\n29%\n31%\n\n\nOther Asia Pacific \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n--\n19%\n25%\n20%\n21%\n\n\nEurope \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n--\n6.7%\n9.1%\n7.8%\n7.9%\n\n\nUnited States \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n16%\n19%\n8.1%\n13%\n13%\n\n\nROW\n\u00a0\n26%\n5%\n5.0%\n6%\n7%\n\n\nTotal\n\n100%\n100%\n100.2%\n100%\n100%\n\n\n\nSource: Refinitiv and FXStreet\nNvidia's revenue by product line, below, shows the dominance of the original gaming sector. However, data center revenue has increased markedly and now rivals gaming. These are the current two main drivers of revenue and will continue to be so over the next three to five years in our view. The omniverse potential remains much\u00a0harder to quantify, but it retains\u00a0the chance of\u00a0being a super catalyst. Recent earnings for cloud peers such as Microsoft and even Amazon via its AWS unit\u00a0have shown continued strength in the cloud sector. In its last earnings report, Nvidia\u00a0showed remarkable revenue growth across the data center sphere, running at over an 80% growth rate on a yearly basis. We estimate this makes it likely to be the biggest revenue driver over the next three\u00a0to five\u00a0years.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHISTORICAL (ACTUALS)\nFORECAST (MEAN)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nFY Jan-20\nFY Jan-21\nFY Jan-22\nFY Jan-23\nFY Jan-24\nFY Jan-25\n\n\nINCOME STATEMENT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nREVENUE\n10,918\n16,675\n26,914\n33,721\n39,356\n45,529\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guidance\nT\nT\nT\nT\n-\n-\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0AUTOMOTIVE\n700\n536\n566\n690\n998\n1,163\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DATACENTER\n2,983\n6,696\n10,613\n16,918\n21,448\n24,568\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GAMING\n5,518\n7,759\n12,462\n13,193\n13,842\n15,090\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OEM AND IP\n505\n631\n1,162\n673\n654\n727\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROFESSIONAL VISUALIZATION\n1,212\n1,053\n2,111\n2,616\n2,916\n3,314\n\n\n\nSource: Refinitiv & FXStreet\nNvidia Wall Street consensus forecast\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAnalysts Per level\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n09-Mar-2022\n09-Apr-2022\n09-May-2022\nCurrent\n\n\n1 - StrongBuy\n11\n11\n11\n12\n\n\n2 - Buy\n29\n28\n28\n29\n\n\n3 - Hold\n7\n8\n9\n8\n\n\n4 - Sell\n1\n-\n-\n-\n\n\n5 - StrongSell\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nRec Mean\n2\n1.9\n2\n1.9\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nPrice Target Summary\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nPrice Target\nTarget\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n09-Mar-2022\n09-Apr-2022\n09-May-2022\nCurrent\n\n\nMedian\n$350.00\n$350.00\n$350.00\n$250.00\n\n\nMean\n$341.17\n$343.03\n$326.46\n$264.52\n\n\n\nSource: Refinitiv\u00a0\nThe Wall Street analyst community remains almost uniformly bullish on Nvidia with only one sell rating and an average price target of $250.

This has made for some concerning valuation multiples. The price/earnings ratio at 50 is ringing alarm bells, especially compared to Intel's P/E at 7. Even against other more direct peers, NVIDIA does look richly priced.\u00a0AMD, for example, at a P/E of 38 is still comfortably behind. However, Nvidia\u00a0boasts the highest margins in the semiconductor space, and revenue is growing exponentially at near 80% annually. The high relative multiple though is one of the key risks going forward, but with revenue growth and margins high NVIDIA should see its P/E reduce without impacting heavily on the share price performance. Indeed, with forward EPS guidance, the P/E for the next twelve months is trading at a more acceptable 31.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMarket Cap\nGross margin\nFCF\nP/E\nEV/EBITDA\nP/book\nP/Sales\nEPS growth rate\nROE\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n$451 billion\n65%\n$8 billion\n50\n34\n18\n18\n22%\n45%\n\n\nBroadcomm\n$225 billion\n58%\n$14 billion\n28\n15\n9\n9\n38%\n28%\n\n\nQualcomm\n$153 billion\n59%\n$7 billion\n14\n11\n15\n5\n50%\n113%\n\n\nIntel\n$163 billion\n54%\n$10 billion\n7\n5\n2\n2\n-45%\n23%\n\n\nAMD\n$160 billion\n47%\n$3 billion\n38\n32\n16\n8\n47%\n47%\n\n\nSamsung\n$362 billion\n40%\n$13 billion\n10\n4\n1.5\n1.5\n24%\n15%\n\n\nS&P 500\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n20\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nNasdaq\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n25\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nSource: TradingView, Refinitiv and FXStreet\nMacroeconomic backdrop, market cycle\u00a0and sector analysis\nThe global macroeconomic backdrop continues to look challenging. Supply chain issues remain unresolved, inflation remains elevated, and central banks have begun aggressive\u00a0monetary tightening. The European Central Bank\u00a0this week announced rate hikes for the remainder of the year. The Fed is already well down that path with another 50 basis point hike imminent, and the Bank of England has been alarmist about the threat of recession. We write in advance of June's US CPI release. While it may show signs of\u00a0inflation slowing, the speed of the decline is unlikely to provide much comfort.\u00a0\nAlso read:\u00a0Tesla Stock Deep Dive: Price target at $400 on China headwinds, margin compression, lower deliveries\nNaturally, all this has meant equities remain in a challenging environment, and most indices are in bear market territory\u00a0(defined as a peak to trough decline of 20% or more). The S&P 500 remains in a corrective phase, while the Nasdaq is in a bear market.\u00a0\n\nBear markets\u00a0on average have losses of nearly 40% from peak valuations and an average time span of 300 days. This bear market should have more time to run then \u2013\u00a0another 20% approximately if it is to meet the historical average. The key question is\u00a0whether or not the US economy will go into recession in 2023.\u00a0Bear markets without accompanying recessions are notably less severe with average peak-to-trough declines of 25%.\u00a0\nThere is conflicting evidence from headline economic indicators as to the next stage in economic growth. Many forecasters are predicting the US and global recession in the first half of 2023. For now, US data is holding up relatively well. Employment markets remain tight, and workers are exercising their power to negotiate pay raises\u00a0or are switching jobs. This helps underpin spending, which is a key driver of economic growth. The flip side is that this makes inflation more entrenched. We have also seen some recent upticks in credit card spending, and the personal savings rate has dropped to a decade low. Consumers are using pandemic savings to fuel consumption as well as credit, but as of yet the levels are not concerning.\nThe pace of change is a factor, and one can say with certainty that US and global economies are slowing. What is less clear is the recession forecast.\nSemiconductor sector\nThe pandemic witnessed a perfect storm of sorts for the chip industry. Stay-at-home demand for work laptops, gaming stations and other PC equipment led to soaring chip demand and resultant shortages. As these bottlenecks unwound, we had continued demand from the aforementioned savings rates and pent-up demand. Semiconductor stocks were some of the best performing names of 2021 as a result. Demand has since flatlined, but supply chain issues have resurfaced meaning chip companies should be able to maintain and increase margins. The majority of chip makers stockpiled in a reactive move to the\u00a0strong demand witnessed during the pandemic. While this demand may be flatlining, chip makers have inventory available at significantly lower input costs than the current surging inflationary selling costs.\nChip companies face yet another perfect storm, but this time on the supply side of the equation. Russia's\u00a0invasion of Ukraine has created a shortage of neon gas, which is critical in the production of semiconductor chips. Ukrainian steel plants under Russia's control produce half the world's supply of neon gas. This problem combined with\u00a0further lockdowns imposed during the month of May in China has led to yet more shortages and fears over chip supply. This has become especially notable in the auto space. Reports have been circulating of auto manufacturers paying double or treble for chips in order to complete a $50,000 vehicle. The reason is scale. A laptop costing $500 requires the same $50 chip that a car costing $50,000 requires to complete its infotainment system or\u00a0other features. Car companies are then hugely incentivized to outbid other customers for those chips. We expect chip shortages to yet again become an issue but would favor those with higher exposure to the auto sector:\u00a0Nvidia is not a major supplier to auto companies.\u00a0\nNvidia latest news and earnings\nThe latest data from the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) expects the sector to grow 16% in 2022 and a more modest 5% in 2023. Intel (INTC) spoke this week at an investor conference and appeard to talk down projections for the coming quarter, citing multiple headwinds from China to inventory levels.\u00a0\nDespite this downbeat analysis from Intel, NVDA reported earnings on May 25 that showed continued growth in revenue with a beat on EPS and revenue versus Wall Street estimates. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.36 which beat estimates by $0.06 and was nearly 50% higher than previous while revenue growth was also nearing 50% yearly. However, the company sounded a more cautious approach on its outlook given headwinds from China and Russia. Nvidia scaled-back revenue and margins to slightly below Wall Street estimates but despite this NVDA stock did perform strongly post the results.\u00a0\nThe reasoning can be seen in the mix of\u00a0revenue and strong sectoral performance across gaming and data center. Gaming revenues were up 30% yearly while data center revenues rose 83% yearly. NVDA has also taken steps in its adoption of the omniverse as it expects monetization of this space to accelerate in 2023.\u00a0\nNvidia valuation analysis and fair value\nWe run a standard DCF and EBITDA valuation model.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nNVIDIA free cash flows\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nEBITDA\n4,116\n7,901\n13,864\n17,405\n20,635\n26,000\n\n\nEBIT\n3,735\n6,803\n12,690\n16,019\n19,144\n21,689\n\n\nTax rate\n7%\n6%\n2%\n12%\n13%\n13%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nEBIT (1-t)\n3,818\n7,421\n13,600\n15,269\n18,032\n22,655\n\n\nD&A\n381\n1,098\n1,174\n1,302\n1,304\n3,138\n\n\nChange in NWC\n-178\n623\n-12,364\n-6,354\n-11,960\n-15,308\n\n\nCapital expenditures\n489\n1,128\n976\n1,534\n1,626\n1,718\n\n\nUnlevered free cash flows (UFCF)\n4,510\n10,270\n3,386\n11,751\n9,001\n12,202\n\n\nFree cash flow forecasts\n4,272\n4,694\n8,132\n14,000\n16,000\n18,000\n\n\nDiscount rate (r)\n\u00a0\n10%\n10%\n10%\n10%\n10%\n\n\nPV of UFCFs\n\u00a0\n9,243\n3,048\n10,576\n8,101\n10,982\n\n\nPV of FCF\n\u00a0\n4,225\n7,319\n12,600\n14,400\n16,200\n\n\nStage 1: Sum of present values\n\u00a0\n41,949\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nSum of PV using FCF\n\u00a0\n54,743\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth in perpuatiy valuation\n\n\u00a0Using Forecast FCF\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\ngrowth rate\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 10\n\u00a0\n10\n10\n\n\n2025 FCF\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 13,178\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 19,440\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 17,162\n\n\ntermival value in 2025\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 658,911\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 972,000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 858,075\n\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 371,938\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 548,669\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 484,361\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nEnterprise value\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 413,887\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 603,412\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 534,812\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\ncurrent net debt\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10,262\n\u00a0\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10,262\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10,262\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nshares outstanding\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,535\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,535\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,535\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nequity value\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0$167\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0$242\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0$215\n\n\nEBITDA Multiple approach\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nebitda multiple\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a035\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 25\n\u00a0\n\n\nterminal value in 2025\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 910,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 650,000\n\u00a0\n\n\nPV of term value\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 513,671\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0366,908\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nent value\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0555,621\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0421,651\n\u00a0\n\n\nnet debt\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 62,928\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 62,928\n\u00a0\n\n\nshares outstanding\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,535\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,535\n\u00a0\n\n\nequity value\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0$194\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0$142\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nSource: Refinitiv and FXStreet calculations\nRunning the numbers gives us various options to consider.\u00a0Our main forecast model uses a 10% increase in revenues for 2023 over company forecasts and a resultant increase in margins. This leads us to a DCF price of $242, some $60 above the current NVDA stock price. However, our concern surrounds the high valuation currently placed on the shares. As mentioned NVDA trades on a P/E of 50, too high in our view to be sustainable.\nUsing the current EV/EBITDA multiple of 35 gives us a fair value of $194, but taking this EV/EBITDA ratio back to 25 gives a lowered price target of $156. This is more in line with sector peers and Nasdaq averages. As we can see below the 10-year average for EV/EBITDA is 28.51 for Nvidia. That would imply a fair value of $162.\n\nIt though will likely take some time for Nvidia to rerate to the sector average of 25 but it may settle at 30, giving us a fair price of $172. Combining this with our revenue forecasts gives us our average price target of $207. This obviously represents a premium to the current NVDA stock price and necessitates a BUY rating as a result.\nUsing the more standardized EPS approach and inputting our updated forecasts gives us EPS guidance of $6.22 for 2023. Trading at 50 times trailing P/E gives a price target of $300 but given we are uncomfortable with such a high P/E this updated EPS still results in a price target of $205 if the P/E falls to 32. The risk as can be seen below is if NVDA falls to the lower end of its historical P/E near 20.\u00a0\n\nSource: Refinitiv\n\nBased on all the above we run with a 12-month price target of $205 and a BUY rating.\u00a0\nNvidia technical analysis\nHow does this fit into the technical viewpoint? There is comforting support at $130 from the huge volume profile and consolidation zone that lasted from August 2020 until April 2021. This breakout was the pandemic-fueled demand combined with chip shortages. As we have highlighted shortages look set to continue. The recent earnings report has seen NVDA stock bottom and $205\u00a0looks modest but it is technical resistance at February to April lows.\u00a0\n\nNvidia price target and recommendation\nThe technical picture above gives us some comfort in the event that the downdraft and bear market continues. As detailed above with supply shortages and demand growth remaining strong, NVDA is in a strong position. We believe it has the inventory to cope with current supply issues and demand from the cloud sector will continue as remote working becomes embedded. This creates a permanent uptick in demand for home office, laptop and PC's\u00a0as well as resultant gaming demand due to more leisure time. This is an immediate event and is not a 5-10 year thesis. The omniverse by comparison is a longer-term thesis and one we largely discounted from any calculation. So there is a form of free bet from the omniverse potential.\u00a0\nUpside risks to our price target\n\nSupply chain issues accelerate meaning increased price pressure and demand at any price from auto and tech companies.\nInflation reduces quickly.\nChinese demand is buoyed from loose monetary policy.\nOmniverse acceleration and monetization.\nDownside risks to our price target\nThe bear market continues with high valuation P/E stocks continued selling.\nPC and laptop demand drop sharply as a result of recession and unemployment. The employment market is strong in US but Europe has headwinds.\nProduction grinds to a halt due to the neon gas shortage.\n\n\u00a0\nNvidia reported earnings and forecast tables below, the foundation for all our DCF models.

(Photo by Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images)  \u00b7 NurPhoto via Getty Images By Andreo Calonzo (Bloomberg) \u2014Philippine carrier Cebu Air Inc. expects to bring back its workforce size to before the Covid-19 pandemic by early next year, President and CEO Lance Gokongwei said. Workers who were laid off due to the pandemic are being prioritized for rehiring, Gokongwei told reporters on Wednesday. There\u2019s enough supply of pilots and cabin crew in the Philippines, unlike in other countries that are experiencing shortages, he said at a media presentation of a grocery delivery platform which he backed.  Cebu Air, the nation\u2019s biggest budget carrier had 4,000 workers before the pandemic. It cut jobs by 25% in 2020, and resumed hiring crew in November after domestic tourism showed signs of a revival as the country eased mobility curbs. The peso\u2019s slump is expected to drive up the airline\u2019s expenses together with higher fuel prices, Gokongwei said, adding that it will have to balance luring back passengers and adjusting fares to recover rising costs. Higher consumer prices and rising borrowing cost are among the biggest challenges to businesses, said Gokongwei, whose conglomerate JG Summit Holdings Inc. also has interests in food, property, petrochemical and banking.

(PHOTO: Getty Images)  \u00b7 Vasily Pindyurin via Getty Images [UPDATE 23 June 202: Ho Jun Jia was sentenced to 10 years' jail on Thursday (23 June).] SINGAPORE \u2014 A Singaporean man who impersonated Riot Games co-founder Marc Merrill to cheat over US$5.46 million worth of cloud computing services has been sentenced to 10 years' jail on Thursday (23 June). Ho Jun Jia, 32, stole Merrill's credit card details from a forum on the dark web. He then researched more of Merrill's personal details and used them to register an account with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google. Between 2017 and 2018, Ho deceived AWS and Google into delivering services which he used to mine cryptocurrency.  Earlier this year, Ho pleaded guilty in a Singapore district court to 12 charges, mostly under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act. Ho also pleaded guilty to consuming methamphetamine and cheating charges.

Ho found Merrill's details on the dark web after offering to forge US driving licenses on a forum in 2017. In return, the owner of the forum allowed him to access the \u201cStaff/VIP\u201d section, which contained details of the names, addresses and credit cards belonging to individuals, including Merrill. Merrill is the also co-chairman of game developer Riot Games which is behind popular games such as League of Legends and Valorant. Did his research into Merrill As part of his plan to impersonate Merrill, Ho researched Merrill's background, set up an imitation email account and forged copies of Merrill's driving license. He then signed up for accounts on AWS and Google Cloud Platform as Merrill. Through his deception, Ho acquired units of the cryptocurrency Ether and sold a portion for S$347,794.83. He spent the money and the remaining Ether units on personal expenses. Having refunded the amounts charged to Merrill's credit card, AWS and Google ultimately received nothing for the services they provided.  Ho's lawyer, S S Dhillon of Dhillon and Panoo, sought seven-and-a-half years\u2019 jail, citing his client's Adjustment Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as mitigating factors. According to the lawyer, Ho suffered from Adjustment Disorder at the end of 2017 due to a friend's betrayal and his breakup with his girlfriend. This friend allegedly stole S$100,000 from Ho.   Story continues Dhillon wrote in his mitigation plea, \u201cThis is a pathetic case which deserves your honour's sympathy and consideration. Ho was first seen at the Institute of Mental Health\u2019s Child Guidance Clinic in 2005 for conduct disorder and ADHD. It is most unfortunate that although the IQ test done in 2005 puts him in the top 30 per cent of ability, Ho left school at the end of Secondary 3.\u201dOn hindsight, Ho wished he had \u201cexercised extreme prudence and not be misled by what was taught by the online community and fall prey to their evil machinations\u201d, added the lawyer.Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingapore  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Crypto.com, which is headquartered in Singapore, said it would make the \u201cdifficult and necessary decisions to ensure continued and sustainable growth\u201d by reducing around 260 positions in its workforce, said its chief executive officer Kris Marszalek via Twitter on 11 June. The company, founded in 2016, has around 4,000 employees, according to its website.  He continued, \u201cWe will continue to evaluate how to best optimize our resources to position ourselves as the strongest builders during the down cycle to become the biggest winners during the next bull run.\u201d Also read: Singapore DPM Heng Swee Keat warns retail investors against cryptocurrency trading Also read: Singapore firms slow in green practices may be \u2018too little, too late\u2019: Teo Chee Hean Also read: Singapore's real wage growth up 1.6% in 2021, MOM says   The layoffs come on the back of other similar cuts in recent weeks. New Jersey-based crypto lending startup BlockFi also announced a headcount reduction of 20 per cent Monday. Its founders Zac Prince and Flori Marquez said in a blogpost on BlockFi\u2019s website that the decision was \u201cdriven by market conditions that have had a negative impact on (the company\u2019s) growth rate and a rigorous review of our strategic priorities\u201d. Founded in 2017, BlockFi grew to over 850 staff-strong. After the layoffs, it will have around 600 staff. Earlier, other crypto firms were reported to have announced headcount cuts and hiring freezes amid a downturn in the industry which saw more than $200 billion wiped off the cryptocurrency market on Monday morning. The values of leading cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Dogecoin tanked by between 15 and 25 percent over the past day. Crypto lender Celsius halted withdrawals from its platform and transfers between accounts Monday, due to \u201cextreme market conditions\u201d. Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini Trust\u2019s chief executive officer Tyler Winklevoss and president Cameron Winklevoss said in a blogpost on 2 June that it would be cutting 10 per cent of its workforce. A day later, Coinbase Global announced that it was extending its hiring freeze for new and backfill roles for the foreseeable future, two weeks after it paused hiring. It will also be rescinding accepted offers, its chief people officer L J Brock said in a blog post.

(PHOTO: Changi Airport Group)   SINGAPORE \u2014 Singapore\u2019s Seletar Airport marked its reopening to commercial flights since the pandemic with Malaysian budget carrier Firefly resuming its service on Monday (13 June). The airline will be having twice-daily flights in each direction \u2013 between Malaysia's Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport in Subang and Seletar Airport.  Flights were suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, putting a halt to Firefly\u2019s operations at Seletar Airport since its maiden flight there in April 2019. Before the pandemic, the airline was plying six Subang-Seletar services daily in each direction. To prepare for the resumption, Changi Airport Group (CAG), which manages Seletar Airport, conducted multiple operational trials and system tests with Seletar\u2019s airport partners.

Taxi companies have also been informed of the resumption of flights, with taxi drivers who pick up passengers from the airport offered free coffee and tea in June. The carrier marked the occasion with flight FY3124 ferrying its chief executive officer Philip See and 58 other passengers from Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport to Seletar Airport Monday morning.  See said of the event, \"This recommencement has become one of the highlights for Firefly this year especially after the last flight in March 2020. Singapore has become one of the important destinations for us, connecting passengers of leisure and business. Hence, this recommencement will be able to connect passengers from both countries, whilst enhancing the economy via the tourism industry.\" Receiving the delegation was CAG\u2019s executive vice president of airport management Tan Lye Teck, who said that the group was working closely with airport partners on the resumption of flights to provide a smoother experience for passengers. Firefly passengers travelling to and from Seletar Airport will enjoy 20kg complimentary baggage allowance, fast check-in and boarding and complimentary in-flight refreshments onboard, the carrier said in a media statement. Passengers may also add on 25kg baggage allowance, unlimited flight changes, priority boarding, seat selection, and travel insurance through Firefly\u2019s bundled service offerings. Passengers are still required to be fully vaccinated and comply with all standard requirements by both countries before booking their flights.

Read more to find out\u2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Dipanjan Banchur Jun 29, 2022  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular Stories\n\n\u2022 Has the Next Bear Market Already Arrived?\n\u2022 How Low Will Stocks Go?\n\u2022 Why is Stock Market Outlook So Uncertain?\n\u2022 Trump or the Fed More Important to Stock Investors?\n\u2022 Investors in \u201cWait and See\u201d Mode\nView All Top stories\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMany investors and consumers around the world has been feeling the effects of what a semiconductor shortage actually means to their everyday lives. This has its rippling effects across markets, even the automotive industry has been disrupted by this shortage. The demand for chips has never been so hot while supplies are so low, the world now looks to the chip manufacturers of the world to create enough supply to satisfy skyrocketing demand.\nSemiconductor powerhouse NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is one of the world leaders in the chip industry, operating through the Graphics and Compute & Networking segments. Its Graphics segment includes their popular GeForce graphics processing unit (GPU), Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs, and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.\nIts Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and accelerated computing.\nNVDA has borne the brunt of the broad-based tech sell-off and lost more than 45% year-to-date. The sharp rise in the benchmark interest rates has led to a correction in notable tech names commanding higher valuation multiples.\u00a0\n\n\nDespite surpassing the consensus EPS estimate by 5% and revenue estimate by 2.4% in the last reported quarter, NVDA is currently trading 53.9% below its 52-week high of $346.47, which it hit on November 22, 2021.\nIn terms of forward EV/EBITDA, NVDA\u2019s 28.41x is 138.1% higher than the 11.93x industry average. Its forward P/S of 12.46x is 345.3% higher than the 2.80x industry average. Also, the stock\u2019s 12.40x forward EV/S is 339.3% higher than the 2.82x industry average.\nNVDA expects its revenue for the second quarter ending July 30, 2022, to take a $500 million hit due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and China\u2019s COVID-19 lockdowns earlier this year. Moreover, the company expects its results to be impacted by supply-side constraints.\nThe stock has declined 20% over the past year to close the last trading session at $159.82.\n3 STOCKS TO DOUBLE THIS YEARHere\u2019s what could influence NVDA\u2019s performance in the upcoming months:\nRobust Financials\nNVDA\u2019s non-GAAP revenue increased 46.4% year-over-year to $8.28 billion for the first quarter ended May 1, 2022. The company\u2019s non-GAAP net income increased 48.8% year-over-year to $3.44 billion.\u00a0\nAlso, its non-GAAP EPS came in at $1.36, representing an increase of 49.4% year-over-year. In addition, its non-GAAP operating income increased 55% year-over-year to $3.95 billion.\n\n\nFavorable Analyst Estimates\nAnalysts expect NVDA\u2019s revenue for fiscal 2023 and 2024 to increase 25.9% and 16.5% year-over-year to $33.89 billion and $39.48 billion, respectively. Also, its EPS for fiscal 2023 and 2024 are expected to increase 22.6% and 19.4% year-over-year to $5.45 and $6.50, respectively. It surpassed consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\nStretched Valuation\nIn terms of forward non-GAAP P/E, NVDA\u2019s 30.95x is 75% higher than the 17.68x industry average. Likewise, its 26.24x forward EV/EBIT is 71.3% higher than the 15.31x industry average. And the stock\u2019s 13.14x forward P/B is 247.1% higher than the 3.78x industry average.\nHigh Profitability\nIn terms of trailing-12-month net income margin, NVDA\u2019s 32.02% is 499.9% higher than the 5.34% industry average. Likewise, its 3.52% trailing-12-month Capex/S is 48.8% higher than the industry average of 2.36%. In addition, its 27.14% trailing-12-month levered FCF margin is 191.9% higher than the 9.30% industry average.\nPOWR Ratings Reflect Uncertainty\nNVDA has an overall rating of C, equating to a Neutral in our POWR Ratings system.

Despite the correction, the stock is still trading at an expensive valuation. The stock is currently trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of $180.22 and $237.95, respectively, indicating a downtrend.\nWhile its long-term prospects look bright, the stock is expected to see further downside in the near term. So, it could be wise to wait for a better entry point in the stock.\nHow Does NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Stack Up Against its Peers?\nWhile NVDA has an overall POWR Rating of C, you might want to consider investing in the following Semiconductor & Wireless Chip stocks with an A (Strong Buy) and B (Buy) rating: United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), STMicroelectronics N.V.

(PHOTO: Getty Creative)  \u00b7 TkKurikawa via Getty Images SINGAPORE \u2014 Banks in Singapore will have to provide a \"kill switch\" for customers to suspend their accounts quickly if they suspect their bank accounts have been compromised, as part of new measures that will be introduced to protect customers from digital banking scams. The new measures are progressively being implemented by banks in consultation with the central bank and the Singapore Police Force (SPF), and are expected to take full effect by 31 October, according to a statement by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) on Thursday (2 June).  The added measures complement those announced on 19 January, which include the removal of clickable links in e-mails or SMSes sent to retail customers and having a delay of at least 12 hours before activation of a new soft token on a mobile device.

The new measures include: - requiring additional customer confirmations to process significant changes to customer accounts and other high-risk transactions identified through fraud surveillance;  - setting the default transaction limit for online funds transfers to S$5,000 or lower; - facilitating rapid account freezing and fund recovery operations by co-locating bank staff at the SPF Anti-Scam Centre; - enhancing fraud surveillance systems to take into account a broader range of scam scenarios Further, a committee of seven domestic systemically important banks will be established as the ABS Standing Committee on Fraud to take forward the work of the Anti-Scam Taskforce established in 2020. The committee will report directly to the ABS Council and will drive the industry's anti-scam efforts, implement robust measures to safeguard customers, and reinforce public confidence in the security of digital banking, said MAS and ABS. Under the committee, the ongoing anti-scam work of the industry will be formalised into five key areas covering customer education, authentication, fraud surveillance, customer handling, and recovery and equitable loss-sharing.   Story continues The MAS reminded customers they have a role in the fight against scams, and must keep up with online banking hygiene practices as scam tactics evolve.These include keeping up with scam advisories and alerts put out by the police, the National Crime Prevention Council, MAS and banks. They should also refer to official sources, such as the MAS Financial Institution Directory and cards issued by banks, for hotline numbers and website addresses to communicate with banks.

Designed by millennials to herald a new way of living, lyf Farrer Park draws inspiration from the vibrant arts and cultural scene at the Farrer Park/Little India district and decorated the interior with colourful murals by local artists.

Residents have exclusive access to CONNECT, an open concept co-working space that spans half of the first floor. On the fourth floor, there is an outdoor lawn area with swings, a cook-out area with barbeque pits, a social kitchen and a jungle gym.  As millennials are the target audience the neon signages and eclectic furniture are designed to convey a playful and youthful vibe. \u201cThe age profile for residents at lyf typically range from 25 to 45,\u201d says Genevieve Khua, area manager at lyf Singapore (The Ascott Limited), adding that many are entrepreneurs who own start-ups and use lyf as a platform to network and meet new people. \u201cAfter the pandemic, tenants want larger social spaces as they don\u2019t want to feel too cooped up.\u201d     There are a total of 240 rooms at lyf Farrer Park with three different room types. A hundred and eighty of them are \u201cone of a kind\u201d rooms, which is the standard across all lyf properties and consists of a single bed and bathroom. There are 15 \u201cside by side\u201d rooms with double beds and similar furnishings. Both room types are 161 sq ft in size. Pantry facilities are shared to maximise space usage within the rooms, and are located in a common area on every floor. In addition, there are 45 \u201ctwo of a kind\u201d rooms which are larger at 313 sq ft and encompass two bedrooms with a shared kitchen and dining area, allowing for greater flexibility and is ideal for families.

Workshops, events and walking tours are specially curated for residents by the lyf team to enhance the community spirit. For example, during the lyf Farrer Park official launch, cocktail and soap-making workshops were conducted as a sample of what residents could enjoy during their stay there.   Story continues Since its soft opening in February, lyf Farrer Park has reached more than 90% occupancy as of the end of May, according to Khua. Majority are long-term stays, making up 65% of the total residents. The profile of long-term residents consists of executives relocating to Singapore and younger couples looking for temporary accommodation due to construction or BTO delays. However, as border restrictions ease, there has been a shift towards short-term stays and are likely to increase in the future, Khua says. Short-term residents are largely made up of individuals and couples. lyf Farrer Park also sees a significant number of residents hailing from India, here either for leisure or business purposes. This is likely due to its proximity to Little india.Average daily rates range from $140 to $150 per night for transient stays of less than seven nights to $95 to $100 per night for long stays of more than a month.Currently, occupancy rates across all of Singapore\u2019s lyf properties average 85%. lyf Funan sees a higher share of short-term stays as it is the only property in Singapore with a hotel licence under the brand. lyf one-north has a share of e-commerce, entrepreneurs and students due to its location within the technology micro market and private schools nearby.

Totalling 24,000 sq ft across two floors, it will be the brand\u2019s largest showroom to date and will feature an enhanced store experience that complements Castlery\u2019s online-to-offline shopping experience. Located in the heart of Orchard Road, Liat Towers is also home to global brands like Hermes, a French luxury fashion house and Swiss luxury watch producer Audemars Piguet.  \u201cBeing the first local furniture brand to set up in Liat Towers is a significant and meaningful milestone for us. It is a physical manifestation of our growth ambitions and reflects our unwavering commitment to staying true to our roots, '' says Castlery co-founder Declan Ee. What had begun as a four-man team in Ubi in 2013 has grown as a digital brand and a disruptor in the traditional furniture business industry. Castlery\u2019s collection of furniture now sits in 300,000 homes globally. Since joining the Enterprise Singapore\u2019s (EnterpriseSG) scale-up programme in November 2019, Castlery has seen a six-fold increase in revenue, launching stores in up to 50 metropolitan areas in the US and growing operations in Australia. \u201cCastlery has developed a clear plan to achieve this ambition while maintaining a strong Singapore base,\u201d says Jeffrey Siow, managing director and COO\u00a0of EnterpriseSG. Currently, international orders account for over 80% of Castlery\u2019s overall revenue. \u201cThe government will identify and partner more companies like Castlery to build the next generation of Singapore Global Enterprises as the next engine of growth for our economy,\u201d adds Siow. As part of its international growth strategy, the brand also plans to hire 100 more personnel over the next year to fill supply chain, marketing and visual merchandising positions.

Sahlgren\u2019s team aims to train a state-of-the-art model with a whopping 175 billion parameters that can handle all sorts of language tasks in the Nordic languages of Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and, it hopes, Icelandic, too.\nFor example, a startup can use it to automatically generate product descriptions for an e-commerce website given only the products\u2019 names. Government agencies can use it to quickly classify and route questions from citizens.\nCompanies can ask it to rapidly summarize reports so they can react fast. Hospitals can run distilled versions of the model privately on their own systems to improve patient care.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a foundational model we will provide as a service for whatever tasks people want to solve,\u201d said Sahlgren, who\u2019s been working at the intersection of language and machine learning since he earned his Ph.D. in computational linguistics in 2006.\nPermission to Speak Freely\nIt\u2019s a capability increasingly seen as a strategic asset, a keystone of digital sovereignty in a world that speaks thousands of languages across nearly 200 countries.\nMost language services today focus on Chinese or English, the world\u2019s two most-spoken tongues. They\u2019re typically created in China or the U.S., and they aren\u2019t free.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to have models built in Sweden for Sweden,\u201d Sahlgren said.\nSmall Team, Super System\n\u201cWe\u2019re a small country and a core team of about six people, yet we can build a state-of-the-art resource like this for people to use,\u201d he added.\nThat\u2019s because Sweden has a powerful engine in BerzeLiUs, a 300-petaflops AI supercomputer at Link\u00f6ping University. It trained the initial GPT-SW3 model using just 16 of the 60 nodes in the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD.\nThe next model may exercise all the system\u2019s nodes. Such super-sized jobs require super software like the NVIDIA NeMo Megatron framework.\n\u201cIt lets us scale our training up to the full supercomputer, and we\u2019ve been lucky enough to have access to experts in the NeMo development team \u2014 without NVIDIA it would have been so much more complicated to come this far,\u201d he said.\nA Workflow for Any Language\nNVIDIA\u2019s engineers created a recipe based on NeMo and an emerging process called p-tuning that optimizes massive models fast, and it\u2019s geared to work with any language.\nIn one early test, a model nearly doubled its accuracy after NVIDIA engineers applied the techniques.\nMagnus Sahlgren\nWhat\u2019s more, it requires one-tenth the data, slashing the need for tens of thousands of hand-labeled records. That opens the door for users to fine-tune a model with the relatively small, industry-specific datasets they have at hand.\n\u201cWe hope to inspire a lot of entrepreneurship in industry, startups and the public using our technology to develop their own apps and services,\u201d said Sahlgren.\nWriting the Next Chapter\nMeanwhile, NVIDIA\u2019s developers are already working on ways to make the enabling software better.\nOne test shows great promise for training new capabilities using widely available English datasets into models designed for any language. In another effort, they\u2019re using the p-tuning techniques in inference jobs so models can learn on the fly.\nZenodia Charpy, a senior solutions architect at NVIDIA based in Gothenburg, shares the enthusiasm of the AI Sweden team she supports. \u201cWe\u2019ve only just begun trying new and better methods to tackle these large language challenges \u2014 there\u2019s much more to come,\u201d she said.\nThe GPT-SW3 model will be made available by the end of year via an early access program.

Vietnam\u2019s MoMo Has a Super-App for That\n\nJune 15, 2022 by Ettikan Karuppiah \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  For younger generations, paper bills, loan forms and even cash might as well be in a museum. Smartphones in hand, their financial services largely take place online.\nThe financial-technology companies that serve them are in a race to develop AI that can make sense of the vast amount of data the companies collect \u2014 both to provide better customer service and to improve their own backend operations.\nVietnam-based fintech company MoMo has developed a super-app that includes payment and financial transaction processing in one self-contained online commerce platform. The convenience of this all-in-one mobile platform has already attracted over 30 million users in Vietnam.\nTo improve the efficiency of the platform\u2019s chatbots, know-your-customer (eKYC) systems and recommendation engines, MoMo uses NVIDIA GPUs running in Google Cloud. It uses NVIDIA DGX systems for training and batch processing.\nIn just a few months, MoMo has achieved impressive results in speeding development of solutions that are more robust and easy to scale. Using NVIDIA GPUs for eKYC inference tasks has resulted in a 10x speedup compared to using CPU, the company says. For the MoMo Face Payment service, using TensorRT has reduced training and inference time by 10x.\nAI Offers a Different Perspective\nTuan Trinh, director of data science at MoMo, describes his company\u2019s use of AI as a way to get a different perspective on its business. One such project processes vast amounts of data and turns it into computerized visuals or graphs that can then be analyzed to improve connectivity between users in the app.\nMoMo developed its own AI algorithm that uses over a billion data points to direct recommendations of additional services and products to its customers. These offerings help maintain a line of communication with the company\u2019s user base that helps boost engagement and conversion.\nThe company also deploys a recommendation box on the home screen of its super-app. This caused its click-through rate to improve dramatically as the AI prompts customers with useful recommendations and keeps them engaged.\nWith AI, MoMo says it can process the habits of 10 million active users over the course of the last 30-60 days to train its predictive models. In addition, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server helps unify the serving flows for recommendation engines, which significantly reduces the effort to deploy AI applications in production environments. In addition, TensorRT has contributed to 3x performance improvement of MoMo\u2019s payment services AI model inference, boosting the customer experience.\nChatbots Advance the Conversation\nMoMo\u2019s will use AI-powered chatbots to allow it to scale up faster when accommodating and engaging with users. Chatbot services are especially effective on mobile device apps, which tend to be popular with younger users, who often prefer them over making phone calls to customer service.\nChatbot users can inquire about a product and get the support they need to evaluate it before purchasing \u2014 all from one interface \u2014 which is essential for a super-app like MoMo\u2019s that functions as a one-stop-shop.\nThe chatbots are also an effective vehicle for upselling or suggesting additional services, MoMo says. When combined with machine learning, it\u2019s possible to categorize target audiences for different products or services to customize their experience with the app.\nAI chatbots have the additional benefit of freeing up MoMo\u2019s customer service team to handle other important tasks.\nBetter Credit Scoring\nCredit history data from all of MoMo\u2019s 30 million-plus users can be applied to models used for risk control of financial services by using AI algorithms. MoMo has applied credit scoring to the lending services within its super-app. Since the company doesn\u2019t solely depend on traditional deep learning for tasks that are less complex, MoMo\u2019s development team has been able to obtain higher accuracy with shorter processing times.\nThe MoMo app takes less than 2 seconds to make a lending decision but is still able to reduce taking on risky lending targets with more accurate predictions from AI. This helps keep customers from taking on too much debt, and helps MoMo from missing out on potential revenue.\nSince AI is capable of processing both structured and unstructured data, it\u2019s able to incorporate information beyond traditional credit scores, like whether customers spend their money on necessities or luxuries, to assess a borrower\u2019s risk more accurately.\nFuture of AI in Fintech\nWith fintechs increasingly applying AI to their massive data stores, MoMo\u2019s team predicts the industry will need to evaluate how to do so in a way that keeps user data safe \u2014 or risk losing customer loyalty. MoMo already plans to expand its use of graph neural networks and models based on its proven ability to dramatically improve its operations.\nThe MoMo team also believes that AI could one day make credit scores obsolete. Since AI is able to make decisions based on broader unstructured data, it\u2019s possible to determine loan approval by considering other risks besides a credit score. This would help open up the pool of potential users on fintech apps like MoMo\u2019s to people in underserved and underbanked communities, who may not have credit scores, let alone \u201cgood\u201d ones.\nWith around one in four American adults \u201cunderbanked,\u201d which makes it more difficult for them to get a loan or credit card, and more than half of Africa\u2019s population completely \u201ccredit invisible,\u201d which refers to people without a bank or a credit score, MoMo believes AI could bring banking access to communities like these and open up a new user base for fintech apps at the same time.\nExplore NVIDIA\u2019s AI solutions and enterprise-level AI platforms driving innovation in financial services.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Financial Services | NVIDIA DGX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(PHOTO: Ore Huiying/Bloomberg)  \u00b7 Bloomberg By Nurin Sofia (Bloomberg) \u2014 After waiting for almost a year, Lim Swee Hoe was ecstatic when his US$340,000 Porsche Taycan finally arrived in Singapore last month. \u201cIt was definitely worth the wait,\u201d said the 56-year-old managing director, his eyes twinkling with pride at the white electric vehicle parked in the garage of his semi-detached home.  His swanky ride has contributed to a surge in EV adoption in the island state. Electric vehicles accounted for 8.4% of all new car registrations in the first five months of the year \u2014 double the level for all of 2021 and 20 times higher than 2020. But just as a government push has seen demand for cleaner cars finally take off, global supply chain snarls are lengthening wait times and threatening to push prices even higher. \u201cThe question is how many vehicles will EV makers ship to the city-state, given the market is relatively small,\u201d said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man. \u201cWith limited supply, EV makers will likely prioritise shipments to larger markets where demand is greater. The waitlist could expand due to this.\u201d That\u2019s a reality car distributors are learning to deal with. \u201cSupply chain disruptions aren\u2019t making things easy, so we work closely with the manufacturers and also manage customer expectations,\u201d said Cheong Yan Pang, a managing director at Sime Darby Motor Holdings Ltd., a distributor of BMW and BYD Co. electric cars.  It\u2019s a similar story for Sabrina Sng, a managing director at car dealership Wearnes Automotive Pte., who\u2019s in charge of Polestar EVs. \u201cWe have limited stock and it\u2019s sporadic,\u201d she said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t help with the Shanghai lockdown. Sometimes we lose certain months of production because vessels can\u2019t leave the port, costing us time in which cars could have been built.\u201d Supply chain disruptions triggered by China\u2019s Covid-19 pandemic curbs and the worldwide chip shortage have upended the global EV industry at a time of growing demand. Across Southeast Asia, countries are gearing up for mass electrification, from Thailand\u2019s government trying to slow the sale of gas guzzling cars, to Indonesia planning a slew of incentives for electric-car manufacturers and drivers. Singapore\u2019s Transport Minister S. Iswaran said earlier this month he expects demand to continue to rise. The nation wants to phase out internal combustion-engine vehicles by 2040 and replace most of them with EVs. Singapore is expected to lead the region in new EVs as a percentage of all vehicle sales, with at least one-third of all cars sold on the island forecast to be electric by 2030, according to a BloombergNEF report last year.   Story continues The city-state is still in its very early stages of adoption, however, with just 1,739 electric cars registered last year, and 1,116 in the first five months of this year, Land Transport Authority data show. That compares with 2021 passenger EV sales of 9,015 in Thailand and 718 in Indonesia, according to BNEF estimates . In China, about one in five cars sold is electric.  (Source: Bloomberg)  \u00b7 BloombergSingapore has relatively low car ownership overall. It\u2019s one of the world\u2019s most expensive places to buy a car with steep excise and registration duties. People must also bid for a limited number of car-ownership permits, known as certificates of entitlement, that are auctioned by the government.Lower registration fees and improved charging infrastructure are helping fuel demand for EVs. The government has targets to equip 2,000 public housing car parks with chargers by 2025, and install a network of 60,000 chargers across the island by 2030 in an effort to spur uptake.That should alleviate concerns mass market car buyers have on the feasibility of EVs as their primary vehicle, said BNEF analyst Allen Tom Abraham.Among the potential new customers is Justin Chiam, a 42-year-old engineer who\u2019s considering swapping out his Subaru Forester SUV for a battery-powered BYD Atto 3. It retails for about S$80,000 and an ownership permit will cost around S$100,000.The island is currently dotted with about 2,500 charging ports and Chiam has mapped out his charging route. \u201cNow I just pump and go at the petrol kiosk,\u201d he said. \u201cI think for EVs it\u2019s a whole new way of living in a sense that you\u2019ve got to integrate that part into your lifestyle.\u201dMeanwhile, Lim is enjoying his new Taycan, for which he paid about S$370,000, plus almost S$100,000 for an ownership permit.He finds it \u201cjust as powerful\u201d as the Porsche 911 he test drove several times. And he\u2019s grateful it\u2019s finally arrived: Porsche said the waiting time now has ballooned to as long as 18 months.\u00a9 2022 Bloomberg L.P.

According to Lianhe Zaobao, the buyer is understood to be from Fujian province in China. The buyer was said to have bought 3-bedders and 4-bedders a few days ago. The 3-bedroom units were priced between S$3.1 million and S$3.3 million, while the 4-bedroom units were priced between S$5.3 million and S$5.6 million.  According to ERA Realty Network, who brokered the deal, these include six 3-bedroom units of 1,259 sq ft and five 3-bedroom units of 1,130 sq ft, with the remaining units being 4-bedroom units spanning 1,959 sq ft. The units are located in several stacks across various floors, ranging from 6th to 23rd floor.

Foreigners will have to pay the ABSD regardless of the number of residential properties they buy. This is on top of the Buyer\u2019s Stamp Duty (BSD), which we estimate to be around S$4 million in total should the deal for the additional units go through. According to the insider source, the funds to pay the units were transferred from Indonesia to Singapore. Rise in the number of foreign buyers Notably, there has been an increase in the number of foreign buyers recently, given the reopening of borders. Singapore\u2019s stability and status as a safe haven also make it attractive for foreign buyers to buy property here.   Story continues For instance, according to Christine Sun, Senior Vice President of Research and Analytics from OrangeTee and Tie, there was a 136% increase in foreign buyers buying new launch condos in April.59 units of new launch condos were bought by foreigners in April, compared to 25 units in March. At the same time, April\u2019s number was higher than the monthly average (from April 2021 to March 2022) of 40 units.This was also not the first time foreign buyers have made headlines for buying condo units in bulk. Back in March last year, all 20 units of EDEN were bought in bulk by a family for S$293 million. It was later revealed that the buyers were the Tsai family of Want Want China Holdings from Taiwan.What do you think of the bulk sale at CanningHill Piers?

Can FTI Consulting ride out the impact of economic shocks?         Stockopedia   30 June 2022 2 min read       In this article:  FCN            Geopolitical shockwaves and economic uncertainty are causing turmoil this year. Some shares are better able to absorb this kind of disruption than others - but could FTI Consulting (NYQ:FCN) be one of them? To understand why different shares respond to chaos in different ways, it pays to look at their strengths...  In bull markets, investors tend to gravitate to more speculative growth stocks as a means of achieving the best returns. But these stocks can collapse early in a crisis. By contrast, high quality shares often get overlooked in bull markets. But it's these that are often better at keeping their momentum and recovering quickest from periods of volatility. Shares in FTI Consulting are currently trading at $176.9 but a question in the minds of investors is whether economic aftershocks from Covid might affect it in the future. The answer is that there are some positive signs. FTI Consulting appears to score well against some important financial and technical measures and has at least some exposure to two influential drivers of investment returns: high quality and strong momentum. So why are these two factors important and where are the clues hidden? GET MORE DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS INTO NYQ:FCN \u00bb High quality When it comes to stock analysis, company quality tends to be revealed in high profitability and strong industry-leading margins. These kinds of firms are stable, growing and often have accelerating sales and earnings. They also have strong and improving financial histories with no obvious signs of accountancy or bankruptcy risk. One of the quality metrics for FTI Consulting is its 5-year Return on Capital Employed, which is 11.7%. Long-term, double-digit ROCEs can be a hallmark of companies with the power to grow very profitably. Strong momentum Positive momentum trends show up in share prices and earnings growth. You can find the clues in stocks that are trading close to their 52 week high prices and outperforming the market. They\u2019ll often be beating broker estimates and getting forecast upgrades and recommendation changes. There are signs of this at FTI Consulting, where the share price has seen a 45.8% return relative to the market over the past 12 months. Market volatility and economic uncertainty can be a major drag on momentum, but previously strong stocks can be quick to recover when confidence returns. In summary, a combination of high quality and momentum can be clues in the search for shares with the potential to deliver solid investment profits over many years. In good times, these shares can become expensive to buy. But in volatile markets, there may be chances to buy them at cheaper prices.   Story continues What does this mean for potential investors?Finding good quality stocks with strong momentum behind them is a strategy used by some of the world's most successful investors. But be warned: these factors don't guarantee future returns and we've identified some areas of concern with FTI Consulting that you can find out about here.

REUTERS/Romeo Ranoco RR/TW  \u00b7 Reuters Photographer / reuters By Andreo Calonzo The Philippines will likely produce fewer chickens in the coming months with numbers reduced by pricier, lower-quality feed and poor weather, an industry leader said \u2013 a slowdown that could drive food costs higher. Raising poultry will be \u201cvery challenging\u201d in the coming months, said United Broiler Raisers\u2019 Association president Elias Jose Inciong, as producers in the Southeast Asian nation compete with the rest of the world for chicken feed, as the war in Ukraine disrupts supplies.  Across Southeast Asia, food costs are rising, hitting domestic supplies and exports. Malaysia recently banned chicken exports due to rising local prices and that hit poultry supplies in neighboring Singapore. In the Philippines, the cost issue is compounded by high humidity that\u2019s unfavorable to growing chickens, as rainy season came earlier this year. \u201cNormally, the answer to high humidity would be very good nutrition. The problem is it\u2019s now more difficult to get good-quality feeds because of the high cost of raw materials,\u201d Inciong said in a phone interview Thursday. Whole chicken prices in Manila have risen 25% to 200 pesos ($3.75) since the start of the year, Agriculture Department data showed. Meat price increases quickened 5.4% in May, boosting overall inflation to its fastest since November 2018. Higher chicken prices could however ultimately boost production, Agriculture Assistant Secretary Noel Reyes told The Philippine Star. The Philippines\u2019 total chicken output fell 3.6% last year to 1.7 million metric tons. \u00a9 2022 Bloomberg L.P.

The two companies jointly announced the strategic partnership on Tuesday (21 June) to provide what is believed to be the first-ever gut microbiome banking service in Southeast Asia. The service involves preserving healthy microbes in a person's digestive tract through their stool samples.  A Singapore Exchange mainboard listed company, Cordlife specialises in cord blood banking services and cryopreservation, which is the use of very low temperatures to preserve living cells and tissues. The firm is one of Asia\u2019s pioneers in cryopreservation of umbilical cord blood obtained from babies. AMILI is a precision gut microbiome company which specialises in processing and analysing gut microbiome \u2013 the bacteria, viruses and fungi that live in the digestive tract.

These can be harvested from stool samples, then processed and cryopreserved for future use.  Under the tie-up, AMILI will be responsible for testing and processing of the gut microbiome obtained from clients\u2019 stool samples before sending them to Cordlife\u2019s facility in Singapore for long-term cryopreservation in a dedicated gut microbiome cryopreservation room. Clients can then choose to withdraw their samples when they are needed for gut microbiome transplantation, also known as faecal microbiota transplantation.  Why preserve microbiome from your stool? Storing an individual\u2019s microbiome early will allow recipients to access the healthier versions of gut microbiomes that are yet unaffected by medication, diseases, and age. The gut microbiomes can be transplanted into the intestinal tract of a recipient to restore microbial balance. Such transplants may also confer therapeutic health benefits, according to an article on the transplant by National Library of Medicine. The transplant is performed via colonoscopy or less commonly through a tube inserted into the nose. Gut microbiomes can also be encapsulated in a pill and consumed. The pills are odourless and tasteless.   Story continues According to the press release, AMILI was inspired to collaborate with Cordlife after it received numerous requests from patients\u2019 families who wanted to preserve their gut microbiome for future transplants.How much to store your stool?The first transplant was performed in 2014 by AMILI co-founder David Ong, who is also Adjunct Associate Professor at the National University Hospital.The service, which includes stool and blood screening along with 10 years or cryopreservation service, is suitable for individuals who are at least five years old and able to follow simple stool collection instructions. It is priced at $5,500 before GST.To be eligible for gut microbiome banking, an individual must meet the prevailing screening criteria, which include a health history questionnaire, stool sample culture test, and infectious disease testing.Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingapore  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

You can expect a much bigger hoopla from NVIDIA when its eventual GeForce RTX 40 series based on Ada Lovelace launches, but in the meantime, budget gamers looking for some added oomph over integrated graphics have another low end option to consider.\n\n\nAnd yes, this is a decidedly low end graphics card. It settles in at the bottom of the GTX 16-series stack and like all the rest, it's based on NVIDIA's Turing GPU architecture. However, there's a pretty big gulf in specs between this latest addition and the next one up on the GTX totem pole, that being the GeForce GTX 1650.\n\n\nHere's a broad overview...\n\n\n\n\nSo we're looking at 512 CUDA cores and a 1,740MHz (base) to 1,785MHz (boost) clock if sticking with reference specifications. It's also equipped with 4GB of GDDR6 memory, which is the same as the GeForce GTX 1650, but it's attached to a 64-bit bus width that's only half as wide. That's undoubtedly going to serve as a choke point in certain situations.\n\n\nTo be fair, while the GeForce GTX 1650 looks like a fairly big step down from the GeForce GTX 1650, it's a big step up from the GeForce GTX 1030 that it kind of supplants. That's a 5-year-old card based on Pascal with 384 CUDA cores and a mere 2GB of slower GDDR5 memory, linked to the same 64-bit bus, resulting in a tick over 48GB/s of memory bandwidth. In comparison, the GeForce GTX 1630 offers up 96GB/s of memory bandwidth.\n\n\nWe haven't tested this card, but there are reviews out there. The folks at TechPowerUp tested it in a whole bunch of games and found that on average, it's three times faster than the GeForce GTX 1030. It's all relative though, as at 1080p the site also found that it was \"severely lacking in performance.\"\n\n\nFrom the outside looking in, this appears better suited for a media PC that needs a bit of extra grunt over integrated graphics. But until we've tested it for ourselves, we don't want to make any final judgements or recommendations.\n\n\nIn any event, several of NVIDIA's hardware partners have already added the GeForce GTX 1630 to their lineup, including EVGA, Gigabyte, MSI, and Zotac, to name a few. EVGA is the only one we see available in the US at the moment, and it's asking $199.99.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, GPU, graphics card, (nasdaq:nvda), geforce gtx 1630\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

(PHOTO: Getty Creative)  \u00b7 Jose Martinez Calderon via Getty Images SINGAPORE \u2014 Non-Fungible Tokens, or NFTs for short, are digital assets that everyone seems to want to own these days. But are they really a good thing, or is it just going to be a passing trend? This is part of a series where Yahoo Finance Singapore will focus on different aspects of millennials and their finances. In this second part, we discover whether it\u2019s good for millennials to invest in NFTs. What are NFTs? For the uninitiated, NFTs are basically certificates of digital ownership which have gained huge traction in recent years. The certificates have a unique record that is written into the fixed code (that cannot be changed) of a blockchain at time of creation or minting, which makes it a cryptographic asset. This can take the form of anything from digital art pieces, in-game items, music, fashion items and even virtual land.  To put it simply, NFTs are crypto assets that record the ownership of a digital file such as an image, video or text. Anyone can create, or \"mint\", an NFT, and ownership of the token does not usually confer ownership of the underlying item. Profits are generated when one sell\u2019s the NFT to someone else who wants it more and is willing to pay a higher price, usually paid with cryptocurrency. Since it lies in the hope of selling it at a higher price to a willing buyer, the value of NFTs is heavily driven by sentiment and hype. This exposes sellers to the risk of price manipulation.

Also read: Millennial Money: How much do I need to spend on my wedding?  For instance, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey created an NFT out of his first tweet and sold it for US$2.9 million in early 2021. Digital artist Beeple sold an NFT of his work for US$69 million, making him one of the most valuable living artists.  The utility of NFTs varies massively across the globe too. For example, there can be security tokens (to prove your identity) and even governance tokens (to indicate the right to vote). One can buy a NFT with crypto coins and NFTs can also represent a store of value, with some tokens worth more than others. In fact, NFT sales volume totalled US$24.9 billion in 2021, compared to just US$94.9 million the year before, according to market tracker DappRadar. Speculative and volatile Despite the huge number of people turning to NFTs, financial experts warn that unlike traditional financial assets, there is little or no basis for the valuation of NFTs. This is because the asset prices of NFTs are determined by demand and supply. Meanwhile, traditional financial assets have some kind of yield or value being created. For example, if you invest into stocks of a company, and it has a business model that is growing, the value of your investment will grow along with it as well.   Story continues \u201cNFTs do not have an underlying economic return based on economic activity of companies or countries. Their payoff structure is speculative and volatile: You can win astronomically but you can also lose everything\u201d, said Chuin Ting Weber, CEO of MoneyOwl, a bionic financial advisor.As such, Weber recommends that millennials look into buying NFTs mainly as a bet or venture. This means keeping the invested amount small and only putting in only what you are prepared to lose.Providing a similar analogy, Gavin Chia, Head of Managed Investments and Investment Advisory of Standard Chartered Bank Singapore, said: \u201cNFTs are a little bit more like buying a luxury car or watch, which is something that is sought after but doesn\u2019t actually create value or yield a return.\u201dFinancial experts warn that because NFTs are speculative in nature, the hope of attaining financial freedom through investing in NFTs is not a plan for financial success.\u201cRegardless of one\u2019s age, speculative investing products should not dominate your investment portfolio,\u201d said Gregory Van, CEO of Endowus, a Singapore-based financial technology company.\u201cIt is crucial to build your core wealth through an investing strategy that is strategic to your goals and passive in asset allocation while being globally diversified and low in cost,\u201d he added.Van also advised that millennials do their research and verify the information they find online before taking action, especially when it comes to riskier investments like NFTs.Lack of regulationWhile the Monetary Authority of Singapore currently doesn't regulate activities related to NFTs, it has reminded consumers that investments in digital tokens, including NFTs, are not suitable for retail investors, Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said in a written reply to a parliamentary question on 15 February.\"For NFTs in particular, their perceived uniqueness, combined with speculative demand, has served to inflate prices. This potentially puts investors at risk of outsized losses should speculative fervour abate,\" said Tharman, who is also chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. He noted there are significant legal complexities and risks involved in NFTs.Despite the lack of regulation, some Singapore companies are quick to jump on the bandwagon.Singaporean ride-hailing app, Ryde, launched its first NFT project in April this year. Called \u201cRydePals\u201d, the NFTs will give owners exclusive in-app rewards and benefits like discounted rides and cashbacks. The RydePals NFTs can also be traded on secondary NFT exchanges like OpenSea.\u201cWe want to deploy NFTs in a way that generates more real world value, especially for the rapidly growing market segment of Singaporeans who hold crypto\u201d, says Terence Zou, founder and chief executive of Ryde.Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingapore  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Aerial view of empty roads and the Pasig river, stretching for 25 kilometers, it divides the Philippines capital of Metro Manila and its surrounding urban area into northern and southern halves. (Photo by Herman Lumanog/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images)  \u00b7 Pacific Press via Getty Images By Siegfrid Alegado and Andreo Calonzo Philippines\u2019 incoming economic planning secretary Arsenio Balisacan plans to bolster the economy\u2019s weak spots as he targets at least 6% annual growth throughout the term of President-elect Ferdinand Marcos Jr. The next administration must boost investment in agriculture and manufacturing and build infrastructure to grow the economy between 6%-8% annually to 2028, Balisacan said in an interview Wednesday. Farm and industry output currently account for less than 40% of gross domestic product, while services contributes the majority.  \u201cI would like to see those weakest points as the priority of the administration,\u201d said the 64-year-old, who\u2019s currently chairman of the nation\u2019s antitrust commission. Consistently growing at the rate of 6% for six years will make Philippines a half-a-trillion dollar economy, according to Bloomberg calculations. The nation\u2019s first-quarter expansion of 8.3% is already among Asia\u2019s fastest, thanks to the reopening from the pandemic. Still, Marcos\u2019s team faces immediate challenges: inflation is at its fastest in three years, budget deficit has widened and the global outlook has dimmed.    Still, Balisacan said the economy can expand by at least 7% this year, within the official growth estimate, riding the recovery from the record contraction in 2020 due to the pandemic. He said he will push for more targeted support measures to ease inflation\u2019s burden on the poor while ensuring \u201ctight\u201d government finances are managed properly. \u201cWe can achieve more with less,\u201d he said, adding that a review and streamlining of beneficiaries are needed. The nation also cannot afford removal of certain taxes on goods as proposed by some sectors, he said. Experienced Economist Balisacan will draw from his experience in crafting a new economic development plan. Before taking helm of the antitrust body, he served as economic planning secretary of the late president Benigno Aquino from 2012 to 2016. To sustain economic growth of at least 6%, the next administration must address red tape and build infrastructure needed to attract investment in manufacturing and agriculture, said Balisacan, who holds a PhD in Economics from the University of Hawaii. Given a budget deficit inflated by pandemic-era support programs, companies and multilateral development agencies may be tapped to finance roads, rail and irrigation, he said. Balisacan helped manage the Aquino administration\u2019s flagship public-private partnership infrastructure program. Funneling investment into lagging sectors is also crucial in creating jobs and bringing down the poverty rate to 9% from 23.7% as of mid-2021, Balisacan said.   Story continues Farming FamilyThe incoming economic planning secretary is widely seen by analysts to bring poverty and rural development flavors into policy making, thanks to his background.Born into a tenant-farmer family in Ilocos Norte province, where the Marcos family also hails from, Balisacan took up agriculture in college before venturing into economics for his graduate degrees.His first job was to survey farmlands for an agriculture research agency, he said. \u201cThat exposed me to many problems of farmers around the country.\u201dAsked why he accepted his new post, Balisacan, whose family was looking forward toward his retirement next year, said it was \u201ccall of duty.\u201d He was adviser to Marcos when the incoming president was Ilocos Norte governor.\u201cI was surprised,\u201d he said about Marcos\u2019s offer. \u201cI don\u2019t mix politics and my work. Politics is not in my DNA, fortunately or unfortunately.\u201d\u00a9 2022 Bloomberg L.P.

The rupee was aided by dollar sales by foreign banks and exporters during the session, a trader at a mid-sized private bank said.   Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

How will a changing economic outlook affect shares in Hikma Pharmaceuticals?         Ben Hobson   3 June 2022 2 min read       In this article:  HIK.L       HKMPF       HKMPY         Shares in Hikma Pharmaceuticals (LON:HIK) are currently trading at 1,673p but a key question for investors is how geopolitical and economic uncertainty will affect the price. Part of the answer comes down to judging whether the stock is well placed to withstand economic shocks. To do that, it's worth looking at its profile to see where its strengths are.  The encouraging news is that Hikma Pharmaceuticals has at least some of the traits that are often associated with two influential drivers of investment returns: high quality and a relatively cheap valuation. To understand where that shows up, here's a closer look: GET MORE DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS INTO LON:HIK \u00bb Buying quality at a fair price Good quality stocks are loved by the market because they're more likely to be solid, dependable businesses. Profitability is important, but so is the firm's financial strength. A track record of improving finances is essential. One of the quality metrics for Hikma Pharmaceuticals is that it passes 7 of the 9 financial tests in the Piotroski F-Score. The F-Score is a world-class accounting-based checklist for finding stocks with an improving financial health trend. A good F-Score suggests that the company has strong signs of quality.  While quality is important, no-one wants to overpay for a stock, so an appealing valuation is vital too. With a weaker economy, earnings forecasts are unclear right across the market. But there are some valuation measures that can help, and one of them is the Earnings Yield. Earnings Yield compares a company's profit with its market valuation (worked out by dividing its operating profit by its enterprise value). It gives you a total value of the stock (including its cash and debt), which makes it easier to compare different stocks. As a percentage, the higher the Earnings Yield, the better value the share. A rule of thumb for a reasonable Earnings Yield might be 5%, and the Earnings Yield for Hikma Pharmaceuticals is currently 11.7%.In summary, good quality and relatively cheap valuations are pointers to those stocks that are some of the most appealing to contrarian value investors. It's among these shares that genuine mis-pricing can be found. Once the market recognises that these quality firms are on sale, those prices often rebound. What does this mean for potential investors? Finding good quality stocks at cheap prices is a strategy used by some of the world's most successful investors. But be warned: these factors don't guarantee future returns and we've identified some areas of concern with Hikma Pharmaceuticals that you can find out about here.

The superalloy used in the key parts of this rocket comes from Daye Special Steel, a subsidiary of CITIC Pacific Special Steel (000708).  \"Superalloys are used for the key components of the 'Long March' rocket engine. Its operating environment is very harsh, which requires high pressure and high temperature resistance\", according to the spokesperson at the launch site. Introduced by its technical director since the year 1960, Daye Special Steel had established 3 laboratories and started trial production of superalloys, precision alloys and cermet. This superalloy has helped China's first artificial satellite launched on April, 1970. Since then, Daye Special Steel has continuously optimized and improved its manufacturing to produce new generations of materials for the Long March\u2019s series of rockets\u2019 carrier engines. While committed to the research of superalloy, Daye Special Steel has also used electroslag casting and perforation technology to prepare tube blanks, and through cold forming process, it has made various specifications of special seamless steel tubes for the production of advance rocket engines. Its seamless steel tubes equipped with a smooth surface, corrosion resistance, good formability and other strong mechanical properties, have become the core supplier of materials for key parts of large liquid rocket engines in China. In the past 52 years, Daye Special Steel has always played an indispensable and important role in the development of China's aerospace industry. The special materials developed by itself have boosted Long March\u2019s series of carrier rockets with more than 300 successful launches.  In conjunction with this Shenzhou 14\u2019s launch, earlier, on May 31, China's newly-configurated model of AG600 Kunlong large amphibious aircraft made its maiden flight in Zhuhai, Guangdong. The steel for the main bearing of the aircraft's landing gear was also developed by Daye Special Steel. With a length of 37 meters and a wingspan of 38.8 meters, the AG600 is roughly the size of a Boeing 737. These specifications make it the world's biggest amphibious aircraft, surpassing Japan's ShinMaywa US-2 and Russia's Beriev Be-200. Xiong Xianpeng, deputy project manager of the AG600 family, said the aircraft will mainly be tasked with aerial firefighting and maritime search and rescue. The plane can be refitted to conduct marine environment inspections and marine resource surveys, as well as for personnel and supply transportation, he said.   Story continues The fire-extinguishing variant has a maximum takeoff weight of 60 metric tons. In a typical firefighting operation, it can collect 12 tons of water from a lake or sea in 20 seconds and use it to douse blazes over an area of about 4,000 square meters, according to its designers.Jiang Qiao, general manager of Daye Special Steel, said that due to its complex and harsh service environment (humid heat, high salt), the steel for the main bearing member of aircraft landing gear not only needs to withstand ultra-high strength, but also excellent resistance to oxidation, stress corrosion fracture and fatigue crack fracture. All these put forward high requirements for the purity and uniformity of material smelting. Daye Special Steel has established a team since the beginning of 2019, and has successfully developed and delivered nearly 100 tons of ultra-high-strength steel with a diameter of 40 to 400 mm for the production of AG600 Kunlong landing gear.In recent years. through Daye Special Steel, CITIC Pacific Special Steel has focused on the development of high-end special metallurgical materials for aviation, aerospace, and in various fields, taking the lead in China's special steel industry, and in global marketplace for complex and high-level applications and deployment.

Oftentimes, that means buying quality businesses and holding the stock for the long term. Even the greatest companies in the world can go through rough short-term patches when the stock plummets. However, holding through those tough times is where investors are rewarded.\nAs an established leader in the technology sector, Nvidia (NVDA -2.71%) has a long history of strong business results in producing the computer chips that power our digital world. Let's dig into Nvidia's recent earnings results to see what has led this business to the outsized results it has provided its long-term shareholders.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA diversified product base\nSince its beginning as a producer of PC graphics cards, Nvidia has grown its business to include several areas of chip production, powering many different markets, including scientific computing, artificial intelligence (AI), data science, autonomous vehicles, robotics, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality\u00a0(VR).\n\nNvidia recently reported results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Revenue for the quarter was $8.3 billion, up from $5.7 billion in the year-ago quarter,\u00a0 indicating a year-over-year (YOY) increase of 46%. For increased clarity on the business's performance, Nvidia breaks its revenue down by the markets it serves.\n\n\n\n\nRevenue (in millions)\n\n\nQ1 2023\n\n\nQ1 2022\n\n\nYOY Growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n$3,620\n\n\n$2,760\n\n\n31%\n\n\n\n\nData Center\n\n\n$3,750\n\n\n$2,048\n\n\n83%\n\n\n\n\nProfessional Visualization\n\n\n$622\n\n\n$372\n\n\n67%\n\n\n\n\nAutomotive & Robotics\n\n\n$138\n\n\n$154\n\n\n(10%)\n\n\n\n\nData source: Nvidia. Chart by author. YOY = year over year.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia showed strong growth in its three largest markets, and its gaming and data center segments set quarterly revenue records. Auto revenue was down due to the automakers' supply constraints, so that result is not surprising. Nvidia has its products in several areas of the market, lessening its risk should one industry face secular headwinds.\nImproved efficiency and profitability\nThe first quarter also saw some positive movements with Nvidia's margin profile. Gross margin for the quarter was 65.5%, an improvement from 64.1% in the year-ago period. While operating income fell 4% YOY, that included an expense related to the termination of Nvidia's attempted acquisition of SoftBank's (SFTB.Y -2.79%) Arm Holdings.\nOn an adjusted basis -- which excludes this one-time expense, as well as stock-based compensation -- operating income actually increased 55% year over year. Non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) net income and earnings per share grew 49% YOY. Nvidia is showing its ability to not only grow revenue but also decrease expenses and improve efficiencies, positively impacting the bottom line.\nImpact of a $10,000 investment\nThese results are the latest in a long line of impressive quarterly reports, highlighting Nvidia's important role in our digital, tech-driven world. Currently boasting a market cap of $471 billion, Nvidia is a major player in the tech economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, 10 years ago, that wasn't the case. At that point, Nvidia had a market cap of only $7.1 billion, and its shares traded for approximately $3.00 (split-adjusted).\u00a0For investors who saw the potential in Nvidia, a $10,000 investment made 10 years ago and held through today would be worth more than $660,000.\nWhere does Nvidia go from here?\nAs impressive as Nvidia's 10-year result may seem, that return would have been close to $1.2 million at Nvidia's most-recent high. Only time will tell whether Nvidia can get back to those lofty heights, but the company has continued to grow and increase its presence in the chip space over the past decade and doesn't show signs of slowing down.\nNvidia currently has a price-to-sales ratio of 16, which is not cheap. However, that multiple is 54% off its high, providing a steep discount for investors who believe Nvidia will continue to reward shareholders for years to come.\n\n\n\nJeff Santoro has positions in Nvidia.

Despite rising sales and profits, its stock is trading down almost 37% year to date. The company is on the leading edge of technology that powers gaming, data centers, and autonomous driving, but investors are worried about whether it can maintain its strong showing over the short term as macroeconomic factors are affecting management forecasts. \nLet's take a closer look at Nvidia, especially one green flag and one red flag regarding its potential as an investment, and see if either is more important to its future.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nGreen flag: Gaming revenue\u00a0\nIn its fiscal year 2022, which ended on Jan. 30, Nvidia generated $12.5 billion in revenue from the products in its gaming division. That was a meaningful increase from the $7.7 billion in revenue the segment earned in fiscal 2021. Nvidia holds the top position in the personal computer gaming market with over three times the revenue of the next biggest competitor. Nvidia boasts of having more than 200 million gamers using its GeForce graphic processing units (GPUs) in their computers. \nThe growth in Nvidia's gaming division is not restricted to this most recent fiscal year. Over the last five years, it has grown revenue at a compound annual rate of 25%. Those sales may have been even higher if Nvidia could have produced the number of chips gamers desired. Its GPUs are regularly sold out at retailers and are selling at premium prices on third-party reseller sites like eBay.\n\nNVDA Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming was a $156 billion industry in 2020, according to Statista, and is expected to grow to $269 billion by 2025. The gaming industry is bigger than the movie industry and the North American Sports industry combined. In fact, video gaming is a growing spectator sport.\nThat's a good sign for shareholders as Nvidia's gaming segment generated 46% of overall revenue in fiscal 2022. A dominant share in a large and growing market is a green flag for Nvidia. \n\nRed flag: Cryptocurrency price crash\u00a0\nNvidia's graphic processing units are capable of cryptocurrency mining and its sales growth fluctuates with the interest in mining digital assets which fluctuates with the price of those assets. Cryptocurrencies are down significantly in 2022 and roughly $1 trillion of value has been shaved from cryptocurrencies overall since hitting their peaks in 2021. The dramatic fall has lessened the enthusiasm of would-be miners. Nvidia's CFO, Colette Kress, discussed the trend in its fiscal first-quarter 2023 earnings release: \"Our GPUs are capable of cryptocurrency mining, though we have limited visibility into how much this impacts our overall GPU demand. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market -- such as the recent declines in cryptocurrency prices or changes in method of verifying transactions, including proof of work or proof of stake \u2013 can impact demand for our products and our ability to accurately estimate it.\"\nSome investors had used cryptocurrencies as a hedge against inflation, but with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates to combat rising inflation, other options like bonds have become more viable and created competition and potentially created a sell-off in crypto. Regardless of the real reason, depressed crypto values are likely to affect the enthusiasm for cryptocurrency mining and reduce demand for Nvidia's processing products. This could be a red flag for Nvidia for the rest of the calendar year.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA Price to Free Cash Flow data by YCharts\nNvidia's red flag is taking center stage in 2022, contributing to the 36% stock price drop year to date. That has created an opportunity for long-term investors to buy Nvidia at a price-to-earnings and price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 50 and 60, respectively. The stock is reasonably priced by historical standards. Considering its excellent long-term prospects, it wouldn't be a bad idea to pay a fair price for Nvidia stock right now.\u00a0\n\n\n\nParkev Tatevosian has positions in eBay.

All seven of the founder-led stocks to buy and hold forever are from this list.\nThe 21 founder-led CEOs range in age from 37 to 74, with an average age of 37. There are no female founder-led CEOs on the Fortune 500. Between 1999 and 2014, founder-led companies were said to outperform those that didn\u2019t have a founder in the CEO role by a factor of three.\u00a0\nOf the seven stocks listed below, two appear in the top 10 holdings of the Global X Founder-Run Companies ETF (CBOE:BOSS). Over the past five years, BOSS has generated an annualized total return of 11.08% through May 31. While it\u2019s not as good a return as the S&P 500, it\u2019s more than adequate.\u00a0\nFounders that lead their companies are more engaged in the job than outside hires. These seven founder-led stocks have what it takes to continue delivering for shareholders:\n\n\n\n\nTicker\nCompany\nPrice\n\n\nTSLA\nTesla, Inc.\n$664.63\n\n\nNVDA\nNvidia Corporation\n$160.74\n\n\nCRM\nSalesforce, Inc.\n$169.99\n\n\nBX\nBlackstone Inc.\n$100.92\n\n\nSTLD\nSteel Dynamics, Inc.\n$70.98\n\n\nSQ\nBlock, Inc.\n$64.77\n\n\nAPO\nApollo Global Management, Inc.\n$50.47\n\n\n\n\nFounder-Led Stocks to Buy: Tesla (TSLA)\n\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo say that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a founder-led stock is a bit of a misnomer.\u00a0While Elon Musk is very much the driving force at the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, the company was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in July 2003. Musk came along in April 2004, investing $6.35 million in Series A funding. He became CEO in October 2008.\u00a0\nAs for the company, it continues to deliver loads of EVs. In the first quarter of 2022, it delivered 310,048 EVs, most of which were the Model 3 and Model Y. As for profits, it generated $2.2 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, 660% higher than a year earlier. It has generated positive free cash flow in 11 of the past 12 quarters. It finished the quarter with $17.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet.\u00a0\u00a0\nTesla currently trades at 13.1x sales, higher than its five-year average, but lower than its multiple over the past couple of years.\u00a0\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nJensen Huang has been Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO since founding the company in 1993. Nvidia went public in January 1999 at $12 per share. Even though NVDA stock is down 41% year-t0-date, Huang has still managed to generate a cumulative total return of 23,156% since its initial public offering over 23 years ago.\u00a0\nIn January, I suggested that Nvidia stock could be one of 2022\u2019s best bets. While it hasn\u2019t worked out this way, the company continues to deliver great quarterly results. Even though it likely won\u2019t hit $400 in 2022, Huang remains entirely in control.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor the first time in the company\u2019s history, its data center revenue of $3.75 billion in Q1 2023 was higher than its gaming revenue of $3.62 billion. Its data center revenues grew 83% over Q1 2022 and 15% from Q4 2022. \u00a0 \u00a0\nNvidia trades at 16.3x sales, slightly less than its five-year average of 17.3. All of its major financial metrics are lower than in previous years due to its 2022 correction.\u00a0\nNVDA stock remains an excellent long-term buy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFounder-Led Stocks to Buy: Salesforce (CRM)\n\n\nSource: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) Co-CEO Marc Benioff founded the cloud-based software company in 1999. Benioff believes that companies have a responsibility to not only create great products, but also make a positive impact on the world. CNN Business named Benioff its top CEO of 2020.\u00a0\nRecently, as a result of the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, 4,000 Salesforce employees signed an open letter to Benioff and Co-CEO Bret Taylor, requesting that the company drop the National Rifle Association (NRA) as a customer.\u00a0\nI would think that Benioff would be open to meeting the employees\u2019 requests. In 2019, it banned customers from using its software if they were selling certain types of firearms.\u00a0\nDespite Benioff\u2019s focus on bettering the world, Salesforce\u2019s business hasn\u2019t suffered. In Q1 2023, its sales grew 24% year-over-year to $7.41 billion. On the bottom line, adjusted net income was $982 million, 14% lower than Q1 2022.\u00a0\nAs for free cash flow, it was $3.5 billion in the first quarter, 14% higher than a year earlier. Its free cash flow for the trailing 12 months through Q1 2023 is $5.7 billion, the highest in its history.\u00a0\n\nBlackstone (BX)\n\n\nSource: Isabelle OHara / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlackstone (NYSE:BX) was founded in 1985 by Steven Schwarzman and Pete Peterson. Both were former Lehman Brothers veterans. The company went public in 2007, selling $4 billion of its shares. Today, it\u2019s one of, if not the largest, alternative asset managers in the world, with $915 billion in assets under management.\u00a0\nSchwarzman remains CEO despite being well into his 70s. I guess if Warren Buffett can do it into his 90s, the Blackstone founder has lots of years ahead of him.\u00a0\nBlackstone\u2019s assets under management are invested under four primary platforms: Real Estate ($298 billion), Private Equity ($268 billion), Hedge Fund Solutions ($83 billion), and Credit & Insurance ($266 billion). Companies owned by its private equity business include Ancestry, Refinitiv, and SERVPRO.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the last 12 months through the first quarter, its net income was $5.3 billion, 38% higher than a year earlier. Its assets at the end of the first quarter were 41% higher than a year earlier, as well.\u00a0\nBlackstone is one heck of a fee-generating machine.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFounder-Led Stocks to Buy: Steel Dynamics (STLD)\u00a0\n\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCurrent CEO Mark Millett co-founded Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) in 1993. He has been CEO since January 2012 and owns 1.5% of the company\u2019s stock.\u00a0\nThe steel maker produced lots of records in Q1 2022, including record steel shipments, net sales, operating income and net income. It also had record cash flow in the quarter, providing it with free cash to buy back its shares. It bought back 3% of its stock in Q1 2022 alone.\u00a0\nThere is no question the company is benefiting from high steel prices. In Q1 2022, it got $1,561 per ton of steel, 50% higher than a year earlier.\u00a0\u00a0\nHow can you tell that the business is operating at maximum efficiency? The five-year average free cash flow between 2016 and 2021 was $1.5 billion, almost 3x the five-year average between 2011 and 2015.\u00a0With the company\u2019s new Texas electric arc furnace flat roll steel mill up and running, it\u2019s expected to grow its annual steel production by 25%. That will lead to even greater free cash flow in the years to come.\n\nBlock (SQ)\n\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey co-founded the company in July 2009. In April 2022, his title changed from CEO to Block Head. Dorsey also served as CEO of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) before stepping down in November 2021. In May, he also stepped down from the social media platform\u2019s board.\u00a0\nIn December, I suggested that Dorsey focusing solely on Block would pay dividends for shareholders. Down 55% year-to-date, SQ stock hasn\u2019t cooperated so far. In the long-term, I have no doubt Dorsey will deliver for shareholders.\u00a0\nNorthStar Asset Management, a Block shareholder, has proposed that the company give up its super-voting shares. It will be voted on at the company\u2019s mid-June shareholder\u2019s meeting. It was on last year\u2019s annual meeting vote, but only got 20% support.\u00a0\nAlthough Dorsey and co-founder Jim McKelvey own less than 11% of Block stock, they control more than 48% because of the dual-class share structure. As we\u2019ve seen with Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), it can be a hot-button issue with shareholders.\nI continue to believe that Dorsey has the financial technology company on the right road.\u00a0\n\nFounder-Led Stocks to Buy: Apollo Global Management (APO)\u00a0\n\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock\n\nApollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) CEO Marc Rowan co-founded the high-growth alternative asset manager in 1990. At the end of March, it had $513 billion in assets under management, with its Yield business accounting for 73% of those assets.\u00a0\nThe company believes that a properly constructed investment portfolio should include 20% to 30% of its assets in alternatives, with equities and fixed income accounting for 40% and 30%, respectively.\u00a0\nOver the next five years, Apollo expects to double its assets under management to $1 trillion, with a majority of those assets focused on its Yield business. In fiscal-year 2022, it expects fee-related earnings of $1.4 billion, with a total adjusted net income of $3.3 billion or $5.50 a share.

Somehow, a 1,600-square-foot penthouse apartment with a lofted upper level made it into the 21st century with the potential of spectacular park and skyline views mostly unrealized.\nThe apartment is surrounded on three sides by terraces totaling 2,300 square feet, so perhaps views from inside were considered less important. But that\u2019s not how the apartment\u2019s current owners, a couple who bought the space as a pied-\u00e0-terre, then decided to make it their primary residence, saw it.\n\u201cThe main goal of the clients was to maximize views,\u201d said Kim Letven, a partner in Lower Manhattan-based NV/design.architecture, which undertook what became a major renovation. \nClose\n\nBrooklyn in Your InboxStay up to date with more great news and articles like this one.\nThank you for subscribing!\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTerms of Service apply.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSign Up\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore The Insider\nFind your Brooklyn design inspiration\n\n\nThe project began modestly. Initially, there was only a steep, narrow stair to the upper level. \u201cWe were originally brought in just to do a new stair,\u201d said Letven. \u201cThe scope grew to every single thing in the entire apartment.\u201d NV/da enlarged some window openings and added new ones, took down the dividing wall between the dining and living rooms to create one open space with three exposures, removed a dropped ceiling on the upper level and created decorative coffers around existing structural beams. They also laid new floors of reclaimed wood, and created a luxurious custom kitchen and three new baths \u2014 all the way down to new moldings, wainscoting and even radiator covers.\nExterior work on the terraces was a key part of the project. Most impressive was the re-creation of Beaux Arts-style ornamental elements around three new French doors leading to the terrace (top photo). \u201cThe motifs for the door casings and surrounds are borrowed from the building\u2019s existing motifs,\u201d said Richard Stora, an associate at the firm who served as project manager. \u201cWe made a mold from a digital scan\u201d of those decorative elements, he said, then fabricated them of GFRC [glass fiber reinforced concrete], further enhancing them with hand-carving.\nThough the architects made changes to the building fa\u00e7ade, \u201cWe got a little bit lucky,\u201d Letven said. \u201cThe historic district jogs around the building, so we didn\u2019t have to go through Landmarks.\u201d\nFurnishings belong to the homeowners.\n\n\nIn the living room, an existing wood-burning fireplace was converted to gas, with a marble mantel imported from Jamb in London.\nThe flooring is antique reclaimed French oak with a dark fumed finish, laid in a herringbone pattern.\n\nThe architects enlarged existing window openings at either end of the main living space, inserting new sliders of Vitrocsa structural glass leading to terraces on both sides. \u201cWith structural glass, the frames can be extremely small, to get the most out of the views,\u201d Letven said.\nThe window at the head of the dining table is a new insertion.\n\n\nThe L-shaped kitchen has custom cabinetry with an antique finish, countertops and backsplash of Calacatta Borghini marble, a hammered copper stove hood and a floor made of century-old reclaimed limestone.\n\nOne of two bedrooms on the penthouse\u2019s lower level retains the existing sliding doors, the only such original glass left in the apartment.\n\nA gracious new staircase to the upper level replaced an inadequate existing one. A new steel window frames the view at the top.\n\n\nA new coffered ceiling and newly enlarged windows and doors vastly improved the lofted upper level, an open bedroom/study comprising about 350 square feet.\nThis had been an unappealing throwaway space, hard as that may be to believe. \u201cThe tower level wasn\u2019t used,\u201d said Sorta. \u201cThe windows were very small and it had a small metal door. We enlarged all the openings\u201d to take full advantage of the expansive terrace, city views and big sky.\n\nThe subway-tile walls in one of three new bathrooms are trimmed with Calacatta marble.\n\nOne of three elaborate pediments created by NV/da of lightweight concrete tops a new steel-and-glass French door.\nThe brickwork and cornice along the roofline are original to the building. The round porthole window belongs not to the apartment but to a machine room above.\n\nWhat looks like a castle turret is a functional flue shared by building residents.\n[Photos by Regan Wood]\nThe Insider\u00a0is Brownstoner\u2019s weekly in-depth look at a notable interior design/renovation project, by design journalist\u00a0Cara Greenberg.

Co-Author | Jakir HossainMentioned: Analog Devices Inc (ADI), Intel Corp (INTC), Microchip Technology Inc (MCHP), Monolithic Power Systems Inc (MPWR), NVIDIA Corp (NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSM)Semiconductor companies have been ground zero for some of the biggest supply chain disruptions of the past two years and, along with other technology stocks, have taken it on the chin in 2022.Those declines, however, have created the best buying opportunity in roughly a decade for some of the industry\u2019s biggest names.Shares in Taiwan Semiconductor\u00a0(TSM)\u00a0and Nvidia\u00a0(NVDA)\u2014whose products power much of the technology in the modern world\u2014are changing hands at their lowest price/fair value estimate in nine years, according to Morningstar's equity analysts.These attractive valuations come as the result of steep losses in semiconductor stocks in recent months.\u00a0The Morningstar Global Semiconductors Index, which measures the performance of companies that design, manufacture, and market microchips and microprocessors, is down 23% for this year, having bottomed out in May at 30% below its 2021 closing price. Semiconductor stocks fell alongside the broader technology stocks group, with the Morningstar US Technology Index dropping 22.7% this year versus the Morningstar US Market Index, which is down 14.7%.\u201cRelative to historic levels, we\u2019re seeing a healthy pullback in the semiconductor space\u2014it\u2019s a good opportunity for long-term investors,\u201d says Abhinav Davuluri,\u00a0Morningstar's equity sector strategist for semiconductors and technology.But given an unusually high level of uncertainty about the outlook heading into 2023, Davuluri says investors should focus on companies with the strongest competitive advantages.Of the 23 companies under analyst coverage in the Morningstar Global Semiconductors Index, three are currently trading at\u00a05-star discount prices. At the beginning of the year, there wasn\u2019t a single company from the index in that category. On top of that, an additional 13 companies under coverage are undervalued but at less-cheap, 4-star prices. None of the companies in the semiconductor index are trading at levels that Morningstar analysts consider overvalued.Another measure of valuations\u2014price/earnings ratios\u2014are also lower than usual for most semiconductor companies.\u201cP/Es are a lot lower than they were last year and the cheapest we\u2019ve seen in three or four years,\u201d Davuluri says. The Morningstar Global Semiconductor Index\u2019s latest P/E ratio is 15.18, down from 21.7 one year ago. It is currently the lowest it has been since 2019. Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s trailing 12-month P/E ratio is currently at 22.2, its lowest in about three years. Intel\u2019s is at 7.4, the lowest it has been in more than 10 years. Davuluri says the market tends to overshoot on the high end when there\u2019s good news and fall too far with bad news.\u201cAs the market gets more comfortable, we expect that P/E ratios will not fluctuate as much.\u201dWhen will the chip shortage end?A key driver for semiconductors has been the severe supply chain constraints.\u00a0Demand for chips skyrocketed at the start of the pandemic as the shift to remote work increased the need for computers for those working from home. At the same time, companies producing those chips shut down factories because of the virus, leading to rapidly depleting inventory and lower manufacturing output.The concentration of the semiconductor market in Asia did little to help matters, as companies on the other side of the world struggled to get new chips to customers on time. Chipmakers also prioritized lucrative state-of-the-art chips, leading to further delays for less advanced chips that are used for products such as automobiles, networking hardware, and industrial machinery.The tide is changing, albeit slightly. Demand for personal computers is slowing, according to Davuluri, and semiconductor manufacturers can free up capacity for less advanced chips. Essential materials required for production also remain a concern, with the Russia-Ukraine war\u00a0putting critical materials like neon in jeopardy.\u201cIt's difficult to say exactly when the shortage will end,\u201d Davuluri says. \u201cBut exiting this year, we think the overall chip market will be in a better supply/demand situation. Though there could be some end markets like automotive that take a little longer to get back into balance.\u201dWhat is the long-term outlook for semiconductors?\u201cOur main thesis is that the semiconductor industry is not as cyclical as it has been historically,\u201d says Davuluri. \u201cEverything is going to be connected to the internet\u2014household devices, cars, farm equipment, wearable tech. It\u2019s the semiconductor chips that enable all these things to be \u2018smart.\u2019 These developments are providing a massive wave of demand. The proliferation of big data and AI is going to require\u00a0everything\u00a0to have a chip in it.\u201dAnd on top of that, the behemoth markets of personal computers and smartphones won't go away. As some markets ebb, the others will flow, Davuluri says, leading to smoother results and less sporadic performance for semiconductor stocks.Another current factor in the space is the increased push toward national sovereignty. \u201cToday, 70%-80% of chips are made on China\u2019s doorstep, in Taiwan and South Korea. Players in the US and Europe aren\u2019t very comfortable with that. There\u2019s a massive push from governments, with the Chips [for America] Act in the US and comparable subsidies in Europe, to provide funding and investments to build up more fabrication labs and factories on US and European soil.\u201d Intel has already begun projects to build factories in Arizona and Ohio, and other companies are following suit.Long-term performance\u201cMany of these companies are still seeing very, very strong financial performance,\u201d Davuluri says. \u201cBut our expectation is that there will be some slowdown or correction in 2023. That\u2019s natural after this high peak, when all areas of the market have been very hot over the past few years.\u201dOver the past five years, the Morningstar Global Semiconductor Index has gained 172%\u2014more than double the growth of the Morningstar US Market Index, which grew 80% during that time. Semiconductor stocks even outshone the high-flying Morningstar US Technology Index, which grew 153% over the past five years.Which semiconductor stocks are a buy?\u201cFor investors, we are cautious because the market is expecting some downturn or slowdown in 2023,\u201d says Davuluri. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear whether these undervalued semiconductor companies might fall more. That\u2019s why we favor the names with wide economic moats that are better able to handle a lot of volatility.\u201dThe Morningstar Economic Moat Rating\u00a0is a Morningstar analyst-assessed designation that represents a company's durable competitive advantage. A company with a wide economic moat is expected to fend off competition and earn high returns on capital over the next 20 years or longer. Here are the wide-moat stocks in the Morningstar Global Semiconductors Index that are currently trading below their fair value estimates:Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u00a0(TSM)\u201cWe believe TSMC\u2019s wide moat stems from its cost advantage and intangible assets, which are realized from its leading position in process technology, or nodes. TSMC\u2019s long-standing leadership in process advancement comes from its ability to correctly and consistently prioritize the right areas in which to innovate for nodes, while maintain fiscal discipline. Process technology leadership not only enables TSMC to improve power, (faster) performance and (smaller) area, or PPA, and the cost of each chip, which are critical for the performance of computing devices, but also justifies higher prices than its peers. As such, we believe that its leading position in the advanced processes will contribute to 1) attracting and retaining more customers, 2) more stable utilization of ever-expanding production capacities and lower production costs, 3) generating a higher return than its peers because of the cost advantage, and as a result, 4) ensuring sufficient profits to fund research and development, or R&D, and capital expenditures on subsequent nodes. This virtuous cycle of intangible assets brought by heavy R&D and cost advantages brought by better PPA reinforce each other, preventing smaller peers catching up, in our view. In fact, we acknowledge TSMC has been leading nodes' advancement and maintaining over 50% market share since the early 2000s, and its gross and operating margins have been at least twice as much as that of its closest peers for years.\u201d\u2014Phelix Lee, equity analystIntel\u00a0(INTC)\u201cWe believe Intel\u2019s wide moat emanates from its superior cost advantages realized in the design and manufacturing of its cutting-edge microprocessors and intangible assets related to its x86 instruction set architecture license and chip design expertise. While the firm has endured significant delays in deploying its latest 10-nanometer process technology, which has allowed foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) to leapfrog Intel and AMD to become more competitive via TSMC\u2019s 7-nm process, Intel\u2019s manufacturing advantage over virtually every other chip designer and manufacturer is still intact and durable. Between Intel\u2019s x86 dominance in PC and server CPUs (85%-plus market share in aggregate, per Mercury Research) and aggressive focus on new chip opportunities (AI, automotive, 5G, and so on) we think that excess returns on capital are likely with near certainty over the next decade and it is more likely than not that the chip titan earns excess returns on invested capital over the next 20 years.\u201d\u2014Abhinav Davuluri, equity sector strategistMonolithic Power Systems\u00a0(MPWR)\u201cWe think Monolithic Power Systems boasts a wide economic moat, as a result of intangible assets in analog chip design and switching costs for its integrated power management chips. In our view, these will enable the firm to average returns on invested capital in excess of its weighted average cost of capital over the next 20 years.\u201cWhile digital integrated circuits process digital inputs\u2014sequences of 1s and 0s\u2014into digital outputs, analog chips process continuous real-world signals into a digital output. The priority in digital semiconductors is packing ever-smaller chips with more transistors using cutting-edge manufacturing in pursuit of Moore\u2019s Law, but analog design uses lagging-edge manufacturing, with customers prioritizing reliability, accuracy, and precision. In the case of Monolithic Power\u2019s bread and butter of power management, power management integrated circuits regulate incoming electricity\u2014with varying voltage and current\u2014to produce a stable electrical output to safely power a device. It is our view that power management discrete transistors\u2014like metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors and insulated gate bipolar transistors\u2014are generally less differentiated and more commoditylike than other semiconductor applications, but Monolithic\u2019s focus on highly integrated power management chips helps create a differentiated product with a compelling value proposition.\u201d\u2014William Kerwin, equity analystMicrochip Technology\u00a0(MCHP)\u201cWe believe that Microchip has a wide economic moat. Moats for analog and microcontroller, or MCU, chipmakers, such as Microchip, tend to come from intangible assets around proprietary chip designs and manufacturing expertise, as well as switching costs that make it difficult to swap out analog and MCU chips for competing offerings once they are designed into a given electronic device. Given Microchip\u2019s track record of stellar profitability in recent years and ability to retain its leadership position in MCUs while expanding its analog business, we think it is more likely than not that Microchip will earn on excess capital over the next 20 years.\u201cLooking at intangible assets, leading analog and MCU chipmakers face stringent quality requirements in some end markets, such as the automotive space, for example, where defects can only be tolerated as infrequently as one part per million. Although the analog and MCU chip industries are quite fragmented, it would be difficult for any new entrant to achieve this level of quality while still satisfying high-volume production. Furthermore, Microchip\u2019s 8-bit MCUs are based on its proprietary PIC architecture, and although the MCU industry is fairly fragmented and MCUs, by definition, perform simple processing functions, we think there is a bit of uniqueness to Microchip\u2019s designs. We also see similar distinctiveness in the firm\u2019s AVR-based MCUs acquired from Atmel.\u201d\u2014Brian Colello, equity sector directorNvidia\u00a0(NVDA)\u201cWe believe Nvidia possesses a wide economic moat stemming from its intangible assets related to the design of graphics processing units, or GPUs. The firm is the originator of and leader in discrete graphics, having captured the lion\u2019s share of the market from longtime rival AMD. We think the market has significant barriers to entry in the form of advanced intellectual property, as even chip leader Intel was unable to develop its own discrete GPUs (despite its vast resources) and ultimately needed to license IP from Nvidia to integrate GPUs into its PC chipsets (though more recently Intel is vying to develop its own discrete GPU). To stay at the cutting edge of GPU technology, Nvidia has a large R&D budget relative to AMD and smaller GPU suppliers that allows it to continuously innovate and fuel a virtuous cycle for its high-margin chips.\u201d\u2014Abhinav Davuluri, equity sector strategistAnalog Devices\u00a0(ADI)\u201cWe believe that ADI has a wide economic moat, thanks to intangible assets around proprietary analog chip design and manufacturing expertise, as well as switching costs that make it difficult to swap out analog chips for competing offerings once they are designed into a given electronic device. We are confident the firm is more likely than not to generate excess returns on capital over the next 20 years.\u201cThe analog chip space is highly fragmented, but ADI is the only firm with a substantial market share lead in any subsegment of the business. The firm has nearly 50% share of the data converter analog chip market, and these chips are widely used in communications infrastructure equipment, in particular, as they convert analog voice signals to digital signals for processing, and vice versa. We believe that ADI will retain its relatively dominant position in converters over time.\u201d\u2014Brian Colello, equity sector director\u00a0NVIDIASEMICONDUCTORSSTOCK IDEASTECHNOLOGYAUTHORLauren Solberg\u00a0is a data journalist at Morningstar Inc.Jakir Hossainis a data Journalist for Morningstar.SHARE THIS ARTICLE Article Page URL has been copied to clipboard for sharing.

The graphics card will be replacing the RTX 3060, a very popular gaming graphics card in the $300-$400 US segment.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Graphics Card - Purely Designed For Enthusiast Gamers\n[Updated- 04/09/22]\nWhile there's no denying the enthusiasm around the higher-end GeForce RTX 4090, GeForce RTX 4080 & GeForce RTX 4070 series graphics cards that offer the best of the best gaming performance, the RTX 4060 series graphics cards will be designed around the $300-$400 US segment which is a mainstream price range that still offers lots of performance at hand. It's simple, the RTX 4090 series will be aimed at users who want the best of the best without worrying about the amount of money they are spending while the RTX 4080 series is aimed at users who want the best performance at the best possible price. The RTX 4070 will be the sweet spot for high-end gaming, while the RTX 4060 is designed for the gaming masses at a price that will be hard to ignore given its performance.\nThe previous GeForce RTX 3060 was touted to offer a huge improvement over the RTX 2080 SUPER. The card did end up meeting its promised performance target but was at most a 25-30% boost when compared to the RTX 2060 SUPER. This was mainly due to the fact that the RTX 2060 SUPER was already an upgraded version of the RTX 2060. But ever since the RTX 20 series, the RTX 30 got its own Ti and Non-Ti flavors.\n\nThe RTX 3060 Ti was around 30% faster than the RTX 3060. The RTX 3060 Ti was also 30% faster than the RTX 2060 SUPER and 40-45% faster than the standard RTX 2060. The RTX 3060 Non-Ti on the other hand was around 10% faster than the RTX 2060 SUPER and 20% faster than the RTX 2060 Non-SUPER graphics card. So based on the performance, the RTX 3060 Ti was indeed faster but also more expensive but still ended up delivering better value versus its predecessor.\nFor example, the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 2060 SUPER both had an MSRP of $399 US but the 3060 Ti offered 30% faster performance. Meanwhile, the RTX 3060 Non-Ti was $20 US cheaper than the RTX 2060 Non-SUPER but offered a 20% performance boost. Since the RTX 3060 never launched with a Founders Edition variant, most of the models retailed at $15-$20 US more so at the end of the day, you were getting the same price as the RTX 2060 Non-SUPER with a 20% uplift.\nThe one thing NVIDIA did to persuade the gaming crowd to get its RTX 3060 graphics card equipped with 12 GB of memory versus the 8 GB on the RTX 3060 Ti. That didn't change the performance much since the card featured a lowly 192-bit bus versus the 256-bit bus of the Ti variant, ending up with lower bandwidth.\nWe should expect similar things with the next-generation gaming solution too but an important factor to consider is that GPUs are becoming more power-hungry and more pricey. It is a trend that might continue into the future as we get better products but in return, there's always a cost to pay for end consumers. So starting with what we know so far, first we should take a look at the brand new Ada Lovelace or AD10* class GPUs that will be powering the next-gen GeForce RTX 40 series cards.\nYou can also read the expected specs, prices, and performance of other upcoming RTX 40 GPUs in the posts below:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Series\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Series\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Series\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 Series\n\nNVIDIA's AD106 'Ada Lovelace' GPU - The Next-Gen Mainstream Chip\nStarting with the GPU configuration, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 series graphics cards may utilize both AD104 and AD106 GPUs. The reason is the same as the situation with the current GeForce RTX 30 series where the RTX 3060 Ti is based on the GA104 GPU and the RTX 3060 is based on the GA106 GPU. We have already detailed the AD104 GPU here so let's take a look at the AD106 GPU & what it has to offer. The GPU is said to measure around 200mm2 and will utilize the TSMC 4N process node which is an optimized version of TSMC's 5nm (N5) node designed for the green team.\n\nThe NVIDIA Ada Lovelace AD106 GPU is expected to feature up to 3 GPC (Graphics Processing Clusters). This is the same GPC count as the GA106 GPU. Each GPU will consist of 6 TPCs and 2 SMs which is the same configuration as the existing chip. Each SM (Streaming Multiprocessor) will house four sub-cores which is also the same as the GA106 GPU. What's changed is the FP32 & the INT32 core configuration. Each sub-core will include 128 FP32 units but combined FP32+INT32 units will go up to 192. This is because the FP32 units don't share the same sub-core as the IN32 units. The 128 FP32 cores are separate from the 64 INT32 cores.\nSo in total, each sub-core will consist of 32 FP32 plus 16 INT32 units for a total of 48 units. Each SM will have a total of 128 FP32 units plus 64 INT32 units for a total of 192 units. And since there are a total of 36 SM units (12 per GPC), we are looking at 4,608 FP32 Units and 2,304 INT32 units for a total of 6,912 cores. Each SM will also include two Wrap Schedules (32 thread/CLK) for 64 wraps per SM. This is a 50% increase on the cores (FP32+INT32) and a 33% increase in Wraps/Threads vs the GA102 GPU.\nNVIDIA AD103 'Ada Lovelace' Gaming GPU 'SM' Block Diagram (Image Credits: Kopite7kimi):\n\nMoving over to the cache, this is another segment where NVIDIA has given a big boost over the existing Ampere GPUs. The Ada Lovelace GPUs will pack 192 KB of L1 cache per SM, an increase of 50% over Ampere. The L2 cache will be increased to 32 MB as mentioned in the leaks. This is a 10.6x increase over the Ampere GA106 GPU that hosts just 3 MB of L2 cache. The cache will be shared across the GPU.\nFinally, we have the ROPs which will stick to 16 per GPC. You are looking at up to 48 ROPs, the same as the current GA106 GPUs. There are also going to be the latest 4th Generation Tensor and 3rd Generation RT (Raytracing) cores infused on the Ada Lovelace GPUs which will help boost DLSS & Raytracing performance to the next level. Overall, the Ada Lovelace AD106 GPU will offer:\n\nSame Number of GPCs as GA106 GPU\n+20% Cores vs GA106 GPU\n50% More L1 Cache (Versus Ampere GA106)\nOver 10x L2 Cache (Versus Ampere GA106)\nSame Number of ROPs (Versus Ampere GA106)\n4th Gen Tensor & 3rd Gen RT Cores\n\nNVIDIA AD106 'Ada Lovelace' Gaming GPU Block Diagram Mock-Up (Image Credits: SemiAnalysis):\n\nDo note that clock speeds, which are said to be between the 2-3 GHz range, aren't taken into the equation so they will also play a major role in improving the per-core performance versus Ampere.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Series Preliminary Specs:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAD104-400?AD104-400?Ampere GA104-400Ampere GA104-300\n\n\nProcess NodeTSMC 4NTSMC 4NSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie Size~300mm2~300mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBDTBD17.4 Billion17.4 Billion\n\n\nPCBNVIDIA PG141-SKU331NVIDIA PG141-310 SKU341NVIDIA PG141NVIDIA PG142\n\n\nCUDA Cores~7680~768061445888\n\n\nTMUs / ROPsTBD / 160TBD / 160192/ 96184 / 96\n\n\nTensor / RT CoresTBD / TBDTBD / TBD192/ 48184 / 46\n\n\nBase ClockTBDTBD1575 MHz1500 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock~2.6 GHz~2.5 GHz1770 MHz1730 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute~40 TFLOPs~38 TFLOPs22 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPsTBDTBD42 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPsTBDTBD174 TOPs163 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity12 GB GDDR6X?12 GB GDDR6X?8 GB GDDR6X8 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus192-bit192-bit256-bit256-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed21 Gbps21 Gbps19 Gbps14 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth504 GB/s504 GB/s608 Gbps448 Gbps\n\n\nTBP~400W285W?290W220W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$599 US?$499 US?$599 US$499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)2022202210th June 202129th October 2020\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Graphics Cards Specifications\nAs we saw with the GeForce RTX 3060 series, NVIDIA can have two distinct configurations of the RTX 4060 series graphics cards. We realistically expect there to be two variants, the RTX 4060 and the RTX 4060 Ti. The existing generation saw the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3060 release a few months apart and this is known to be a volume segment so NVIDIA will take the advantage to position two solutions, one around $300-$350 and one around $400-$450 US at mainstream gamers right off the bat.\nCurrently, there's no telling if the AD104 GPU will be utilized within the GeForce RTX 4060 series and as such, we will focus on the standard RTX 4060 which will utilize the AD106 GPU.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 'Expected' Specifications\nBased on NVIDIA's decision to do a mix of AD104/AD106 or go AD106 across its RTX 4060 series lineup we can either see a cut-down RTX 4060 or one with a full configuration whereas the Ti can use a cut-down AD104 configuration. The AD106 GPU will come packed with 32 MB of L2 cache and up to 48 ROPs.\nThe clock speeds are not confirmed yet but considering that the TSMC 4N process is being used, we are expecting clocks between the 2.0-3.0 GHz range. The higher than usual clock speed bump comes from the fact that NVIDIA is making a two-node jump considering the Ampere GPUs with Samsung 8nm node was in reality a 10nm process node with some optimizations. NVIDIA is skipping 7nm and going straight for a 5nm node and not even the vanilla variant but an optimized version of it. With Pascal on the TSMC 16nm node, NVIDIA delivered a huge frequency leap and we can expect a similar jump this time around too.\n\nI don't care about the real release date. I'm just curious about the performance of RTX 4060, which consumes more power than RTX 3070.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) June 5, 2022\n\nAs for memory specs, the GeForce RTX 4060 is expected to rock 8 GB GDDR6X capacities that might come at faster 20+ Gbps speeds across a 128-bit bus interface for over 320 GB/s of bandwidth. The 'Ti' variant, if it ends up with an AD104 GPU, could offer up to 12 GB of memory across a 192-bit bus interface. The GeForce RTX 4060 graphics card is also said to rock a TGP of 220W which is an increase of 30% over the RTX 3060 and a 10% increase over the RTX 3060 Ti. This is a massive TGP increase and the performance needs to be really good for NVIDIA to keep its efficiency numbers up.\n\nAs for its feature set, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 graphics cards will rock all the modern NV feature sets such as the latest 4th Gen Tensor Cores, 3rd gen RT cores, and the latest NVENC Encoder, and NVCDEC Decoder, and support for the latest APIs. They will pack all the modern RTX features such as DLSS, Reflex, Broadcast, Resizable-BAR, Freestyle, Ansel, Highlights, Shadowplay, and G-SYNC support too.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Series Preliminary Specs:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAda Lovelace AD104?Ada Lovelace AD106Ampere GA104-200Ampere GA106-300\n\n\nProcess NodeTSCM 4NTSCM 4NSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie Size~300mm2~200mm2395.2mm2TBC\n\n\nTransistorsTBDTBD17.4 BillionTBC\n\n\nCUDA Cores5120?460848643584\n\n\nTMUs / ROPsTBD / 64TBD / 48152 / 80112 / 64\n\n\nTensor / RT CoresTBDTBD152 / 38112 / 28\n\n\nBase ClockTBDTBD1410 MHz1320 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock2.2-2.6 GHz2.2-2.6 GHz1665 MHz1780 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute~24 TFLOPs~21 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs13 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPsTBDTBD32 TFLOPs25 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPsTBDTBD192 TOPs101 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity12 GB GDDR6?8 GB GDDR6?8 GB GDDR612 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus192-bit128-bit256-bit192-bit\n\n\nMemory SpeedTBDTBD14 Gbps16 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth>448 GB/s>320 GB/s448 Gbps384 Gbps\n\n\nTGP~265W~220W175W170W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)~$399 US~$329 US$399 US$329 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)1H 20231H 20232nd December 202025th February 2021\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Graphics Cards Performance\nAs for the performance of the gaming GPUs, we can only use theoretical numbers here since the launch is a bit far away but based on what we know, the RTX 40 series cards might be the first gaming cards to hit the 100 TFLOPs compute horsepower limit.\nJust for comparison's sake:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti: ~103 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.8 GHz clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090: ~90 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.8 GHz clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080: ~50 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti: 40 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.86 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti: ~38 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070: ~36 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090: 36 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.69 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080: 30 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.71 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti: 22 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.77 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GForce RTX 4060: 20 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assiming 2.2 GHz clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070: 20 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.72 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti: 16 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.65 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060: 13 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.77 GHz Boost clock)\n\nBased on a theoretical clock speed of 2.2 GHz, you get up to 20 TFLOPs of compute performance and the rumors are suggesting even higher boost clocks. Now, these are definitely sounding like peak clocks, similar to AMD's peak frequencies which are higher than the average 'Game' clock. A 20+ TFLOPs compute performance means more performance on a '60-class' GPU than a '70-class flagship' which will be a good bump. But one should keep in mind that compute performance doesn't necessarily indicate the overall gaming performance.\n\n\nFP32 Compute Horsepower Comparisons (Higher is Better)\n\nCompute Power\n\n\n020406080100120\n\n\n\n\n\n020406080100120\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090 Ti (Theoretical)\n\n100\n\n\nRTX 4090 (Theoretical)\n\n90\n\n\nRTX 4080 (Theoretical)\n\n50\n\n\nRTX 3090 Ti\n\n40\n\n\nRTX 4070 Ti\n\n38\n\n\nRTX 4070\n\n36\n\n\nRTX 3090\n\n36\n\n\nRTX 3080\n\n30\n\n\nRX 6900 XTX\n\n25\n\n\nRTX 3070 Ti\n\n22\n\n\nRTX 4060 (Theoretical)\n\n20\n\n\nRTX 3070\n\n20\n\n\nRTX 3060 Ti\n\n16\n\n\nRTX 3060\n\n13\n\n\n\u00a0 Xbox Series X\n\n12\n\n\nPlayStation 5\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will be around a\u00a054% compute performance uplift for the GeForce RTX 4060 graphics card versus its predecessor and this is without even factoring in the RT and Tensor core performance which is expected to get major lifts too in their respective department. Now FLOPs aren't necessarily reflective of the graphics or gaming performance but they do provide a metric that can be used for comparison.\n\nGamers should expect great 1080p and even 1440p gaming to be buttery smooth on these graphics cards and with DLSS. The '60' series has always been targeted at premium 1080p & mainstream 1440p gaming but expect these cards to be really popular amongst eSports with technologies such as Reflex, DLSS, and various streaming capabilities at a mainstream price point.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Graphics Cards Price & Availability\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 was launched at $329 US while the RTX 3060 Ti was launched at 399 US. We can expect NVIDIA to retain the same prices for these cards with a $10-$20 US pricing adjustment here and there.\nNVIDIA really needs to secure more gamers in the $300-$400 US segment but they have to deliver a product that's worth the price. The RTX 3060 Ti was a decent product while the RTX 3060 proved very competitive against the AMD Radeon RX 6600 series. Now it will be up to NVIDIA to decide if they want to retain the position of the mainstream-king or go a route that will not be in the interest of gamers and themselves, alike.\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards are rumored for a Q3 reveal and a launch is expected in Q4 2022 so we will know for sure what NVIDIA is up to in the next few months.\nNVIDIA GeForce GPU Segment/Tier Prices\n\n\n\nGraphics Segment2023-20242022-20232021-20222020-20212019-20202018-20192017-20182016-20172014-2016\n\n\n\n\nTitan TierGeForce RTX 4090GeForce RTX 4090GeForce RTX 3090 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3090GeForce RTX 3090Titan RTX (Turing)Titan V (Volta)Titan Xp (Pascal)Titan X (Pascal)Titan X (Maxwell)\n\n\nPrice$1599 US$1599 US$1999 US\n$1499 US$1499 US$2499 US$2999 US$1199 US$1199 US$999 US\n\n\nUltra Enthusiast TierGeForce RTX 4080 SUPERGeForce RTX 4080GeForce RTX 3080 TiGeForce RTX 3080 TiGeForce RTX 2080 TiGeForce RTX 2080 TiGeForce GTX 1080 TiGeForce GTX 980 TiGeForce GTX 980 Ti\n\n\nPrice$999 US$1199 US$1199 US$1199 US$999 US$999 US$699 US$649 US$649 US\n\n\nEnthusiast TierGeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPERGeForce RTX 4070 TiGeForce RTX 3080 12 GBGeForce RTX 3080 10 GBGeForce RTX 2080 SUPERGeForce RTX 2080GeForce GTX 1080GeForce GTX 1080GeForce GTX 980\n\n\nPrice$799 US$799 US$799 US$699 US$699 US$699 US$549 US$549 US$549 US\n\n\nHigh-End TierGeForce RTX 4070 SUPER\nGeForce RTX 4070GeForce RTX 4070\nGeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16 GBGeForce RTX 3070 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3070GeForce RTX 3070 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3070GeForce RTX 2070 SUPERGeForce RTX 2070GeForce GTX 1070GeForce GTX 1070GeForce GTX 970\n\n\nPrice$599\n$549$599 US\n$499 US$599\n$499$599\n$499$499 US$499 US$379 US$379 US$329 US\n\n\nMainstream TierGeForce RTX 4060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 4060GeForce RTX 4060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 4060GeForce RTX 3060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3060 12 GBGeForce RTX 3060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3060 12 GBGeForce RTX 2060 SUPER\nGeForce RTX 2060\nGeForce GTX 1660 Ti\nGeForce GTX 1660 SUPER\nGeForce GTX 1660GeForce GTX 1060GeForce GTX 1060GeForce GTX 1060GeForce GTX 960\n\n\nPrice$449\n$299$399 US\n$299 US$399 US\n$329 US$399 US\n$329 US$399 US\n$349 US\n$279 US\n$229 US\n$219 US$249 US$249 US$249 US$199 US\n\n\nEntry TierRTX 3050 8 GB\nRTX 3050 6 GBRTX 3050RTX 3050GTX 1650 SUPER\nGTX 1650GTX 1650 SUPER\nGTX 1650GTX 1050 Ti\nGTX 1050GTX 1050 Ti\nGTX 1050GTX 950GTX 750 Ti\nGTX 750\n\n\nPrice$229\n$179$249 US$249 US$159 US\n$149 US$159 US\n$149 US$139 US\n$109 US$139 US\n$109 US$149 US$149 US\n$119 US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series graphics card are you looking forward to the most?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti (48 GB 600W)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 (24 GB 450W)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 (16 GB 340W)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 (12 GB 285W)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 (8 GB 235W)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 (8 GB 150W)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n86\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n46\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs;

The RTX 4090 is rumored to be a strong entry of the company after a leaker spilled out some information about it.Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU Leak\n\n\nAccording to the tipsters, the upcoming Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU could beat AMD when it comes to performance.\nNana Dua from Unsplash\n\n\nOK, let's do a new summary. RTX 4090, AD102-300, 16128FP32, 21Gbps 24G GDDR6X, 450W, ~2x3090. I am disappointed with RDNA3. That's all.\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) May 16, 2022\n  As Techradar spotted via kopite7kimi, a well-known computer hardware tipster, the Nvidia 4090 GPU could potentially sport 128 multiprocessors.It is expected that the Lovelace graphics card will be much better than RTX 3090 when it comes to overall performance.That's not the only thing that's impressive with this GPU.Another prominent leaker RedGamingTech who usually posts stuff on YouTube said that the RTX 4090 could allegedly come in September, according to the sources that he heard about.Following this launch, the RTX 4090 eyes October release, while the RTX 4070 could potentially hit shelves in November.It's disappointing that Nvidia has delayed the release of its Lovelace flagship once again, but RedGamingTech said that Nvidia needs more time to sell the RTX 3000 cards.Can Nvidia Beat AMD This Time?Previously, Nvidia's next-gen GPU was rumored to be launched in mid-July. However, it won't happen anytime, and users should stick to their existing cards before going to this high-end flagship.Another interesting thing about this graphics card is its power usage. Again, RedGamingTech highlighted that the RTX 4090 could sit at 450W in terms of this aspect.If Nvidia wants to surpass AMD, it should take note that the upcoming GPU should excel in power efficiency. The latter has recently touted that its graphics cards have been showing a vast improvement when it comes to performance-per-watt. This is even better compared to the usual RDNA 2 card.Nvidia needs to continue developing a very adaptive graphics card that can withstand extreme heating issues. Another concern is the surging energy costs, which the company should consider about its product.Related Article:\n\u00a0Nvidia Showcases Simplified Super Resolution Technologies via Streamline at GDC 2022AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.0A few days ago, Tom's Hardware reported that AMD had shared some information about the newest FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.0 (FSR 2.0) adoption rate.The hardware maker said that 16 video game titles would soon benefit from the FSR 2.0 support.

This new GTX 1630 \u2013 at least the EVGA XC GAMING version I saw for sale this morning at EVGA.com \u2013 costs more than $149 USD.\n \n\n\nAt least I can finance it with low monthly payments\u2026\nI found that EVGA listing later, when I went looking for an image of the new GPU. NVIDIA somehow didn\u2019t send out PR for this, choosing to let board partners announce the exciting new entry into the Turing family. Have no fear, NVIDIA does list the new GPU on their GeForce graphics site, including this comparison of the GTX 16 Series family, which I captured \u2013 and highlighted \u2013 below:\n \n\n\nThe GTX 1630 offers 512 CUDA Cores, a 1785 MHz Boost Clock, and has 4 GB of GDDR6 memory on a 64-bit bus \u2013 good for 96 GB/s of memory bandwidth.\nClearly, this is not going to be a fast card, as TechPowerUp can verify, having already reviewed one of these this morning. Please click through and read their review, but I\u2019ll note that, while performance is well below that of a GTX 1650 and Radeon RX 6400, it destroys the GT 1030! Now, if you can find it for a price between that GT 1030 and a Radeon RX 6400, you might have yourself an acceptable time. As long as a graphics card for awe-inspiring 1080/low PC gaming is worth spending your money on.\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousAMD Ryzen 7 5700G Processor with Radeon Graphics Mini Review \n\nNextBoycott 7-Zip Because It\u2019s Not On Github; Seriously? \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nSebastian Peak\nEditor-in-Chief at PC Perspective.

The GTX 1630 is based on a Turing TU117-150 graphics processor and sports 512 CUDA cores. For comparison, the new card lags behind the GTX 1650 model with its 896 cores, and even fails to keep up with the six-year-old GTX 1050 Ti (768 cores). Positioned at the bottom of the stack, the GTX 1630 has 4GB of GDDR6 memory across a 64-bit memory bus that is capable of reaching a theoretical bandwidth of only 96 GB/s, half that of the GTX 1650. The new graphics card requires 75W of power and has a base clock of 1740MHz and boosts up to 1785MHz, matching the clock speeds on the GTX 1660. Zooming out, the GTX 1630 is similar to the GTX 1650 in that it uses the same architecture and has similar TDP, memory amounts, and cooling designs. It also inherits some of its faults, including a 6-pin power connector and a lack of ray tracing support (to be fair, ray tracing shouldn\u2019t be a concern at this price). Display support is also limited to 7680 x 4320 at 60Hz instead of the 120Hz supported by the other Nvidia GPUs.\n\n\n Nvidia GeForce GTX 1630 Image: Nvidia For now, the only official review of the GTX 1630 comes by way of TechPowerUp, which was critical of the card, stating that it is \u201cseverely lacking in performance,\u201d with the Radeon RX 6400 and GTX 1650 clocking in 60% faster. Rather than being a replacement for the GTX 1050 Ti, TechPowerUp believes the GTX 1630\u2019s purpose is to make the GeForce GT 1030 obsolete. How is it for gaming? Not great. The card struggled across every gaming benchmark, failing to reach 30 frames per second on most tests and averaging just 24 fps at 1080p settings across the wide range of titles.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the purpose of this card, then? It is best as a low-cost option for a productivity desktop that lacks integrated graphics. The GTX 1630 will provide a significant boost over any integrated solutions and has enough oomph to play less demanding games at 1080p on lower settings. We\u2019re still awaiting pricing details, but these specs should make this a sub-$150 graphics card. Anything at or above that mark will be hard to justify. We\u2019ve reached out to Nvidia for pricing details and will update this article as soon as we know more.\n\n\n\nAlienwareComputingGraphics hardwareIntelNvidia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily

The security has lost 36.3% so far in 2022, though it sports 6.4% lead over the last 12 months. The $160 level kept the equity's recent pullback in check, while the stock's 30-day moving average has recently stepped in as a floor on the charts. Even better, Nvidia stock is a noted outperformer during the second half of the year, making now a good time to speculate on even more upside for the shares as 2022 marches on.\n\nSpecifically, the security just landed on Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White's list of the best performing stocks during the second half of the year, going back 10 years. According to this data, eight out of the last 10 of NVDA's H2 returns were positive, with the shares averaging an impressive 32% return during that time period. A similar move from its current perch of $187.51 would put the equity at just above the $247.50 region, which hasn't been touched since early April.\u00a0\n\nAn unwinding of pessimism in the options pits could put additional wind at the equity's back. At the\u00a0International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), NVDA sports a 50-day put/call volume ratio that sits in the 92nd percentile of its 12-month range. This means puts are being picked up at a quicker-than-usual clip.\u00a0\nIt's worth noting that NVDA's Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS) ranks at 96 out of a possible 100. This means the stock tends to exceed options traders' volatility expectations -- a boon for buyers.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow @Schaeffers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhich of These SUB-$5 Stocks Could 26x From Here?\u00a0(AD)\nHe called a rare 11x on Tesla\u2026\nThen he called a 26x on Workhorse\u2026\nThen an even rarer 35x on Nio Inc\u2026\nNow Tim Bohen says these 5 tiny \u201cAmerica First\u201d stocks are next up in 2025.\nThey\u2019re trading for less than $5 right now.\nBut thanks to Elon & Trump\u2019s new alliance\u2026\nThey could be off to the races in Trump\u2019s first 100 days.\nAnd right now for a limited time\u2026\nYou can get the names & tickers for just $1 here.\u00a0(AD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFeatured Articles from Trusted Partners:\n\ud83d\ude80 One Stock Pick Could Change Everything in 2025\nWhat if one stock pick could define your success next year?

With the company\u2019s RTX 3080 mobile GPU at the heart of things, Fortnite zips along at an astonishing ~160fps at 2K resolution with detail up high. As well as the raw power, that\u2019s likely also thanks to the clever DLSS upscaling technology that uses AI to give you both high framerates and high fidelity graphics.\u00a0\n\nEven enabling the famously intensive graphical niceties of ray tracing \u2014 where every beam of light is accurately modelled by NVIDIA RTX GPUs for incredible reflections, shadow, and lighting \u2014 leaves the game running at a buttery ~60fps. Given much of Fortnite is spent traversing the massive Battle Royale Island evading the coming storm while spotting enemy silhouettes in the distance, ray traced visuals certainly gave me something to gawp at, and I spent way longer than I should in a speed boat, marvelling at the way the sun reflected on the waters.\n\n\nAd\n\n\n\n \n\nAd \u2013 content continues below\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest of all, given the average Fortnite player is roughly half my age with the kind of natural youthful reflexes that have eroded in me over the last 15 year, I can\u2019t help but feel the fact that I\u2019m still competitive is more than a little down to a helping hand from NVIDIA\u2019s new Reflex technology. And with the new No Build mode drawing in fresh faces and returning veterans alike, any competitive advantage is certainly worth grabbing with both hands.\nThe NVIDIA Reflex Advantage\nTo recap, Reflex is NVIDIA\u2019s way of tackling latency. Not the latency you get when playing online games \u2014 or ping, as it is known among gamers \u2014 but local latency. That is to say the amount of time it takes for your actions (a mouse click, pressing space, etc.) to register on screen (a bullet leaving your gun, your character jumping).\u00a0\nReflex is something that has to be coded into the game, but is already in eight of the 10 most popular competitive shooters, says Seth Schneider, Senior Product Manager at NVIDIA.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d say \u2018worst case Reflex integration\u2019 is like a 20 to 25% reduction in latency,\u201d Schneider tells Den of Geek. \u201cReally, really good ones that we see are even above 50%, they\u2019ll be 60 to even 65% latency reduction, which is phenomenal.\u201d\nThe benefits of Reflex in a fast-paced game like Fortnite should be immediately obvious: with faster reactions, you\u2019re quicker on the draw, more responsive with your aim, and able to lay down shots a bit faster than your opponents. Unless they\u2019re also using NVIDIA Reflex, of course, in which case you\u2019ll have to rely on your natural gaming talents.\nMy favorite Reflex-aided kill in Fortnite came really early on in a round, when I stumbled across two people fighting in a building. I ducked in, and with Reflex helping me respond quickly, was able to take down my opponent before they could even turn around and take aim. But with another player rattling around on the floor above, there was no time to lose: I grabbed my dead teammate\u2019s discarded shotgun and closed myself in a room, lying in wait. Sure enough, the other player opened the door, and I was able to instantly respond with a one-shot shotgun blast before they knew what hit them.\n\n\nAd\n\n\n\n \n\nAd \u2013 content continues below\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy experience playing Fortnite has been full of fine-margin wins like that, and I find myself silently saluting the technology helping me live to fight another day. Like when you\u2019ve got someone in your sights with the sniper rifle and they\u2019re making your life extra difficult by jumping around like no soldier ever has in real life. Timing is everything, and with Reflex, I\u2019m pleased to say that I\u2019ve pulled off more than my fair share of unlikely headshots. This may have left them under the false impression that I\u2019m some kind of elite hacker rather than just a below-average gamer with magical hardware at his fingertips.\n\n\n\nJoin our mailing list\nGet the best of Den of Geek delivered right to your inbox!\n\n\n \n\n\nAlthough I spoke to him before my Fortnite journey began, Schneider would likely be unsurprised by these coin-toss moments that in Fortnite are a matter of life and death.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re running an RTX 3050 at 1440p,\u201d he says. \u201cGenerally in Fortnite, that\u2019s going to be somewhere between 60 to 80fps at decent, pretty high settings. So at that, without Reflex you would expect latency of around 60 milliseconds.\u201d\nThat, he says, is something you can certainly feel. \u201cIt feels a little squishy, a little floppy.\u201d With Reflex minimizing the render queue and optimizing the CPU side, it\u2019ll \u201creduce us down to 30 and maybe even 25 milliseconds,\u201d he explains.\n\u201cFor competitive gamers, that\u2019s obviously the pull, but honestly it helps pretty much any game that requires responsiveness. Whether you\u2019re grinding a Soulslike or playing a platformer\u2026 latency\u2019s important for everything.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe only real problem with NVIDIA Reflex is that I may have spoiled myself for other gaming platforms that don\u2019t offer the same advantages. \u201cJust this weekend I was playing my console on the TV with my son,\u201d Schneider says. \u201cWe just got the new Lego Star Wars game, and it was fun, but it runs at 30fps on a TV and the latency was so bad! I have ruined myself on TV console gaming.\u201d\n\n\nAd\n\n\n\n \n\nAd \u2013 content continues below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare:Share on Facebook (opens in a new tab)Share on Twitter (opens in a new tab)Share on Linkedin (opens in a new tab)Share on email (opens in a new tab) | Comment:\nComments count:0 \nTags: NvidiaPC GamingTech\n\n\n\n\nWritten by\n\n\t\t\t\tAlan Martin\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\tAlan is a London-based technology writer, who has written for the likes of Gizmodo, Wired and The New Statesman.

The company\u2019s data center segment surpassed the gaming segment for the first time to become the largest revenue contributor. The GeForce RTX 30 Series\u2019 product cycle enabled the gaming segment to grow 33% YoY to achieve $3.6 billion in revenues. The A100 GPU, with large-volume deployments by hyperscale customers, proved to be a key factor in the data center segment\u2019s revenue growth of 79.4% YoY to $3.6 billion. Source: Counterpoint Estimates, Company earnings; Earnings are CY QuarterGaming revenue to decline in Q2 due to architectural transition, mixed global demandGaming revenue stood at $3.6 billion with 33% YoY growth. The demand was primarily fuelled by the GeForce RTX 30 series. Nvidia estimates that about one-third of the GeForce Gaming GPU installed base is now on RTX.The geopolitical situation in Europe caused a demand softness along with COVID-19 lockdowns in China but was cushioned by the growing American demand. Uncertainties faced by the cryptomarket globally also added to the headwinds in the gaming segment. The company also expects a sequential revenue decrease due to architectural transitions.We believe due to the inflationary environment and tumultuous consumer demand and price cuts, the segment may face a revenue decline in the coming quarters. However, the GeForce Cloud Gaming will continue to grow as more and more players move towards cloud gaming, which presents itself as an inexpensive alternative to premium device gaming.Pro visualization grows 79.5% YoY to achieve $629 million in revenuesThe professional visualization segment\u2019s growth was driven by mobile workstation GPUs enabled by remote office infrastructure against the backdrop of hybrid work environments.Omniverse enterprise software also proved to be a support for the revenues. The software is being currently used for digital content creation by major enterprises like Sony and Medtronics. Amazon, Kroger and Pepsico are using the software\u2019s digital twin capabilities to optimize their business processes.As enterprises adopt more Omniverse technologies in their processes, premium GPU configuration systems will become a necessity than an option, and services revenue will continue to contribute to this segment\u2019s growth.Automotive declines 11.5% YoY at $134 million with uplifting short-term outlook due to Drive Orin SoCThe automotive market declined due to new product cycle ramping in later quarters. Additionally, deals are in pipeline that will take a couple of quarters to materialize. At the time of earnings, the win pipeline was at $11 billion over the course of the next six years.The segment will be a major growth driver in the coming years due to consumer AV and commercial robotaxis. But as of now, as this market is in its nascent stage, the revenue growth will remain muted in the next quarter.Data center is the crown jewel with 79.4% YoY growth at $3.6-billion revenueThe A100 GPU drove the data center segment\u2019s revenue past the gaming revenues. Large-volume deployments by hyperscalers and consumer internet companies, financial services, and telecom expansion of IT Infrastructure remained the key growth drivers. From a workload perspective, recommender systems, conversational AI, large language models and cloud graphics were the top workloads that warranted the sale of GPUs and DPUs along with networking to achieve the system architecture required for building systems that can sustain the unique requirements emerging from these workloads.Outlook for Q2 2022We expect the data center demand to remain strong for the next quarter due to the H100 systems\u2019 ramp-up, I/O upgrades in servers and large installations \u2013 deep recommender systems, large language models and AI models. The almost full-stack solution from Nvidia provides the platform for enterprises to deploy these models in a cost-effective manner.COVID-19 lockdowns in China and Russia-Ukraine war will impact the gaming market by about $400 million in revenues, with a muted growth in Q2.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nCategory\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs \n\n\nPublished\nJun 9, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack To List\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nInfographic: Global Foundry Revenue Share | Q1 2022\n\nJun 3, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nThe uphill battle for Intel commences with its first earnings of 2022\n\nMay 10, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nTSMC\u2019s Quarterly High-performance Computing Sales Surpass Smartphones for First Time in Q1 2022\n\nApr 29, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nGaming, Data Center Shine in NVIDIA\u2019s 2021 Show; Shortages Hit Networking Revenues\n\nFeb 21, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nCXL: Simplifying Server Fabric\n\nFeb 17, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nSamsung Takes Semiconductor Crown From Intel in 2021\n\nJan 28, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nCES 2022: Chip Biggies See Loads of Action\n\nJan 27, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nAutomotive NAD Module Market Sees Slow Growth in Q3 2021 Due to Tight Supply Chain\n\nJan 6, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nTesla AI Day: From Cars and Chips to Robots\n\nAug 23, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Papers\n\n\n\n\nRISC-V Adoption Picks Up Pace\n\nNov 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 Automotive Announcements in CES 2021\n\nJan 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nShakeout Coming in AI Chip Start-Up Market in 2020\n\nJan 20, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverage\n\nAI\nAutomotive\nConsumer Electronics\nDisplay\neSIM\nIoT & cIoT\nLocation Platform\nMacro\nManufacturing\nNetworks & Infrastructure\nSemiconductors\nSmartphones\nWearables\n\n\n\nInsights\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\nCP Conferences\nCP Conversations\nPodcasts\nEvents & Webinars\nWhite Papers\nReviews\nData\nIn the Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nUSA\nAFGHANISTAN\nALBANIA\nALGERIA\nAMERICAN SAMOA\nANDORRA\nANGOLA\nANGUILLA\nANTARCTICA\nANTIGUA AND BARBUDA\nARGENTINA\nARMENIA\nARUBA\nAUSTRALIA\nAUSTRIA\nAZERBAIJAN\nBAHAMAS\nBAHRAIN\nBANGLADESH\nBARBADOS\nBELARUS\nBELGIUM\nBELIZE\nBENIN\nBERMUDA\nBHUTAN\nBOLIVIA\nBOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA\nBOTSWANA\nBOUVET ISLAND\nBRAZIL\nBRITISH INDIAN OCEAN TERRITORY\nBRUNEI\nBULGARIA\nBURKINA FASO\nBURUNDI\nCAMBODIA\nCAMEROON\nCANADA\nCAPE VERDE\nCAYMAN ISLANDS\nCENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC\nCHAD\nCHILE\nCHINA\nCHRISTMAS ISLAND\nCOCOS (KEELING) ISLANDS\nCOLOMBIA\nCOMOROS\nCONGO\nCONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE\nCOOK ISLANDS\nCOSTA RICA\nCOTE D'IVOIRE\nCROATIA\nCUBA\nCYPRUS\nCZECH REPUBLIC\nDENMARK\nDJIBOUTI\nDOM.

Maybe let the market decide.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n By Thiago Trevisan  \n\n Contributor, PCWorld   Jun 24, 2022 3:45 am PDT \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nImage: Thiago Trevisan \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT has been an interesting GPU this generation. It\u2019s both cheaper than the competing Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090\u2014and sometimes faster, too. It\u2019s now been refreshed with the RX 6950 XT, a late entrant into the tumultuous GPU market. Nvidia has also done its part with the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti, which brings impressive performance, albeit with a high cost and power draw at 450W TDP.\u00a0\u00a0\nWith the original RTX 3090 price recently decreasing slightly, it makes for an interesting comparison against the newer AMD RX 6950 XT. The RTX 3090 Ti offers more performance, but is significantly outside of the price bracket of the RX 6950 XT. Is this AMD refresh enough to push performance for AMD ahead of Nvidia, even in the murky waters of ray tracing? More importantly, does it move the needle for high-end gamers enough for them to switch their allegiance from Nvidia to AMD? Let\u2019s find out!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSapphire RX 6950XT\nBrad Chacos\nNvidia RTX 3090 vs. AMD 6950XT: Price\nRelax. You can easily find both GPUs in stock now at most retailers, and generally at close to MSRP. The GPU market has experienced a significant downturn during the last several months, with prices quickly dropping from their stratospheric levels.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNitro+ Pure Radeon RX 6950 XT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AMD RX 6950XT comes in at a $1,099 MSRP for the reference model, and some third-party models range from $1,199 to $1,299. A modest bump from the $999 6900XT pricing\u2014but it does not mean they\u2019re a great deal. With the declining GPU market and murmurs of the next-generation GPUs coming out this year, it has significantly dampened demand and enthusiasm for this level of GPU.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$1,829.99 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\nThe Nvidia RTX 3090 has also experienced much lower demand, resulting in quickly falling pricing. While you\u2019re still unlikely to find a $1,499 Founders Edition at MSRP, most models such as those from the EVGA RTX 3090 lineup have experienced a significant price drop, coming in as low as $1,609 for the Black series. (The 3090 Ti debuted at $1,999, a big increase over the RTX 3090\u2014and it\u2019s already being discounted at many retailers, too)\u00a0\nThe pricing on the used market is even lower, however, with RTX 3090s dipping close to the $1,200 mark in many cases.\u00a0\n\nNeither model is a great price-to-performance choice this late into the release cycle, however. Most high-end gamers who don\u2019t have a top-tier GPU will likely be best served by waiting for the next generation this year.\n\n\n\n\nThe AMD RX 6950 XT is the latest to test its mettle against Nvidia. Thiago Trevisan\nNvidia RTX 3090 vs. AMD 6950XT: Performance\nAMD certainly threw in a surprising performance with the original 6900 XT\u2014it was able to match or beat the RTX 3090 in certain games and scenarios. Has the RX 6950 XT finally crossed the Rubicon in all performance areas? Not quite. When it comes to ray tracing performance, the RTX 3090 is still out ahead. (Check out Brad Chacos\u2019 review for a deeper dive on the new AMD refreshes.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThiago Trevisan\nIn games such as Watch Dogs Legion with traditional rasterization, we can see the AMD RX 6950 XT performing as well or better than the RTX 3090 (especially at lower resolutions). This trend continues in other games such as Horizon Zero Dawn, where it\u2019s able to keep up with the RTX 3090. Game after game, both GPUs trade blows and are highly competitive with each other.\u00a0\nBoth GPUs have party tricks up their sleeves for performance, too. AMD has Smart Access Memory that can boost performance when coupled with a Ryzen CPU, along with Radeon Super Resolution. This will give it significant boosts in many games, besting the RTX 3090 in some cases, as shown below in Horizon Zero Dawn. Nvidia also has DLSS technology that does wonders for keeping graphical fidelity and high frames simultaneously\u2014which is a gamer changer when paired with ray tracing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD RSR AdvantagesThiago Trevisan\nWhat happens when we introduce ray tracing? That\u2019s where Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3090 still holds an advantage over AMD. The 6950 XT does not have upgraded ray tracing hardware when compared to the 6900 XT, keeping it behind the Nvidia RTX GPUs in this case.\u00a0\nIt can be argued that there are diminishing returns for ray tracing visuals and performance, with varying results. The technology puts insane strain on performance, lowering frame rates significantly until you claw some back with the help of an upscaling technology like DLSS or AMD\u2019s FSR. The visual impact doesn\u2019t always make losing that performance worthwhile, either. But when it comes to the \u201chalo\u201d GPUs like these, ray tracing can be part of the reason you get a high-end GPU in the first place; you want to turn all the eye candy up to Ultra, including ray tracing. Paired with Nvidia\u2019s DLSS, the performance penalty can be mitigated, and the visuals enjoyed fully. \n\n\nThis is one big advantage of the RTX 3090 versus the newer 6950 XT\u2014maximum performance and visuals matter when you\u2019re spending way over $1,000 for a GPU. AMD\u2019s ray tracing hardware is a generation behind Nvidia\u2019s implementation, while its DLSS rival, FSR 2.0, is great but still in its infancy, with only a handful of games supporting the fledgling technology at this point. That means ray tracing is best experienced at 1440p resolution on the 6950 XT, while you can usually crank ray traced games even at 4K on the 3090. If you\u2019re not interested in ray tracing however, the 6950 XT is a mighty fine choice for significantly less cost.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$1200 at  Best Buy \n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that the RTX 3090 is certainly better geared towards content creation and other workstation use cases, as well. With a whopping 24GB of GDDR6x VRAM, it will handily beat the 16GB RX 6950 XT in most content creation tasks. The 3080 Ti would be a more reasonable competitor to the 6950 XT in this case as a pure gaming solution.\u00a0\n\nNvidia RTX 3090 vs. AMD 6950 XT: Power and other things to know\nThe RTX 3090 packs a TDP of 350W, with many third-party models eclipsing 400W. The RX 6950 XT comes in a 335W TDP, which is reasonable for the performance that it puts out. Remember, the 3090 Ti is already up to 450W TDP\u2014so next-generation offerings will likely go up significantly in requirements.\u00a0\nYou\u2019ll want a minimum of a 750W power supply for both, but we\u2019d recommend you up that even higher for future proofing\u2014as high-quality power supplies tend to last a long time.\u00a0\n\n\nYou\u2019ll need a case with good airflow for both these options, and better clearance than lesser GPUs require. (They\u2019re often wrapped in a nice, thick, beefy air coolers to keep their temperatures in check.)\u00a0\nWhich is the better option for water cooling? We\u2019d argue that the RTX 3090 is, since it likely will have a wider range of water blocks available on the market. Plus, with its steaming-hot VRAM, it often benefits more from taking a deep swim versus the typically cooler RX 6950 XT.\n\nSo, is the 6950 XT enough to best the RTX 3090?\nThe 6950 XT is a slightly more powerful addition to the high-end AMD lineup, putting up an impressive performance versus the RTX 3090. It\u2019s simple: If you\u2019re playing at higher resolutions and want to use ray tracing, Nvidia still holds an advantage here. DLSS and the Nvidia encoders are also great technologies that serve people well.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re after pure frame rate goodness\u2014without as much ray tracing, the 6950 XT can be often a much better choice than the RTX 3090, especially in sub-4K resolutions. AMD offers great technologies such as FSR, Smart Access Memory to really up the performance too.\u00a0\n\n\nSo, who wins? Unfortunately, the 6950 XT comes in too late in the release cycle to be relevant in the rapidly declining GPU market, making it an expensive option. The aging RTX 3090 is a similar story. Its high price was never a very good option for purely gaming\u2014making better use for hybrid content creators/gamers instead. The RTX 3090 Ti is an even worse value proposition this late into the story, making it only relevant for a few high-end enthusiasts who don\u2019t mind the price tag.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3090 Ti: The symbol for diminishing returns in an ever changing market. Beautiful, but flawed!\nIDG\nThe verdict: This is a good ole\u2019 fashioned standstill. We\u2019d wait out the market a few months as both will experience even steeper declines in price with the introduction of the next generation. Otherwise, if you really must have one now, the decision will come down to ray tracing preference and resolution you\u2019re playing at. Both GPUs will give you good, all-around performance for years to come\u2014but neither are a great choice right now as the GPU market is rapidly changing this year.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Thiago Trevisan, Contributor, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\nThiago Trevisan is a Mac and PC enthusiast for over 20 years, and has written for PCWorld and Macworld since 2021.

A single port PCIe version was on display on the show floor that utilizes a Supermicro SuperBlade, which is interesting to see. The Supermicro SuperBlade enhances system computing density by housing multiple blade servers in a single enclosure. Some of the main features of the ConnectX-7 interface include:\nRelated Story Chinese AI Lab DeepSeek Has 50,000 NVIDIA H100 AI GPUs, Says AI CEO\nMaximum Total Bandwidth: 400GbE\nSupported Ethernet Speeds: 10/25/40/50/100/ 200/400GbE\nNumber of Network Ports: 1/2/4\nNetwork Interface Technologies: NRZ (10/25G) / PAM4 (50/100G)\nHost Interface PCIe Gen5.0: x16/x32\nCards Form Factors: PCIe FHHL/HHHL,OCP3.0 SFF\nNetwork Interfaces: SFP56, QSFP56, QSFP56-DD, QSFP112, SFP112\n\nIn the pictures provided by the website Serve The Home, you can see the side of the card with the ports, the switch modules of the blade server, the top of the unit, and a unique backplate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe top of the NVIDIA ConnectX-7 unit has a large heatsink located on the optical cage to dissipate heat more efficiently, especially from the 200 Gbps and 400 Gbps class optics. Looking at the rear of the unit, we can see a very interestingly shaped backplate. The plate is the NDR200 MCX75210AAS-HEAT model that you can see listed in the table below.\nSource: Serve the Home\nThe Hopper DGX H100 uses two assemblies themselves. Four ConnectX-7 controllers can be located on a single body, such as the NVIDIA Cedar Fever 1.6 Tbps modules used in the DGX H100. The NVIDIA A100 modules can be seen mounted in Delta or Redstone assemblies, and numerous A100 SXM modules are placed throughout the heatsinks.\nSource: Serve the Home\nSource: Serve the Home\nThere is a different density of components on the NVIDIA H100 board versus the A100. However, the NVIDIA H100 was absent from the show floor. There is also a significant difference between the A100 and H100 in terms of connections, as reported by Serve the Home.\nA lot of the products will be seen at SC22 later in the year, so we are just on the verge of the PCIe Gen5 generation, which will allow us to see new devices and chips. Several partners of NVIDIA have stated that shipments of the ConnectX-7 were still several months away as we waited for production volumes to rise to more comfortable positions.\nNews Source: Serve The Home\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Gets The \u201cGreen Signal\u201d By US To Sell Cutting-Edge H100 AI GPUs To The UAE Firm G42\n\nMuhammad Zuhair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon\u2019s \u2018Colossus\u2019 Supercomputer Built With 100K H100 NVIDIA GPUs Goes Online, H200 Upgrade Coming Soon\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel Might Get NVIDIA As A Foundry Customer Soon, Likely To Produce 5000 H100 Wafers Per Month\n\nMuhammad Zuhair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk Begins Training xAI With 100,000 Liquid-Cooled NVIDIA H100 GPUs, The Most Powerful AI Training Cluster On The Planet\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n159\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n125\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nA Mac Studio Cluster Of Four Units, All Featuring Apple\u2019s Latest M3 Ultra, Consume Less Than Half The Power Of A Network Switch When Running At Idle\n\n\n\n66\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n33\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1480\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1157\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Almost every gaming application, game launcher, and graphics card software offer an overlay option. But not every gamer needs an overlay setting that pops up every time you launch a game. \nIf you feel that you don't need the GeForce overlay or the features that it offers, you can disable it. We will list out all the possible methods to hide and disable the Nvidia GeForce overlay. \n                        Why Use the Nvidia GeForce Overlay?\n               \nNvidia GeForce overlay is a useful gaming utility. It offers many great features for avid gamers and streamers. Rather than installing separate software for each feature, gamers get all of them in one app. Check our detailed guide on Nvidia GeForce Experience app for more info.\nHere are some of the features of Nvidia GeForce overlay offers: \n\n                                        Screen recording to store all the game clips from a session.\n                        \n\n                                        Instant Replay to record the last 20 minutes of gameplay at 60 FPS.\n                        \n\n                                        Live broadcast the gameplay to Twitch or YouTube.\n                        \n\n                                        Capture high-resolution in-game screenshots and upload them to Google Photos or Imgur.\n                        \n\n                                        Share gameplay with friends.\n                        \n\n                                        Monitor graphics card performance.\n                        \n\n\n                        Can You Turn Off the Nvidia GeForce Overlay?\n               \nYes. It is possible to turn off the Nvidia GeForce overlay. The app offers the option to completely disable the feature in the settings.\nDespite this, it doesn\u2019t provide a method to disable the overlay for a single game. There is a trick to do so, but unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t work all the time. \n                        How to Turn Off the Nvidia GeForce Overlay for All Games\n               \nIf you no longer need the Nvidia GeForce overlay, you can disable it on your system. Remember that this method will completely disable the overlay.

You also get the overlay feature and the option to auto-optimize games for your hardware. But you can run games and other GPU-intensive apps without it.\nAs long as you have the Nvidia GPU drivers installed, your GPU will function without any problem. So, you can remove the Nvidia GeForce Experience app to get rid of overlays for good.\nTo remove the Nvidia GeForce Experience, repeat the following steps: \n\n                                        Press Win + I to launch the Settings app. Navigate to the left-hand side menu and scroll down to find the Apps option.\n                                            \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        Click on it and then click on the Installed Apps option.\n                        \n\n                                        Now, scroll down the installed app list and find the Nvidia GeForce Experience app. You can even use the search bar on the top to find the app.\n                                            \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        Click on the three dots and select the Uninstall option.

Restart your system.\n                        \n\nNvidia GeForce Experience is now removed from your system. You won't have to worry about the overlays feature anymore. \n                        Why Should You Remove the Nvidia GeForce Overlay?\n               \nThe Nvidia GeForce overlay has its fair share of problems. These include jittery game detection, problematic behavior with full-screen apps, and more. If you face any of these problems, it is advisable to remove the Nvidia GeForce Experience app to see if it fixes the problem. \n                        Does the Nvidia GeForce Overlay Impact System Performance?\n               \nThe Nvidia GeForce Experience app does not consume a lot of system resources. The official system requirements include a two-core processor and a GTX 600 series GPU.\nHowever, if you have a low-end system and are running demanding games with little to no resources to spare, then the overlay can take up valuable processing power.\nIf the FPS drops are minuscule, you can ignore them. Otherwise, disabling the overlay or removing the Nvidia GeForce Experience app can help squeeze a few more frames from your games. \n                        Get Rid of Nvidia's Overlays for Good\n               \nNvidia GeForce Experience isn't a bad app. It is a handy tool for automatically optimizing your games. But it depends upon your use case and whether you need the overlays feature or not. If you rarely use the GeForce overly, you can either disable it from within the app's settings or uninstall the program from your PC. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n\n\nWindows 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support MakeUseOf.

And so I asked the AI painter de jour, DALL-E mini, to help visualise what an 800W RTX 4090 might look like should the green team go all out. I think DALL-E has actually nailed the cooling array, so I'm going to steal it and see if I can get a design credit from Jen-Hsun.We're edging ever closer to the launch of the new Nvidia RTX 40-series graphics cards, yet we don't really have a lot to go on in terms of what they're going to look like. Or even really how they're going to be specced out.There were rumours a while back of the green team testing AD102 boards with 800W total board power (TBP), and though that is unlikely to actually appear in a release graphics card\u2014at least not for the consumer market\u2014I kinda wanted to see what one might look like. The DALL-E design features a dual-fan cooling array on top, with a supplementary 120mm fan pushing air down the length of the PCB, presumably to an exhaust vent pointing towards the back of the PC.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nThe RTX 5090 Founders Edition might be svelte but the Asus ROG Astral cards are absolute chonkers\n\n\n\n\nRTX 5090 prototype GPU with 24,576 cores reportedly leaks hinting at possible 800 W 5090 Ti or Titan monster\n\n\n\nThat would result in a very chunky, maybe five-slot graphics card design, but it sure would be able to house a heatsink capable of keeping such a hot and heavy Ada Lovelace GPU cooled. But yeah, 'heavy' might very well be the watchword here if 'efficiency' certainly isn't; you're going to want a support bracket in there, I'd wager.Thankfully, the latest rumours suggest the top-end card of the next Nvidia generation, the RTX 4090 will be a 450W board. That is still pretty ludicrous, considering the GeForce RTX 3090 was a 350W card.\u00a0Yeah, I know the RTX 3090 Ti is a 450W card, too, but that is also a ludicrous board.Some updates.

For those not familiar with BlueField, it provides data center infrastructure-on-a-chip, optimized for high-performance enterprise and cloud computing. Because DOCA is tied to BlueField, there\u2019s a misconception that it\u2019s closed and proprietary.\nThe reality is that DOCA is built using an open-source foundation, which allows for flexibility and portability. Nvidia has always made much of its software open, and its strategy with DOCA is consistent with that. The company is a believer (as am I) that openness drives usage, which in turn creates opportunity. Nvidia\u2019s commitment to being open is one of the reasons it has run away from the field in the area of accelerated computing.\nThere are three key aspects of DOCA that make it open:\n\nSpecific open-source networking drivers, which developers can use in their software stack.\nDOCA FLOW, an API that provides a set of accelerated libraries for specific environments. DOCA FLOW runs on top of the Data Plane Development Kit, an open-source software managed by the Linux Foundation, and makes it easy to develop hardware-accelerated networking apps.\nContainerized services, which are binaries that anyone can develop on top of. A nondeveloper can use a container, drop it into the app and run it. The use of containers makes DOCA-based applications portable between different environments.\n\nThe accelerated libraries improve performance when using BlueField DPUs. Whenever a new BlueField DPU is introduced, typically every 18 months, the DOCA libraries are forward- and backward-compatible. So software developers don\u2019t have to rewrite their stacks every time a new BlueField DPU comes out. Although developers can\u2019t use DOCA to program another DPU, they can take their code, with minor rewrites, and apply it elsewhere using DOCA\u2019s open foundation.\nThere is already some standardization at the driver level, but Nvidia has observed a trend where those who initially integrated with BlueField using drivers are migrating to DOCA for better performance. Most BlueField developers have programmed at the driver level in the past because the DOCA SDK has been available for only a short time. The first version shipped early last year. Now that DOCA is on version 1.3, developers can gradually transition to DOCA to enable better performance and faster application development.\nStandardization is also taking place around tools for programming smart network interface cards or smartNICs, which are programmable hardware that offload processing tasks typically handled by a central processing unit. Nvidia\u2019s most advanced smartNICs are powered by BlueField DPUs. Organizations are starting to think more about the APIs and what the management framework will look like for smartNICs going forward.\nSmartNICs aren\u2019t new, but the programmability of DPUs and the APIs \u2013 like DOCA \u2013 make them much more flexible than older generations. These standardized, cross-vendor APIs are not yet ready, but Nvidia is participating in those efforts.\nThe containerized services within DOCA offer a different type of openness to application development for DPUs. Although the services are not open source, they are very portable and easy to implement, so developers can quickly port applications written for other DPUs to run on Bluefield, or take BlueField-based applications written for one environment and port them to other environments. This simplified portability provides much of the benefits of an open API.\nOver time, Nvidia hopes customers will be using DOCA libraries to get the enhanced performance that differentiates Nvidia from other hardware providers. Customers that want to get the best of BlueField can use the DOCA libraries or services. Those who want flexibility and portability can use the open drivers.\nBesides leveraging an open platform, Nvidia is contributing to different open-source frameworks and consortiums such as the Open Programmable Infrastructure. Nvidia is also a major and frequent contributor of new open-source code to the Linux kernel in the areas of networking, artificial intelligence and compute acceleration.\nZeus Kerravala\u00a0is a principal analyst at ZK Research, a division of Kerravala Consulting.

This will enable an industrial metaverse with physics-based digital models from Siemens and real-time AI from NVIDIA in which companies make decisions faster and with increased confidence.The addition of Omniverse to the open Siemens Xcelerator partner ecosystem will accelerate the use of digital twins that can deliver productivity and process improvements across the production and product lifecycles. Companies of all sizes will be able to employ digital twins with real-time performance data; create innovative industrial IoT-solutions; leverage actionable insights from analytics at the edge or in the cloud; and tackle the engineering challenges of tomorrow by making visually rich, immersive simulations more accessible.\u00a0\u201cPhotorealistic, physics-based digital twins embedded in the industrial metaverse offer enormous potential to transform our economies and industries by providing a virtual world where people can interact and collaborate to solve real-world problems. Through this partnership, we will make the industrial metaverse a reality for companies of all sizes,\u201d said Roland Busch, President and Chief Executive Officer, Siemens AG. \u201cFor over a decade, our digital twin technology has been helping customers across all industries to boost their productivity and today offer the industry\u2019s most comprehensive digital twin. When Siemens Xcelerator is connected to Omniverse, we will enable a real-time, immersive metaverse that connects hardware and software, from the edge to the cloud with rich data from Siemens\u2019 software and solutions.\u201d\u201cSiemens and NVIDIA share a common vision that the industrial metaverse will drive digital transformation. This is just the first step in our joint effort to make this vision real for our customers and all parts of the global manufacturing industry,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO, NVIDIA. \u201cThe connection to Siemens Xcelerator will open NVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse and AI ecosystem to a whole new world of industrial automation that is built using Siemens\u2019 mechanical, electrical, software, IoT and edge solutions.\u201dThis partnership brings together complementary technologies and ecosystems to realize the industrial metaverse. Siemens is uniquely positioned at the intersections of the real and digital world, information technology and operational technology. The Siemens Xcelerator platform connects mechanical, electrical and software domains across the product and production processes and enables the convergence of IT and OT.NVIDIA Omniverse is an AI-enabled, physically simulated and industrial-scale virtual-world engine that enables for the first time full-fidelity live digital twins. NVIDIA AI, used by more than 25,000 companies worldwide, is the intelligence engine of Omniverse in the cloud and autonomous systems at the edge. NVIDIA Omniverse and AI are ideal computation engines to represent the comprehensive digital twin from Siemens Xcelerator.  **Contact for journalists  **Siemens AGFlorian MartensPhone: +49 162 2306627, e-mail: florian.martens@siemens.com\u00a0Bernhard WardinPhone: +49 173 3270510; e-mail: bernhard.wardin@siemens.com\u00a0NVIDIALexi HatziPhone: +44 7583 137446, e-Mail: lexih@nvidia.comAbout NVIDIASince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

Customers can now easily monitor GPU utilization and its memory to scale their workloads more effectively without custom scripts. In this post, we\u2019ll describe how to allow GPU monitoring and integrate it into your Amazon Machine Images (AMI). Furthermore, we\u2019ll extend this to include the monitoring of GPU hardware events utilizing CloudWatch Log Streams. By combining this telemetry into the Amazon CloudWatch Console, customers can have a complete picture of GPU activity across their fleets.\nCapturing GPU metrics\nThere is an extensive list of NVIDIA accelerator metrics that can be captured. Depending on the workload type, it may be unnecessary to capture all of the metrics at all times. The following table breaks down the suggested metrics to collect by workload type. This considers a balance of cost and impactful metrics at scale.\n\n\n\nCompute (Machine Learning (ML), High Performance Computing (HPC))\nGraphics/Gaming\n\n\nutilization_gpu power_draw utilization_memory memory_total memory_used memory_free pcie_link_gen_current pcie_link_width_current clocks_current_smclocks_current_memory\nutilization_gpu utilization_memory memory_total memory_usedmemory_free pcie_link_gen_current pcie_link_width_current encoder_stats_session_count encoder_stats_average_fps encoder_stats_average_latency clocks_current_graphics clocks_current_memory clocks_current_video\n\n\n\nMoreover, this is supported through custom AMIs that are deployed with managed service offerings, including Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Amazon Elastic Container Services (Amazon ECS), and AWS ParallelCluster w/ SLURM for HPC clusters.\nThe following is an example screenshot from the CloudWatch Console showcasing the telemetry captured for a P4d instance. You can see that we captured the preceding metrics on a per-GPU index. Each Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) P4d instance has 8x A100 GPUs.\n\nCapturing GPU Xid events\nXid events are a reporting mechanism from GPU hardware vendors that emit notable events from the device to the OS in this case we are capturing the events through the NVRM kernel module. Current GPU architecture requires that the full GPU with protections are passed into the running instance. Thus, most errors that manifest inside of the customer instance aren\u2019t directly visible to the Amazon EC2 virtualization stack. Although some of these errors are benign, others indicate problems with the customer application, the NVIDIA driver, and under rare circumstances a defect in the GPU hardware.\nFor NVIDIA-based Amazon EC2 instances, these errors will be logged in the system journal with an \u201cNVRM:\u201d regular expression.\nThese events can be collected and pushed to Amazon CloudWatch Logs as a stream. When an Xid event occurs on the GPU, it will parse the event and push it the log stream for that instance ID in the Region in which the instance is running. The following steps are required to get started capturing those events.\nDeployment\nWe\u2019ll cover the deployment in two different use-cases: 1. You have an existing instance running and you want to start to capture metrics and XID events. 2. You want to build and an AMI and use it within Amazon EC2 or additional services.\nI. On a running Amazon EC2 instance\nStep 1. Attach an IAM Role to the EC2 instance that has permission to CloudWatch Metrics/Logs. The following is an IAM policy that you can attach to your IAM Role.\n{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Sid\": \"1\",\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Action\": [\n                \"cloudwatch:PutMetricStream\",\n                \"logs:CreateLogDelivery\",\n                \"logs:CreateLogStream\",\n                \"cloudwatch:PutMetricData\",\n                \"logs:UpdateLogDelivery\",\n                \"logs:CreateLogGroup\",\n                \"logs:PutLogEvents\",\n                \"cloudwatch:ListMetrics\"\n            ],\n            \"Resource\": \"*\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nStep 2. Connect to a shell on the EC2 instance (through SSM or SSH). Install the CloudWatch Agent following the instructions here. There is support across architectures and distributions.\nStep 3. Next, we can create our CloudWatch Agent JSON configuration file. The following JSON snippet will capture the logs from gpuerrors.log and push to CloudWatch Logs. Save the contents of the following JSON snippet to a file on the instance at\u00a0/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/etc/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.json.\n{\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \"agent\": {\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"run_as_user\": \"root\"\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 },\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \"metrics\": {\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"append_dimensions\": {\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"AutoScalingGroupName\": \"${aws:AutoScalingGroupName}\",\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"ImageId\": \"${aws:ImageId}\",\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"InstanceId\": \"${aws:InstanceId}\",\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"InstanceType\": \"${aws:InstanceType}\"\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 },\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"aggregation_dimensions\": [[\"InstanceId\"]],\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"metrics_collected\": {\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"nvidia_gpu\": {\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"measurement\": [\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"utilization_gpu\",\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"utilization_memory\",\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"memory_total\",\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"memory_used\",\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"memory_free\",\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"clocks_current_graphics\",\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"clocks_current_sm\",\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"clocks_current_memory\"\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0]\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0}\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 },\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \"logs\": {\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"logs_collected\": {\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"files\": {\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"collect_list\": [\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 {\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"file_path\": \"/var/log/gpuevent.log\",\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"log_group_name\": \"/ec2/accelerated/accel-event-log\",\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"log_stream_name\": \"{instance_id}\"\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ]\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 }\n\u00a0}\nStep 4. To start capturing the logs, restart the aws cloudwatch systemd service.\nsudo systemctl restart amazon-cloudwatch-agent.service\nAt this point, if you navigate to the CloudWatch Console in the Region that the instance is running, \u2013 All metrics \u2013 CWAgent, you should see a table of metrics similar to the following screenshot.\n\nStep 5. To capture the XID events it\u2019s possible to use the same CloudWatch Log directive used in the preceding image were set the GPU metrics to capture. The JSON following snippet defines that we will stream the log in /var/log/gpuevent.log to CloudWatch.\n\"logs\": {\n         \"logs_collected\": {\n             \"files\": {\n                 \"collect_list\": [\n                     {\n                         \"file_path\": \"/var/log/gpuevent.log\",\n                         \"log_group_name\": \"/ec2/accelerated/accel-event-log\",\n                         \"log_stream_name\": \"{instance_id}\"\n                     }\n                 ]\n             }\n         }\n     }\n\nThe GitHub project is an open source reference design for capturing these errors in the CloudWatch agent.\nhttps://github.com/aws-samples/aws-efa-nccl-baseami-pipeline\nStep 6. Save the following file as /opt/aws/aws-hwaccel-event-parser.py|.go with the following contents, which will write the Xid errors parsed to /var/log/gpuevent.log:\nThe code is available in either Python3 or Go (> 1.16).\nGolang code of the hwaccel-event-parser: https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-efa-nccl-baseami-pipeline/blob/master/nvidia-efa-ami_base/cloudwatch/nvidia/aws-hwaccel-event-parser.go\nPython3 code: https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-efa-nccl-baseami-pipeline/blob/master/nvidia-efa-ami_base/cloudwatch/nvidia/aws-hwaccel-event-parser.py\nAs you can see from the code, this is a blocking thread, and it will be running during the lifetime of the instance or container.\nStep 7. For ease of deployment, you can also create a systemd service (aws-hw-monitor.service), which will run at startup before the CloudWatch agent.\n[Unit]\nDescription=HW Error Monitor\nBefore=amazon-cloudwatch-agent.service\nAfter=syslog.target network-online.target\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nExecStart=/opt/aws/cloudwatch/aws-cloudwatch-wrapper.sh\nRemainAfterExit=1\nTimeoutStartSec=0\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nWhere\u00a0/opt/aws/cloudwatch/aws-cloudwatch-wrapper.sh is a script which contains:\n#!/bin/bash\npython3 /opt/aws/aws-hwaccel-event-parser.py &\nFinally, enable and start the hw monitor service\nsudo systemctl enable aws-hw-monitor.service \u2013now\nII. Building an AMI\nFor convenience, the following repo has what is needed to build the AMI for Amazon EC2, Amazon EKS, Amazon ECS, Amazon Linux 2, and Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 distributions. You must have Packer installed on your machine, and it must be authenticated to make API calls on your behalf to AWS. Generally you need to modify the variables:{} json and execute the packer build.\n\"variables\": {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"region\": \"us-east-1\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"flag\": \"<flag>\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"subnet_id\": \"<subnetid>\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"security_groupids\": \"<security_group_id,security_group_id\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"build_ami\": \"<buildami>\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"efa_pkg\": \"aws-efa-installer-latest.tar.gz\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"intel_mkl_version\": \"intel-mkl-2020.0-088\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"nvidia_version\": \"510.47.03\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"cuda_version\": \"cuda-toolkit-11-6 nvidia-gds-11-6\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"cudnn_version\": \"libcudnn8\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"nccl_version\": \"v2.12.7-1\"\n\u00a0 },\nAfter filling in the variables, check that the packer script is validated.\npacker validate nvidia-efa-ml-al2.yml\npacker build nvidia-efa-ml-al2.yml\nThe log group namespace is\u00a0/ec2/accelerated/accel-event-log. However, you may change this to the namespace of your preference in the CloudWatch Agent config file created earlier.\nNavigate to the CloudWatch Console \u2013 Logs \u2013 Log groups \u2013 /ec2/accelerated/accel-event-log. It\u2019s sorted by instance ID, where the instance ID of the latest stream is on top.\n\nWe can see in the preceding screenshot that an example workload ran on instance i-03a7b66de3198977e, which was a p4d.24xlarge triggered a Xid 63 event. Capturing these events is the first step. Next, we must interpret what these events mean. With each Xid error, there is a number associated with each event. As previously mentioned, these can be hardware errors, driver, and/or application errors. If you\u2019re running on an Amazon EC2 accelerated instance, and after code execution run into one of these errors, contact AWS Support with the instance ID and Xid error. The following is a list of the more common Xid errors that you may encounter.\n\n\n\nXid Error\nName\nDescription\nAction\n\n\n48\nDouble Bit ECC error\nHardware memory error\nContact AWS Support with Xid error and instance ID\n\n\n74\nGPU NVLink error\nFurther SXid errors should also be populated which will inform on the error seen with the NVLink fabric\nGet information on which links are causing the issue by running nvidia-smi nvlink -e\n\n\n63\nGPU Row Remapping Event\nSpecific to Ampere architecture \u2013- a row bank is pending a memory remap\nStop all CUDA processes, and reset the GPU (nvidia-smi -r), and make sure thatensure the remap is cleared in nvidia-smi -q\n\n\n13\nGraphics Engine Exception\nUser application fault , illegal instruction or register\nRerun the application with CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1 enabled which should determine if it\u2019s a NVIDIA driver or hardware issue\n\n\n31\nGPU memory page fault\nIllegal memory address access error\nRerun the application with CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1 enabled which should determine if it\u2019s a NVIDIA driver or hardware issue\n\n\n\nA quick way to check for row remapping failures is to run the below command on the instance.\nnvidia-smi --query-remapped-\nrows=gpu_name,gpu_bus_id,remapped_rows.failure,remapped_rows.pending,remapped_rows.correctable,remapped_rows.uncorrectable --format=csv\ngpu_name, gpu_bus_id, remapped_rows.failure, remapped_rows.pending, remapped_rows.correctable, remapped_rows.uncorrectable\nNVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB, 00000000:10:1C.0, 0, 0, 0, 0\nNVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB, 00000000:10:1D.0, 0, 0, 0, 0\nNVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB, 00000000:20:1C.0, 0, 0, 0, 0\nNVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB, 00000000:20:1D.0, 0, 0, 0, 0\nNVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB, 00000000:90:1C.0, 0, 0, 0, 0\nNVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB, 00000000:90:1D.0, 0, 0, 0, 0\nNVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB, 00000000:A0:1C.0, 0, 0, 0, 0\nNVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB, 00000000:A0:1D.0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nThis isn\u2019t an exhaustive list of Xid events, but it provides some of the more common ones that you may come across as you develop your accelerated workload. You can find a more complete table of events here.

The graphics and AI company wants its employees to feel like they\u2019re stepping into the future each day as they arrive for work, and the latest addition to its campus definitely achieves that goal. The 500,000-square-foot Endeavor, completed in 2017, has a stark black-and-white space age look, while the 750,000-square-foot Voyager has a more organic feel loaded with living greenery.Aerial view of Gensler's futuristic Nvidia headquarters campus in Santa Clara, California. Not many people outside Nvidia\u2019s employees will ever be able to get the full experience, but CNET got an exclusive tour of the interiors that gives us a pretty good idea of what it would be like to work there. A walkway lined with trees and shaded with solar panels leads from the Endeavor to the Voyager, and just inside the entrance, you\u2019ll see what looks like a series of jagged mountain-shaped structures inside the main envelope of the building. A stairway scales the central \u201cmountain,\u201d which is where employees meet up and work.Entryway and central Climb to the top of that mountain, and you can gaze out at the interior landscape of seating areas covered with pergolas to shield them from the afternoon sun. White multi-level mezzanines on either side contain more conventional office spaces. Grasses, vines, and shrubs spill out of long built-in planters that cover virtually every surface of this space, including a sizable green wall. Triangular skylights overhead allow daylight to pierce the roof and keep the plants happy.Inside the Gensler-designed Nvidia Voyager headquarters in Santa Clara, California.At the peak of the mountain is a faceted black structure meant to evoke the image of an abstracted volcano. Inside this \u201ccaldera\u201d is a long live-edge wooden table for meetings. As you climb down the back, you see more seating areas, conference tables, and an amphitheater where employees watch presentations. Outside the Voyager but beneath the \u201ctrellis\u201d (a canopy covered in solar panels), employees enjoy elevated \u201cbird nest\u201d areas to meet and lounge. These circular enclosures contain sculptural benches, caf\u00e9 tables, and an open roof that floods the space with sunlight. Four acres of garden separate the Voyager from the Endeavor.Living wall inside the Gensler-designed Nvidia Voyager HQ building. AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementIt\u2019s an unusual design, but Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang wanted a building that gave every employee a view. All offices face outside windows, and employees can choose to work anywhere on campus, not just at stationary desks. The plans were launched well before the pandemic began, but now that the campus is complete, Nvidia sees it as a worthwhile investment. Sure, a lot of employees are choosing to work from home, but if you want to draw your employees back to the office, a gorgeous design like this one is a great way to do it.If you haven\u2019t seen inside the Endeavor, it\u2019s pretty worth checking out. Architecture firm Gensler designed it around a glass-enclosed elevator core that whisks employees up from an underground parking lot and into a faceted black metal \u201ccocoon\u201d that forms the heart of the building. Just like the Voyager, the Endeavor features a multitude of skylights.Inside the other Gensler-designed Nvidia HQ building \u2014 the futuristic Endeavor.\u201cWe worked hard to get the right specifications of glass makeup to allow us the right quality of diffused and soft sunlight in the space,\u201d says Hao Ko, principal and managing director at Gensler. \u201cThe final result \u2014 where the daylighting is evenly dispersed throughout and evenly experienced by everyone \u2014 is a testament to the upfront work we did in design.\u201dCheck out the full tour of the new Voyager building over at CNET.The post Nvidia\u2019s Voyager HQ Seduces WFH Employees Back with a Dazzling Design first appeared on Dornob.AdvertisementAbout Our AdsSolve the daily Crossword33,571 people played the daily Crossword recently.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nThe global GPU market is appears to be stabilizing, even as shipment numbers fell between Q4 2021 and Q1 2022.According to new research from Jon Peddie Research (JPR) and reported on by Windows Central, total GPU shipments from AMD, Intel, and Nvidia fell by 6.2% from Q4 2021 to Q1 2022 with a total number of 96 million units shipped during that time period.\u00a0AMD shipments decreased by 1.5%, Intel's by 8.7%, but Nvidia's shipments actually increased by 3.2%. The JPR report attributed the drop in shipments to various factors such as the political situations in China and Ukraine. While a descrease in shipments might sound like negative news, the decline is far less than the normal decline typically seen during the same period; the report points out that the 10-year median decline during this period is 10.2%.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia in 2024: year in review\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's RTX 5000 GPUs continue to face severe supply issues, with RTX 5070 Ti reportedly being even worse for launch stock than the RTX 5080\n\n\n\nThe JPR report also predicts a compound annual growth rate of 6.3% between 2022-2026 as it forecasts solid growth later in the year.Analysis: How is the GPU market faring?\u00a0This year has been a complicated one for GPU manufacturers in general, as prices have sharply declined while . Going by German retailer 3D Center sales data, graphics card prices have dipped on average by 13%.\u00a0AMD and Nvidia's best graphics cards were selling at an 83% and 87% premium, respectively, over their official retail prices back in December 2021. Now the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3000 series is at about 19% over MSRP, while AMD's Radeon RX 6000 series is now 12% over MSRP.Despite this, it seems that Team Green is holding its lead over Team Red according to retailer Newegg\u2019s top ten sellers. The list shows that all ten slots are taken up by Nvidia GPUs; in fact the top 20 list is flush with Nvidia Ampere cards with one lone exception: the MSI Mech Radeon RX 6600, coming in at number 20.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.So it seems that there are signs of a general decline in revenue but despite this, Nvidia is maintaining its strong lead against archrival AMD and we don\u2019t expect that to change anytime soon. Better still, the decline in prices is a sign that the supply of graphics cards is increasing, which makes us more hopeful about the upcoming launch of the Nvidia Lovelace cards later this year.Nvidia CEO says there\u2019s no magic cure for GPU shortage that\u2019ll last until 2023\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\nAMD\n\n\nAllisa JamesSocial Links NavigationComputing Staff WriterNamed by the CTA as a CES 2023 Media Trailblazer, Allisa is a Computing Staff Writer who covers breaking news and rumors in the computing industry, as well as reviews, hands-on previews, featured articles, and the latest deals and trends.

READY Robotics, pioneers in software-defined automation, today announced a strategic investment from NVIDIA, the leader in accelerated computing technology.\n\"Manufacturing has been held back for decades by software silos between robot vendors. We've broken down those barriers with a standard interface that simplifies deployment for enterprises and dramatically increases the market opportunity for the automation industry,\" said Ben Gibbs, CEO and Co-Founder of READY Robotics.\n\"For factory workers, that interface is a no-code tablet which allows them to upskill to become a robot programmer within weeks,\" he continued. \"For software developers, it's a standard API that unlocks data streams from over 3 million compatible robots deployed today.\"\nThe investment accelerates the collaboration between READY Robotics and NVIDIA, which includes a READY Robotics Forge/OS integration with NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122\u00a0Isaac Sim to simplify development and accelerate time-to-market of industrial automation deployments.\nManufacturing enterprises want robust deployments that embody their competitive advantage, while being flexible enough to meet the demands of digital supply chains. READY Robotics provides a foundation that enables software developers to meet these demands. By enabling integration with processing at the edge, these solutions can offer increased efficiency without compromising on privacy, latency or data security.\nNVIDIA is joined by existing Micron Technology, as well as new investor SIP Global Partners, a cross-border venture fund strategically focused on helping startups expand into Asian markets by working with large industrial conglomerates. The new investment allows READY Robotics to continue improving its core Forge/OS 5 platform as well as expanding to support a growing ecosystem of partners and developers.\n\nMeet us at Automate 2022\n\nExperience READY Robotics and NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac Sim in action together at booth 2783 of Automate 2022 in Detroit, MI, from June 6-9.\n\nAbout READY Robotics\n\nWe don't make robots. We make robots better. READY is the developer of Forge/OS, the industrial OS for robots and automation.\nhttps://www.ready-robotics.com/\nSOURCE READY Robotics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWANT YOUR COMPANY'S NEWS FEATURED ON PRNEWSWIRE.COM?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            440k+\nNewsrooms\u00a0&\nInfluencers\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            9k+\nDigital\u00a0Media\nOutlets\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            270k+\nJournalists\nOpted In\n                        \n\n\n\nGET STARTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nModal title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact PR Newswire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall PR Newswire at 888-776-0942\n                \n                from 8 AM - 9 PM ET\n            \n\nChat with an Expert\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n                \n\n\nGeneral Inquiries\n\n\nEditorial Bureaus\n\n\nPartnerships\n\n\nMedia Inquiries\n\n\nWorldwide Offices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\n\nFor Marketers\n\n\nFor Public Relations\n\n\nFor IR & Compliance\n\n\nFor Agency\n\n\nFor Small Business\n\n\nAll Products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\nAbout PR Newswire\n\n\nAbout Cision\n\n\nBecome a Publishing Partner\n\n\nBecome a Channel Partner\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nAccessibility Statement\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Sites\n                \n\n\nAsia\n\n\nAPAC\n\n\nAPAC - Traditional Chinese\n\n\nBrazil\n\n\nCanada\n\n\nCzech\n\n\nDenmark\n\n\nFinland\n\n\nFrance\n\n\nGermany\n\n\nIndia\n\n\nIndonesia\n\n\nIsrael\n\n\nKorea\n\n\nItaly\n\n\nJapan\n\n\nMexico\n\n\nMiddle East\n\n\nMiddle East - Arabic\n\n\nNetherlands\n\n\nNorway\n\n\nPoland\n\n\nPortugal\n\n\nRussia\n\n\nSlovakia\n\n\nSpain\n\n\nSweden\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Services\n\n\n\nAll New Releases\n\n\nOnline Member Center\n\n\nProfNet\n\n\nData Privacy\n\n\n\n\nDo not sell or share my personal information:\n\nSubmit via [email\u00a0protected]\u00a0\nCall Privacy toll-free: 877-297-8921\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact PR Newswire\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\nMy Services \n\nAll News Releases\n\nOnline Member Center\n\nProfNet\n\n\n\n\n\n Call PR Newswire at\n    \t888-776-0942\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nInformation Security Policy\nSite Map\nRSS\nCookie Settings\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025\u00a0Cision\u00a0US Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Photo illustration by Tom's Hardware, images by Nvidia, AMD, Shutterstock)\n\n\n\n\nAMD vs Nvidia. If you're building a gaming PC, you'll inevitably be faced with choosing between the two GPU heavyweights. Both companies make GPUs that power the best graphics cards, fighting for supremacy in our GPU benchmarks hierarchy. AMD vs Nvidia isn't the only decision you\u2019ll need to make when building a PC, of course. You'll also need to choose between AMD vs Intel CPUs. Our focus here will be on graphics, however, and we'll be looking at performance, features, drivers and software, power and efficiency, pricing and more.\n\nThe AMD vs Nvidia flame wars have been cooking since the late 90s, with Nvidia currently leading in the GPU arena by many metrics. Its graphics cards account for the majority of GPUs on the Steam Hardware Survey, for example, and in terms of pure finances, Nvidia is worth roughly three times as much as AMD (with a large chunk of AMD's resources devoted to CPUs).\n\nBut we're not interested in the distant past or finances. We want to find a winner in the current battle of AMD vs Nvidia GPUs. That primarily means looking at AMD Big Navi and Nvidia Ampere graphics cards \u2014 and maybe one of these days, we'll even need to add Intel Arc into the mix.\n\nIt's important to keep the big picture in view throughout this analysis. We're not just focusing on the fastest GPU, or the most power-efficient GPU, or the best bang-for-the buck GPU. We'll consider all of the factors in each category, from budget to mid-range to high-end and extreme GPUs, along with the tech behind the GPUs. We will declare a winner today, but of course this isn't the end of the war. It's more like owning the heavyweight GPU title: A victory today doesn't mean your opponent won't come back leaner and meaner next year.\n\nWith that preamble out of the way, let's pull out the boxing gloves and go the rounds with AMD vs Nvidia.AMD vs Nvidia: Gaming Performance\u00a0For decades, faster GPUs have enabled game developers to create increasingly detailed and complex worlds. While you can find everything from budget GPUs to high-end offerings from both AMD and Nvidia, when it comes to outright performance, Nvidia has a slight overall lead thanks to the chunky GeForce RTX 3090 Ti.\n\nBeyond the pole position, however, it's a closer match. If you look at our GPU benchmarks hierarchy, you'll see that AMD's RX 6950 XT owns the top spot at 1080p and 1440p, and Nvidia only wins at 4K or in ray tracing games. Of the top ten fastest GPUs, four are AMD and six are Nvidia, but part of that is thanks to quantity rather than truly different GPUs \u2014 the RTX 3080 12GB takes a bit of RTX 3080 Ti and a bit of RTX 3080 and mixes them together into a card that ended up matching the 3080 Ti at a lower price point.\n\nOf course, the main benchmarks only look at games running APIs and settings that work on all GPUs, which means we haven't included ray tracing or DLSS in the results. We also haven't included any FSR results, and CPU bottlenecks certainly play a role at lower resolutions. Here's the updated 2022 performance rankings, showing the overall performance from eight games and four settings/resolutions combinations four our standard test suite, and four more charts for our ray tracing suite that uses six complex DXR (DirectX Raytracing) games.Image 1 of 8(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Nvidia's RTX 3090 Ti isn't remotely affordable, while the GeForce RTX 3080 and Radeon RX 6800 XT represent a better view of performance. Those two trade blows in traditional rasterization games, with AMD taking a slight lead, while Nvidia easily jumps ahead \u2014 often by a large margin \u2014 as soon as ray tracing and/or DLSS get turned on. We give Nvidia a slight lead at the top of the performance ladder, but that's not the only category to consider.\n\nLooking at the mainstream market ($400, give or take), things get a bit messy. AMD's Radeon RX 6700 XT takes on the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, with slightly better performance \u2014 provided once again that we ignore RT and DLSS. In our review, we called it a net tie. However, while AMD's card theoretically costs 20% more than Nvidia's offering, in practice pricing actually favors AMD right now ($480 vs. $500 at the time of writing).\n\nOlder model GPUs are mostly outclassed by the new arrivals, so the best pairing would be pitting the RTX 3050 against the RX 6600, both of which can be had for around $300 (never mind MSRPs). AMD's GPU crushes the 3050 in standard gaming performance by 25\u201335%, and while ray tracing does favor the Nvidia GPUs by 7\u201315%, that's far less critical for this category.What about budget offerings, like stuff for under $200? Sadly, we have to wonder where all the good budget GPUs have gone. The RX 6500 XT and RX 6400 sell for under $200, but performance is generally worse than the old RX 5500 XT 8GB and GTX 1660, instead going up against the GTX 1650 and 1650 Super. AMD's cards are easy enough to find brand new, while Nvidia's GTX 16-series parts are now coming up on three years old and supply and availability can be a bit spotty. Still, Newegg has GTX 1650 Super for $200, effectively making the budget sector a tie.\n\nWinner: Tie This is simply too close to call, as there are so many ways to split things. Nvidia wins for 4K and ray tracing performance, AMD wins for standard 1080p and 1440p gaming, and also in performance at similar high-end and mid-range price points. DLSS also counts in Nvidia's favor, however, and while FSR 2.0 might be relatively competitive, it works on any GPU.AMD vs Nvidia: Power Consumption and Efficiency\u00a0Prior to AMD's Navi, GPU power efficiency was decidedly in favor of Nvidia. But Navi changed all that, and Big Navi has further improved AMD's efficiency. Using chips built with TSMC's 7nm FinFET process and a new architecture that delivered 50% better performance per watt, Navi started to close the gap. Except, it was so far behind that even a 50% improvement didn't fully address the efficiency deficiency.\n\nBut Nvidia's Ampere architecture pushed higher clocks at the cost of efficiency, while AMD's Big Navi gets a healthy boost in efficiency from the Infinity Cache. The net result is that Ampere and Big Navi are pretty close to tied.\n\nUsing Powenetics hardware to capture the real graphics card power use of GPUs, we've tested all of the current and recent graphics cards from both companies. We've also tested third party cards from both sides, but we'll confine the charts to the reference designs as much as possible.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)While power use favored Nvidia's older GPUs, sometimes by a wide margin, the differences on the latest generation hardware go the other way. RTX 3090 Ti uses the most power, followed by the RX 6950 XT, RTX 3080 12GB (custom card), and then we get the RTX 3090, 3080 Ti, and 3080. AMD's RX 6900 XT and 6800 XT come next, before we start getting to previous generation GPUs.\n\nIt's more difficult to declare a winner outside of the extreme performance range. AMD's RX 6700 XT uses a bit more power than the RTX 3060 Ti and a bit less than the RTX 3070, but they're all in a 10W range. Drop down to the RTX 3060 and RTX 3050 against the RX 6600 XT and RX 6600, and power use tracks pretty closely with performance.Among budget GPUs, the RX 6500 XT uses more power than the GTX 1650, but the RX 6400 is the only truly modern GPU that doesn't need at least a PCIe 6-pin power connector.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Winner: AMD Focusing just on the current generation AMD Big Navi and Nvidia Ampere GPUs, power and efficiency are relatively close. AMD takes a slight lead at the top, the middle's a tie, and AMD wins in the budget sector as well, giving it the overall nod. TSMC's N7 process also factors in, helping out AMD, while Nvidia's use of Samsung 8N likely accounts for reduced overall efficiency.AMD vs Nvidia: Featured Technology\u00a0Most of the features supported by AMD and Nvidia seem similar, though the implementations do vary. Both support ray tracing now, which allows for some nice effects, but it's not required to get a good gaming experience. Nvidia's DLSS is a bigger factor, as FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) doesn't look as good in the FSR 1.0 implementation, while FSR 2.0 isn't widely adopted yet \u2014 and in either case, FSR works on AMD and Nvidia GPUs, and even Intel integrated graphics. That's actually a point to AMD for not locking people into its hardware, but practically speaking there are a lot of games with DLSS support and it can be an nice extra.\n\nThere are other aspects as well. G-Sync takes on FreeSync, Radeon Anti-Lag goes up against Nvidia's ultra-low latency mode plus Reflex, Radeon Super Resolution (RSR) works in a similar way to Nvidia Image Scaling (NIS), and there other areas where features effectively match up as well.These aren't the rays you're looking to trace. (Image credit: Shutterstock)Supporting the same APIs and similar hardware features doesn't make things equivalent, however. Ampere and RDNA2 also support mesh shaders and variable rate shading (VRS), as well as some other features that are all part of the DirectX 12 Ultimate spec. But Nvidia's performance in ray tracing tends to be quite a bit higher than AMD, even without DLSS.\n\nWhile FreeSync and G-Sync might seem equivalent on the surface, the best G-Sync displays are almost invariably higher quality and better latency than FreeSync displays. The same goes for AMD's anti-lag and Nvidia's ultra-low latency and Reflex: Similar in theory, but in practice Reflex implementations come out on top.\n\nVideo encoding and decoding are another important aspect, and here Nvidia definitely comes out ahead. The Turing and Ampere codecs support higher-quality encodes and lower GPU utilization, both good things. There's no need for CPU-based video encoding with Nvidia's latest GPUs. AMD's budget Navi 24 chips lack some key video encoding features as well.\n\nThere is one area where AMD has a clear advantage, though it's also perhaps to AMD's detriment. TSMC's N7 process that AMD uses for RDNA2 (and RDNA and Zen 3 and the PS5/XSX) chips clearly delivers better performance and power characteristics than Samsung's custom 8N (really just an improved version of Samsung's 10LPP process). The catch being that lots of other companies also want to partake of TSMC's goodness \u2014 AMD, Apple, Nvidia GA100, Qualcomm, and even Intel all use TSMC, along with various other smaller players. This becomes a problem when TSMC doesn't have enough capacity to meet the demands of all of those companies.\n\nWinner: Nvidia While AMD and Nvidia have superficial parity on most features, Nvidia's implementations are generally superior \u2014 and cost more. G-Sync, Reflex, DLSS, and NVENC all end up being at least slightly better than AMD's alternatives.AMD vs Nvidia: Drivers and Software\u00a0Trying to determine a clear winner in the drivers and software category is difficult. Quite a few people previously encountered black screen issues with AMD drivers on RX 5000 Navi series GPUs, while others didn't have any difficulties. Newer drivers have fixed these problems, as far as we can tell. Nvidia drivers aren't foolproof either, and depending on the game and hardware, issues crop up for both companies. But is one company doing better with drivers?\u00a0(Image credit: Shutterstock)AMD makes a lot of noise about its yearly driver overhaul. The Radeon Adrenalin 2020 drivers consolidated everything under one large umbrella, aiming to simplify things, though it can be confusing at first if you're used to the older drivers. AMD tends to skip WHQL (Windows Hardware Quality Labs) testing, which means fewer hoops to jump through and potentially more bugs slip through, but Microsoft's insurance of a minimum level of functionality doesn't really mean much for gaming purposes.\n\nYou can generally count on at least one new AMD driver per month, often more if there are major game launches. Nvidia's driver schedule follows a similar cadence. You'll get new drivers for major game launches or new graphics card hardware. Nvidia's releases (outside of rare hotfixes) are all WHQL certified, and Nvidia also has a separate Studio Driver branch for content creators.\n\nOne of the big differences between AMD and Nvidia drivers is that Nvidia has two separate user interfaces. The Nvidia Control Panel handles things like resolutions and certain graphics settings, while GeForce Experience tackles game optimizations, driver updates, and extra features including ShadowPlay, Ansel, NIS, and more. Annoyingly, you have to log in and solve a captcha prompt to use GeForce Experience, which is something I've done more times than I\u2019d ever want to count. Just say no to data mining plus drivers.\n\nWinner: Tie We prefer AMD's unified driver approach, as it's one less interface to navigate, but there's just so much stuff in the current releases. Nvidia's Q&A is arguably better, though plenty of bugs and issues end up slipping through on both sides. Quantifying drivers ends up being an incredibly subjective affair, however, so we're calling this one a draw as well.AMD vs Nvidia: Pricing and AvailabilityWho offers the better value in the battle of AMD vs Nvidia? The past two years have been a bit of a joke (not a funny one, either), but things are now greatly improved. You can find all the latest graphics cards in stock at retail now, with many models selling at or below MSRP. But of the \"many\" selling at or below MSRP, far more are using AMD GPUs than Nvidia GPUs, with only the extremely priced RTX 3080 Ti and above selling below MSRP from Team Green.\n\nOur GPU pricing index looks at eBay pricing as an alternative, but it's no longer required. In general, the simple fact is that the best values are currently from AMD, with the RX 6600, RX 6600 XT, RX 6650 XT, RX 6700 XT, and RX 6750 XT all ranking near the top of the FPS per dollar charts. Nvidia's RTX 3060, 3050, and 3060 Ti aren't horribly option, but you're paying about 15\u201325% more in terms of FPS per dollar (and getting DLSS for that money).(Image credit: Shutterstock)At the top of the pricing spectrum, the RTX 3090 Ti is the unquestioned worst value, priced at over $1,800 and only delivering slightly more performance than the RTX 3080 Ti. AMD's RX 6950 XT doesn't cost nearly as much and competes well against the 3080 Ti, but as we go down the pricing scale things begin to favor AMD a lot more.\n\nRight now, the RX 6600 takes top honors with around 0.23 fps per dollar spent. Nvidia's highest ranking GPUs come from its previous generation Turing RTX 20-series, where the RTX 2060 scores 0.196 FPS/$, but the highest RTX 30-series part only rates 0.176 FPS/$. AMD's RX 6500 XT is right in the mix for a budget card, also at 0.176 FPS/$.\n\nWinner: AMD With the supply of graphics cards greatly improving, at least partly thanks to cryptocurrency mining profitability being in the dumps, the value proposition finally becomes meaningful again for the first time in about two years. GPU prices continue to drop, but for now AMD's RX 6000-series cards represent a better value than Nvidia's RTX 30-series parts.Swipe to scroll horizontallyRoundNvidia GeForceAMD RadeonGaming Performance\u2717\u2717Power ConsumptionRow 1 - Cell 1 \u2717Featured Technology\u2717Row 2 - Cell 2 Drivers and Software\u2717\u2717Price and ValueRow 4 - Cell 1 \u2717Total34AMD vs Nvidia: Bottom Line\u00a0With an overall score of four to three, AMD squeaks out a victory and lays claim to the king of the GPU world crown. Cue the band and light the fireworks. That doesn't mean AMD GPUs are a better choice in every case, and there's a lot of fuzzy math and subjectivity involved, but you should be well served by Team Red's RDNA 2 GPUs \u2014 and just about equally well served by Team Green.\n\nOverall, which GPU you prefer will likely come down to personal preference rather than hard numbers. AMD clearly wins most match ups (comparing similar priced cards) in standard benchmarks, but it falls behind in ray tracing games and DLSS still factors in. We could certainly see people being willing to pay 10\u201315% more money to get an Nvidia card, even if it may not technically be the \"best\" choice.\n\nAt this point, we're now looking forward to the future RDNA 3 and Ada Lovelace graphics cards, both of which we expect to see before the end of the year. There are still too many unknowns to even venture a guess at who will be on top by the end of the year, but hopefully the end of 2022 ends up being far better for gamers looking to upgrade their GPU than 2020 and 2021 were.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nray tracing\nNVIDIA RTX\nDrivers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (54)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

I've been gaming on Linux since 2006 with both Nvidia and AMD cards, and right now, the biggest hurdle I had right after rebuilding my rig was, format and install the new system boot, install the very latest developer build for the Mesa drivers (just because, and a 60 Mb download that contains the very latest fixes for the very latest games is good), install Steam (3 clicks, login), install Doom Eternal and play it, I do mean the BIGGEST problem I had with that process was setting up a Bethesda account...\nSaid game just ran beautifully @1440p Ultra Nightmare on a reference RX480 8Gb.\nDoing the same for Nvidia required me to enable proprietary drivers, download a compiler and a linker along with the kernel's symbols, determine which driver version was best for my card (because it's not the very latest model, see), wait for the 500 Mb download to finish, wait for the compilation to end, reboot, redefine my monitor's setup in Nvidia's proprietary tool and then hope it would work (which it doesn't always).\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnofanneeded\n\n\nWell had AMD bought Nvidia instead of ATI , we would have said AMD is the best lol. it is ATI team guys, bought and inseted in AMD.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspongiemaster\n\n\nmitch074 said:Oooh, butthurt much.

GeForce NOW transforms nearly any Mac into a high-end gaming rig, rendering games at full quality and streaming them to Macbook Pros, Macbook Airs, iMacs and Mac Minis.\nOn GeForce NOW, you play the real PC versions of games without having to worry if something has been ported to Mac. Since the native PC version of games streams straight from the cloud, gamers can upgrade to the newest Apple hardware with confidence.\nGeForce NOW RTX 3080 members can play on M1 Mac laptops at up to 1600p, or up to 4K resolution on supported external displays. Stream with even longer sessions lengths \u2014 up to eight hours. Members on RTX 3080 and Priority plans can even play with RTX ON for supported games, experiencing modern classics like Cyberpunk 2077 and Control with real-time ray tracing. No PC required.\nGame saves are synced across each digital store for supported games, so members can play on Macs, as well as any other supported device, without losing progress.\nJoin today to see what it\u2019s like to have the best of both PC and Mac worlds.\nGet Started With Genshin Impact\nThis week brings the release of Genshin Impact, as well as rewards for Travelers playing on GeForce NOW.\nEmbark on a journey as a Traveler from another world and search for a missing sibling in the fantastic continent of Teyvat. Explore immersive landscapes, dive deep into rich quests alongside iconic characters and complete daily challenges, streaming across supported PCs, Macs and Chromebooks.\nRTX 3080 members can even play with ultra-low latency, streaming at 1440p and 120 frames per second or in 4K resolution at 60 FPS on the PC and Mac apps.\nStart the adventure off right with rewards in \u201cGenshin Impact.\u201d\nMembers who\u2019ve opted in to rewards will receive an email for a starter kit that can be claimed through the NVIDIA Rewards redemption portal. The kit will become available in game once players reach Adventure Rank 10.\nThe reward includes 10,000 Mora to purchase various items, five Fine Enhancement Ores to enhance weapons, three Squirrel Fish and three Northern Apple Stews for fuel, and 10 Adventurer\u2019s Experience points to level up characters.\nGetting membership rewards for streaming games on the cloud is easy. Log in to your NVIDIA account and select \u201cGEFORCE NOW\u201d from the header, then scroll down to \u201cREWARDS\u201d and click the \u201cUPDATE REWARDS SETTINGS\u201d button.

Feet of Lab Space \n          How we test\n            CNET\u2019s expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month, building on more than a quarter century of expertise.   \n      2023\n    Nvidia's GeForce Now cloud gaming service has been constantly evolving since I first reviewed it in October 2021 and even more since I\u00a0first laid hands on it in November 2020, and that development in a still-growing category like cloud gaming is more important to me than all the splashy launch partnerships and big ambitions. Because of its smart set of plan options, solid performance and big and growing list of supported games, along with Nvidia's aggressive strategy for its data center and GPU businesses -- the bedrock on which GeForce Now is built -- I'm giving it an Editors' Choice Award and put it on our list of best cloud-gaming services for gamers who've amassed large game libraries and want to play them in more places or who don't want to be beholden to a capricious rotation of available games.Though it now supports 4K/60fps, the option for 1440p/120 frames per second is part of what's smart. Though 4K sounds better, 1440p at 120fps plays better when you're gaming over a network, making it a really good compromise when 1080p doesn't work for you. It's good for the wider audience of gamers and recent laptop buyers, for whom screens with 2,560x1,440- or 1,600-pixel resolutions and fast refresh are overtaking FHD (1080p). And while sim games may benefit from higher resolutions more than from faster screen rendering, the bulk of games need 120fps more than they need 4K.  I still think it's an iffy decision to buy a game that you'll only be able to play via GeForce Now. But if you already own games you want to use with GeForce Now, on the other hand, there's little downside and a lot of upside. That's also true if you're only planning to play free games such as Fortnite or DOTA 2.

That's a more expensive approach, though it offers one perk the others don't: It's a full-fledged system with persistent local storage.\u00a0 You can link Ubisoft, Epic and Steam accounts within the app so you don't have to sign in to those every time you launch the game. But because GeForce Now uses temporary virtual machines, anything that would normally be saved to your local storage either needs to be synced with the cloud by the game store or publisher or it's blowin' in the wind.  How GeForce Now works To use it, you boot up the appropriate app for\u00a0Android\u00a0(including phones and TVs), Windows or Mac OS, or go to the website on a Chromebook, iPhone or iPad. Microsoft Edge support, which lets it work on an Xbox, is currently in beta. There are also about 117 supported free-to-play games.\u00a0    \n      Enlarge Image\n             A list of platforms supported by GeForce Now as of May 25. Screenshot by Lori Grunin/CNETYou find a supported game that's in one of your game libraries -- primarily on\u00a0Steam\u00a0and\u00a0Epic Games Store, but also\u00a0GOG as well as launchers for\u00a0Ubisoft Connect and Origin-- and commence play. The app connects to the closest data center, which hosts the engine to render the games and stream them to you. Gameplay syncing and account management are handled by the respective game launchers, not Nvidia.Depending upon your plan, there may be a bit of a wait, beyond the typical matchmaking delay. And there are still some big publisher holes, such as Electronic Arts (and its franchise formerly known as \"FIFA\"), Activision/Blizzard\u00a0(Call of Duty, Overwatch), Bandai Namco\u00a0(Elden Ring) and\u00a0Rockstar Games (Grand Theft Auto).      Nvidia (and Microsoft) brought Fortnite gameplay back to Apple's mobile devices. Since it's via Safari, Apple's App Store ban against Fortnite doesn't apply. Lori Grunin/CNETYou might ask why it requires specific support in order to play your own games via GeForce Now. There are a lot of reasons, but ultimately it comes down to two: optimization and licensing.\u00a0 A game frequently needs to be streamlined for efficient streamed play, and for high-profile games both Nvidia and the publisher have an incentive to make sure you have the best experience possible. That might require enabling adaptive sync, turning on ray tracing and finding ways to decrease latency.\u00a0 And even though you \"own\" your games, both Nvidia and the publisher frequently have to work out appropriate licensing not just for the game, but for all assets subject to third-party rights, notably music. That's also why a game might leave the service (or any service, for that matter). I haven't tracked games which have left the service in a while, but I don't think there are a lot, and certainly fewer than a vault like Xbox Game Pass where games leave on a monthly basis. A major departure that is happening on July 1, 2022, is God of War (on Epic or Steam). But in an interesting licensing twist, if you start the game before then, you retain the right to play it on GeForce Now. It's a feature of the service, though it won't apply for every game.\u00a0In the case of God of War, Nvidia explained: \"Members who have started playing a game at least once on GeForce NOW [can] continue playing it, even after the game has been removed for users who have not played it.\" GeForce Now's lack of a plan-determined game vault makes that sort of granular availability license possible, or at least easier to set up. Plan choices With the Free plan you can play any game you own or any of the free-to-play games for free, but it's limited to a single-hour session and you're at the bottom of the list for getting onto the server. Still, seeing GeForce Now at its worst is a good way to figure out if the service is for you. The Priority plan is probably the best option for most people, providing a similar experience to what you might get from an entry-to- midrange gaming laptop. Since it includes 6-hour sessions and better access to the faster servers as well as support for ray tracing, if you only want to use GeForce Now on a phone for noncompetitive play, Priority is all you need. And it works out to a reasonable $8.33 to $10 per month, depending on your renewal frequency.If you need better response time and either higher frame rates or resolution or both, Nvidia's RTX 3080 plan makes more sense if your budget is up to it, with front-of-the-line access to the best servers, an 8-hour session length and up to 4K/60fps or 1440p/120fps resolution and frame rates. In a lot of cases Nvidia uses upscaling to achieve the better frame rates and resolutions, but at this point the network still has a more degrading influence over quality than anything going on on the back end. If you have a GeForce GTX 10-series or later GPU, it can take advantage of better DLSS upscaling (it requires special decoding on your end, hence the GeForce GPU).GeForce Now plans   FreePriorityRTX 3080 Price Free$50 for 6 months or $10 a month$100 for 6 months or $20 per monthMax quality (up to) 1080p/60fps1080p/60fps, RTX ray-tracing acceleration1440p/120fps and 4K/60fps on PC and Mac (1600p on MacBooks; 4K/60fps with HDR and 7.1 surround audio on Nvidia Shield, 120fps on select Android devices; RTX ray tracing accelerationSession length 1 hour6 hours8 hoursAccess type Standard access to basic serversPriority access to premium serversExclusive access to top servers    RTX 3080 works out to a minimum of $16.67 a month, which is a lot more expensive than\u00a0Amazon Luna\u00a0or\u00a0Google Stadia Pro, both $10 a month, or even Microsoft's $15-per-month\u00a0Xbox Game Pass Ultimate\u00a0(including its Game Pass Cloud Gaming), all of which include\u00a0\n  games\n. For $20, you can try it out for a month to see if it's worth it.\u00a0On the other hand, GFN doesn't have any a la carte subscription charges, like Luna's and Stadia's for Ubisoft Plus. Then again, you don't have access to Ubisoft Plus with GFN.Playing at 1440p and 120Hz has higher minimum requirements than the lower tiers, unsurprisingly. Nvidia recommends at least 35Mbps bandwidth; for 4K gaming it recommends 40Mbps. (Here's a\u00a0full list of system requirements.) Keep in mind that bandwidth is only one of the variables that can affect your experience, and Nvidia doesn't specify any maximum packet loss or ping or maximum jitter specs.When you run the in-app network test on mobile, it specifies less than 2% packet loss (less than 1% recommended), less than 80ms jitter (less than 40ms recommended) and less than 80ms ping (less than 40ms recommended).\u00a0     GeForce Now's network test results for a phone showing what it considers excellent  network performance. Screenshot by Lori Grunin/CNETEven meeting those doesn't guarantee a perfect experience, since network conditions change from millisecond to millisecond, and many times I've started with perfect stats only to have them worsen significantly midgame. That's not unique to GFN, though. The pricier the plan the more power Nvidia throws behind mitigating whatever network issues it can.Like competitors, Nvidia recommends a wired connection for best performance. But I think needing to recommend Ethernet for cloud gaming on anything other than a stationary living-room console or device like the Shield is a strike against all these services, since it's inconvenient or impossible for most players. My router is in the living room but far from anyplace to game comfortably without running a cable across the room (a hospital visit waiting to happen).  Nvidia novelties All GFN gamers, regardless of plan, benefit from Nvidia's adaptive sync support, which uses server-side\u00a0G-Sync\u00a0to match frames arriving at your screen with the rate at which your screen updates to reduce display artifacts. Traditional adaptive sync requires frequent communication between the GPU and monitor in order to dynamically match gameplay frame rates with the speed at which your monitor can update. For services or plans locked to 60fps, adaptive refresh isn't as necessary as for the variable refresh tiers, though.Nvidia also uses its Reflex Latency Analyzer technology for the RTX 3080 tier, which the company says can reduce latency to 60ms or less for a chunk of gamers who subscribe to that plan and have 144Hz monitors.\u00a0The company also makes use of some of this back-end technology for its Highlights, brief game clip recordings that you can share. (The Highlights feature requires game-level support, though, and only a fraction of the games work with it, even though it launched in September 2021.) It also supports Discord Rich Presence for in-game status and invites.Cloud gaming hasn't yet reached the point where any service can sit back and relax. Many of the device issues have been worked out, but they still have to deal with game support strategy and network latency. Nvidia's GeForce Now has the best combination of performance, game support and value we've seen thus far.    \n    Gaming Guides\n   \n      Virtual Reality Gaming\n     \n  \n          Best VR Headsets\n        \n          Best Meta Quest 2 Games and Experiences\n        \n          Best VR Games\n        \n          Best Playstation VR 2 Deals\n        \n          Meta Quest 2 Review\n        \n      PlayStation\n     \n  \n          PS5 Restock Tracker\n        \n          Playstation Plus Review\n        \n          Best PS5 Games\n        \n      Xbox\n     \n  \n          Best Xbox Series X S Controller\n        \n          Xbox GamePass Ultimate Review\n        \n      Other Gaming\n     \n  \n          Best Nintendo Switch Controller\n        \n          Best Cloud Gaming Services\n        \n          Best Gaming Chair\n        \n          Nintendo Switch OLED Review\n        \n          Best Gaming Keyboard\n        \n      Video Games\n     \n  \n          Best Online Games to Play with Friends\n        \n          Video Game Deals\n        \n          Best VR Games\n        \n          Best Xbox Series X Games\n        \n          Best PS5 Games\n           LORI GRUNIN  Senior Editor / Advice I've been reviewing hardware and software, devising testing methodology and handed out buying advice for what seems like forever; I'm currently absorbed by computers and gaming hardware, but previously spent many years concentrating on cameras.

This November, Fatshark leaps thousands of years into the future to bring gamers Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, the hotly-anticipated follow up set during the time of the Space Marines.\nHead to the industrial city of Tertium to combat the forces of Chaos, using Vermintide 2\u2019s lauded melee system and a range of deadly Warhammer 40,000 weapons. Personalize your playstyle with a character creation system, and delve deep into the city to put a stop to the horrors that lurk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn advance of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide\u2019s November 30th launch, NVIDIA and Fatshark have formed a partnership to deliver the definitive experience to GeForce RTX gamers, enhancing their co-op adventures with NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex, and advanced ray tracing effects. In other words, you\u2019ll receive the highest levels of performance, the smoothest gameplay, and the highest-fidelity graphics.\nWith NVIDIA DLSS, our critically acclaimed AI-powered tech, your performance will get even faster, without compromising image quality. NVIDIA DLSS is used in over 180 games, where it accelerates performance by up to 3X.\nSmooth, responsive gameplay is as-important as having a high frame rate, and to ensure Warhammer 40,000: Darktide\u2019s high-intensity action is the smoothest around, we\u2019re also bringing NVIDIA Reflex to the party. This feature reduces system latency, meaning your actions occur faster, which makes gameplay feel snappier and more enjoyable. Reflex is a comparatively new NVIDIA technology, but it\u2019s already one of the fastest to be adopted, with integrations already available in the biggest games and franchises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is a stunningly-rendered game. But if you have a GeForce RTX graphics card, desktop or laptop, you can take those visuals to new heights with the addition of ray-traced reflections, and amazing RTX Global Illumination (RTXGI) effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if you don\u2019t have a GeForce RTX PC or laptop, you can still enjoy Warhammer 40,000: Darktide with #RTXON by streaming it from the cloud thanks to NVIDIA GeForce NOW. Members can play over 1,000 of the real and full PC versions of games they already own from Steam, Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect, and GOG.com.\nGeForce NOW\u2019s RTX 3080 Membership gives you the power of a GeForce RTX 3080-class PC in the cloud, enabling streaming sessions at up to 1440p on PC and Mac, 4K HDR on NVIDIA SHIELD, and up to 120 FPS on select android devices. Better yet, GeForce NOW RTX 3080 members can experience Warhammer 40,000: Darktide enabled for the best graphic quality across nearly all their devices.\u00a0\nHead over to the GeForce NOW website to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more on Warhammer 40,000: Darktide\u2019s RTX technologies, stay tuned to GeForce.com in the months to come. And shortly before release, be sure to head back to download our Warhammer 40,000: Darktide Game Ready Driver, which will ensure your performance and experience is optimized from day one of your co-op adventures into the corrupted districts of Tertium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(Image credit: JADES Collaboration)\nWorking with Ryan Hausen, a Ph.D. student in UC Santa Cruz\u2019s computer science department, Robertson helped create a deep learning framework that classifies astronomical objects, such as galaxies, based on the raw data streaming out of telescopes on a pixel by pixel basis, which they called Morpheus.\nIt quickly became a key tool for classifying images from the Hubble Space Telescope. Since then the team working on Morpheus has grown considerably, to roughly a half-dozen people at UC Santa Cruz.\nResearchers are able to use NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate Morpheus across a variety of platforms \u2014 from an NVIDIA DGX Station desktop AI system to a small computing cluster equipped with several dozen NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs to sophisticated simulations runs thousands of GPUs on the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\nA Trio of High-Profile Projects\nNow, with the first science data from the JWST due for release July 12, much more\u2019s coming.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be applying that same framework to all of the major extragalactic JWST surveys that will be conducted in the first year,\u201d Robertson.\nRobertson is among a team of nearly 50 researchers who will be mapping the earliest structure of the universe through the COSMOS-Webb program, the largest general observer program selected for JWST\u2019s first year.\nSimulations by UCSC researchers showed how JWST can be used to map the distribution of galaxies in the early universe. The web-like structure in the background of this image is dark matter, and the yellow dots are galaxies that should be detected in the survey. (Image credit: Nicole Drakos)\nOver the course of more than 200 hours, the COSMOS-Webb program will survey half a million galaxies with multiband, high-resolution, near-infrared imaging and an unprecedented 32,000 galaxies in mid-infrared.\n\u201cThe COSMOS-Webb project is the largest contiguous area survey that will be executed with JWST for the foreseeable future,\u201d Robertson said.\nRobertson also serves on the steering committee for the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, or JADES, to produce infrared imaging and spectroscopy of unprecedented depth. Robertson and his team will put Morpheus to work classifying the survey\u2019s findings.\nRobertson and his team are also involved with another survey, dubbed PRIMER, to bring AI and machine learning classification capabilities to the effort.\nFrom Studying the Stars to Studying Ourselves\nAll these efforts promise to help humanity survey \u2014 and understand \u2014 far more of our universe than ever before. But perhaps the most surprising application Robertson has found for Morpheus is here at home.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve actually trained Morpheus to go back into satellite data and automatically count up how much sea ice is present in the North Atlantic over time,\u201d Robertson said, adding it could help scientists better understand and model climate change.\nAs a result, a tool developed to help us better understand the history of our universe may soon help us better predict the future of our own small place in it.\nFEATURED IMAGE CREDIT: NASA\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Deep Learning | The AI PodcastTags: Aerospace \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Like DLSS, DLAA uses a dash of AI brainpower to stitch together frames with more detail than conventional anti-aliasing techniques like TAA and MSAA \u2013 only with DLAA, there\u2019s no upscaling involved. That means no performance gains, but for those with sufficiently powerful Nvidia RTX GPUs, potentially superior image quality at all resolutions. Even better than DLSS, mayhaps.\r\n\n\n\r\nIs DLAA actually worth using, though? I tried two of its most recent implementations, in No Man\u2019s Sky and Deep Rock Galactic, and found that any image quality benefits come at a sometimes hefty performance cost \u2013 even on one of the best graphics cards. Then again, because DLAA requires a muscular GPU in the first place, the frames-per-second difference might not even be noticeable unless your monitor has an esports-grade refresh rate.\r\n\n\n\n\nOur Eight Favourite Games From Not E3 2022\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\r\nHere's everything you need to know about Nvidia DLAA, including how exactly Nvidia\u2019s AI does the heavy lifting, and which games can use it. You\u2019ll find my quality comparisons and performance benchmarks a wee scroll further down.\r\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nWhat is DLAA and how does it work?\r\n\n\r\nExplaining DLAA is much like explaining DLSS, because they both rely on the same AI system. The work actually starts over at Nvidia HQ, where a supercomputer feeds extremely high-res images into a neural network \u2013 essentially, an AI model. These images teach the AI how to accurately predict the content of upcoming frames, which in turn generates anti-aliasing algorithms that allow for rendered images with more detail and more intelligently-placed pixels. The AI model, including its latest learnings, is then sent to your RTX graphics card via driver update.\r\n\n\r\nWith both DLAA and DLSS, the GPU can apply these AI-powered algorithms when running a supported game, theoretically producing a sharper image than other, dumber AA systems. The big difference is that DLSS involves upscaling, so games are first rendered at a lower resolution than your monitor\u2019s, then pieced back together to resemble native res while also including that AI anti-aliasing. With DLAA, games are simply rendered at native res to begin with. It\u2019s much more of a 'simple' anti-aliasing option in this regard, even if getting there does require a supercomputer and some machine learning.\r\n\n\r\nOn paper, this should allow DLAA to look slightly sharper than DLSS, as all other things being equal, it will always use a higher rendering resolution as a starting point. However, it also means DLAA gives up the performance advantage of DLSS; the latter\u2019s upscaling process isn\u2019t very GPU-heavy in itself, which together with the less demanding render resolution means games will simply run faster with it. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that Nvidia\u2019s upscaling is very, very good: on DLSS\u2019 Quality and Balanced modes, it usually looks as good as native, if not even a little better.\r\n\n\r\nIt's all very sciencey, which I know isn\u2019t massively interesting to every PC owner. But the long and short of it is that DLAA is intended to boost the visual quality of games that can already run smoothly without upscaling, giving RTX graphics card owners the choice of digging into that extra FPS headroom in exchange for prettier anti-aliasing. \r\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nWhich games support DLAA?\r\n\n\r\nNot many, in truth. DLSS support might be approaching the 200 games mark but as of June 2022, the newer and more specialised DLAA only works in a relative handful:\r\n\n\nChorus\nDeep Rock Galactic\nFarming Simulator\nJurassic World Evolution 2\nNo Man\u2019s Sky\nThe Elder Scrolls Online\n\n\r\nUnofficially, Deathloop can use DLAA as well. In the game\u2019s eyes, it would be running DLSS while rendering at native resolution, but since they use the same algorithms, that\u2019s all DLAA really is. Setting it up is also more involved than clicking a single toggle: you\u2019d need to enable DLSS, set it to use Adaptive Quality, set the target frame rate to 30fps and finally flip on the Quality setting. Weird, innit.\r\n\n\r\nYou could also, potentially, attain a DLAA-like effect in a wider range of games by combining DLSS with DLDSR (Deep Learning Dynamic Super Resolution). Another piece of Nvidia imaging tech for RTX cards, DLDSR is a downsampler that can improve image quality by rendering games above native resolution, and because it works at the driver level it doesn\u2019t require per-game implementation. By mixing DLSS upscaling with DLDSR downsampling, you could get the former\u2019s AI anti-aliasing with an internal render resolution that balances out to match your monitor\u2019s native res. DLAA, basically.\r\n\n\r\nIt's a total bodge job, and requires at least some manual arithmetic to end up at the correct resolution, but does work if you select the right combination of settings. If all that doesn\u2019t appeal, you\u2019ll have to stick with the games listed above. Also, just for the curious: no, you can\u2019t have DLSS and DLAA enabled at the same time.\r\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nWhat does DLAA look like?\r\n\n\r\nIn pure image quality terms, DLAA does make good on its promise of higher image quality \u2013 just. In the galleries below, you can see how DLAA compares to the highest-quality DLSS setting, as well as native/TAA, across No Man\u2019s Sky and Deep Rock Galactic (remember you can click the pics to embiggen them).\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 of 3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption          \n\n\n\n\n\nAttribution          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 of 3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption          \n\n\n\n\n\nAttribution          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nIt\u2019s not a completely perfect form of anti-aliasing, as the occasional jaggies are present, if not particularly pronounced: on that circular ship engine in No Man\u2019s Sky, for instance, which even basic TAA seems to do a better job of smoothing out. \r\n\n\r\nBut then, TAA\u2019s whole deal is blurring out details to hide jaggies, which has the clear downside of\u2026 blurred details. DLAA therefore looks a lot sharper overall, and especially in motion. Even if you can\u2019t see it in these screenshots, tricky environmental elements like mesh grates and distant staircases don\u2019t shimmer as much with DLAA as they do with TAA. Or, for that, matter, DLSS. Both Nvidia technologies naturally look very similar as they\u2019re using the same machine-learned AA, though in the smaller details, DLAA can look a touch more polished.\r\n\n\n\n \nLeft: DLAA. Right: DLSS Quality\n\n\r\nA zoom in on our spaceperson\u2019s space backpack, for instance, highlights a sharper, more in-focus look to the textures and edges. And it\u2019s not just close-up details where you can see the difference. Over in DRG, a distant monitor displays noticeably clearer text using DLAA:\r\n\n\n\n \nLeft: DLAA. Right: DLSS Quality\n\n\r\nAgain, TAA proves better at reducing the jagged effect, but only at the cost of making the whole scene look a little less in-focus. To me, at least, it\u2019s worth giving that up in exchange for DLAA\u2019s overall better detail reproduction. On this grated ramp, TAA even seems to chip away bits of the metal, whereas it\u2019s all rendered and presented properly with DLAA.\r\n\n\n\n \nLeft: DLAA. Right: TAA\n\n\r\nI don\u2019t want overstate the jagginess of DLAA, either. In motion, it looks fine, and that shouldn\u2019t be a surprise to anyone who\u2019s happily run DLSS as the anti-aliasing is basically the same. It\u2019s just the higher starting resolution that DLAA can leverage for a modest, but real, quality improvement.\r\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nHow does DLAA perform?\r\n\n\r\nSince DLAA lacks upscaling, it was never going to improve performance like DLSS could. But maybe with all its AI smarts, it could impose less of a performance tax than old-timey anti-aliasing?\r\n\n\r\nNo such luck. In both games tested, and regardless of native resolution, DLAA was consistently the harshest on frames-per-second. And this was with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070, one of the mightier models among the compatible RTX range. \r\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nGranted, it was a sub-10fps difference from TAA at 4K, and even with both games\u2019 Ultra graphics presets engaged, the RTX 3070 never wanted for high frame rates at 1440p and 1080p. If anything, these results show the exact conditions that Nvidia had in mind for DLAA: when performance is so already so high that it doesn\u2019t matter much if you knock a few frames off for its image quality enhancements. Indeed, Deep Rock Galactic losing 36fps at 1440p (compared to TAA) sounds terrible, but you wouldn\u2019t even see the difference on a 144Hz monitor. And you\u2019d have to really, really squint to see it on a 240Hz screen.\r\n\n\r\nThat said, results will vary according to your own hardware setup, and if you\u2019re getting by with an older, lower-spec RTX GPU \u2013 the RTX 2060, for instance \u2013 then I wouldn\u2019t blame you for peering more keenly at that performance gap between DLAA and DLSS. The 4K results, in particular, are a convincing argument for having your AI anti-aliasing served with a side of upscaling.The dab of extra detail with DLAA is nice but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth more than a 50% speed boost, y\u2019know?\r\n\n\r\nAs such, DLSS is definitely still the king of Nvidia graphics wizardry: the kind you\u2019d buy a GeForce graphics card for specifically (apologies to FSR 2.0). DLAA is neat, and can most certainly be worth switching if you\u2019d got the performance headroom \u2013 it\u2019s just not as much of a must-have feature, especially when so few games have built-in support for it. \r\n\n\r\nSpeaking of which, I\u2019m wondering if game developers (and Nvidia) are missing a trick here. Other than The Elder Scrolls Online, all of the currently supported games are quite recent releases. Understandable, given DLAA is a new-ish technology, but would it not make even more sense to add it to older games? These would be easier to run than contemporary releases, thus giving GPUs more performance headroom to spare, and the extra detail reproduction could be like a fresh coat of paint on aging visuals. Just a thought.\r\n\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            No Man\u2019s Sky Adrift update leaves you completely alone in its universe, except for sandworms and ghost ships\n          \n\n\n\n            Deep Rock Galactic Season 5 has you plunge to new depths with \"Drillevators\"\n          \n\n\n\n            Deep Rock Galactic Season 5 tunnels through time itself and lets you replay old seasons\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor.

Now, NIO aims to amp up the volume further.\nThis week, the electric automaker unveiled the ES7 SUV, purpose-built for the intelligent vehicle era. Its sporty yet elegant body houses an array of cutting-edge technology, including the Adam autonomous driving supercomputer, powered by NVIDIA DRIVE Orin.\nSUVs gained a foothold among consumers in the late 1990s as useful haulers for people and cargo. As powertrain and design technology developed, the category has flourished, with some automakers converting their fleets to mostly SUVs and trucks.\nWith the ES7, NIO is adding even more to the SUV category, packing it with plenty of features to please any driver.\nThe intelligent EV sports 10 driving modes, in addition to autonomous capabilities that will gradually cover expressways, urban areas, parking, and battery swapping. It also includes a camping mode that maintains a comfortable cabin temperature with lower power consumption and immersive audio and lighting.\n\nUtility Meets Technology\nThe technology inside the ES7 is the core of what makes it a category-transforming vehicle.\nThe SUV is the first to incorporate NIO\u2019s watchtower sensor design, combining 33 high-performance lidars, radars, cameras and ultrasonics arranged in around the vehicle. Data from these sensors is fused and processed by the centralized Adam supercomputer for robust surround perception.\n\nWith more than 1,000 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of performance provided by four DRIVE Orin systems-on-a-chip (SoCs), Adam can power a wide range of intelligent features in addition to perception, with enough headroom to add new capabilities over the air.\n\nUsing multiple SoCs, Adam integrates the redundancy and diversity necessary for safe autonomous operation. The first two SoCs process the 8 gigabytes of data produced every second by the vehicle\u2019s sensor set.\nThe third Orin serves as a backup to ensure the system can operate safely in any situation. And the fourth enables local training, improving the vehicle with fleet learning and personalizing the driving experience based on individual user preferences.\nWith high-performance compute at its center, the ES7 delivers everything an SUV customer could need, and more.\nA Growing Lineup\nThe ES7 joins the ET7 and ET5 as the third NIO vehicle built on the DRIVE Orin-powered Adam supercomputer, adding even greater selection for customers seeking a more intelligent driving experience.\nNIO intends to have vehicle offerings in more than two dozen countries and regions by 2025 to bring one of the most advanced AI platforms to more customers.\nPreorders for the ES7 SUV are now on the NIO app, with deliveries slated to begin in August.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Nvidia positions the DGX family as the premier vehicle for its datacenter GPUs, pre-loading the machines with its software and optimizing them to provide the fastest AI performance as individual systems or in large supercomputer clusters.\nHuang's confirmation answers a question we and other observers have had about which next-generation x86 server CPU the new DGX system would use since it was announced in March.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GPU giant has previously promised that the DGX H100 [PDF] will arrive by the end of this year, and it will pack eight H100 GPUs, based on Nvidia's new Hopper architecture. By using its fourth-generation NVLink interconnect to connect the GPUs, the chip designer has claimed that a single system will be capable of delivering 32 petaflops of AI performance using its FP8 format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuang confirmed Nvidia's selection of Sapphire Rapids for the DGX H100 while voicing his continued support for x86 CPUs as the company plans to introduce its first Arm-based server CPU, Grace, next year. He also said that Nvidia will use Sapphire Rapids for new supercomputers.\n\"We buy a lot of x86s. We have great partnerships with Intel and AMD. For the Hopper generation, I've selected Sapphire Rapids to be the CPU for Nvidia Hopper, and Sapphire Rapids has excellent single-threaded performance. And we're qualifying it for hyperscalers all over the world. We're qualifying it for datacenters all over the world. We're qualifying it for our own server, our own DGX. We're qualifying it for our own supercomputers,\" he said at the Tuesday event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe selection of Intel's upcoming Sapphire Rapids chip, which has already started shipping to some customers, marks a reversal of sorts for Nvidia after it chose AMD's second-generation Epyc server CPU, code-named Rome, for its DGX A100 system that was introduced in 2020.\nThis comes after industry publication ServeTheHome reported in mid-April that Nvidia had motherboard designs for both Sapphire Rapids and AMD's upcoming Epyc CPU, code-named Genoa, for the DGX H100 as the GPU giant had not yet decided on which x86 chip it would use.\nWhile Intel will consider this a victory as the semiconductor giant works to regain technology leadership after years of missteps, it's a relatively small win when considering the bigger battle over GPUs and other accelerators that is playing out between Nvidia, Intel, AMD and other companies. It's why, for instance, Intel is making a big bet on its upcoming Ponte Vecchio GPU and why AMD has pushed to become more competitive against Nvidia with its latest Instinct GPUs.\n\nNvidia promises annual updates across CPU, GPU, DPU lines\nIntel's Falcon Shores XPU to mix 'n' match CPUs, GPUs within processor package\nAMD nearly doubles Top500 supercomputer hardware share\nLos Alamos to power up supercomputer using all-Nvidia CPU, GPU Superchips\n\nOne major reason why Nvidia has decided to build its own Arm-compatible CPU is so it can put a CPU and a GPU together in the same package to significantly speed up the flow of data between the two components to fuel AI workloads and other kinds of demanding applications.\nNvidia plans to introduce its first iteration of this design, called the Grace Hopper Superchip, next year alongside the 144-core, CPU-only Grace Superchip, and we think it's likely that Nvidia will introduce a new kind of DGX system that will use Grace. Intel also plans to introduce a CPU-GPU design for servers with the Falcon Shores XPU in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Tuesday talk, Huang promised that \"Grace is going to be an amazing CPU\" that will allow the Nvidia to fine-tune everything from the components to the systems to the software. While the GPU giant is designing the Arm-compatible chip to benefit recommender systems and large language models used by so-called hyperscale companies, it will be used for other applications too, according to Huang.\n\"Grace has the advantage that in every single application domain that we go into, we have the full stack, we have all of the ecosystem all lined up, whether it's data analytics, or machine learning, or cloud gaming, or Omniverse, [or] digital twin simulations. In all of the spaces that we're going to take Grace into, we own the whole stack, so we have the opportunity to create the market for it,\" he said. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                CPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Intel\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                CPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Intel\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                x86\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Apple M1\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Mobileye\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                NPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Pat Gelsinger\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                RISC-V\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                vPro\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Xen\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                Alder Lake\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                FPGA\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Hardware\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                POST A COMMENT\n        \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                CPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Intel\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                CPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Intel\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                x86\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Apple M1\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Mobileye\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                NPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Pat Gelsinger\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                RISC-V\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                vPro\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Xen\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                Alder Lake\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                FPGA\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Hardware\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNvidia won the AI training race, but inference is still anyone's game\n\nComment\u00a0When it's all abstracted by an API endpoint, do you even care what's behind the curtain?\n\nSystems12 Mar 2025 | 5\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIntel cranks up accelerators in Xeon 6 blitz to outgun AMD\nBut you're probably not cool enough for Chipzilla's 288-core monster\n\nSystems24 Feb 2025 | 3\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIntel's new CEO: Chip world veteran Lip-Bu Tan\nRestoring x86 giant to its former glory, a job no one will envy\n\nSystems12 Mar 2025 | 18\n\n\n\n\n\n \nData resilience and data portability\nWhy organizations should protect everything, everywhere, all at once\nSponsored Feature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCoreWeave rides AI wave with IPO filing \u2013 but its fate hinges on Microsoft\nGPU farm discloses 77% of revenue tied to just two customers, putting Redmond giant front and center\n\nAI + ML4 Mar 2025 | \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAMD looks to undercut Nvidia, win gamers' hearts with RX 9070 series\nThe question is whether we can find them in stock and at MSRP\n\nSystems28 Feb 2025 | 51\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWanna save Intel?

The graphics card will be replacing the RTX 3050, a very popular gaming graphics card in the sub-$300 US segment which is aimed at the mass consumer segment.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 Graphics Card - Purely Designed For Enthusiast Gamers\n[Updated- 04/09/22]\nWhile there's no denying the enthusiasm around the higher-end GeForce RTX 4090, GeForce RTX 4080 & GeForce RTX 4070 series, or even the more mainstream RTX 4060 graphics cards that offer the best of the best gaming performance, the RTX 4050 series graphics cards will be designed around the $250 US segment which is a mainstream priced range aimed at the budget gamer who wants the same features as higher-end cards minus the performance, at a much lower price point.\nIt's simple, the RTX 4090 series will be aimed at users who want the best of the best without worrying about the amount of money they are spending while the RTX 4080 series is aimed at users who want the best performance at the best possible price. The RTX 4070 will be the sweet spot for high-end gaming, while the RTX 4060 is designed for the gaming masses at a price that will be hard to ignore given its performance, and the RTX 4050 is aimed at those who want to enter the new series at a budget tier pricing without losing the next-gen feature set.\nJust like the generation before it, the RTX 3050 managed to offer performance close to the RTX 2060 but was hurt by its 128-bit memory interface. The RTX 3050 did offer better performance, features, and value (at MSRP) versus its competition, the RX 6500 XT but it took months to reach a price close to the MSRP. Overall, the RTX 3050 was a 1080p-focused and eSports-aimed graphics card and the same should be expected of the RTX 4050.\n\nThe '50-class' segment is the share-cow for NVIDIA and it's definitely something that NVIDIA wants to have priced right in its given performance.\nWe should expect similar things with the next-generation gaming solution too but an important factor to consider is that GPUs are becoming more power-hungry and more pricey. It is a trend that might continue into the future as we get better products but in return, there's always a cost to pay for end consumers. So starting with what we know so far, first we should take a look at the brand new Ada Lovelace or AD10* class GPUs that will be powering the next-gen GeForce RTX 40 series cards.\nYou can also read the expected specs, prices, and performance of other upcoming RTX 40 GPUs in the posts below:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Series\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Series\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Series\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Series\n\nNVIDIA's AD107 'Ada Lovelace' GPU - Entry-Tier Focused Next-Gen Chip\nStarting with the GPU configuration, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 series graphics cards may utilize both AD106 and AD107 GPUs. We don't think there would be a 'Ti' configuration in the lineup as we didn't get that during the Ampere family but it could change. The reason I mention both AD106 and AD107 GPU for the same card is that the RTX 3050 did the same. The card was produced on GA106 GPUs before GA107 became widely available in the market after its mobile debut.\nThe RTX 3050 was always meant to utilize the GA107 GPU but NVIDIA made good use of the GA106 dies that couldn't reach the yields required for the higher-end cards. The GPU is said to measure around 150mm2 and will utilize the TSMC 4N process node which is an optimized version of TSMC's 5nm (N5) node designed for the green team.\n\nThe NVIDIA Ada Lovelace AD107 GPU is expected to feature up to 3 GPC (Graphics Processing Clusters). This is the same GPC count as the GA106 GPU. Each GPC will consist of 4 TPCs and 8 SMs which is the same configuration as the existing chip. Each SM (Streaming Multiprocessor) will house four sub-cores which is also the same as the GA106 GPU. What's changed is the FP32 & the INT32 core configuration. Each sub-core will include 128 FP32 units but combined FP32+INT32 units will go up to 192. This is because the FP32 units don't share the same sub-core as the IN32 units. The 128 FP32 cores are separate from the 64 INT32 cores.\nSo in total, each sub-core will consist of 32 FP32 plus 16 INT32 units for a total of 48 units. Each SM will have a total of 128 FP32 units plus 64 INT32 units for a total of 192 units. And since there are a total of 24 SM units (8 per GPC), we are looking at 3,072 FP32 Units and 1,536 INT32 units for a total of 4,608 cores.\nNVIDIA AD103 'Ada Lovelace' Gaming GPU 'SM' Block Diagram (Image Credits: Kopite7kimi):\n\nMoving over to the cache, this is another segment where NVIDIA has given a big boost over the existing Ampere GPUs. The Ada Lovelace GPUs will pack 192 KB of L1 cache per SM, an increase of 50% over Ampere. The L2 cache will be increased to 16 MB as mentioned in the leaks. This is an 8x increase over the Ampere GA106 GPU that hosts just 2 MB of L2 cache. The cache will be shared across the GPU.\nFinally, we have the ROPs which will stick to 16 per GPC. You are looking at up to 48 ROPs, the same as the current GA106 GPUs. There are also going to be the latest 4th Generation Tensor and 3rd Generation RT (Raytracing) cores infused on the Ada Lovelace GPUs which will help boost DLSS & Raytracing performance to the next level. Overall, the Ada Lovelace AD107 GPU will offer:\n\nSame Number of GPCs as GA106 GPU\n+20% Cores vs GA107 GPU\n50% More L1 Cache (Versus Ampere GA107)\n8x L2 Cache (Versus Ampere GA107)\n50% More ROPs (Versus Ampere GA107)\n4th Gen Tensor & 3rd Gen RT Cores\n\nNVIDIA AD107 'Ada Lovelace' Gaming GPU Block Diagram Mock-Up (Image Credits: SemiAnalysis):\n\nDo note that clock speeds, which are said to be between the 2-3 GHz range, aren't taken into the equation so they will also play a major role in improving the per-core performance versus Ampere.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 Series Preliminary Specs:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAD107?Ampere GA106-150\nAmpere GA107-300?\n\n\nProcess NodeTSMC 4N\tSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie Size~150mm2276mm2 (GA106)\n\n\nTransistorsTBD13.2 Billion (GA106)\n\n\nCUDA Cores~30722560\n\n\nTMUs / ROPsTBD / 4880 / 32\n\n\nTensor / RT CoresTBD / TBD80 / 20\n\n\nBase ClockTBD1552 MHz\n\n\nBoost ClockTBD1777 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute~14 TFLOPs9.1 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPsTBD18.2 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPsTBD72.8 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity8 GB GDDR6X?8 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus128-bit?128-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed20 Gbps+?14 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth320 GB/s+?224 GB/s\n\n\nTGP~150W130W (GA106)\n115W (GA107)\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)~$249 US$249 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)202327th January 2022\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 Graphics Cards Specifications\nNVIDIA may or may not offer two variants of the GeForce RTX 4050 graphics cards. That depends on whether they have enough chips or defective dies at hand to turn into discrete graphics cards but we know that there is indeed going to be an RTX 4050 graphics card. The laptop side may see more configurations but for RTX 4050 on desktops, we can expect the following specs.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 'Expected' Specifications\nBased on NVIDIA's decision to do a mix of AD106/AD107 or go AD107 across its RTX 4050 series lineup we can see up to a total of 3072 cores. The AD107 GPU will come packed with 16 MB of L2 cache and up to 48 ROPs.\nThe clock speeds are not confirmed yet but considering that the TSMC 4N process is being used, we are expecting clocks between the 2.0-3.0 GHz range. The higher than usual clock speed bump comes from the fact that NVIDIA is making a two-node jump considering the Ampere GPUs with Samsung 8nm node was in reality a 10nm process node with some optimizations. NVIDIA is skipping 7nm and going straight for a 5nm node and not even the vanilla variant but an optimized version of it. With Pascal on the TSMC 16nm node, NVIDIA delivered a huge frequency leap and we can expect a similar jump this time around too.\nAs for memory specs, the GeForce RTX 4050 is expected to rock 8 GB GDDR6X capacities that might come at faster 20+ Gbps speeds across a 128-bit bus interface for over 320 GB/s of bandwidth. The thing is that you can either go 8 GB for such a graphics card in the given 128-bit bus or cut down to 96-bit for either 6 GB or 12 GB configurations.\nThe GeForce RTX 4050 graphics card is also said to rock a TGP of around 150W which is an increase of 30% over the RTX 3050 on the GA107 GPU. This is a massive TGP increase and the performance needs to be really good for NVIDIA to keep its efficiency numbers up.\n\nAs for its feature set, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 graphics cards will rock all the modern NV feature sets such as the latest 4th Gen Tensor Cores, 3rd gen RT cores, and the latest NVENC Encoder, and NVCDEC Decoder, and support for the latest APIs. They will pack all the modern RTX features such as DLSS, Reflex, Broadcast, Resizable-BAR, Freestyle, Ansel, Highlights, Shadowplay, and G-SYNC support too.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Series Preliminary Specs:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAda Lovelace AD104?Ada Lovelace AD106Ampere GA104-200Ampere GA106-300\n\n\nProcess NodeTSCM 4NTSCM 4NSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie Size~300mm2~200mm2395.2mm2TBC\n\n\nTransistorsTBDTBD17.4 BillionTBC\n\n\nCUDA Cores5120?460848643584\n\n\nTMUs / ROPsTBD / 64TBD / 48152 / 80112 / 64\n\n\nTensor / RT CoresTBDTBD152 / 38112 / 28\n\n\nBase ClockTBDTBD1410 MHz1320 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock2.2-2.6 GHz2.2-2.6 GHz1665 MHz1780 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute~24 TFLOPs~21 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs13 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPsTBDTBD32 TFLOPs25 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPsTBDTBD192 TOPs101 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity12 GB GDDR6?8 GB GDDR6?8 GB GDDR612 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus192-bit128-bit256-bit192-bit\n\n\nMemory SpeedTBDTBD14 Gbps16 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth>448 GB/s>320 GB/s448 Gbps384 Gbps\n\n\nTGP~265W~220W175W170W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)~$399 US~$329 US$399 US$329 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)1H 20231H 20232nd December 202025th February 2021\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 Graphics Cards Performance\nAs for the performance of the gaming GPUs, we can only use theoretical numbers here since the launch is a bit far away but based on what we know, the RTX 40 series cards might be the first gaming cards to hit the 100 TFLOPs compute horsepower limit.\nJust for comparison's sake:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti: ~103 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.8 GHz clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090: ~90 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.8 GHz clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080: ~50 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti: 40 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.86 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti: ~38 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070: ~36 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.5 GHz clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090: 36 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.69 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080: 30 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.71 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti: 22 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.77 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GForce RTX 4060: 20 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.2 GHz clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070: 20 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.72 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti: 16 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.65 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050: 14 TFLOPs (FP32) (Assuming 2.2 GHz clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060: 13 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.77 GHz Boost clock)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050: 9 TFLOPs (FP32) (1.77 GHz Boost clock)\n\nBased on a theoretical clock speed of 2.2 GHz, you get up to 14 TFLOPs of compute performance and the rumors are suggesting even higher boost clocks. Now, these are definitely sounding like peak clocks, similar to AMD's peak frequencies which are higher than the average 'Game' clock. A 14+ TFLOPs compute performance means more performance on a '50-class' GPU than a '60-class flagship' which will be a good bump. But one should keep in mind that compute performance doesn't necessarily indicate the overall gaming performance.\n\n\nFP32 Compute Horsepower Comparisons (Higher is Better)\n\nCompute Power\n\n\n020406080100120\n\n\n\n\n\n020406080100120\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090 Ti (Theoretical)\n\n100\n\n\nRTX 4090 (Theoretical)\n\n90\n\n\nRTX 4080 (Theoretical)\n\n50\n\n\nRTX 3090 Ti\n\n40\n\n\nRTX 4070 Ti\n\n38\n\n\nRTX 4070\n\n36\n\n\nRTX 3090\n\n36\n\n\nRTX 3080\n\n30\n\n\nRX 6900 XTX\n\n25\n\n\nRTX 3070 Ti\n\n22\n\n\nRTX 4060 (Theoretical)\n\n20\n\n\nRTX 3070\n\n20\n\n\nRTX 3060 Ti\n\n16\n\n\nRTX 4050\n\n14\n\n\nRTX 3060\n\n13\n\n\nXbox Series X\n\n12\n\n\nPlayStation 5\n\n10\n\n\nRTX 3050\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will be around a\u00a055% compute performance uplift for the GeForce RTX 4050 graphics card versus its predecessor and this is without even factoring in the RT and Tensor core performance which is expected to get major lifts too in their respective department. Now FLOPs aren't necessarily reflective of the graphics or gaming performance but they do provide a metric that can be used for comparison.\n\nGamers should most realistically expect good 1080p performance from the RTX 3050. The '50' series has always been targeted at budget 1080p solutions that are popular amongst eSports with technologies such as Reflex, DLSS, and various streaming capabilities at a mainstream price point.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 Graphics Cards Price & Availability\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 was launched at $249 US. We can expect NVIDIA to retain the same prices for these cards with a $10-$20 US pricing adjustment here and there.\nNVIDIA really needs to secure more gamers in the $200-$300 US segment but they have to deliver a product that's worth the price. The RTX 3050 was a decent upgrade path given and what made it really interesting was its expansive 'GeForce RTX' feature set. This time, NVIDIA should focus on both the feature and performance side of things to lure more gamers into their ecosystem as this is going to be a really heated segment with Intel entering the space with its Arc lineup.\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards are rumored for a Q3 reveal and a launch is expected in Q4 2022 so we will know for sure what NVIDIA is up to in the next few months.\nNVIDIA GeForce GPU Segment/Tier Prices\n\n\n\nGraphics Segment2023-20242022-20232021-20222020-20212019-20202018-20192017-20182016-20172014-2016\n\n\n\n\nTitan TierGeForce RTX 4090GeForce RTX 4090GeForce RTX 3090 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3090GeForce RTX 3090Titan RTX (Turing)Titan V (Volta)Titan Xp (Pascal)Titan X (Pascal)Titan X (Maxwell)\n\n\nPrice$1599 US$1599 US$1999 US\n$1499 US$1499 US$2499 US$2999 US$1199 US$1199 US$999 US\n\n\nUltra Enthusiast TierGeForce RTX 4080 SUPERGeForce RTX 4080GeForce RTX 3080 TiGeForce RTX 3080 TiGeForce RTX 2080 TiGeForce RTX 2080 TiGeForce GTX 1080 TiGeForce GTX 980 TiGeForce GTX 980 Ti\n\n\nPrice$999 US$1199 US$1199 US$1199 US$999 US$999 US$699 US$649 US$649 US\n\n\nEnthusiast TierGeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPERGeForce RTX 4070 TiGeForce RTX 3080 12 GBGeForce RTX 3080 10 GBGeForce RTX 2080 SUPERGeForce RTX 2080GeForce GTX 1080GeForce GTX 1080GeForce GTX 980\n\n\nPrice$799 US$799 US$799 US$699 US$699 US$699 US$549 US$549 US$549 US\n\n\nHigh-End TierGeForce RTX 4070 SUPER\nGeForce RTX 4070GeForce RTX 4070\nGeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16 GBGeForce RTX 3070 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3070GeForce RTX 3070 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3070GeForce RTX 2070 SUPERGeForce RTX 2070GeForce GTX 1070GeForce GTX 1070GeForce GTX 970\n\n\nPrice$599\n$549$599 US\n$499 US$599\n$499$599\n$499$499 US$499 US$379 US$379 US$329 US\n\n\nMainstream TierGeForce RTX 4060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 4060GeForce RTX 4060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 4060GeForce RTX 3060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3060 12 GBGeForce RTX 3060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3060 12 GBGeForce RTX 2060 SUPER\nGeForce RTX 2060\nGeForce GTX 1660 Ti\nGeForce GTX 1660 SUPER\nGeForce GTX 1660GeForce GTX 1060GeForce GTX 1060GeForce GTX 1060GeForce GTX 960\n\n\nPrice$449\n$299$399 US\n$299 US$399 US\n$329 US$399 US\n$329 US$399 US\n$349 US\n$279 US\n$229 US\n$219 US$249 US$249 US$249 US$199 US\n\n\nEntry TierRTX 3050 8 GB\nRTX 3050 6 GBRTX 3050RTX 3050GTX 1650 SUPER\nGTX 1650GTX 1650 SUPER\nGTX 1650GTX 1050 Ti\nGTX 1050GTX 1050 Ti\nGTX 1050GTX 950GTX 750 Ti\nGTX 750\n\n\nPrice$229\n$179$249 US$249 US$159 US\n$149 US$159 US\n$149 US$139 US\n$109 US$139 US\n$109 US$149 US$149 US\n$119 US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series graphics card are you looking forward to the most?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti (48 GB 600W)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 (24 GB 450W)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 (16 GB 340W)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 (12 GB 285W)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 (8 GB 235W)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 (8 GB 150W)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n134\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n100\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n58\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features;

The technology developed by IKIM is integrated with the IT infrastructure of University Hospital Essen.\nIKIM hosts a data annotation lab, overseen by a team of board-certified radiologists, that accelerates the labeling of anatomic structures in medical images using MONAI, an open-source, PyTorch-based framework for building, training, labeling and deploying AI models for healthcare imaging.\nMONAI was created by NVIDIA in collaboration with over a dozen leading clinical and research organizations, including King\u2019s College London.\nIKIM researchers also use self-supervised learning to pretrain AI models that generate high-quality labels for the hospital\u2019s CT scans, MRIs and more.\nAdditionally, the IKIM team has developed a smart hospital information platform, or SHIP, an AI-based central healthcare data integration platform and deployment engine. The platform is used by researchers and clinicians to conduct real-time analysis of the slew of data in university hospitals \u2014 including medical imaging, radiology reports, clinic notes and patient interviews.\nSHIP can, for example, flag an abnormality on a radiology report and notify physicians via real-time push notifications, enabling quicker diagnoses and treatments for patients. The AI can also pinpoint data-driven associations between healthcare metrics like genetic traits and patient outcomes.\n\u201cWe want to solve real-world problems and bring the solutions right into the clinics,\u201d Kleesiek said. \u201cThe SHIP framework is capable of delivering deep learning algorithms that analyze data straight to the clinicians who are at the point of care.\u201d\nPlus, increased workflow efficiency \u2014 enabled by AI \u2014 means increased sustainability within hospitals.\nMaking Hospitals Smarter\nNensa says his hospital currently has close to 500 IT systems, including those for hospital information, laboratories and radiology. Each consists of critical patient information that\u2019s interrelated \u2014 but data from disparate systems can be difficult to connect or draw machine learning-based insights from.\nSHIP connects the data from all such systems by automatically translating it into a description standard called fast healthcare interoperability resources, or FHIR, which is commonly used in medicine to exchange electronic health records. SHIP currently encompasses more than 1.2 billion FHIR.\nOnce converted to FHIR, the information can be easily accessed by data scientists, researchers and clinicians for real-time AI training and analysis based on NVIDIA GPUs and DGX A100 systems. This makes it possible for labor-intensive tasks, such as liver volumetry prior to living donor liver transplantation or bone age estimation in children, to be performed fully automatically in the background, instead of requiring a half-hour of manual work by a radiologist.\n\u201cThe more artificial intelligence is at work in a hospital, the more patients can enjoy human intelligence,\u201d Nensa said. \u201cAs AI provides doctors and nurses relief from repetitive tasks like data retrieval and annotation, the medical professionals can focus on what they really want to do, which is to be there and care for their patients.\u201d\nNVIDIA DGX A100 systems power IKIM\u2019s AI training and inference. NVIDIA Triton Inference Server enables fast and scalable concurrent serving of AI models within the clinic.\nThe IKIM team also uses NVIDIA FLARE, an open-source platform for federated learning, which allows data scientists to develop generalizable and robust AI models while maintaining patient privacy.\nSmarter Equals Greener\nIn addition to reducing physician workload and increasing time for patient care, AI in hospitals boosts sustainability efforts.\nAs a highly specialized medical center, the University Hospital Essen must be available year-round for reliable patient treatment, with 24-hour operation times. In this way, patient-oriented, cutting-edge medicine is traditionally associated with a high consumption of energy.\nSHIP helps hospitals increase efficiency, automating tasks and optimizing processes to reduce friction in the workflow \u2014 which saves energy. According to Kleesiek, IKIM reuses the energy emitted by GPUs in the data center, which also helps to make the University Hospital Essen greener.\n\u201cNVIDIA is providing all of the layers for us to get the most out of the technology, from software and hardware to training led by expert engineers,\u201d Nensa said.\nIn April, NVIDIA experts hosted a workshop at IKIM, featuring lectures and hands-on training on GPU-accelerated deep learning, data science and AI in medicine. The workshop led IKIM to kickstart additional projects using AI for medicine \u2014 including a research contribution to MONAI.\nIn addition, IKIM is building SmartWard technology to provide an end-to-end AI-powered patient experience in hospitals, from service robots in waiting areas to automated discharge reports.\nFor the SmartWard project, the IKIM team is considering integrating the NVIDIA Clara Holoscan platform for medical device AI computing.\nSubscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news and watch IKIM\u2019s NVIDIA GTC session on demand.\nFeature image courtesy of University of Duisburg-Essen.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | GPU | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inference | NVIDIA in Europe | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The robot-inspired, software-defined vehicle features cutting-edge AI capabilities powered by the high-performance NVIDIA DRIVE Orin compute platform.\nThe sleek compact SUV provides a glimpse of JIDU\u2019s upcoming lineup. It\u2019s capable of level 4 autonomous driving, safely operating at highway speeds, on busy urban roads and performing driverless valet parking.\nThe Robo-01 also showcases a myriad of design innovations, including a retractable yoke steering wheel that folds under the dashboard during autonomous driving mode, as well as lidar sensors that extend and retract from the hood. It features human-like interactive capabilities between passengers and the vehicle\u2019s in-cabin AI using perception and voice recognition.\nJIDU is slated to launch a limited production version of the robocar later this year.\nContinuous Innovation\nA defining feature of the Robo-01 concept is its ability to improve by adding new intelligent capabilities throughout the life of the vehicle.\nThese updates are delivered over the air, which requires a software-defined vehicle architecture built on high-performance AI compute. The Robo-01 has two NVIDIA DRIVE Orin\u00a0 systems-on-a-chip (SoC) at the core of its centralized computer system, which provide ample compute for autonomous driving and AI features, with headroom to add new capabilities.\nDRIVE Orin is a highly advanced autonomous vehicle processor. This supercomputer on a chip is capable of delivering up to 254 trillion operations per second (TOPS) to handle the large number of applications and deep neural networks that run simultaneously in autonomous vehicles and robots, while meeting systematic safety standards such as ISO 26262 ASIL-D.\nThe two DRIVE Orin SoCs at the center of JIDU vehicles will deliver more than 500 TOPS of performance to achieve the redundancy and diversity necessary for autonomous operation and in-cabin AI features.\nEven More in Store\nJIDU will begin taking orders in 2023 for the production version of the Robo-01, with deliveries scheduled for 2024.\nThe automaker plans to unveil the design of its second production model at this year\u2019s Guangzhou Auto Show in November.\nJam-packed with intelligent features and room to add even more, the Robo-01 shows the incredible possibilities that future electric vehicles can achieve with a centralized, software-defined AI architecture.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

NVIDIA has done so consistently since submitting in December 2018 to the first round of MLPerf, an industry-standard suite of AI benchmarks.\nLeading Benchmark Results, Availability\nIn its fourth consecutive MLPerf Training submission, the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture continued to excel.\nFastest time to train on each network by each submitter\u2019s platform | Format: Chip count, Submitter, MLPerf-ID | RNN-T: 1536x NVIDIA 2.0-2104 | BERT: 4096x NVIDIA 2.0-2106, 4096x Google 2.0-2012, 256x Graphcore 2.0-2053, 8x Intel-HabanaLabs 2.0-2073 | RN-50: 4216x NVIDIA 2.0-2107, 4096x Google 2.0-2012, 256x Graphcore 2.0-2054, 8x Intel-HabanaLabs 2.0-2073 | 3D U-Net: 768x NVIDIA 2.0-2100 | RetinaNet: 1280x NVIDIA 2.0-2103, 2048x Google 2.0-2010 | Mask R-CNN: 384x NVIDIA 2.0-2099, 2048x Google 2.0-2010 | MiniGo: 1792x NVIDIA 2.0-2105 | DLRM: 112x NVIDIA 2.0-2098\nSelene \u2014 our in-house AI supercomputer based on the modular NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD and powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs, our software stack and NVIDIA InfiniBand networking \u2014 turned in the fastest time to train on four out of eight tests.\nPer-chip performance is not a primary metric of MLPerf\u2122 Training. To calculate per-chip performance, this chart normalizes every submission to the closest scale of the fastest competitor. The fastest competitors are shown with 1x. To determine the fastest competitor, we selected the scale common to most submitters.| Format: Chip count, Submitter, MLPerf-ID | ResNet-50: 8x Inspur 2.0-2069, 3456x Google 2.0-2011, 16x Graphcore 2.0-2047, 8x Intel-HabanaLabs 2.0-2073 | BERT: 8x Inspur 2.0-2070, 3456x Google 2.0-2011, 16x Graphcore 2.0-2045, 8x Intel-HabanaLabs 2.0-2073 | DLRM: 8x Inspur\u00a0 2.0-2068 | Mask R-CNN: 384x NVIDIA 2.0-2099, 1024x Google 2.0-2009 | RetinaNet: 1280x NVIDIA 2.0-2103, 2048x Google 2.0-2010 | RNN-T 8x Inspur 2.0-2066 | 3D-UNet: 8x H3C 2.0-2060,| MiniGo: 8x H3C 2.0-2059\nNVIDIA A100 also continued its per-chip leadership, proving the fastest on six of the eight tests.\nA total of 16 partners submitted results this round using the NVIDIA AI platform. They include ASUS, Baidu, CASIA (Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences), Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, New H3C Information Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Inspur Electronic Information, KRAI, Lenovo, Microsoft Azure, MosaicML, Nettrix and Supermicro.\nMost of our OEM partners submitted results using NVIDIA-Certified Systems, servers validated by NVIDIA to provide great performance, manageability, security and scalability for enterprise deployments.\nMany Models Power Real AI Applications\nAn AI application may need to understand a user\u2019s spoken request, classify an image, make a recommendation and deliver a response as a spoken message.\nEven the simple above use case requires nearly 10 models, highlighting the importance of running every benchmark\nThese tasks require multiple kinds of AI models to work in sequence, also known as a pipeline. Users need to design, train, deploy and optimize these models fast and flexibly.\nThat\u2019s why both versatility \u2013 the ability to run every model in MLPerf and beyond \u2013 as well as leading performance are vital for bringing real-world AI into production.\nDelivering ROI With AI\nFor customers, their data science and engineering teams are their most precious resources, and their productivity determines the return on investment for AI infrastructure. Customers must consider the cost of expensive data science teams, which often plays a significant part in the total cost of deploying AI, as well as the relatively small cost of deploying the AI infrastructure itself.\nAI researcher productivity depends on the ability to quickly test new ideas, requiring both the versatility to train any model as well as the speed afforded by training those models at the largest scale.That\u2019s why organizations focus on overall productivity per dollar to determine the best AI platforms \u2014 a more comprehensive view that more accurately represents the true cost of deploying AI.\nIn addition, the utilization of their AI infrastructure relies on its fungibility, or the ability to accelerate the entire AI workflow \u2014 from data prep to training to inference \u2014 on a single platform.\nWith NVIDIA AI, customers can use the same infrastructure for the entire AI pipeline, repurposing it to match the varying demands between data preparation, training and inference, which dramatically boosts utilization, leading to very high ROI.\nAnd, as researchers discover new AI breakthroughs, supporting the latest model innovations is key to maximizing the useful life of AI infrastructure.\nNVIDIA AI delivers the highest productivity per dollar as it is universal and performant for every model, scales to any size and accelerates AI from end to end \u2014 from data prep to training to inference.\nToday\u2019s results provide the latest demonstration of NVIDIA\u2019s broad and deep AI expertise shown in every MLPerf training, inference and HPC round to date.\n23x More Performance in 3.5 Years\nIn the two years since our first MLPerf submission with A100, our platform has delivered 6x more performance. Continuous optimizations to our software stack helped fuel those gains.\nSince the advent of MLPerf, the NVIDIA AI platform has delivered 23x more performance in 3.5 years on the benchmark \u2014 the result of full-stack innovation spanning GPUs, software and at-scale improvements. It\u2019s this continuous commitment to innovation that assures customers that the AI platform that they invest in today and keep in service for 3 to 5 years, will continue to advance to support the state-of-the-art.\nIn addition the NVIDIA Hopper architecture, announced in March, promises another giant leap in performance in future MLPerf rounds.\nHow We Did It\nSoftware innovation continues to unlock more performance on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture.\nFor example, CUDA Graphs \u2014 software that helps minimize launch overhead on jobs that run across many accelerators \u2014 is used extensively across our submissions. Optimized kernels in our libraries like cuDNN and pre-processing in DALI unlocked additional speedups. We also implemented full stack improvements across hardware, software and networking such as NVIDIA Magnum IO and SHARP, which offloads some AI functions into the network to drive even greater performance, especially at scale.\nAll the software we use is available from the MLPerf repository, so everyone can get our world-class results. We continuously fold these optimizations into containers available on NGC, our software hub for GPU applications, and offer NVIDIA AI Enterprise to deliver optimized software, fully supported by NVIDIA.\nTwo years after the debut of A100, the NVIDIA AI platform continues to deliver the highest performance in MLPerf 2.0, and is the only platform to submit on every single benchmark. Our next-generation Hopper architecture promises another giant leap in future MLPerf rounds.\nOur platform is universal for every model and framework at any scale, and provides the fungibility to handle every part of the AI workload. It\u2019s available from every major cloud and server maker.\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA A100 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But when it comes to autonomous vehicles, the key may be in one, two, three.\nFaction, a Bay Area-based startup and NVIDIA Inception member, is preparing to debut its business-to-business autonomous delivery service, accelerating its commercial deployment with three-wheel production electric vehicles purpose-built for driverless services.\nIn addition, the company has built its autonomous driving system on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX for robust, automotive-grade AI compute.\nThe demand for last-mile enterprise delivery has significantly increased over the past decade, with few signs of slowing down. The number of business-to-business parcels grew from 7 billion to 11 billion from 2019 to 2021, according to ABI Research. The firm expects this number to continue rising, to reach 75 billion in 2030.\nHowever, with a rising labor shortage that has hit the trucking industry especially hard, it\u2019s difficult for driver supply to meet this demand.\nFaction aims to narrow this gap with affordable, production autonomous vehicles ready to hit the road this year.\nSmaller Vehicles, Bigger Brains\nFaction\u2019s flagship vehicle, the D1, is built on EV maker Arcimoto\u2019s low-cost vehicle platform. The vehicle is designed to be completely driverless, combining autonomous driving and teleoperation to navigate delivery routes.\nThe D1 delivery vehicle can reach speeds up to 75 miles per hour, with over 100 miles of battery range, and tote 500 pounds of cargo.\nInside the vehicle, NVIDIA DRIVE AGX delivers high-performance and energy-efficient AI compute for autonomous driving.\nThe centralized platform runs the redundant and diverse deep neural networks that power the vehicle\u2019s AI capabilities, while leaving enough compute headroom to continuously add new features. It\u2019s also automotive grade, achieving systematic safety standards such as ISO 26262 ASIL-D.\n\u201cOur goal is to deploy cost-efficient autonomous vehicles in the near term,\u201d said Faction CEO Ain McKendrick. \u201cWe chose NVIDIA DRIVE because it\u2019s an automotive-grade platform that meets our needs today.\u201d\nMaking the Inception Connection\nAs a member of NVIDIA Inception, Faction taps into the latest AI technologies and expertise to create vehicles that are always at the cutting edge.\nInception supports all stages of a startup\u2019s life cycle. NVIDIA works closely with members to provide the best technical tools, latest resources and opportunities to connect with investors.\nMcKendrick added that Inception has helped Faction take full advantage of the latest software tools for faster iteration and streamlined development.\nExpanding Services\nIn addition to last-mile delivery, Faction is targeting its vehicles for the micro-mobility market.\nThe startup plans to next year launch single-rider vehicles that can be requested via an app. The vehicle will drive autonomously to the customer, who will then take control and manually drive it to their destination.\nFaction\u2019s single-rider shared mobility vehicle based on the ElectraMeccanica SOLO EV.\nThe goal is to meet single-rider demand with a cost-efficient and sustainable shared mobility offering.\nBy keeping its delivery and mobility vehicles in a compact package without sacrificing compute, Faction proves that three truly is a magic number.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: Inception | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Royal Library is based on concept art and very different if you compare it.\u201d\nFine attention to detail on individual models is the foundation of creating a stunning scene.\nVu began her creative workflow crafting 3D models in Autodesk Maya, slowly building out the larger scene. Deploying her GeForce RTX 2080 GPU unlocked the GPU-accelerated viewport, enabling Vu\u2019s modeling and animation workflows to be faster and more interactive. This left her free to ideate and unlock creativity, all while saving valuable time.\n\u201cBeing able to make those fast, precise tweaks was really nice,\u201d Vu said. \u201cEspecially since, when you\u2019re making a modular kit for an interior versus an exterior, there is less room to mess up because buildings are made to be perfect structurally.\u201d\n\nPractice makes perfect. The NVIDIA Studio YouTube channel hosts many helpful tutorials, including how to quickly model a scene render using a blocking technique in Autodesk Maya.\nVu then used ZBrush\u2019s customizable brushes to shape and sculpt some models in finer detail.\nNext, Vu deployed Marmoset Toolbag and baked her models quickly with RTX-acceleration in mere seconds, saving rendering time later in the process.\n\nVu then shifts gears to lighting where her mentor encouraged her to go big, literally, saying, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cool to do all this bounce lighting in this big, expansive building?\u201d\nHere, Vu experimented with lighting techniques that take advantage of several GPU-accelerated features. In Unreal Engine 4.26, RTX-accelerated ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS, powered by AI and Tensor Cores, make scene refinement simpler and faster. With the release of Unreal Engine 5, Vu then tried Lumen, UE5\u2019s fully dynamic global illumination system, which gives her the ability to light her scene in stunning detail.\nComposition is a key part of the process, noted Vu, \u201cWhen building a composition, you really want to look into the natural lines of architecture that lead your eye to a focal point.\u201d\nNormally Vu would apply her hand-painted texture style to the finished model, but as she continued to refine the scene, it made more and more sense to lean into realistic visuals, especially with RTX GPU hardware to support her creative ambition.\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually really weird, because I think I was stuck in the process for a while where I had lighting set up, the camera set up, the models were done except for textures,\u201d said Vu. \u201cFor me that was hard, because I am from a hand-painted background and switching textures was nerve wracking.\u201d\nApplying realistic textures and precise lighting brings the Royal Library to life.\nVu created her textures in Adobe Photoshop and then used Substance 3D Painter to apply various colors and materials directly to her 3D models. NVIDIA RTX and NVIDIA Iray technology in the viewport enable Vu to edit in real time and use ray-traced baking for faster rendering speeds \u2014 all accelerated by her GPU.\nVu returns to Unreal Engine 5 to animate the scene using the Sequencer feature. The sparkly effect comes from a godray, amplified by particle effects, combined with atmospheric fog to fill the room.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/studio-itne-jacinta-vu-wk9-blog-loop-1280.mp4\n\u00a0\nAll that\u2019s left are final renders. Vu renders her full-fidelity scene in lightning speed with UE5\u2019s RTX-accelerated Path Tracer.\nAt last, the Royal Library is ready for visitors, friends and distinguished guests.\nVu, proud to have finally completed Royal Library, reflected on her creative journey, saying, \u201cIn the last stretch, I said, \u2018I actually know how to do this.\u2019 Once again I was in my head thinking I couldn\u2019t do something, but it was freeing and it\u2019s the type of thing where I learned so much for my next one. I know I can do a lot more a lot quicker, because I know how to do it and I can keep practicing, so I can get to the quality I want.\u201d\nNVIDIA Studio exists to unlock creative potential. It provides the resources, innovation and know-how to assist passionate content creators, like Vu.\n3D environment artist Jacinta Vu is on ArtStation and Twitter.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

Later, he founded Coursera, where his machine learning courses have attracted nearly 5 million students.\nToday, Ng is best known for his views on data-centric AI \u2014 that improving AI performance now requires more focus on datasets and less on refining neural network models. It\u2019s a philosophy coded into Landing AI\u2019s flagship product, LandingLens.\nFounded in 2017, Landing AI counts among its users Foxconn, StanleyBlack&Decker and automotive supplier Denso. They and others have applied deep learning to improve their efficiency and reduce costs.\nA Classification Challenge\nA chip maker with manufacturing plants around the globe was one of the first to try LandingLens. It wanted to use deep learning to improve throughput and yield of the wafers that carry chips through its fabs.\nLike all chip makers, \u201cthey have a lot of visual inspection machines on the fab floor that scan wafers at various steps \u2014 and they do a good job finding anomalies \u2014 but they didn\u2019t do as well classifying the things they found into types of defects,\u201d said Quinn Killough, Landing\u2019s liaison to the customer.\nAnd like many chip makers, it had tried a variety of software programs for classification. \u201cBut the solutions needed to be fine-tuned for each product and with more than 100 products, the investment wasn\u2019t worth it,\u201d said Killough, who has a background in computer vision and manufacturing.\nAI Automates Inspection\nThen the customer applied AI with LandingLens. It\u2019s designed to handle the end-to-end MLOps process \u2014 from collecting data to training and deploying models \u2014 then manage the ongoing process of refining the models, and especially the data, to enhance results.\nAlthough it\u2019s still early days for the deployment, the product and its data-centric approach have already helped the chip maker reduce costs.\n\u201cThe primary engineer driving the project said he sees deep learning as transformative and wants to scale it out across his facility and get other plants to adopt it,\u201d said Killough.\nInspectors in the Cloud\nThe chip maker used LandingLens on NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs in a cloud-based service that runs inference on hundreds of thousands of images a day.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure of the throughput capabilities at the beginning, but now it\u2019s clear it can handle that and a lot more,\u201d said Killough.\nThe same service can train a new classification model in less than a minute using about 50 defect images so users can iterate rapidly.\n\u201cOn the training side, it\u2019s very important for our tool to feel snappy so our customers can troubleshoot problems and experiment with solutions,\u201d he said.\nTaking AI to the Edge\nNow the company is taking the AI work to the factory floor with a new product, LandingEdge, which is in beta tests with several customers.\nIt captures images from cameras, then runs inference on industrial PCs equipped with NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier modules. Insights from that work feed directly to controllers that operate robotic arms, conveyor belts and other production systems.\n\u201cWe aim to improve quality controls, creating a flywheel effect for fast and iterative AI processes,\u201d said Jason Chan, product manager for LandingEdge.\nAccelerating a Startup\u2019s Growth\nTo get early access to the latest technology and expertise, Landing AI joined the NVIDIA Metropolis program, geared for companies using AI vision to make spaces and operations safer and more efficient.\nIt\u2019s still early days for the company and data-centric AI, which Ng believes may be one of the biggest tech shifts in this decade.\nTo learn more, watch a GTC session (free with registration) where Ng describes the status and outlook for the data-centric AI movement.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | Computer Vision | Customer Stories | Embedded Computing | GPU Computing | Industrial and Manufacturing | Jetson | Machine Learning | Metropolis | New GPU Uses \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Today Sensory brings interactivity to all kinds of voice-enabled electronics. LG and Samsung have used Sensory not just in their mobile phones but also in refrigerators, remote controls and wearables.\n\u201cWhat if I want my talking microwave to get me any recipe on the internet, to walk me through the recipe? That\u2019s where the hybrid computing approach can come in,\u201d said Mozer, CEO and founder.\nHybrid computing is the dual approach of using cloud and on-premises computing resources.\nThe company\u2019s latest efforts rely on NVIDIA NeMo \u2014 a toolkit to build state-of-the-art conversational AI models \u2014 and Triton Inference Server for its Sensory Cloud hybrid computing unit.\nMaking Electronic Devices Smarter\nDevices are getting ever more powerful. While special-purpose inference accelerators are hitting the market, better models tend to be bigger and require even more memory, so edge-based processing is not always the best solution.\nCloud connections for devices can deliver improved performance to these compact models. Over-the-air deployments of updates can apply to wearable devices, mobile phones, cars and much more, said Mozer.\n\u201cHaving a cloud connection offers updates for smaller, more accurate on-device models,\u201d he said.\nThis offers a payoff for many improvements to features on devices. Sensory offers its customers speech-to-text, text-to-speech, wake word verification, natural language understanding, facial ID recognition, and speaker and sound identification.\nSensory is also working with NVIDIA Jetson edge AI modules to bring the power of its Sensory Cloud to the larger on-device implementations.\nTapping Triton for Inference\nThe company\u2019s Sensory Cloud runs voice and vision models with NVIDIA Triton. Sensory\u2019s custom cloud model management infrastructure built around Triton allows different customers to run different model versions, deploy custom models, enable automatic updates, and monitor usage and errors.\nIt\u2019s deployable as a container by Sensory customers for on-premises or cloud-based implementations. It can also be used entirely privately, with no data going to Sensory.\nTriton provides Sensory a special-purpose machine learning task library for all Triton communications and rapid deployment of new models with minimal coding. It also enables an asynchronous actor pipeline for ease of new pipeline assembly and scaling. Triton\u2019s dynamic batching assists for higher GPU throughput and performance analysis for inference optimization.\nSensory is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a global program designed to support cutting-edge startups.\nEnlisting NeMo for Hybrid Cloud Models\u00a0\u00a0\nSensory has expanded on NVIDIA NeMo to deliver improvements in accuracy and functionality for all of its cloud technologies.\nNeMo-enhanced functions include its proprietary feature extractor, audio streaming optimizations, customizable vocabularies, multilingual models and much more.\nThe company now has 17 languages supported by NeMo models. And with proprietary Sensory improvements, word error rates are consistently outperforming the best in speech-to-text, according to the company.\n\u201cSensory is bringing about enhanced features and functionality with NVIDIA Triton hardware and NeMo software,\u201d said Mozer. \u201cThis type of hybrid-cloud setup offers customers new AI-driven capabilities.\u201d\n\u00a0\nImage credit: Sensory\n\n\nCategories: CloudTags: Artificial Intelligence | Inception | Jetson | NVIDIA NeMo \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Taipei Veterans General Hospital (TVGH) is working to improve outcomes for these patients with an AI model that predicts heart failure risk in real time during dialysis procedures.\nCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for dialysis patients, a trend that TVGH hopes to mitigate with its AI risk assessment model, which achieves 90% accuracy.\nThe hospital\u2019s AI tool displays key factors for risk prediction on a dashboard for clinicians, detects abnormal patterns in the streaming data from dialysis machines, and immediately alerts doctors and nursing staff to intervene.\nNVIDIA AI technology, including the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform, enables TVGH to analyze patient data in real time, with the proposed model using a combination of dialysis machine data, patient medical records, test results and medication information.\n\u201cIn this field, early detection and prompt decision-making can save lives,\u201d said Professor Der-Cherng Tarng, chief of the department of medicine at TVGH. \u201cBy deploying NVIDIA Jetson next to each dialyzer to perform AI prediction during the procedure, we can achieve real-time insights in a way that\u2019s affordable and effective, even for small-scale dialysis centers.\u201d\nThe team plans to expand testing of its software to a dozen island-wide hospitals, and to seek approval from the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration for clinical use as a medical device.\nDetection During Dialysis\nHemodialysis is a three- to four-hour procedure for patients with kidney failure, in which a machine filters toxins and waste products out of a patient\u2019s blood, typically done two or three times a week. Patients can experience serious complications, including heart failure \u2014 which can be triggered if a metric known as dry weight isn\u2019t set accurately during the procedure.\nDry weight refers to a person\u2019s natural weight without any extra fluid in the body. Clinicians aim to return patients to their dry weight after each dialysis session. But estimating dry weight is subjective, since patients with advanced kidney disease typically have excess fluid in their bodies, meaning they start out with a weight higher than their dry weight.\nOverestimating dry weight can cause hypertension, leading to complications including heart failure or other macrovascular complications. Underestimating it can remove too much fluid from the body, resulting in dehydration and a lower blood pressure.\nThis makes it critical that clinicians monitor multiple data points during dialysis, including blood flow rate, pressure in the arteries and veins, and ultrafiltration rate \u2014 a metric that represents the amount of fluid removed during the treatment.\nTVGH\u2019s risk assessment tool processes these values along with medical records, blood test results and medication information \u2014 assessing up to 200 sets of dynamic physiological and dialysis machine values. These key statistics are displayed on a dashboard for doctors and nurses, along with a metric that predicts heart failure risk for each patient.\n\nThis dashboard displays the health status of all dialysis patients, showing the patient\u2019s severity and risk category in different colors. For each patient, it shows a real-time stream of dialysis machine data and the AI model\u2019s assessment of whether or not the patient\u2019s iron levels are normal.\nThe hospital\u2019s tool was built to identify abnormal patterns in a patient\u2019s data using multiple AI algorithms including decision trees, gradient boosting and convolutional neural networks. It was trained on a dataset of 3 million health records. The team recently added additional predictive indicators to the tool, including hemoglobin level and chest X-ray image analysis.\nAdopting a convolutional neural network model improved the AI\u2019s accuracy by 95%.\nIn addition to predicting heart failure risk, TVGH\u2019s AI model has reduced the deviation rate in clinicians\u2019 assessment of a patient\u2019s dry weight by 80%, an accuracy boost that helps lessen the risk of complications.\nAI, Edge Computing Power Real-Time Results\nTVGH\u2019s IT team adopted the SAS Viya analytics engine along with NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries to develop its AI model.\nWhile the team\u2019s electronic hemodialysis system could automatically record the data generated by dialyzers, their initial workflow still required healthcare staff to record physiological measurements every 30 minutes, sending the data to servers over a Bluetooth connection.\nThe TVGH team (from L to R): Hsin-Ling Tai, nursing department; Der-Cherng Tarng, chief of the department of medicine; Chen-Tsung Kuo, director of the information department; Yuan-Chia Chu, senior software engineer; and Shuo-Ming Ou, visiting staff in the nephrology division.\n\u201cA half-hour window between data analysis still left gaps where a patient may begin experiencing complications that can lead to heart failure,\u201d said Shou-Ming Ou, visiting staff in the nephrology division at TVGH. \u201cSo our team worked to find a real-time solution that could receive and compute data generated by dialysis machines within milliseconds.\u201d\nTo achieve real-time AI inference using streaming data over the course of a four-hour dialysis session, TVGH adopted the Aetina Edge AI Starter Package featuring NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX, which packs the power to process up to 21 trillion operations per second in a compact module that consumes just 10 watts. The team used NVIDIA TensorRT software to optimize their AI prediction model for inference on the Jetson platform.\nBy shifting processing to the edge, NVIDIA Jetson also helps TVGH reduce the computation workload on their main servers, freeing up resources to support other AI teams training high-quality medical models.\nIn addition to the heart failure risk prediction model, the hospital is working on additional AI projects accelerated with the NVIDIA Parabricks genomics software, the NVIDIA FLARE federated learning workflow and the NeMo Megatron framework for natural language processing.\nTo learn more, hear the TVGH team share their work in a session from the latest NVIDIA GTC.\nSubscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news. \n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Embedded Computing | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inference | Jetson | NVIDIA NeMo | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

As a player in hardware and pneumatics used in robotics, Festo is making a move into AI-driven simulation, aiming at future Festo products.\nFesto uses Isaac Sim to develop skills for its collaborative robots, or cobots. That requires building an awareness of their environments, human partners and tasks.\nThe lab is focused on narrowing the sim-to-real gap for a robotic arm, developing simulation that improves perception for real robots.\nFor building perception, its AI models are trained on synthetic data generated by Omniverse Replicator.\n\u201cFesto is working on its own cobots, which they plan to ship in 2023 in Europe,\u201d said Satikidis.\n\nApplying Cortex for Automation\u00a0\nFesto uses Isaac Cortex, a tool in Isaac Sim, to simplify programming for cobot skills. Cortex is a framework for coordinating the Isaac tools into a cohesive robotic system to control virtual robots in Omniverse and physical robots in the real world.\n\u201cOur goal is to make programming task-aware robots as easy as programming gaming AIs,\u201d said Nathan Ratliff, director of systems software at NVIDIA, in a recent GTC presentation.\nIsaac Sim is a simulation suite that provides a diverse set of tools for robotics simulation. It enables sensor simulation, synthetic data generation, world representation, robot modeling and other capabilities.\nThe Omniverse platform and its Isaac Sim tools have been a game changer for Festo.\n\u201cThis is incredible because you can manifest a video game to a real robot,\u201d said Satikidis.\nTo learn more, check out the GTC session Isaac Cortex: A Decision Framework for Virtual and Physical Robots\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | GPU | GTC 2022 | Synthetic Data Generation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Researchers know NVIDIA speeds world-changing breakthroughs. Businesses know us for the AI engines transforming their industries.\nAnd NVIDIA employees know the company as one of the best places to work on the planet.\nMore people than ever have a piece of NVIDIA. Roboticists, visual artists, data scientists \u2014 all sorts of innovators and creators rely on the company\u2019s technology. And that\u2019s only natural: NVIDIA\u2019s the largest startup on Earth, growing to 25,000 employees from 10,000 a few years ago.\nBut as NVIDIA spills out in all directions it\u2019s more important than ever to connect all these pieces, these people who may know our products, but don\u2019t know one another.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re launching a campaign this week to bring all these elements together. To reflect back to the entertainers and entrepreneurs, researchers and scientists, developers and designers the staggering body of work we\u2019ve built together.\nIt\u2019s going to be quite a conversation. Not just because it\u2019s comprehensive, but because it\u2019s coherent.\nThe same GPU technology that powers the Nintendo Switch has proven the existence of the gravity waves Einstein predicted a century ago.\nThe parallel computing power harnessed by NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA platform is key not just to Oscar-winning special effects, but to a new generation of medical breakthroughs.\nAnd the huge leaps in computing power unleashed by innovations in silicon, software and systems created at NVIDIA are turning data centers into engines of business innovation and imbuing supercomputers with the power to simulate the planet itself, for the benefit of those of us who would become its stewards.\nThese stories don\u2019t just cover the breadth of what\u2019s been accomplished. They point to possibilities, new places where each of these endeavors intersect. These spillovers are anything but happy accidents; they\u2019re by design, and they\u2019ve always been the soul of NVIDIA.\nSo think of this as an introduction. Not just to the NVIDIA story, but to each other. And with more people than ever contributing to this story we all share, this body of work, there can be no doubt that the best part of the NVIDIA story is still to come.\nVisit NVIDIA\u2019s \u201cAbout Us,\u201d page, or click here for more on what NVIDIA, developers and customers have built together.\n\u00a0\nFeatured image credit: image courtesy of Accuray\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Data Center | Deep Learning | Gaming | Research | Robotics | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | CUDA | Data Science | GeForce \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The steady drumbeat of data and identity thefts spawned a new movement and a modern mantra that\u2019s even been the subject of a U.S. presidential mandate \u2014 zero trust. So,\nZero Trust Defined\nZero trust is a security strategy and framework for verifying every user, device, application and transaction on a network in the belief that no user or process should be trusted.\nThat definition comes from the NSTAC report, a 56-page document on zero trust compiled in 2021 by the U.S. National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, a group that included dozens of security experts led by a former AT&T CEO.\nIn an interview, John Kindervag, the former Forrester Research analyst who created the term, noted that he defines it this way in his Zero Trust Dictionary: Zero trust is a strategic initiative that helps prevent data breaches by eliminating digital trust in a way that can be deployed using off-the-shelf technologies that will improve over time.\nWhat Are the Basic Tenets of Zero Trust?\nIn his 2010 report that coined the term, Kindervag laid out three basic tenets of zero trust. Because all network traffic should be untrusted, he said users must:\n\nverify and secure all resources,\nlimit and strictly enforce access control, and\ninspect and log all network traffic.\n\nThat\u2019s why zero trust is sometimes known by the motto, \u201cNever Trust, Always Verify.\u201d\nHow Do You Implement a Zero Trust Architecture?\nAs the definitions suggest, zero trust is not a single technique or product, but a set of principles for a modern security policy.\nIn its seminal 2020 report, the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) detailed guidelines for implementing zero trust.\n\nIts general approach is described in the chart above. It uses a security information and event management (SIEM) system to collect data and continuous diagnostics and mitigation (CDM) to analyze it and respond to insights and events it uncovers.\nIt\u2019s an example of a security plan also called a zero trust architecture (ZTA) that creates a more secure network called a zero trust environment.\nBut one size doesn\u2019t fit all in zero trust. There\u2019s no \u201csingle deployment plan for ZTA [because each] enterprise will have unique use cases and data assets,\u201d the NIST report said.\nFive Steps to Zero Trust Security\nThe job of deploying a zero trust architecture can be boiled down to five main steps.\nIt starts by defining a so-called protect surface, what users want to secure. That\u2019s a departure from previous efforts in access management that focused on a so-called attack surface of specific vulnerabilities. A protect surface can span systems inside a company\u2019s offices, the cloud and the edge.\nMap a Zero Trust Architecture\nFrom there, users create a map of the transactions that typically flow across their networks and a zero trust architecture to protect them.\nThen they establish security policies for the network.\nFinally, they monitor network traffic to make sure transactions stay within the policies across all workloads.\n\nHow Zero Trust Models Evolve\nBoth the NSTAC report (above) and Kindervag suggest these same steps to create a zero trust environment.\nIt\u2019s important to note that zero trust is a journey not a destination. Consultants and government agencies recommend users adopt a zero trust maturity model to document an organization\u2019s security improvements over time.\nThe Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency, part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, described one such model (see chart below) in a 2021 document.\n\nMFAs in Zero Trust Environments\nIn practice, users in zero trust environments request access to each protected resource separately. They typically use multi-factor authentication (MFA) such as providing a password on a computer, then a code sent to a smartphone.\nIt\u2019s an access policy better suited to protecting sensitive data, apps and user identity as well as preventing malware and ransomware attacks.\nThe NIST report lists ingredients for an algorithm (below) that determines whether or not a user gets access to a resource.\n\n\u201cIdeally, a trust algorithm should be contextual, but this may not always be possible,\u201d given a company\u2019s resources, it said.\nSome argue the quest for an algorithm to measure trustworthiness is counter to the philosophy of zero trust policy. Others note that machine learning has much to offer here, capturing context across many events on a network to help make sound decisions on access.\nThe Big Bang of Zero Trust\nIn May 2021, President Joe Biden released an executive order mandating zero trust for the government\u2019s computing systems.\nThe order gave federal agencies 60 days to adopt zero trust architectures based on the NIST recommendations. It also called for a playbook on dealing with security breaches, a safety board to review major incidents \u2014 even a program to establish cybersecurity warning labels for some consumer products.\nIt was a big bang moment for zero trust that\u2019s still echoing around the globe.\n\u201cThe likely effect this had on advancing zero trust conversations within boardrooms and among information security teams cannot be overstated,\u201d the NSTAC report said.\nWhat\u2019s the History of Zero Trust?\nAround 2003, ideas that led to zero trust started bubbling up inside the U.S. Department of Defense, leading to a 2007 report. About the same time, an informal group of industry security experts called the Jericho Forum coined the term \u201cde-perimeterisation.\u201d\nKindervag crystalized the concept and gave it a name in his bombshell September 2010 report.\nThe industry\u2019s focus on building a moat around organizations with firewalls, VPNs and intrusion detection systems was wrongheaded, he argued. Bad actors and inscrutable data packets were already inside organizations, threats that demanded a radically new approach.\nHow Zero Trust Goes Beyond Firewalls\nFrom his early days installing firewalls, \u201cI realized our trust model was a problem,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe took a human concept into the digital world, and it was just silly.\u201d\nAt Forrester, he was tasked with finding out why cybersecurity wasn\u2019t working. In 2008, he started using the term zero trust in talks describing his research.\nZero Trust Microsegmentation\nInstead of erecting a single network perimeter enforced by user access policies and permissions, he advocated a novel approach to network security based on least privileged access policies. Each endpoint should apply more granular access policies in a kind of network segmentation sometimes called microsegmentation.\nAfter some early resistance, users started embracing the concept.\n\u201cSomeone once told me zero trust would become my entire job. I didn\u2019t believe him, but he was right,\u201d said Kindervag, who, in various industry roles, has helped hundreds of organizations build zero trust environments.\nWhat\u2019s a Zero Trust Network Architecture\nIndeed, Gartner projects that by 2025 at least 70% of new remote access deployments will use what it calls zero trust network access (ZTNA), up from less than 10% at the end of 2021. (Gartner, Emerging Technologies: Adoption Growth Insights for Zero Trust Network Access, G00764424, April 2022)\nThat\u2019s in part because the COVID lockdown accelerated corporate plans to boost security for remote workers. And many firewall vendors now include ZTNA capabilities in their products.\nMarket watchers estimate at least 50 vendors from Appgate to Zscaler now offer security products aligned with the zero trust approach.\nHow AI Automates Zero Trust\nUsers in some zero trust environments express frustration with repeated requests for multi-factor authentication. It\u2019s a challenge that some experts see as an opportunity for automation with machine learning.\nFor example, Gartner suggests applying analytics in a security strategy it calls continuous adaptive trust. CAT (see chart below) can use contextual data \u2014 such as device identity, network identity and geolocation \u2014 as a kind of digital reality check to help authenticate users.\nGartner lays out steps to implement a zero trust security model. Source: Gartner, Shift Focus From MFA to Continuous Adaptive Trust, G00745072, December 2021.\nIn fact, networks are full of data that AI can sift in real time to automatically weigh access requests and enhance security.\n\u201cWe do not collect, maintain and observe even half the network data we could, but there\u2019s intelligence in that data that will form a holistic picture of a network\u2019s security,\u201d said Bartley Richardson, senior manager of AI infrastructure and cybersecurity engineering at NVIDIA.\nAI in Zero Trust Environments\nHuman operators can\u2019t track all the sensitive data a network spawns or set policies for all possible vulnerabilities. But they can apply AI to scour data for suspicious activity, then respond fast.\n\u201cWe want to give companies the tools to build and automate robust zero trust environments with defenses that live throughout the fabric of their data centers,\u201d said Richardson, who leads development on NVIDIA Morpheus, an open AI cybersecurity framework and co-authored a technical blog on zero trust.\n\nNVIDIA provides pretrained AI models for Morpheus, or users can choose a model from a third party or build one themselves.\n\u201cThe backend engineering and pipeline work is hard, but we have expertise in that, and we can architect it for you,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s the kind of capability experts like Kindervag see as part of the future for a zero trust strategy.\n\u201cManual response by security analysts is too difficult and ineffective,\u201d he wrote in a 2014 report. \u201cThe maturity of systems is such that a valuable and reliable level of automation is now achievable.\u201d\nMore Resources on Zero Trust\nTo learn more about AI and zero trust principles, read this blog or watch the video below.

Specializing in visual design and 3D content, Barnes covers his creative workflow in designing the galactic 3D scene Journey.\u00a0\nJune Boon: Studio Driver Release Supports Blender, Sapphire and Denoise AI Updates\nThe June Studio Driver provides support for the recent Blender 3.2 release, which enables OpenVDB platform support in NVIDIA Omniverse.\n\nOpenVDB offers a near-infinite 3D index space, allowing massive Universal Scene Description (USD) files to move in and out of Omniverse while keeping these volumes intact. 3D artists can iterate with larger files, speeding up creative workflows without the need to reduce or convert files and sizes.\nLight sources from the interior, pool, benches and greater world combine for a breathtaking visual built in the Blender compositor without added re-render work.\nBlender 3.2 also added a Light Group feature, enabling artists to modify the color and intensity of light sources in the compositor without re-rendering. New Shadow Caustics supports selective rendering of caustics in shadows of refractive objects for further realism. Check out a complete overview of the Blender 3.2 update.\n\nBorisFX Sapphire 2022.5 now supports multi-GPU systems applying GPU-accelerated visual-effect plugins in Blackmagic\u2019s DaVinci Resolve \u2014 scaling GPU power with rendering speeds up to 6x faster.\nTopaz Denoise AI accelerated by the NVIDIA TensorRT framework provides more consistent color while reducing blotchiness in highlights and shadows.\nTopaz Denoise AI 3.7.0 added support for the NVIDIA TensorRT framework, which means RTX GPU owners will benefit from significantly faster inference speeds. When using RAW model denoising features, inference runs up to 6x faster.\nDownload GeForce Experience or NVIDIA RTX Experience to be notified of the latest Studio Driver releases.\nThe Journey Is the Reward\nThis week\u2019s In the NVIDIA Studio artist spotlight sees NVIDIA\u2019s Daniel Barnes share his creative process for the 3D sci-fi scene, Journey.\nBarnes\u2019 artwork draws inspiration from various movies and anime, usually a combination of visual revelations. Journey is an extension of Barnes\u2019 latest obsession, the isekai genre in anime, where the protagonist awakens in another world and has to navigate their new and unknown situation.\n\u201cThis reincarnation narrative can be pretty refreshing, as it almost always is something you can connect with living life and having firsts, or wishing you could redo a particular moment differently with the advantage of 20/20 hindsight,\u201d Barnes noted.\nBarnes first visualized \u2018Journey\u2019 in Adobe Photoshop.\nBarnes sketches when inspiration strikes \u2014 often at his local coffee shop \u2014 which is where he got started with Journey using Adobe Photoshop.\nWith his GeForce RTX 3060-powered laptop, Barnes benefited from speedy GPU-accelerated features such as Scrubby Zoom, to quickly zoom and adjust fine details, and Flick Panning, to move around the canvas faster, with the freedom to create on the go.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/studio-itns-wk11-journey-wire.mp4\n\u00a0\nTurning his attention to Autodesk Maya, Barnes built and blocked out foundational geometric shapes for the Journey scene, starting with elements he could reuse from an existing scene. \u201cAbsolutely nothing wrong with working smart wherever possible,\u201d Barnes mused. The GPU-accelerated viewport unlocks fast and interactive 3D modeling for Barnes, who was able to set up the building blocks quickly.\nBarnes further detailed some 3D models in ZBrush by sculpting with custom brushes. He then ran the ZBrush Remesh feature, creating a new single mesh by combining several existing objects. This simplified applying textures and will make potentially animating Journey much easier.\nOmniverse Create\u2019s material presets and lighting allowed Barnes to work faster and more efficiently.\nBarnes then used the Omniverse Create app to assemble his physically accurate, photorealistic 3D scene. Back at home with his RTX 3080-powered desktop system, he used the built-in RTX Renderer for interactive visualization within the viewport with virtually no slowdown. Even building at real-world scale, Create\u2019s material presets and lighting allowed Barnes to quickly and efficiently apply realistic visuals with ease.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/studio-itns-wk11-ov-create.mp4\n\u00a0\nBarnes bounced back and forth between the handy Adobe Substance 3D Painter Connector and the Omniverse NVIDIA vMaterials library to discover, create and refine textures, applying his unique color scheme style in Create.\nAI in the Studio suite of apps, Omniverse Create and NVIDIA Canvas played key roles in developing \u2018Journey.\u2019\nWith the piece in good shape, Barnes planned for the composite by exporting several versions with depth of field, extra light bloom and fog enabled.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/studio-itns-wk11-canvas-ps-01.mp4\n\u00a0\nNow, all Journey needed was a vibrant sky to complete the piece. Barnes harnessed the power of AI with the NVIDIA Canvas app, free for RTX GPU owners, turning simple brushstrokes into a realistic, stunning view. Barnes generated outer space in mere minutes, allowing for more concept exploration and saving the time required to search for backgrounds or create one from scratch.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/studio-itns-wk11-canvas-ps-07.mp4\n\u00a0\nThe artist then returned to Adobe Photoshop to add color bleed and stylish details, drop in the Canvas background, and export final renders.\nNVIDIA Senior Visual Designer and 3D artist Daniel Barnes.\nCheck out Barnes\u2019 Instagram for more design inspiration.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Omniverse, including tips and tricks, on the Omniverse YouTube channel.

Moving to open NVIDIA DOCA will help develop and nurture broad and vibrant DPU ecosystems and power unprecedented data center transformation.\nThe OPI project aims to create a community-driven, standards-based, open ecosystem for accelerating networking and other data center infrastructure tasks using DPUs.\nDOCA includes drivers, libraries, services, documentation, sample applications and management tools to speed up and simplify the development and performance of applications. It allows for flexibility and portability for BlueField applications written using accelerated drivers or low-level libraries, such as DPDK, SPDK, Open vSwitch or Open SSL. We plan to continue this support. As part of OPI, developers will be able to create a common programming layer to support many of these open drivers and libraries\u00a0 with DPU acceleration.\nDOCA library APIs are already publicly available and documented for developers. Open licensing of these APIs will ensure that applications developed using DOCA will support BlueField DPUs as well as those from other providers.\nDOCA has always been built on an open foundation. Now NVIDIA is opening the APIs to the DOCA libraries and plans to add OPI support.\nExpanding Use of DPUs\nAI, containers and composable infrastructure are increasingly important for enterprise and cloud data centers. This is driving the use of DPUs in servers to support software-defined, hardware-accelerated networking, east-west traffic and zero-trust security.\nOnly the widespread deployment of DPUs such as NVIDIA BlueField can support the ability to offload, accelerate and isolate data center workloads, including networking, storage, security and DevOps management.\nNVIDIA\u2019s history of open innovation over the decades includes engaging with leading consortiums, participating in standards committees and contributing to a range of open source software and communities.\nWe contribute frequently to open source and open-license projects and software such as the Linux kernel, DPDK, SPDK, NVMe over Fabrics, FreeBSD, Apache Spark, Free Range Routing, SONiC, Open Compute Project and other areas covering networking, virtualization, containers, AI, data science and data encryption.\nNVIDIA is often among the top three code contributors to many releases of Linux and DPDK. And we\u2019ve historically included an open source version of our networking drivers in the Linux kernel.\nWith OPI, customers, ISVs, infrastructure appliance vendors and systems integrators will be able to create applications for BlueField DPUs using DOCA to gain the best possible performance and easiest developer experience for accelerated data center infrastructure.\n\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | NetworkingTags: NVIDIA BlueField \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Ultima Genomics, Inc. today unveiled a broad collaboration with NVIDIA that leverages AI-accelerated analysis across multiple stages of the DNA sequencing and analysis process. The collaboration includes the use of NVIDIA GPUs for deep learning in photometry and base calling and will soon include acceleration of variant calling.\nOver the last five years, Ultima Genomics has developed a fundamentally new sequencing architecture designed to scale beyond conventional approaches, including completely different flow cell engineering, sequencing chemistry, and machine learning. Ultima is currently in an early access program for the UG 100\u2122, its first high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) instrument that is using this new technology, which enables customers to generate high-quality sequencing data at a cost of $1/Gb.\nGenomics Meets AI\nThe Ultima instrument utilizes NVIDIA A30 GPUs with the NVIDIA Clara AI computing platform to offer highly accurate and accelerated primary and secondary analysis for customers who want to run genomic analyses at scale. Ultima has separately announced partnerships to develop Ultima-specific germline variant calling pipelines for Google's DeepVariant. These custom models can be run within NVIDIA Clara Parabricks, which accelerates these and other applications for secondary analysis.\n\"Ultima's mission is to continuously drive the scale of genomic information,\" said Gilad Almogy, CEO of Ultima Genomics. \"Our unique architecture scales by combining multiple technologies, so we are excited to work with NVIDIA, leveraging their platforms for GPUs and AI acceleration, to power high-quality sequencing and accelerate the computing to lower total cost of ownership for customers.\"\n\"NVIDIA solutions are designed to accelerate high-volume data processing, and our collaboration with Ultima demonstrates this at multiple levels,\" said George Vacek, Global Director of Genomics Alliances at NVIDIA.\u00a0 \"NVIDIA GPUs provide a high degree of onboard computational power within the UG 100, and data analysis can be accelerated downstream via Clara Parabricks, enabling large-scale data initiatives via analysis that is both higher throughput and lower cost.\"\nNVIDIA Clara Parabricks computational pipelines employ NVIDIA's CUDA, HPC, AI and data analytics stacks to deliver GPU-accelerated libraries, pipelines, and reference application workflows for primary, secondary, and tertiary analysis. Off-the-shelf solutions are coupled with a toolkit to support new application development to address the rapidly evolving needs of high-throughput genomic labs.\nAbout Ultima Genomics\nUltima Genomics is unleashing the power of genomics at scale. The Company's mission is to continuously drive the scale of genomic information to enable unprecedented advances in biology and improvements in human health. With humanity on the cusp of a biological revolution, there is a virtually endless need for more genomic information to address biology's complexity and dynamic change\u2014and a further need to challenge conventional next-generation sequencing technologies. Ultima's revolutionary new sequencing architecture drives down the costs of sequencing to help overcome the tradeoffs that scientists and clinicians are forced to make between the breadth, depth, and frequency with which they use genomic information. The new sequencing architecture was designed to scale far beyond conventional sequencing technologies, lower the cost of genomic information and catalyze the next phase of genomics in the 21st century.

These SDGs \u2014 which include \u201cclimate action\u201d and \u201csustainable cities and communities\u201d \u2014 serve as calls to action for all UN member states to bolster global well-being.\nThe collaboration between UNOSAT, part of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research, and NVIDIA is initially focused on boosting climate-related disaster management by using AI for Earth Observation. AI4EO, as it\u2019s known, is a term that encompasses initiatives using AI to help monitor and assess the planet\u2019s changes.\nTo fast track research and development for its AI4EO efforts, UNOSAT will integrate its satellite imagery technology infrastructure with NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing platform. The AI-powered satellite imagery system will collect and analyze geospatial information to provide near-real-time insights about floods, wildfires and other climate-related disasters.\nIn addition, UNOSAT has launched an educational module that builds upon an NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) course on applying deep learning methods to generate accurate flood detection models.\n\u201cWorking with NVIDIA will enable us to close the loop from AI research to implementation of climate solutions in the shortest time possible, ensuring that vulnerable populations can benefit from the technology,\u201d said Einar Bj\u00f8rgo, director of UNOSAT.\nAI-Powered Satellite Imagery Analysis\nFor tasks like evaluating the impact of a tropical cyclone in the Philippines or a volcanic eruption in Tonga, UNOSAT\u2019s emergency mapping service uses computer vision and satellite imagery analysis to gain accurate information about complex disasters.\nNear-real-time analysis is key to managing climate-disaster events. Humanitarian teams can use the data-driven insights provided by AI to take rapid, effective action in combating disasters. The data is also used to inform sustainable development policies, develop users\u2019 capacities and strengthen climate resilience overall.\nUNOSAT will supercharge its satellite imagery technology infrastructure with NVIDIA DGX systems, which enable AI development at scale \u2014 as well as the NVIDIA EGX platform, which delivers the power of accelerated computing from the data center to the edge.\nNVIDIA technology speeds up AI-based flood detection by 7x, covering larger areas with greater accuracy, according to UNOSAT.\nNVIDIA DLI Course on Disaster Risk Monitoring\nIn addition to powerful technology, a skilled workforce is essential to using AI and data science to analyze and prevent climate events from becoming humanitarian disasters.\n\u201cNVIDIA and UNOSAT have a unique opportunity to combat the impact of climate change and advance the UN\u2019s SDGs, with a launching point of training data scientists to develop and deploy GPU-accelerated models that improve flood prediction,\u201d said Keith Strier, vice president of global AI initiatives at NVIDIA.\nUNOSAT has developed a module for the Deep Learning Institute\u2019s free online course that covers how to build a deep learning model to automate the detection of flood events.\nCalled Disaster Risk Monitoring Using Satellite Imagery, it\u2019s the first NVIDIA DLI course focused on climate action for the global public sector community \u2014 with many additional climate-action-related courses being planned.\nUNOSAT\u2019s module \u2014 based on a real UN case study \u2014 highlights an example of a flood in Nepal.\nIn collaboration with NVIDIA, UNOSAT is offering the module for free with the goal of upskilling data scientists worldwide to harness accelerated computing to predict and respond to climate-related disasters.\n\u201cWe aim to democratize access to accelerated computing to help nations train more accurate deep learning models that better predict and respond to a full spectrum of humanitarian and natural disasters,\u201d Strier said.\nGet started with the course, which is now available.\nLearn more about how NVIDIA technology is used to improve the planet and its people.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Data Science | Deep Learning Institute | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA EGX | Science | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Jazz is all about improvisation \u2014 and NVIDIA is paying tribute to the genre with AI research that could one day enable graphics creators to improvise with 3D objects created in the time it takes to hold a jam session.\nThe method, NVIDIA 3D MoMa, could empower architects, designers, concept artists and game developers to quickly import an object into a graphics engine to start working with it, modifying scale, changing the material or experimenting with different lighting effects.\nNVIDIA Research showcased this technology in a video celebrating jazz and its birthplace, New Orleans, where the paper behind 3D MoMa will be presented this week at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.\n\nExtracting 3D Objects From 2D Images\nInverse rendering, a technique to reconstruct a series of still photos into a 3D model of an object or scene, \u201chas long been a holy grail unifying computer vision and computer graphics,\u201d said David Luebke, vice president of graphics research at NVIDIA.\n\u201cBy formulating every piece of the inverse rendering problem as a GPU-accelerated differentiable component, the NVIDIA 3D MoMa rendering pipeline uses the machinery of modern AI and the raw computational horsepower of NVIDIA GPUs to quickly produce 3D objects that creators can import, edit and extend without limitation in existing tools,\u201d he said.\nTo be most useful for an artist or engineer, a 3D object should be in a form that can be dropped into widely used tools such as game engines, 3D modelers and film renderers. That form is a triangle mesh with textured materials, the common language used by such 3D tools.\nTriangle meshes are the underlying frames used to define shapes in 3D graphics and modeling.\nGame studios and other creators would traditionally create 3D objects like these with complex photogrammetry techniques that require significant time and manual effort. Recent work in neural radiance fields can rapidly generate a 3D representation of an object or scene, but not in a triangle mesh format that can be easily edited.\nNVIDIA 3D MoMa generates triangle mesh models within an hour on a single NVIDIA Tensor Core GPU. The pipeline\u2019s output is directly compatible with the 3D graphics engines and modeling tools that creators already use.\nThe pipeline\u2019s reconstruction includes three features: a 3D mesh model, materials and lighting. The mesh is like a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 model of a 3D shape built from triangles. With it, developers can modify an object to fit their creative vision. Materials are 2D textures overlaid on the 3D meshes like a skin. And NVIDIA 3D MoMa\u2019s estimate of how the scene is lit allows creators to later modify the lighting on the objects.\nTuning Instruments for Virtual Jazz Band\nTo showcase the capabilities of NVIDIA 3D MoMa, NVIDIA\u2019s research and creative teams started by collecting around 100 images each of five jazz band instruments \u2014 a trumpet, trombone, saxophone, drum set and clarinet \u2014 from different angles.\nNVIDIA 3D MoMa reconstructed these 2D images into 3D representations of each instrument, represented as meshes. The NVIDIA team then took the instruments out of their original scenes and imported them into the NVIDIA Omniverse 3D simulation platform to edit.\n\nIn any traditional graphics engine, creators can easily swap out the material of a shape generated by NVIDIA 3D MoMa, as if dressing the mesh in different outfits. The team did this with the trumpet model, for example, instantly converting its original plastic to gold, marble, wood or cork.\nCreators can then place the newly edited objects into any virtual scene. The NVIDIA team dropped the instruments into a Cornell box, a classic graphics test for rendering quality. They demonstrated that the virtual instruments react to light just as they would in the physical world, with the shiny brass instruments reflecting brightly, and the matte drum skins absorbing light.\nThese new objects, generated through inverse rendering, can be used as building blocks for a complex animated scene \u2014 showcased in the video\u2019s finale as a virtual jazz band.\nThe paper behind NVIDIA 3D MoMa will be presented in a session at CVPR on June 22 at 1:30 p.m. Central time. It\u2019s one of 38 papers with NVIDIA authors at the conference.

products to market faster,\u201d Busch said during an event at Siemens\u2019 Munich headquarters.\nPairing physics-based digital models from Siemens with real-time AI from NVIDIA, the companies announced they will connect the Siemens Xcelerator and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms.\nThe connection between Siemens Xcelerator (left) and NVIDIA Omniverse (right) will enable customers to develop full-design-fidelity, closed-loop digital twins.\n\u201cWith our two companies we can connect what Siemens makes with what NVIDIA makes, to AI and Omniverse,\u201d Huang said. \u201cWe can now fuse data from the point of design, all the way through product life cycle management, all the way through the automation of plants to the optimization of the plant after deployment \u2014 that entire life cycle can now be in one world.\u201d\nBringing Real, Virtual Worlds Together\nSiemens Xcelerator is a business platform that includes internet of things-enabled hardware, software and digital services from across Siemens that offer a comprehensive digital twin that can bring together the mechanical, electrical and software domains.\nSiemens is a leader in industrial automation and software, infrastructure, building technology and transportation, and their solutions are used across the manufacturing lifecycle from designing products and the equipment to manufacture those products in factories to controlling and tracking how the equipment moves to orchestrating the flow of people, parts and machines across the factory itself.\nThe company has built a rich portfolio of hardware and software solutions that are part of the Siemens Xcelerator platform that is now at the center of an ecosystem of more than 50 certified partners\nThe NVIDIA Omniverse 3D collaboration and simulation development platform delivers photorealistic rendering capabilities and advanced AI to the Siemens Xcelerator ecosystem, allowing the digital twin to be represented in full-design fidelity, and operating in real time.\nWorking Side by Side\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s event, Busch and Huang outlined their plans, showed a demo video of these technologies working together, and sat down for an informal fireside chat with Milan Nedeljkovic, a member of the board of management of BMW.\n\n\u201cThe digital twin itself is not the challenge,\u201d Nedeljkovic said, outlining BMW\u2019s plans to create sophisticated digital models of its manufacturing process that are linked, in real time to real-world factories. \u201cThe challenge is to link into this digital twin the existing systems one by one, and to have any change in the digital twin being reverted in the original planning tools.\u201d\nBusch and Huang began their conversation by sharing the story behind Wednesday\u2019s news, relaying insights from their meeting in November.\n\u201cWe figured out that when we bring our competencies, our technology, our platforms together, we can do something great,\u201d Busch said. \u201cWe can basically go for the full-fledged industrial metaverse \u2026 to have faster decisions, real-time decisions with higher confidence.\u201d\nTransforming Businesses\nWith the connection of Siemens Xcelerator and NVIDIA Omniverse, manufacturing customers of any size will be able to immediately analyze issues, identify root causes, and simulate and optimize solutions, thanks to the AI-infused, real-time photorealistic virtual environments, Busch and Huang said.\nSo, for example, if something goes wrong on the factory floor, teams of users from around the world will be able to meet, virtually, to collaborate and use the connected digital twin to quickly identify, troubleshoot and solve the problem.\nThe partnership also promises to make factories more efficient and sustainable. Users will more easily be able to turn data streaming from the factory floor PLCs and sensors into AI models. These models can be used to continuously optimize performance, predict problems, reduce energy consumption, and streamline the flow of parts and materials across the factory floor.\nUnder the Hood\nThe partnership brings together complementary technologies and ecosystems, the two leaders said.\nInnovating at the intersection of real and digital worlds, Siemens offers the industry\u2019s most comprehensive digital twin by representing the mechanical, electrical and software domains interacting, Busch explained.\nNVIDIA Omniverse is a multi-GPU scalable virtual world engine that enables teams to connect 3D design and CAD applications for collaborative design workflows and allows users to build physically accurate virtual worlds for training, testing and operating AI agents such as robots and autonomous machines.\nTogether, Xcelerator and Omniverse offer a powerful combination of capabilities.\nTeams will be able to meet and collaborate in NVIDIA Omniverse\u2019s real-time, photorealistic virtual environment.\nFor example, energy and utility plant engineers can virtually navigate through the live digital twin of a facility to analyze the thermal distribution produced by the existing air conditioning. system from Siemens simulations.\nThen they can explore different vents and cooling towers configurations, powered by use the of Omniverse\u2019s full-design-fidelity visualization capabilities enabled by real-time ray- and path-traced rendering.\nUltimately every component inside a factory can be inspected and optimized \u2014 and eventually, automated by AI. A robotic conveyer belt could be trained to alert an operator when the conveyor motor is undergoing excessive energy draw due to improperly greased rollers, saving time and maintenance costs, for example.\nAdvancing Digital Twins\nThese innovations will reach not just from the cloud to the factory floor, but across industries, Busch and Huang explained.\n\u201cYou know, if you look at almost every engineering project today of any significant complexity, we simulate the product before we go to production,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd yet, for most plants and most factories, it\u2019s nearly impossible to do that today \u2026 and so we needed to create a very large-scale simulation platform: Omniverse.\u201d\nThe addition of Siemens Xcelerator to the Omniverse ecosystem will enable domain-specific digital twins, using the rich design, manufacturing and operational data from Siemens\u2019 mechanical, electrical, software, IoT and edge solutions in Omniverse.\n\u201cThe world\u2019s industries represent hundreds of trillions of dollars over time,\u201d Huang said, adding that finding even small efficiencies in such huge systems is a huge opportunity. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why people want to invest and now we have the technology capability for them to do so.\u201d\nBMW\u2019s iFACTORY\nThe two CEOs continued the fireside chat with BMW AG\u2019s Member of the Board of Management, Milan Nedeljkovi\u0107.\nNedeljkovi\u0107 outlined the carmaker\u2019s initiative, dubbed iFACTORY, to make its factories \u201clean, green and digital.\u201d\nAnd he explained how BMW Group is working with both Siemens and NVIDIA to move this effort forward.\n\u201cBy the end of next year BMW will offer 13 fully electrified cars,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we are changing our equipment, we are changing our production environment, we are changing our processes, and all of that needs good planning, and, again, digitization is a part of it.\u201d\nSiemens and NVIDIA are continuing to help BMW with this digital transformation with the companies committing to collaborate to develop BMW\u2019s factory in Debrecen, Hungary.\nBMW is moving fast, planning to get the factory running by 2025. That means Siemens and NVIDIA, who will help BMW model the factory, will need to move fast, too.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make it happen,\u201d Huang said.\nLearn more about Siemens and NVIDIA\u2019s partnership.\n\n\nCategories: Accelerated Analytics | Cloud | Corporate | Data Center | Deep Learning | Hardware | Networking | Pro Graphics | Robotics | SoftwareTags: Digital Twin | Industrial and Manufacturing | Metaverse | Omniverse | Omniverse Enterprise | Rendering \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Better still if the company pays out a consistent dividend that serves as a source of passive income flow. The recent weak sentiment has thrown up opportunities to buy a variety of companies at more attractive valuations. A word of caution, though. Remember to pace your purchases and not go \u201call in\u201d so that you allow yourself to buy more should share prices fall. If I had S$20,000 to spare, here\u2019s where I will consider parking that money. DBS Group (SGX: D05) The bluest of the blue chips has to be DBS Group, Singapore\u2019s largest bank. DBS offers a comprehensive range of banking services to both corporates and individuals. The bank has proven resilient thus far, reporting its second-highest net profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 (1Q2022). It has also been active on the acquisition front, buying up India\u2019s Lakshmi Vilas Bank in 2020 and more recently, Citigroup\u2019s (NYSE: C) Taiwan consumer banking business.  The lender is also trying to broaden its income streams by setting up a digital exchange and has also collaborated with Singapore Exchange Limited (SGX: S68), Temasek Holdings and Standard Chartered Bank (LON: STAN) to set up Climate Impact X, a carbon credits marketplace. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve has raised the benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points recently, its biggest increase since 1994. DBS should see its net interest margin and income rise in tandem with the rising interest rate. Sheng Siong Group Ltd (SGX: OV8) Sheng Siong is one of the largest supermarket chains in Singapore and operates 65 outlets across the island. The group sells a wide variety of products ranging from fresh foods to essentials such as toiletries and household products. The retailer is a good investment option for those who are seeking stability, as its focus on essential goods puts it in a good position to weather downturns. For 1Q2022, Sheng Siong announced a 6% year on year rise in revenue to S$358 million. Net profit improved by 13.9% year on year to S$35.2 million.  The group paid out a total of S$0.062 in dividends for FY2021, translating to a historical dividend yield of 4.1% for its shares. CEO Lim Hock Chee plans to grow the business by opening three to five new stores per year over the next three to five years. He also plans to improve on Sheng Siong\u2019s e-commerce capabilities to reach customers in areas where the group does not currently have a presence. UMS Holdings (SGX: 558) If you\u2019re looking to gain exposure to the growing semiconductor industry, UMS Holdings may be a good choice.   Story continues The group is a one-stop-shop that provides equipment manufacturing and engineering services to manufacturers of semiconductors and related products.UMS reported a good set of numbers for 1Q2022, with revenue surging 71% year on year to S$84.7 million.Net profit rose 26% year on year to S$19.4 million, and the group declared an interim dividend of S$0.01, unchanged from last year.Free cash flow was healthy at S$18.7 million, up from S$14.8 million a year ago.CEO Andy Luong is optimistic about the group\u2019s outlook as he sees accelerating capital expenditure from global wafer fab players.Fab equipment spending is set to post healthy growth and will remain above the US$100 billion mark. Industry capacity is projected to rise by 8% this year and a further 6% next year.Raffles Medical Group (SGX: BSL)If you\u2019re looking for a recession-proof industry, healthcare immediately comes to mind.Raffles Medical Group, or RMG, is an integrated healthcare provider operating in 14 cities within five countries.The group operates three tertiary hospitals and more than 100 multi-disciplinary clinics that offer a wide range of medical and diagnostic services.The hospital operator reported a sparkling set of earnings for FY2021 as it successfully pivoted its business to help the government manage the COVID-19 pandemic.Revenue climbed 27.4% year on year to S$723.8 million while net profit rose 27.7% year on year to S$84.2 million.A final dividend of S$0.028 was paid out, giving its shares a trailing dividend yield of 2.5%.With borders reopening around the world, medical tourism should also resume, boosting RMG\u2019s prospects for FY2022.Our beginner\u2019s guide to investing is finally here!

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Most recently, a Good Class Bungalow (GCB) at Queen Astrid Park has been let to a Chinese national at a monthly rent of $200,000 or $2.4 million a year. Accessible via Sixth Avenue and Coronation Road West, the GCB at Queen Astrid Park sits on an elevated, freehold site of 25,439\u00a0sq ft, which is largely shielded from street view. The GCB is newly completed.

The owner, however, declined the offer as he intended to move into the newly completed house, which has been dubbed \u201cWater Courtyard House\u201d. The unsolicited offer was made by a Chinese resident. \u201cIt\u2019s the very large and luxurious houses that fetch such premiums,\u201d notes Savills\u2019 Wong. \u201cDue to the lack of new stock, these GCBs may not necessarily be brand-new, but must have a contemporary design, with clean lines and designed by a renowned architect.\u201d    This newly completed GCB, dubbed \"Water Courtyard House\" designed by Guz Architects received an unsolicited rental offer of $380,000 a month (Photo: Guz Architects website) \u2018Private clubhouse\u2019 In land-scarce Singapore, living in a large GCB is the ultimate status symbol. \u201cIt\u2019s something that the Chinese, particularly the wealthy from Fujian province, want to secure,\u201d says a real estate broker who specialises in the luxury housing market, and requested anonymity. Not only are these Chinese willing to pay such premium rents, they are equally willing to splash out millions to fit out these trophy homes, adds the broker. Beyond a residence, the GCBs are regarded as \u201cprivate clubhouses\u201d to entertain their friends.  A must-have is a private KTV room with state-of-the-art sound system, and the budget there is $1 million. Another requirement is a putting green. \u201cWe are not talking about any putting green, but a tournament-grade putting green that Tiger Woods himself would use,\u201d says the broker. \u201cThat costs at least $300,000, including all the equipment. And the championship-golf-course grass requires a gardener to tend to it at least twice a week.\u201d   Story continues   Source: URA REALIS, data downloaded as at June 21, 2022\u00a0The highest housing rent recorded on URA Realis this year is $150,000 a month for a GCB at Dalvey Estate, sitting on a land area of about 22,500 to 22,600 sq ft. It was transacted in April this year (see table). Another is a GCB at Jalan Asuhan, off University Road, which was tenanted for $128,000 in March. The GCB sits on a site of 26,100 to 26,200 sq ft, and owing to its size, agents reckon it\u2019s one of the two GCBs sitting at the hilltop of Jalan Asuhan that were designed by Aamer Architects and completed in 2017.  Five units at Eden with a total floor area of 15,100 to 15,200 sq ft was recently rented out for $80,000 a month, according to URA Realis data (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)\u00a0Luxury condo monthly rents closing in on $100,000It's not just GCBs, but also luxury condos, that are seeing rents soar to stratospheric levels. At Draycott Park is Eden, a single 22-storey residential tower designed by Thomas Heatherwick and developed by Hong Kong developer Swire Properties. All 20 units in Eden, which are freehold, were purchased en bloc by the Tsai family of snack food company Want Want China for $293 million in April last year. The building was completed in 2019.\u00a0(See potential condos with en bloc calculator)  Source: EdgeProp LandlensThe units at Eden are said to have identical layout, with four en suite bedrooms and built-up area of 3,035 sq ft each. According to URA rental data, five connected units at Eden with a combined floor area of 15,100 to 15,200 sq ft were leased for a total of $80,000 a month this February. It topped the charts for condo rents in 2022 (see table).  Source: URA REALIS, data downloaded as at June 21, 2022\u00a0The second highest monthly rent of $60,000 was achieved at The Marq on Paterson Hill. It was for a 6,200 to 6,300 sq ft, four-bedroom unit with lap pool at the Signature Tower. The 66-unit, freehold The Marq on Paterson Hill was developed by SC Global Developments and completed in 2011.  A 6,200-6,300 sq ft unit at The Marq on Paterson Hill was rented out for $60,000 a month in April. Asking rent for such units at The Marq is now $100,000 a month (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)\u00a0There are two towers within the development -- the Signature Tower, where typical units are 6,200 to 6,300 sq ft, and come with a lap pool at the balcony; and the Premier Tower, where typical units are 3,200 to 3,300 sq ft four-bedders. The asking monthly rent for a 6,300 sq ft unit at the Signature Tower of The Marq on Paterson Hill is\u00a0$100,000 today.What $45,000 to $48,000 can get youAt the 510-unit, V on Shenton in Marina Bay, there are six penthouses, the biggest of which is the 7,255 sq ft, five-bedroom penthouse on the 52nd level. The penthouse achieved a monthly rent of $48,000.Developed jointly by Singapore Land Group, the 99-year leasehold development is located on Shenton Way. The development was completed in 2017.  Biggest penthouse of 7,255 sq ft at V on Shenton was recently rented out by the owner for $48,000 a month (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)Meanwhile in Sentosa Cove, a four-bedroom, 4,800 sq ft unit on the first level of the luxury condo Seven Palms was rented out for $45,000 per month, the highest rent achieved in Sentosa Cove to date. The deal was believed to be brokered by senior associate vice president Steve Tay\u2019s team at List Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. The 41-unit, 99-year leasehold condo, developed by SC Global Developments, was completed in 2010. Every unit has a sea view, and the development has its own private beach club.The corporate human resource teams of MNCs have had to adjust their rental budgets to the new reality amid soaring rents. \u201cMany MNCs have relocated their regional headquarters from Hong Kong to Singapore, as there are no travel restrictions here,\u201d says Savills\u2019 Wong. That has further fuelled demand at the top end of the housing market. It looks like the rental market will continue to sizzle.

As a first step in this collaboration, the companies plan to connect Siemens Xcelerator, the open digital business platform, and NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122, a platform for 3D design and collaboration. This will enable an industrial metaverse with physics-based digital models from Siemens and real-time AI from NVIDIA in which companies make decisions faster and with increased confidence.\nThe addition of Omniverse to the open Siemens Xcelerator partner ecosystem will accelerate the use of digital twins that can deliver productivity and process improvements across the production and product lifecycles. Companies of all sizes will be able to employ digital twins with real-time performance data; create innovative industrial IoT solutions; leverage actionable insights from analytics at the edge or in the cloud; and tackle the engineering challenges of tomorrow by making visually rich, immersive simulations more accessible.\n\u201cPhotorealistic, physics-based digital twins embedded in the industrial metaverse offer enormous potential to transform our economies and industries by providing a virtual world where people can interact and collaborate to solve real-world problems. Through this partnership, we will make the industrial metaverse a reality for companies of all sizes,\u201d said Roland Busch, President and Chief Executive Officer, Siemens AG. \u201cFor over a decade, our digital twin technology has been helping customers across all industries to boost their productivity and today offer the industry\u2019s most comprehensive digital twin. When Siemens Xcelerator is connected to Omniverse, we will enable a real-time, immersive metaverse that connects hardware and software, from the edge to the cloud with rich data from Siemens\u2019 software and solutions.\u201d\n\u201cSiemens and NVIDIA share a common vision that the industrial metaverse will drive digital transformation. This is just the first step in our joint effort to make this vision real for our customers and all parts of the global manufacturing industry,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO, NVIDIA. \u201cThe connection to Siemens Xcelerator will open NVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse and AI ecosystem to a whole new world of industrial automation that is built using Siemens\u2019 mechanical, electrical, software, IoT and edge solutions.\u201d\nThis partnership brings together complementary technologies and ecosystems to realize the industrial metaverse. Siemens is uniquely positioned at the intersections of the real and digital world, information technology and operational technology. The Siemens Xcelerator platform connects mechanical, electrical and software domains across the product and production processes and enables the convergence of IT and OT.\nNVIDIA Omniverse is an AI-enabled, physically simulated and industrial-scale virtual-world engine that enables for the first time full-fidelity live digital twins. NVIDIA AI, used by more than 25,000 companies worldwide, is the world\u2019s most popular AI platform and the intelligence engine of Omniverse in the cloud and autonomous systems at the edge. NVIDIA Omniverse and AI are ideal computation engines to represent the comprehensive digital twin from Siemens Xcelerator.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

(PHOTO: Getty Images)   SINGAPORE \u2014 Singapore is now the fifth most expensive city in the world, moving up four places from last year, a report released by Swiss private bank Julius Baer showed. The Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2022 also found Singapore cars were the most expensive globally. Cars topped the list based on the price of a BMW X7 obtained from the relevant country website of the manufacturer.  A check by Yahoo Finance Singapore shows that a BMWX7 starts from S$548,888 in Singapore and in the US, it starts from US$74,900 (S$104,000). The report, which ranked 24 cities, but excluded Moscow this year and was released Wednesday (15 June), found that Asia was still the most expensive region in the world, with Asian cities holding six of the top 10 in the list. Shanghai retained first place in the global ranking, maintaining its status from last year, while London, Taipei and Hong Kong took second, third and fourth place respectively. Other notable Asian cities, such as Tokyo, fell six places to eighth most expensive city this year, while Bangkok fell four places to 15th place.

Ongoing global uncertainty, prompted by the pandemic, and sustained by rising inflation and increased geopolitical tension, has only sharpened the need for investors to protect their purchasing power and, in the long-term, actively plan to preserve their wealth.\u201d The report, which is Julius Baer\u2019s third annual report, also ranked countries according to luxury items. It found that Singapore was the most expensive country for cars, followed by Sao Paolo and Jakarta.   Singapore cars were ranked the most expensive, among the cities surveyed.   The other items considered were: jewellery, ladies\u2019 handbag, shoes, men\u2019s suit, wine, whisky, business class flight, health insurance, hotel suite, Lasik, lawyer, MBA, degustation dinner, treadmill, watch, technology package, bicycle. Generally, prices increased between 2 per cent and 53 per cent year-on-year for most items in Singapore, with the most drastic surge in whisky. Only the prices for four items \u2013 ladies\u2019 handbags, wine, MBA and health insurance \u2013 dropped from between 2 per cent to 20 per cent from last year.   Story continues   Treadmills, health insurance and watches are cheaper in Singapore than in other cities.  Overall, the biggest price increases globally was in technology packages, which includes electronic items. There was a 41 per cent increase year-on-year for technology packages, which the report attributed to the launch of a new MacBook.The second biggest price increase was in lawyers fees, which had a 32.6 per cent rise year-on-year. The next biggest were in bicycles, whisky and degustation dinners, which showed 30.4 per cent, 27.4 per cent and 26 per cent increases year-on-year respectively.The report also contained Baer's first lifestyle survey, which assessed how the spending habits of high net worth individuals have changed in the last year in comparison to before the pandemic.One observation was that the demand for technology grew across all regions, in correlation with the price increase. This was likely due to the pandemic, which saw a rise in working from home. The change also led to more frequent upgrading of personal technology from smart phones to Wi-Fi-enabled equipment. The investment in technology will likely persist as people continue to work away from offices, the report added.The report concluded that complexity and uncertainty will persist, with the pandemic, stretched supply chains, inflation and geopolitical uncertainty factoring in.Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingapore  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Things do appear to be on the up-an-up though, as graphics cards are continuing to come down in price, to the point where they're almost at their MSRPs again. This is good news and seems to suggest a return to some semblance of normalcy. On top of that, it looks as though shipments for graphical tech is also falling. \nAccording to a recent report from Jon Peddie Research, as spotted by Tom's Hardware, demand for graphics cards from both AMD and Nvidia has seen a decline this year. While the numbers show that 96 million units have been sold in Q1 of this year, that actually represents a drop by 6.2%. The reason for the decline seems to stem from numerous factors, from disturbances in countries like China and Ukraine, as well as the easing up of lockdowns since they began back in 2020. However, JPR predicts that growth will go up over the next few years.\nRELATED: Rumor: Nvidia Ada Series Launch Schedule Confirmed, RTX 4090 to Be the First\nThat's not to say that graphics cards are becoming less popular. It just seems as though a number of influences are resulting in less demand for hardware products. With AMD looking to launch the RDNA 3 this year, and its biggest rival Nvidia due to unveil the RTX 40 series soon, it's likely that an interest in GPUs is only going to increase as the weeks and months progress. With demand dipping slightly, this may also help to alleviate some of the issues many have been having when it comes to actually procuring hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Intel's CEO saying the chip shortages could go on until 2024, it's entirely possible that the market is not out of the woods yet. Having said that, no one can truly say what the future will hold for the industry, but with COVID restrictions being lifted for a lot of the world, it seems as though fewer people may be demanding new graphics cards, which could help supplies overall.\nAs Nvidia prepares its Ada Lovelace range, and AMD does the same for RDNA 3, the giants of the GPU world are seemingly not letting the deficit get in the way of their plans. It may still be bad news for a while, but recent developments suggest that things are not as bleak as they once were.\nMORE: With the GPU Shortage, Gaming Laptops and Pre-Builts Are The Only Alternative\nSource: Jon Peddie Research, Tom's Hardware \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming News\n\n\n\n\nAMD\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS2 is No Longer the Best-Selling Video Game Console of All Time in the US\n\t\t\n\n\nPS2\n\nSony's beloved PlayStation 2 is no longer the best-selling console in video game history as new sales figures reveal a new industry leader.\n\n\nPosts\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nAaron McKinley\n\n\nDec 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSome PS5 Pro 30th Anniversary Edition Pre-Orders Are Being Canceled\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nMatthew Schomer\n\n\nSep 27, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIncredible Xbox Series X Deal Found at Pawn Shop\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nSarah Fields\n\n\n4 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS5 Pro Packaging Has Interesting Spin on Console's Lack of a Disc Drive\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nAaron McKinley\n\n\nNov 1, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCRKD Fortnite Festival Edition NEO S Controller Review\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nCarley Garcia\n\n\n15 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRumor: Sony May Be Working on Native PS3 Backwards Compatibility\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nEdiz Guner\n\n\nJun 23, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNew Avatar Video Game Available Now\n\t\t\n\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender\n\nA new Avatar: The Last Airbender mobile game is now available to play, allowing gamers to build a team of legendary heroes to protect the world.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tReignbreaker: Best Resolve Upgrades to Unlock Early\n\t\t\n\n\nReignbreaker\n\nThe Resolve Upgrades in Reignbreaker can significantly improve your abilities.

But is there a better way? NVIDIA's GeForce Experience might be your best solution for optimizing games. \n                        Game Ready Driver Prompts\n               \nIf you're the proud owner of an NVIDIA GeForce GTX graphics card, it's worth downloading the NVIDIA GeForce Experience app. While it's not a requirement to play games on your PC, it can enhance your gaming experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the main benefits of GeForce Experience is its Game Ready Drivers feature. You can manually search for driver updates, or you can set the software to automatically notify you of them. These drivers are often released prior to the launch of a new game and include bug fixes and performance boosters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen installing the latest drivers, NVIDIA GeForce Experience allows you to choose between \"custom\" or \"express\" installation. Custom installation means you can check the current and latest version of the drivers available, as well as see if other drivers, like audio drivers, are available.\nHowever, driver updates are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to exploring what GeForce Experience can really do to optimize your games.\nRelated: How to Download NVIDIA Drivers Without GeForce Experience \n                        Optimized Games in the Palm of Your Hand\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most useful features of GeForce Experience is the ability to optimize your game library at the click of a button. NVIDIA performs thousands of tests and uses its cloud data center to find the prime settings for your PC based on its components. You can do this on a per-game basis or ask NVIDIA to automatically optimize any newly added games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also view independent in-game settings by hovering over each setting to see exactly how NVIDIA's in-depth optimization can enhance your game performance. This software allows you to go much further than most games' basic graphics settings enable you to.\nThe slideshow will display the game that you're currently optimizing, making the settings easier to understand. And, if you'd prefer to adjust the settings yourself, you can do this by clicking the wrench icon to optimize for performance or quality. Here you can also override the resolution and display mode for each game.\nNVIDIA doesn't get it right all of the time, but it's certainly a lot easier to optimize your games in one fell swoop. If you know what you like and don't like, such as motion blur, you can optimize the settings automatically, then manually go in and change the ones you want. \n                        Streaming Made Simple\n               \nAside from being able to optimize your games, you can use NVIDIA ShadowPlay to record and stream your gameplay, allowing you to share your content far and wide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile in-game, you can record your gameplay by pressing Alt+F9; this will record anything you're doing in your game with the files accessible on your PC once you stop recording. You can choose to record in low, medium, or high quality, or pick your own custom settings. This includes being able to adjust the resolution and frame rates.\nIf you'd prefer to record for just a small amount of time, to capture a specific scene or action, you can also use ShadowPlay's Instant Replay feature by pressing Alt+F10; this can be set using a predefined length between 15 seconds and 20 minutes.\nRelated: How Do Frame Rates Affect the Gaming Experience?\nFor streamers, ShadowPlay can also be used to broadcast live to a range of platforms including Facebook, Twitch, and YouTube. But, that's not all, because you can add custom branding and personalize your HUD to display viewer count, comments, and more. So, once you've optimized your games using NVIDIA GeForce Experience, you can share your creations with the world for viewers to marvel at. \n                        Screenshots Never Looked So Good\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you're using Steam or another game platform, there's always been a way to take screenshots in-game, so you may wonder how NVIDIA Ansel is that different. Rather than taking a basic screenshot, Ansel allows you to use its camera to take snaps of a wide variety of angles and then use the post-processing filters to create a truly stylized image.\nFrom vignette filters to adding stickers, you can capture 4K images to show off your gameplay. You can open NVIDIA Ansel by pressing Alt+F2 while in a compatible game, allowing you to see everything that's on offer using the overlay. \n                        Using GeForce Experience\n               \nRegardless of what kind of gamer you are, NVIDIA GeForce Experience is a must-have for those that have an NVIDIA GeForce GTX graphics card installed.\nNot only does it take away the tiresome chore of checking for driver updates, but it also makes it incredibly easy to optimize your games so they can be played the way they're meant to, taking your computer's hardware into account.\nRelated: How to Hide NVIDIA's GeForce Experience In-Game Overlay Icons and Alt+Z Notification \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Games\n\n\n\n\nPC Gaming\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

(Image Credits: Moore's Law is Dead)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe alleged renders of NVIDIA's next-gen 'Ada Lovelace' BFGPUs, the GeForce RTX 4090 Ti & RTX 4090 have been revealed by Moore's Law is Dead. The renders showcase the updated Founders Edition coolers that will be utilized by the flagship AD102 GPUs.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti & RTX 4090 Graphics Card's Alleged Renders Point To 3-Slot BFGPU Coolers\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti graphics card cooler was allegedly leaked out a while back. The very convincing photos possibly gave us a first look at the updated yet similar Founders Edition coolers that would be utilized by the next-gen Ada Lovelace-powered BFGPUs. Now MLID has a new set of renders for the same AD102 cards in various angles. The renders were made using information that the insider gathered through his sources.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nSo starting with the details, NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4090 Ti and RTX 4090 are going to be some insanely power-hungry designs with TGP ratings of 450 to 600W. Based on the previous leaks & recent rumors from Kopite7kimi, it looks like the GeForce RTX 40 series will utilize similar coolers that are utilized by the existing RTX 30 series but with some internal changes. The FE cooler for the RTX 4090 Ti and RTX 4090 is said to be between either 3 or 3.5 slots and will carry more fins and more heatsink surface area. Will that be enough to keep the next-gen GPUs in check?\n\nAt least, they designed a triple-fan cooler for reference board of AD102. https://t.co/vQb2KnpE4y\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) June 9, 2022\n\n\nNo necessary now. RTX 4090 looks like a RTX 3090 Ti, RTX 4080 does that too. RTX 4070 looks like a RTX 3070 Ti.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) June 21, 2022\n\nWell, you can look at the existing Founders Edition cooler for the RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti graphics cards. Both share the same cooler despite the latter pushing the TGP figures up by almost 30% (350W vs 450W). Despite that, the same cooler managed to keep the 3090 Ti run cooler and hit its clock targets without the need to change the heatsink design or the fan speeds of the card itself. So if the existing Founders Edition design can manage 450W TGP cards easily, then an updated version with more surface area in a slightly thicker package would surely be enough for up to 600 Watt cards.\n\nOther things of the card such as the dual flow-through fan design will remain the same while the logos on the shroud will light up with LED illumination. One thing is for sure, you'd require a lot of chassis room to accommodate these next-gen BFGPUs such as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti & RTX 4090. Plus, you'd also need to invest in a very solid PSU rated at least 1200W (or above). The next-generation GeForce RTX 40 flagship is expected to launch in October with the rest of the line following in the months ahead.

The card will also pack a 4 GB of GDDR6 memory across a 64-bit memory bus, a huge cut-down from the 128-bit bus that the TU117 GPU has at its disposal.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\n\nAs such, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1630 graphics card delivers a maximum bandwidth of 96 GB/s which is half that of the GTX 1650.\nThe bandwidth is also less than the GeForce GTX 1050 Ti graphics card, a Pascal series graphics card from six years ago,\u00a0 but retains the 4GB GDDR6 memory base clock of 12 Gbps. The graphics card will feature a TDP of 75W and core clocks will be configured at 1785 MHz though there are several custom models that ship with an external power connector and deliver over 1800 MHz max clocks.\nWith the specs out of the way, the only review for the card at the moment comes from Tech Power Up. The tech outlet managed to get hands-on a GTX 1650 Ghost custom model from Gainward and while the card does offer 3x the performance improvement over its predecessor, the GT 1030, the RX 6400 offers 55-60% higher performance at a similar price point and at the same power figures.\n\nOverall, if you look at this card, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1630 is primarily designed for the entry-level and OEM segment. As such, it will be a very silent launch that will go unnoticed by several gamers but you would be surprised to see large quantities of these GPUs on market shelves as Turing is abundant in supply and NVIDIA wants to get rid of as many old chips as they can.\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1630 Graphics Card Custom Models:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nMSRP has been suggested as around $140-$150 US though retailers may offer the card close to $155-$160 US and even as high as $200 US. The card is mainly going to be available in Asian Pacific markets and there's already a new driver out, the Game Ready 516.59 WHQL, which adds support for the new graphics card.\nNVIDIA GeForce 16 Series Specifications\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 2060 FEGeForce GTX 1660 Ti 6GB\nGeForce GTX 1660 SUPER 6GB\nGeForce GTX 1660 6GB\nGeForce GTX 1650 SUPER 4 GBGeForce GTX 1650 4 GBGeForce GTX 1630 4 GB\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture (GPU)\nTU106TU116-400TU116-300TU116-300TU116TU117\nTU106TU117\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n19201536 140814081280896512\n\n\nTensor Cores\n240N / AN / AN / AN / AN / AN / A\n\n\nRT cores\n30N / AN / AN / AN / AN / AN / A\n\n\nTexture Units\n120 96 8888805632\n\n\nROPs\n48484848323232\n\n\nBase Clock\n1365 MHz1500 MHz1530 MHz1530 MHzTBD1485 MHzTBD\n\n\nGPU Boost\n1680 MHz1770 MHz1785 MHz1785 MHzTBD1665 MHz1800 MHz\n\n\nMemory\n6GB GDDR66GB GDDR66GB GDDR66GB GDDR54GB GDDR54GB GDDR54GB GDDR6?\n\n\nMemory Bus\n192-bit192-bit192-bit192-bit128-bit128-bit64-bit\n\n\nMemory Clocks\n14 Gbps12 Gbps14 Gbps8 Gbps12 Gbps8 Gbps12\n\n\nL2 cache\n3 MB1.5 MB1.5 MB1.5 MB1.5 MB1.5 MB1.5 MB\n\n\nTDP\n160 W120W125W120W100W75W>75W\n\n\nTransistors\n10.8 billion6.6 billion6.6 billion6.6 billion6.6 billion4.7 billion4.7 billion\n\n\nDie Size\n445 mm\u00b2284mm2284mm2284mm2284mm2200mm2200mm2\n\n\nPrice\n$349$279$229$229$159$149$119?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n153\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n87\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n75\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

This new information comes from our sources close to the GPU industry but we would still advise our readers to treat it as a rumor for now.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Rumored Launch Schedule: RTX 4090 In October, RTX 4080 In November, RTX 4070 In December, RTX 4060 Unveil at CES 2023\nNow there have been rumors going around that NVIDIA will be launching its GeForce RTX 4090 GPU first followed by the RTX 4080, RTX 4070, and RTX 4060. This indeed seems to be the case however, the actual launch might still be a few months away as we have learned from our sources. We know that it was recently reported that the launches will happen as early as Q3 2022 but it looks like the new schedule has moved the launch of the first three graphics cards to Q4 2022 while the RTX 4060 could be pushed back to a CES 2023 unveil.\nRelated Story NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Graphics Card - October 2022 Launch\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Graphics Card - November 2022 Launch\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Graphics Card - December 2022 Launch\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Graphics Card - January CES 2023 Unveil\n\nThe GeForce RTX 4090 will be the first to launch, followed by its siblings, the RTX 4080 and the RTX 4070. If you recall the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series launch, you will remember that the green team also announced the trio of its Ampere cards, the RTX 3090, RTX 3080, and RTX 3070 the same day however, the launches took place a few weeks apart from each other. The first graphics card within the RTX 30 series wasn't available in retail until a month later (1st September RTX 30 Unveil, 24th September RTX 3080 Retail launch).\nThe GeForce RTX 3090 was launched for retail availability by the end of September so an October launch for the RTX 4090 will mark almost 24 months since the previous graphics card.\n\nNVIDIA first launched the GeForce RTX 3080 in the market followed by the RTX 3090 and the RTX 3070. The mainstream RTX 3060 cards came in months later. This time, however, NVIDIA is said to focus on its upper echelon of cards first such as the GeForce RTX 4090. We can the company using a similar launch schedule as the RTX 30 series with each launch being a few weeks apart. So while the cards could be announced by Q3 2022, the RTX 4090 won't be available till Q4 2022 and the GeForce RTX 4080 will slip into November while the RTX 4070 will be available on store shelves by December.\nThe trio of GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards is expected to utilize different Ada Lovelace GPU designs with the RTX 4090 using the top AD102 SKU, the RTX 4080 using the AD103 SKU while the RTX 4070 is expected to feature the AD104 GPU SKU. During its\u00a0recent earnings call, NVIDIA stated that the demand for graphics cards in the crypto segment has already dried up and most AIBs are stating that they still have large quantities of Ampere GPUs left which need to get out into the hands of consumers so we can expect new discounted deals and promotions by NVIDIA and their partners in the coming months. NVIDIA may even offer discounted prices to OEMs to feature the RTX 30 series cards within their gaming lineups.\n\nThe AD102 and the AD103 GPUs are expected to utilize the same PCB, PG139, but the SKU will vary slightly with the RTX 4090 using the PG139-330 SKU and the RTX 4080 using a PG139-360 SKU.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 will be the first Ada Lovelace card for 2023, being unveiled at CES 2023 and launching a few weeks later.

This is lower than the annual growth rate of 6.3% which is predicted between 2022 and 2026 to reach an installed base of 3.3 million units while the penetration of discrete graphics is expected to hit 46%.\nRelated Story AMD Targets NVIDIA\u2019s Grace & Intel Granite Rapids Xeon CPUs With New 5th Gen EPYC Performance Showcase, Up To 2.75x Power Efficiency\n\nComing to the vendor breakdown, NVIDIA saw the biggest market share increase of 1.69% and now stands at 21% while AMD's market share increased 0.7%, hitting 19% total GPU share. Intel's GPUs saw a decline of -2.4% and currently stand at 60% market share. The reason for Intel's GPU market share still being so high is because all of their CPUs with iGPUs are accounted for in the report. The overall shipments for NVIDIA increased by 3.2% while AMD and Intel saw a decline of -6.2% and -1.5 percent, respectively.\n\n\n\nDiscrete GPU Market Share (Q1 2022)\n\n\n\nQ1\u201921\nQ4\u201921\nQ1\u201922\n\n\nAMD\n19%\n18%\n17%\n\n\nIntel\nNA\n5%\n4%\n\n\nNvidia\n81%\n78%\n78%\n\n\n\nThe discrete GPU market share is a different story where NVIDIA retained 78% market share from the previous quarter, AMD declined -by 1% to 17%, & Intel saw a -1% decline down to 4%. Do note that Intel's Arc GPUs were introduced at the tail end of Q1 2022 so they have yet to amount to any significant market share yet. The GPUs are also limited to certain markets at the moment so they won't be amounting to any significant market share till the end of 2022.\nQuick highlights\n\nThe GPU\u2019s overall attach rate (which includes integrated and discrete GPUs, desktops, notebooks, and workstations) to PCs for the quarter was 129%, up 5.0% from last quarter.\nThe overall PC CPU market decreased by -10.8% quarter-to-quarter and decreased by -26.2% year-to-year.\nDesktop graphics add-in boards (AIBs that use discrete GPUs) increased by 1.4% from the last quarter.\nThis quarter saw a 16.5% drop in tablet shipments from last quarter.\n\n\nWe also have more data coming in from Tech Analyst, Mike Bruzzone (Camp Marketing) who has reported a discrete GPU share of 80.67% for NVIDIA and 19.43% for AMD. According to the new statistics (1st week of 2022), NVIDIA's Ampere GPUs amount to 84.87% market share while AMD's RDNA 2 GPUs amount to 15.23% market share.\nFor the AMD GPU market share, the breakdown is as follows:\nCommercial (DC) = 0.57% includes V340 and Instinct listed below\nAnalyst believes AMD data center higher on production share\nWorkstation = 2.64%\nDesktop = 88.75%\nMobile = 8.04%\nBack 2 generation N6x, N5x % by product category week of 5.28.22 only;\nCommercial (DC) = 0.37% includes V340 and Instinct listed below\nWorkstation = 2.46%\nDesktop = 86.21%\nMobile = 10.96%\nFor the NVIDIA GPU market share, the breakdown is as follows:\nCommercial (DC) = 0.17%\nWorkstation = 7.52%\nDesktop = 72.98%\nConsumer Mobile = 19.33%\nBack 2 generation % by product category week of 5.28.22;\nCommercial (DC) = 0.18%\nWorkstation = 3.12% desktop + 3.12% laptop = 6.23% total\nDesktop = 68.45%\nConsumer Mobile = 25.13%\nWith the prices dropping and graphics card vendors picking up their marketing game for the gaming segment, we can expect GPU shipments to increase in the second half of 2022. Both NVIDIA & AMD are also expected to launch their next-generation lineup later this year which will also push shipments further up.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJP Morgan Believes AMD\u2019s AI GPU Business Would Grow By 60 Percent This Year, Highlights Oracle\u2019s Initial Order Of 30,000 MI355X GPUs\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n153\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n87\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n75\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Wilson \u2022\nJun 18, 2022 at 03:07pm EDT\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated 6/20/2022, 12.16 AM GMT+5: This article was updated to correct an error with the headline and text which incorrectly attributed the contract to NVIDIA instead of Atos.\nNVIDIA unveiled the Grace SUPERCHIP earlier this year, ensuring a high-powered Arm-based chipset that would rival AMD and Intel's x86 HPC (High-Performance Computing) presence. HPC Wire now reports that Atos has signed a $160 million contract to assist with the supercomputing hardware for the MareNostrum 5 system installed as part of the EuroHPC JU initiative and will be using NVIDIA Grace chips.\nNVIDIA Arm-based Grace Superchips to see use in Atos' new MareNostrum 5 Supercomputer as part of EuroHPC initiative\nThe location of the new venture will be in Spain at the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre (BSC) and will begin operating by next year.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB MemoryMareNostrum 5 is expected to offer 314 Petaflops of FP 64 computing power performance levels between computer and graphics processor accelerators. Additionally, another 200 Petabytes of storage will be used for in-access workloads, and up to 400 Petabytes will be used for cold storage. It is anticipated that the MareNostrum 5 will hold the Petabyte node used in a NAND-based storage subsystem that will need to reach swift levels. At the same time, the cold storage node will utilize HDD topologies that are older and more cost-efficient. The cold storage node is also active storage, using critical data not typically accessed.\n\nThe new Arm-based Superchip system will use the NVIDIA Grace 144-core chips configured in dual-chip settings and combined with the H100 dGPU accelerators, showcasing 80 billion transistors each with 3.2 TB/s bandwidth and 80 GB of HBM3 memory. In turn, the MareNostrum 5 should transmit over 18 Exaflops of artificial intelligence acceleration and potentially be the most efficient AI supercomputer in the European Union.\nAtos, the company behind the MareNostrum 5, will also utilize the Quantum-2 InfiniBand software-defined networking to\u00a0stabilize the company's BlueField data processing units, all parts communicating at lower latency levels with a much higher throughput of 400 GB/s. This output in performance is similar to the same in Cray's Slingshot interconnect.\nThe acquisition of MareNostrum 5 will enable world-changing scientific breakthroughs such as the creation of digital twins to help solve global challenges like climate change and the advancement of precision medicine. In addition, [BSC] is committed to developing European hardware to be used in future generations of supercomputers and helping to achieve technological sovereignty for the EU's member states.\n\u2014 Mateo Valero, director, BSC\nWebsite The Next Platform projects that the MareNostrum 5 could deliver up to 4,500 H100 accelerators or 270 petaflops of FP64 boost from the Tensor Cores on the Superchips. The final 44 Petaflops of performance of FP64 would come from the NVIDIA dual-CPU systems. Each NVIDIA Grace chip will offer 3.84 teraflops of execution, equaling up to 5,730 dual-layered Grace modules.\nThe MareNostrum 5 supercomputer is specifically focused on medical research, chemistry simulations, the development of new drugs, climate science, and applications focused on environmental engineering. NVIDIA will supply their Omniverse software package to assist in accessing larger-than-life, accurate industrial systems and processes.\nThe MareNostrum 5 will be fully powered by renewable energies, while the excess heat will be repurposed, making the system more environmentally friendly. However, it is unknown how the MareNostrum 5 will reuse the heat and at what level it will be processed. It is expected to follow other supercomputer designs, such as rival AMD and the LUMI supercomputer.\nNews Sources: Tom's Hardware, HPC Wire, NVIDIA, The Next Platform\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n153\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n87\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n75\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Nvidia reported results for all eight of the tests.The benchmark tests report how many minutes it takes to tune the neural \"weights,\" or parameters, until the computer program achieves a required minimum accuracy on a given tasks, a process referred to as \"training\" a neural network.\u00a0Across all vendors, training times showed significant improvements thanks to both greater horsepower and smarter software approaches. In a media briefing, the MLCommons's executive director, David Kanter explained that in broad strokes, the results show that training has increased in performance better than Moore's Law, the traditional rule of thumb that says a chip's doubling in transistors every 18 to 24 months speeds up computer performance.\u00a0Also:\u00a0Google uses MLPerf competition to showcase performance on gigantic version of BERT language modelScores on the venerable ImageNet task, for example, where a neural network is trained to assign a classifier label to millions of images, is 9 to 10 times faster today than simple chip improvements would imply, said Kanter.\u00a0\"We've done a lot better than Moore's Law,\" said Kanter. \"You would expect to get about three and a half times better performance, assuming that transistors linearly relate to performance; as it turns out, we're getting 10x Moore's Law.\"The benefits trickle down to \"the common man or woman,\" said Kanter, \"the researcher with a single workstation\" containing just 8 chips, he said.\u00a0Nvidia, which dominates sales of the GPU chips that make up the majority of AI computing in the world, routinely submits results for most or all of the tests. Those single workstations are seeing improvements or 4 to 8 times simple transistor scaling, he noted. \"We're putting a lot more capabilities into the hands of researchers, which allows us to run more experiments and, hopefully, make more discoveries.\"Also:\u00a0MLCommons unveils a new way to evaluate the world's fastest supercomputersGoogle, whose TPU is one of the main competitors to Nvidia chips, has a much less consistent track record with MLPerf. In December's benchmark report, the company only submitted one test number, for an experimental use of its TPU on the BERT test.Google said in prepared remarks, \"Google's TPU v4 [version 4] ML supercomputers set performance records on five benchmarks, with an average speedup of 1.42x over the next fastest non-Google submission, and 1.5x vs our MLPerf 1.0 submission.\"\u00a0   Google's reference to five benchmarks includes a reported best score on recommendation systems for a research system that is not commercially available.\u00a0Asked by ZDNet why Google chose to compete with commercial systems in the four categories and not the other four, the company said in an email response, \"Our intent with submissions is to focus primarily on workloads that maximize benefits beyond MLPerf for us.Also:\u00a0AI industry, obsessed with speed, is loathe to consider the energy cost in latest MLPerf benchmark\"We make a decision on which models to submit based on their resemblance to ML models used within Google and by customers of Google Cloud. Submitting and tuning benchmarks is a significant amount of work so we focus our efforts to maximize benefits beyond MLPerf for us.\u00a0\"Given this, we focused our efforts on four benchmarks for the Cloud available category - BERT, ResNet, RetinaNet, MaskRCNN.\"\u00a0Nvidia emphasized the comprehensive scope of submissions by itself and by partners including Dell and Lenovo. Computers using Nvidia chips of one kind or another were responsible for 105 systems and 235 reported test results out of the total 264 reported results.   \"NVIDIA and its partners continued to provide the best overall AI training performance and the most submissions across all benchmarks with 90% of all entries coming from the ecosystem, according to MLPerf benchmarks released today,\" Nvidia executive Shar Narasimhan said in prepared remarks.Also:\u00a0Graphcore brings new competition to Nvidia in latest MLPerf AI benchmarks\"The NVIDIA AI platform covered all eight benchmarks in the MLPerf Training 2.0 round, highlighting its leading versatility.\"In one slide, Narasimhan showed what he said was a \"normalized\" measurement that tried to achieve a per-accelerator performance, given that the different machine submissions use different numbers of accelerator chips. This measure, said Narasimhan, showed Nvidia being tops in performance on 6 of the 8 tests.\u00a0\"We believe that this particular methodology of showing the highest performance normalized to 1.0 X and then showing all of the remaining accelerators at similar scale in comparison is the fairest way to compare everybody,\" said Narasimhan.   Among other developments, the MLPerf test continued to gain adherents and garnered more test results than in past. A total of 21 organizations reported the 264 test results, up from 14 organizations and 181 reported submissions in the December version 1.1 report.\u00a0 \u00a0The new entrants included Asustek; the Chinese Academy of Sciences, or CASIA; computer maker H3C; HazyResearch, the name submitted by a single grad student; Krai, which has participated in the other MLPerf competition, inference, but never before in training; and startup MosaicML.Among top-five commercial systems, Nvidia and Google were trailed by a handful of submitters that managed to achieve third, fourth or fifth place.\u00a0Also:\u00a0To measure ultra-low power AI, MLPerf gets a TinyML benchmarkMicrosoft's Azure cloud unit took second place in the image segmentation competition, fourth place in the object detection competition with high-resolution images, and third place in the speech recognition competition, all using systems with AMD EPYC processors and Nvidia GPUs.Computer maker H3C took fifth place in four of the tests, the image segmentation competition, the object detection competition with high-resolution images, the recommendations engine, and Go game playing, and was able to also make it to fourth place in speech recognition. All of those systems used Intel XEON processors and Nvidia GPUs.Dell Technologies held the fourth place in object detection with the lower-resolution images, and fifth place in the BERT natural-language test, both with systems using AMD processors and Nvidia GPUs.Also:\u00a0AI industry's performance benchmark, MLPerf, for the first time also measures the energy that machine learning consumesComputer maker Inspur took fifth place in speech recognition with a system using AMD EPYC processors and Nvidia GPUs, and held the third and fourth-place results in recommendation systems, with XEON-based and EPYC-based systems, respectively.\u00a0Graphcore, the Bristol, England-based startup building computers with an alternative chip and software approach, took fifth place in ImageNet. IT solutions provider Nettrix took\u00a0 fourth place in the image segmentation competition and fourth place in the Go reinforcement learning challenge.   The top five submitters in each of the eight benchmark tests, with number of minutes it took them to train the neural nets listed for the tasks listed. A smaller number means less time to train, which is better. MLCommonsIn a briefing for journalists, Graphcore emphasized its ability to provide competitive scores versus Nvidia at lower prices for its BowPOD machines with varying numbers of its IPU accelerator chips. The company touted its BowPOD256, for example, which had the fifth-place score in ResNet image recognition, being ten times faster than an 8-way Nvidia DGX system, while costing less money.\"The most important thing is definitely the economics,\" said Graphcore's head of software, Matt Fyles, in a media briefing. \"We have had a trend in past of machines getting faster but more expensive, but we have drawn a line in the sand, we won't make it more expensive.\"Although some smaller Graphcore machines trail the best scores or Nvidia and Graphcore by a coupe of minutes of training time, \"None of our customers care about a couple of minutes, what they care about is whether you're competitive and you can then solve the problem that they care about,\" he said.\u00a0    GraphcoreAlso:\u00a0As AI pops up in more and more scientific computing, a new time test measures how fast a neural net can be trainedAdded Fyles, \"There are a lots of projects with thousands of chips, but now industry is going to expand what else you can do with the platform rather than just, We've got to win this benchmark competition \u2014 that's the race to the bottom.\"As in past reports, Advanced Micro Devices had bragging rights over Intel. AMD's EPYC or ROME server processors were used in 79 of 130 systems entered, a greater proportion than Intel XEON chips. Moreover, 33 of the top 40 results across the eight benchmark tests were AMD-based systems.As in past, Intel, in addition to having its XEON processor in partner systems, also made its own entries with its Habana Labs unit, using the XEON coupled with the Habana Gaudi accelerator chip instead of Nvidia GPUs. Intel focused the effort only on the BERT natural language test but failed to crack the top five.\u00a0Also:\u00a0Nvidia makes a clean sweep of MLPerf predictions benchmark for artificial intelligenceSeven of the the eight benchmark tests were all the same as the December competition. The one new entry was a replacement for one of the object detection tasks, where a computer has to outline an object in a picture and attached a label to the outline identifying the object.\u00a0In this new version, the widely used COCO data set and SSD neural network were replaced with a new data set, OpenImages, and a new neural network, RetinaNet.\u00a0OpenImages uses image files that are higher than 1,200 by 1,600 pixels. The other object detection task still uses COCO, which uses lower-resolution, 640 by 480-pixel images.In the media briefing, the MLCommons's Kanter explained that the OpenImages data set is combined with a new benchmark neural net for submitters to use.\u00a0 The prior network was based on the classic ResNet neural net for image recognition and image segmentation.Also:\u00a0Nvidia and Google claim bragging rights in MLPerf benchmarks as AI computers get bigger and biggerThe alternative used in the new test, called RetinaNet, improves accuracy via multiple enhancements to the ResNet structure. For example, it adds what's called a \"feature pyramid,\" which looks at all the looks at the context around an object, in all layers of the network, simultaneously, rather than just one layer of a network, which adds context to enable better classification.\u00a0\"Feature pyramids are a technique from classic computer vision, so this is in some ways a riff on that classic approach applied in the domain of neural networks,\" said Kanter.\u00a0Also:\u00a0Google, Nvidia tout advances in AI training with MLPerf benchmark results   In addition to the feature pyramid, the underlying architecture of RetinaNet, called ResNeXt, handles convolutions with a new innovation on ResNet. Classic ResNet uses what are called \"dense convolutions\" to filter pixels by the height and width of an image as well as the RGB channels. The ResNeXt breaks the RGB filters into separate filters that are known as \"grouped convolutions.\" Those groups, operating in parallel, learn to specialize in aspects of the color channels. That also contributes to greater accuracy.\u00a0   Also: MLPerf benchmark results showcase Nvidia's top AI training times Editorial standards  Show Comments  \n          Log In to Comment\n         Community Guidelines     Related   \n      AI scholars win Turing Prize for technique that made possible AlphaGo's chess triumph\n      \n      How Google is using AI to improve its medical advice reputation\n      \n      Will synthetic data derail generative AI's momentum or be the breakthrough we need?\n              ZDNET we equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at home.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorJun 30, 2022, 07:48pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 2 years old.For the first time, NVIDIA did not sweep the MLPerf table. While the era of its performance dominance may have come to an end, NVIDIA GPU\u2019s flexibility and massive software ecosystem will continue to form a deep and wide moat. \nMeanwhile, Google, Intel, and Graphcore have achieved an important step in their attempts to cross that moat: excellent performance, good software, and ability to scale.\n\nFor decades, CPU vendors would leapfrog each other running benchmarks such as SPEC and TPC, with Intel, SUN SPARC, DEC Alpha, MIPS, and IBM POWER showing off the latest silicon. However the AI accelerator race has been a one-company story since the beginning, with NVIDIA far in front of a small pack of earnest wannabe\u2019s. With MLPerf 2.0, that has all changed. In a game of leapfrog, the winner is often determined by the timing of the comparison; we expect the next-gen Hopper GPU will retake the crown, but this time will not keep it.\n\nIf you are tight for time, we suggest you skip the analyses and jump to the section on software near the end; that\u2019s where this battle will be won or lost.\n\nSo, who is the winner? Well, it\u2019s complicated.\n\nMLCommons just published the V2.0 version of its AI training benchmark suite, with impressive performance gains as companies release new chips, including the Intel Habana Gaudi 2.0, Google\u2019s TPUv4, and Graphcore\u2019s \u201cBOW\u201d platform with Wafer on Wafer technology. More important than the silicon, software performance improved even more dramatically, by over 30%. And startup MosaicML demonstrated its prowess in AI training optimization.\n\nThe results are difficult to present in an apples to apples fashion, as submitters naturally pick and choose specific configurations across the eight AI models being characterized, especially when it comes to the number of chips used in the training run. NVIDIA claims leadership in some benchmarks, while Google, Intel and Graphcore all claim leadership on at least one metric.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\nOpen MLPerf Training 2.0 ResultsNVIDIA\n\nThe graph above best summarizes the results for each architecture on a chip-to-chip basis for the eight benchmarks in MLPerf 2.0 normalized to the fastest. Note that NVIDIA was the only company to submit across all eight benchmarks, which makes it easy for them to claim leadership on the 4 benchmarks no one contested, in addition to BERT and Mask R-CNN. More on this later.\n\n\nFor the very first time, Intel Habana and Google each won a benchmark on a chip-to-chip compare (ResNet-50 and RetinaNet respectively). However if you change the metric from \u201cFastest Chip\u201d to \u201cFastest Results\u201d, then you are really measuring how much a vendor is willing to spend to provide a massive research platform, and of course to squash its competitors. In this case, Google is now the champion, but only on one benchmark. But if one cares about money (how quaint!), then Graphcore merits a closer look as they claim significantly better price-performance, at least for ResNet-50.\nConfused yet? Me too. So, instead of trying to slice and dice the MLPerf 2.0 spreadsheet to derive a rather useless comparison, let me summarize a few takeaways for each vendor.\nGoogle\nGoogle is to be congratulated on the TPUv4 and the TensorFlow software that goes along with it. After three fairly disappointing attempts at TPU chips, the 4th generation looks like a winner. For image processing, a 4096 TPUv4 supercomputer beat the 4216 GPU NVIDIA Selene by some 40%. While these results are impressive, benchmarking at Google is really just an expensive sideshow. For exascale computers, nobody would forgo a GPU\u2019s more general purpose capabilities for a faster TPUv4 for AI. More to the point, Google\u2019s penetration of cloud AI services is probably low because as a CSP, even Google Cloud surely prefers the flexibility, high utilization, and broad software ecosystem of an NVIDIA GPU SuperPod for their cloud clients.\nThe performance chart below, from Google\u2019s MLPerf blog, is indeed impressive, however I would note that the DLRM and BERT results for recommendation and NLP are only marginally better than NVIDIA, and these apps are increasingly where the money is. Also, as is the case for all these comparisons, the Ampere A100 GPU is over 2 years old now, and the NVIDIA Hopper GPU is now sampling to customers with its new Transformer Engine.Google claims five winning benchmarks across the field, with up to 80% over NVIDIA's A100.Google\nThe real story here is that Google engineers designed an architecture to best meet their needs for internal applications such as search, translation, and recommendation. And that design is the TPU. TPUv4\u2019s will certainly reduce the demand for GPUs to run these internal apps, but will likely not displace much business from NVIDIA on the Google Cloud Platform.\nGraphcore\nUK Unicorn Graphcore also has a new chip to show off. BOW, the company\u2019s 3rd generation accelerator uses Wafer-on-Wafer technology to reduce latencies and power consumption. In general, it looks to me that the BOW platform delivers about 40% of  the per-chip performance of a single A100 80 GB, as the image below compares a 16-node BOW POD16 to an 8-GPU DGX. Keep in mind that this is ResNet-50, which has no business value we know of outside being a very popular Convolutional Neural Network all chips must run well for comparison sake.Graphcore likes to compare their 16-chip results to NVIDIA\u2019s 8-chip DGX A100.Graphcore\nWhile I applaud the Graphcore teams solid work on MLPerf, it really doesn\u2019t tell the whole story of Graphcore\u2019s differentiation , which is about price-performance and configuration flexibility using disaggregated CPUs and accelerators. In the figure below, Graphcore claims that 64 A100 GPUs are more expensive than a 256-node Graphcore POD which delivers some 40% more performance.Graphcore appears to offer the best price-performance at scale, at least with ResnetGraphcore\nBaidu also submitted results to MLCommons using BOW, producing nearly identical results to those submitted by Graphcore. This leads us to two important thoughts. First, it means that Baidu was able to easily optimize the code for BOW. Second, it means that Graphcore has caught the attention of China\u2019s largest AI company. We will have to wait to see any confirmation of deployment of BOW at Graphcore, but Baidu looks like a likely design win for Graphcore, in our opinion.\nHabana\nAfter spending some $2B to acquire Israeli startup Habana Labs, Intel is finally starting to realize its goal of becoming the leading alternative to NVIDIA GPUs for AI. Amazon AWS has started offering the Gaudi platform on AWS, and Habana has launched its second generation training platform which does a much better job at running MLPerf benchmarks than its predecessor. But a 7-36% advantage is unlikely to beat NVIDIA for most customers, especially since Hopper is around the corner.Habana Labs Gaudi 2 beat NVIDIA by 7-36%.Intel\nBUT, and this is a huge but, Habana continues to tout unoptimized code or models, preferring to market \u201cout of the box\u201d ease of use. Now, we agree that some clients will not want to take the time or have the expertise to optimize AI for a specific chip, especially early in the selection process. But Habana is fighting the battle with one hand tied behind their back! For example, NVIDIA has demonstrated up to ten-fold improvements through software optimization. Graphcore points to a 37% performance improvement between MLPerf 1.1 and 2.0.\nWhy spend hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a chip that doubles your performance if you are not going to finish the job with better software and increase your customer value by, say, 5X? We would rather see Habana give customers the choice of out of the box or optimized code.\nNVIDIA\nOk, we are so used to hearing NVIDIA\u2019s team proudly show how they trounced the competition, this week was a bit disorienting. And we all wanted to hear about Hopper! While that chip is still awaiting a production ramp, NVIDIA only won 2 benchmarks in head-to-head competition this time around. However, NVIDIA submitted four other benchmarks with no challenger whatsoever. That\u2019s either because the competition didn\u2019t fare well in these, or more likely because they didn\u2019t have the resources to stand up the code and optimize the results. Either way, we count this as a win for the green team. Also, note that 90% of all MLPerf V2.0 submissions were run on NVIDIA hardware, many submitted by over 20 partners from startup MosaicML to Baidu, Dell, HPE and others.\nTo paraphrase political analyst James Carville from 1992, \u201cIts the Ecosystem, stupid.\u201d\nThe Back Story: Software\nIf you strip away all the hardware hype, the real performance hero over time is the software that runs on these chips. NVIDIA points to some 14-23X performance improvement over the last 3.5 years, and a whopping 23X over the last 3.5 years, only a small part of which is the A100 over the V100. Graphcore points to a 37% improvement since V1.1 (part of which is the BOW technology to be sure).\nAnd to solve a customer\u2019s problem you need a software stack that exploits your hardware advantages over many different AI models. This is where NVIDIA excels, in addition to having good hardware. The example they shared is below, in which a simple voice query can require nine AI models to produce an answer.NVIDIA points out that it take nine different AI Models to answer a voice query about an image.NVIDIA\nIf Intel is right, and people don\u2019t want to mess with optimizations, can the optimization development process be streamlined? Could it be outsourced? After all, people don\u2019t want to optimize benchmarks. They need to optimize real world applications that produce business results. And each model and dataset is unique. Enter MosaicML and Codeplay. The latter, a champion of SYCL, was just acquired by Intel for OneAPI. The former was formed by Naveen Rao, formerly of Intel and early AI startup Nervana. MosaicML\u2019s mission is to \u201cmake AI model training more efficient for everyone\u201d. They achieved astonishing results in their first MLPerf publication, beating NVIDIA\u2019s optimized model by 17%, and the unoptimized model by 4.5x.MosaicML improved performance over unoptimized ResNet-50 by 4.5X, and 17% better than optimized ... [+] MXNet performance.MosaicML\nIs this magic? Can it be repeatable? Is in invasive? The company\u2019s blogs says \u201cOur techniques preserve the model architecture of ResNet-50, but change the way it is trained. For example, we apply Progressive Image Resizing, which slowly increases the image size throughout training. These results demonstrate why improvements in training procedure can matter as much, if not more, than specialized silicon or custom kernels and compiler optimizations. Deliverable purely through software, we argue that these efficient algorithmic techniques are more valuable and also accessible to enterprises.\u201d\nWe will be watching as MLPerf tackles more models and helps more customers meet their ROI goals with AI projects.\nConclusions\nOk, this blog took a lot more work than normal, because each company has a good story to tell, but also a blind side. If you made it to the software story, thank you.\nWe congratulate the teams who worked so hard to submit these results, and the MLCommons team who herds the cats. We hope to see more team join the party in the next release in six months. Customers need these important data points to inform their decisions and shape their perspectives. And the work to optimize these common AI workloads for MLPerf directly benefits customers in their AI journey.\n(AMD, we hope you are listening!)\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

In general, the creation of deep learning models is an extremely complex and time-consuming process that requires the use of large datasets, domain expertise and countless hours. For many companies, this can be cost-prohibitive.\nNvidia said TAO Toolkit, built on the TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks, accelerates deep learning model training by abstracting away much of the complexity. Developers can leverage transfer learning to create customized deep learning models that are optimized for various industry-specific use cases, including defect detection, language translation, custom voice creation and traffic management. Using TAO Toolkit, it\u2019s possible to develop AI models with much less training data, human domain expertise and time than it would normally take.\nThe TAO Toolkit notably comes with dozens of pre-trained models that developers can use to build applications. One of the most interesting is OneCup AI, which was used to create an app called Bovine Expert Tracking and Surveillance, or BETSY. As the name suggests, this is a cattle-related application that can track the health, growth, nutrition, activity and phenotypes of livestock using vision AI. BETSY is like an extra pair of eyes for cattle ranchers, Nvidia said, helping them spot any signs of ill health or poor nutrition in their herds.\nOther pre-trained models enable developers to apply data gathered from lidar sensors for robotics and automotive applications, and classify human actions based on their poses, which has applications in areas such as public safety, retail and workplace safety. The TAO Toolkit also comes with various speech AI models that can be used to create customized AI voices with just 30 minutes\u2019 worth of recorded data. Those voices can be used to power smart devices, game characters, quick-service restaurant apps and more.\nAccording to Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc., the battle for leadership in AI is happening at all levels of the technology stack, as evidenced by today\u2019s announcement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Nvidia\u2019s turn to push the envelope with the latest edition of the TAO Toolkit, which is a key simplifier on the software side as it helps developers to create successful AI use cases,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see the low-code nature of this release, plus the foundation on TensorFlow and PyTorch, which are two of the leading AI platforms. The pre-trained models are especially useful, allowing developers to easily create AI that provides real value for enterprises.\u201d\nTAO Toolkit isn\u2019t just for pre-trained models, though, as developers can also use it to create their own. In this case, they\u2019ll benefit from new capabilities such as \u201cbring your own model weights,\u201d which makes it possible to fine-tune and optimize non-TAO models with imported, pre-trained weights from ONNX.\n\u201cThe ability to bring your own model weights is very important,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cThis enables the necessary localization of AI models.\u201d\nDevelopers will be able to visualize their models better too, thanks to an integration with TensorBoard. Through this, it\u2019s possible to get a better understanding of training models performance by visualizing scalars such as training and validation loss, model weights and predicted images. Developers can also use TensorBoard to experiment with models by changing various parameters.\nFinally, Nvidia said, TAO Toolkit can now be deployed as-a-service with REST application programming interfaces. That means developers can build new AI services or integrate TAO into existing ones with REST APIs, and manage and orchestrate the framework on Kubernetes.\nMueller\u2019s colleague at Constellation Research, Andy Thurai, told SiliconANGLE that while the likes of GPT-3, Microsoft Corp. and Google LLC have all done some work to make AI model pipelines easier, they are still very expensive and time-consuming, and for many companies the business case realization takes too long to make it worthwhile. With TAO Toolkit, he said Nvidia is having a go at creating faster go-to-market AI models, he said.\n\u201cWhile low-level tools such as PyTorch and TensorFlow have given help to data scientists, these new initiatives can move the AI model pipeline to business folks,\u201d Thurai said. \u201cIn the TAO toolkit, the combination of pre-trained industry and specific use case models, plus the option to fine tune\u00a0 models with enterprise data, means that time to market can be much faster and possibly done without the need of many data scientists. Nvidia is a little bit late to the market as GPT-3/Microsoft has waves on this front for many months now.\u201d\nNvidia said the new version of TAO Toolkit will be available with the next quarterly update to its Nvidia AI Enterprise platform.\nImage: Nvidia\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. \u00a0\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\n\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

And then in late May, it froze hiring after its stock price sank from lower-than-expected revenue forecasts amid the war in Ukraine and supply chain woes relating to COVID-19 lockdowns.\n\n\nBut it isn't all doom-and-gloom for Nvidia. The $475-billion chip giant recently announced record revenues and growth in its gaming and data center divisions, released the latest update of its autonomous-driving software development suite Hyperion, and is slated to release the successor to its artificial intelligence dedicated chip Hopper later this year. Analysts say there are many areas where Nvidia could grow to build on these developments.\n\"They really have surprised me in their ability to move and transition and to be flexible,\" David Williams, an analyst at the research firm Benchmark, told Insider.\nPlus, Nvidia has already made some minor acquisitions this year that are focused exclusively on cloud computing. In March, it purchased cloud-storage company Excelero. Before that, in January, it\u00a0acquired Bright Computing, a company that makes software for managing deployments in data centers and clouds. Nvidia acquired both for undisclosed amounts.\n\n\nBut with the Arm deal off, the lack of a blockbuster acquisition has analysts speculating on where Nvidia could shore up its weaknesses, bolster its strengths, and cement its presence in any one of the areas its currently in.\n\"They've gone from being this gamer player to getting tentacles into all kinds of spaces,\" Daniel Morgan, an analyst at the financial firm Synovus, told Insider. \"You would have never thought that 10 years ago, even five years ago. They are making huge strides.\"\nHere are 5 companies analysts said Nvidia could look to acquire next, listed from smallest to largest valuations or market caps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSiFive: $2.5 billion valuation, according to the company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiFive at the 2019 Global Semiconductor Awards.\n\n\n                                                SiFive\n                                               \n\n\nSemiconductor company SiFive builds specialized chips\u00a0for niche industries. It most recently raised a $175 million Series F round in March.\u00a0\nOther firms have targeted the company for acquisition for awhile. In June 2021, Intel came close to acquiring the chip company before dropping its bid in October, according to Bloomberg.\nInitially, Intel hoped this acquisition could help it compete with Nvidia and Arm. But with that deal falling through, Nvidia could acquire the chip maker to help it grow its production and stay in competition with Arm and Intel.\u00a0\nSiFive's product is the closest alternative to Arm's chip architecture, Matt Bryson, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, told Insider. It's the likeliest acquisition in the semiconductor space Nvidia could make, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nLuminar Technologies: $3.4 billion market cap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuminar founder and CEO Austin Russell.\n\n\n                                                Kimberly White / Stringer\n                                               \n\n\nLuminar Technologies develops the light-detection and ranging systems known as LIDAR that engineers use in self-driving cars to measure the distance of objects relative to the car.\nThe firm\u00a0already has a close relationship with Nvidia. In November,\u00a0the companies announced that Nvidia's autonomous-driving development suite Hyperion would use Luminar's LIDAR system.\nThe close relationship, coupled with Nvidia's desire to grow its autonomous-driving business, would make Luminar a top target for acquisition, Ross Gerber, the president and CEO of the investment-management firm Gerber Kawasaki Wealth Management, told Insider.\nBuying Luminar and its technology would allow Nvidia to market its chip product as a full kit, according to Gerber. That's an attractive proposition for automotive companies looking to build out their fleet, he said.\nLuminar recently hired Christopher Moore, a former Apple manager who worked on the company's secretive car project.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nValve Corporation's Steam: $10 billion valuation, according to Bloomberg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValve cofounder and managing director Gabe Newell.\n\n\n                                                Getty\n                                               \n\n\nNvidia found its success with developing graphics chips designed for gaming and has its own game-streaming platform called GeForce NOW. So an acquisition in the gaming space wouldn't be totally out of the question for the chip giant.\nSteam is an online store and platform for computer games run by Valve Corporation. Purchasing Steam from Valve could allow Nvidia to create more vertical integration with its gaming business, Gerber told Insider.\u00a0\nValve also just started to produce its own handheld game system, the Steam Deck, which runs on Nvidia rival AMD's chipset. In the past, Nvidia has also tried its hand at making game systems and now offers a streaming player similar to Amazon's Fire TV called the Shield TV.\nAcquiring the Steam platform \u2014 or even Valve itself \u2014 could jump-start Nvidia's gaming-hardware business, Gerber said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMicrochip Technology: $39.5 billion market cap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrochip Technologies produces small chips for a number of devices such as cars and smartphones.\n\n\n                                                NurPhoto/Getty Images\n                                               \n\n\nMicrochip Technologies produces microcontrollers \u2014 small semiconductors designed for specific applications. It has seen growth in its automotive microcontrollers that handle everything from a car's information and entertainment system to electric-vehicle charging.\nMicrochip has been working on a chip designed for advanced driver-assistance systems. It would run artificial intelligence-based applications within the car, including navigation and crash assistance.\nOf all the areas for expansion, automotive and autonomous driving make the most sense for Nvidia, Morgan told Insider.\u00a0\n\"You want to add on to areas that you feel are going to be future growth catalysts for your company,\" Morgan said. \"By gaining their technologies, opposed to adding on to technologies that you already have.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMarvell Technologies: $49.3 billion market cap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeadquarters of Marvell Technologies in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\n\n                                                Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images\n                                               \n\n\nIf Nvidia wants to make a big play into data-center technology, it could acquire Marvell Technologies, analysts said; but that would come with several regulatory challenges.\nThe Delaware-based company creates semiconductors for data infrastructures, ranging from networking to data-processing units. Recently, Marvell has also announced its third-generation Brightlane Ethernet Switch chip for cars. \nNvidia has been expanding quickly into the data-center space and building out its Hyperion self-driving-car software platform, making Marvell an interesting target for acquisition.\n\"It gives them access to a few adjunct areas,\" Williams told Insider. \"It gives them broader access in the data center, which is what they've really been working towards.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Driving Car\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n      subscribers.

Faster processing speed, higher frame rates, and efficient battery life are all crucial for a better computing experience. As a PC gamer myself, I\u2019m always tinkering with hardware and software, trying to eke out those few extra frames in my favorite games.That\u2019s one of the reasons I use NVIDIA hardware: When paired with competent related software, like DLSS and GeForce Experience, I don\u2019t need to waste time tinkering to get great performance. Not to mention, one of the latest NVIDIA hardware improvements, Advanced Optimus, delivers faster performance and better battery life on specific NVIDIA GeForce RTX laptop models. Here\u2019s what you need to know:What is NVIDIA Advanced Optimus?Put simply, Advanced Optimus is a hardware advancement that allows NVIDIA GeForce RTX dedicated graphics cards to better communicate with your display without user input.All gaming laptops have a graphics processing units (GPU). Some have more than one\u2014an integrated graphics unit (IGP), connected to the computer\u2019s central processing unit (CPU), which can handle simple tasks like email and web browsing, and a discrete GPU (like the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080) for more demanding commands like high-graphics calculations and deep learning.  The problem is, in older systems without Advanced Optimus, the less powerful IGP is permanently connected to the display. When you play a game for example, the  GPU renders the games and sends each frame to your IGP\u2014which then sends the frame to the display. These steps between the dedicated GPU and the IGP create a bottleneck that slows everything down.NVIDIA Advanced Optimus eliminates this bottleneck by disconnecting the display from the IGP and connecting it to the NVIDIA GPU instead. In essence, it allows your powerful, dedicated GPU to communicate directly with your display by skipping the integrated graphics processor. This happens automatically while the system is in use. How Does It Enhance the Gaming Experience?By bypassing the internal graphics processor completely, Advanced Optimus allows the dedicated RTX GeForce GPUs to take direct control. This leads to tons of refinements when it comes to gaming and overall performance.Higher Frame RatesThe most noticeable upgrade are the in-game frame rates. NVIDIA reports that Advanced Optimus up to 26% higher frame rates in DOOM: Eternal, and 13% higher in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, compared to systems without Advanced Optimus. Lower System LatencyEliminating the communication between the integrated graphics processor and dedicated graphics card also helps lower system latency (the lag time between pressing an input and seeing it reflected in the game). According to NVIDIA\u2019s research, Advanced Optimus can reduce system latency in eSports titles specifically. In Fortnite, latency was improved by 40%, while Overwatch saw an 11% improvement. In these types of competitive games\u2014where the difference between victory and defeat can be just a few frames\u2014anything that can lower your system latency is crucial. Better Battery LifeUnsurprisingly, not having to rope in the integrated graphics processor for each and every task helps improve battery life on NVIDIA RTX laptops. Advanced Optimus does this by automatically turning off the dedicated GPU and reconnecting the display to the integrated graphics processor when the system is running basic tasks. While off, the GPU doesn\u2019t consume power, allowing the system to run for longer.  Which NVIDIA GeForce RTX Laptop is Right for You?Many NVIDIA RTX laptops feature Advanced Optimus and you can check that it\u2019s enabled in the through the NVIDIA Control Panel software. If you\u2019re looking to find a new, awesome gaming laptop, here are a few recommendations. 1Acer - Predator Helios 300 - 15.6\" FHD Gaming Laptop - Intel Core i7 - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 - 16GB DDR5 - 512GB SSD$200 at Best Buy2dell Dell Alienware m15 R7 Gaming Laptop i7-12700H/15,6\" / FHD SSD/RTX 3080 Ti/W11HNow 100% Off$2,100 $2 at dell.comAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below3Lenovo Lenovo Legion 5 15.6\" 165Hz Gaming Laptop AMD Ryzen 7-5800H 16GB RAM 1TB SSD RTX 3070 8GB GDDR6 130W TGPNow 22% Off$90 $70 at antonline.com4HP OMEN 17-ck0372nr 17.3\" Gaming Laptop Computer Platinum Collection - Black$2,000 at microcenter.comHarry RabinowitzHarry Rabinowitz is a writer, editor, and columnist covering the latest and greatest products in the gaming industry.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is rumored to have cancelled the production of the RTX 3080 12GB GPU. It\u2019s not a big surprise as we get closer to the launch of next generation Lovelace cards, though it is a shame that Nvidia chose to cancel the superior model over the 3080 10GB.The rumor comes from @Zed_Wang (via elchapuzasinformatico.com). On top of the pending launch of its RTX 40 series successor, there\u2019s no doubt that falling GPU prices would have influenced the decision. As the price gap between the RTX 3080 10GB and the RTX 3080 Ti closes, there\u2019s less room for the RTX 3080 12GB, especially since the far more ubiquitous 10GB card needs to be sold off before its replacement arrives.A look at 3080 pricing at Newegg shows that prices are continuing to drop. At the time of writing \u00a0(and not counting refurbished or open box cards), there are five models listed at under $800, and two of them are 12GB variants. Moving up to the 3080 Ti, the cheapest cards are under RRP at $1,100 and falling. The 3080 12GB would seem to be messing up Nvidia\u2019s need to clear out 3080 10GB stocks. No one should buy the 10GB version if the 12GB one is the same price.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nAIB vendors getting the RTX 5080's memory config wrong could mean 50-series Super cards have more and faster VRAM\n\n\n\n\nMSI says that the supply of its RTX 5090 cards will be very tight, due to a limited supply of GPUs from Nvidia\n\n\n\nUnless you\u2019re a GPU enthusiast, it might not be apparent that 3080 12GB cards use a superior GPU with more shaders and a wider memory bus. The 3080 10GB contains 8704 cores, while the 12GB has 8960. But by far the bigger difference is the memory bus, at 320-bit for the 10GB and 384-bit for the 12GB. This means effective bandwidth is 760GB/s and 912GB/s respectively. So, if you buy a 3080 12GB, you get more shaders and an extra 2GB of memory with more bandwidth. It\u2019s a no brainer if both carry the same price.Swipe to scroll horizontallyRTX 3080 SpecsHeader Cell - Column 0 RTX 3080 10GBRTX 3080 12GBRTX 3080 TiGPUGA102-200GA102-220GA102-225CUDA cores8704896010240Memory10GB GDDR6X12GB GDDR6X12GB GDDR6XMemory Bus320-bit384-bit384-bitEffective Bandwidth760.3 GB/s912.4 GB/s912.4 GB/sWhat is Nvidia to do if it wants to sell stockpiles of 3080 10GB cards that no one should buy ahead of the 12GB version at the same price? That\u2019s easy, cancel the 12GB. That means buyers will have to buy the 3080 10GB (which is still an excellent card) or cough up the money for the 3080 Ti, which is essentially a 3080 12GB with more shaders.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest gaming motherboard: The right boards\nBest graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest3080 10GB buyers have very little to worry about though. The real world performance differences between the 10GB and 12GB cards aren\u2019t large at all. Unless you\u2019re playing games at 4K with large texture packs, 10GB is still sufficient, though to what degree that will remain the case in 2023 and beyond is uncertain.The 3080 has been in production for much longer than the 12GB version and if there\u2019s a SKU that vendors will want to clear out before the next gen launch, it\u2019s that one. \u00a0Vendors won\u2019t want to be holding them for any longer than they have to. Especially if the high end next gen cards are as fast as they're rumored to be.

Back at GTC 2022, when NVIDIA announced its new DGX H100 system, they only mentioned the use of an x86 CPU. It wasn't told whether the CPU will be an Intel or AMD design. But now that NVIDIA has confirmed that the DGX H100 indeed features Intel's upcoming Sapphire Rapids Xeon CPUs, that should settle the dust.\nRelated Story Intel AI Chip Breakthrough To Compete With NVIDIA Unlikely Before 2027 \u2013 Report\"We buy a lot of x86s. We have great partnerships with Intel and AMD. For the Hopper generation, I've selected Sapphire Rapids to be the CPU for Nvidia Hopper, and Sapphire Rapids has excellent single-threaded performance. And we're qualifying it for hyperscalers all over the world. We're qualifying it for datacenters all over the world. We're qualifying it for our own server, our own DGX. We're qualifying it for our own supercomputers,\" he said at the Tuesday event.\nNVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang at BofA Securities 2022 Global Technology Conference via The Register\nThe selection of Intel's Sapphire Rapids Xeon CPUs is definitely an interesting choice considering the AI giant had switched from Intel to AMD on its previous AI system, the Ampere GPU-powered DGX A100. The A100 featured two AMD EPYC Rome CPUs with up to 64 cores. We don't know what Xeon SKU would be used to power the DGX H100 but Sapphire Rapids maxes out at 56 cores and 112 threads. Surely these are fewer cores than the AMD's current EPYC lineup but NVIDIA wants to leverage the higher single-threaded capabilities that Intel's Golden Cove architecture-powered chip has to offer.\n\nIf NVIDIA was looking at multi-threading performance, they might have still gone the AMD EPYC route, especially when Genoa is right around the corner and will offer up to 96 cores & 192 threads based on the newer Zen 4 architecture. Previously, ServerTheHome had reported that NVIDIA two DGX H100 boards configured around AMD and Intel server CPUs. We cannot say for sure if NVIDIA would release an EPYC variant of the DGX H100 system in the future but for now, it's going to be all Intel Sapphire Rapids.\nNVIDIA DGX H100 System Specifications\nWith Hopper GPU, NVIDIA is releasing its latest DGX H100 system. The system is equipped with a total of 8 H100 accelerators in the SXM configuration and offers up to 640 GB of HBM3 memory & up to 32 PFLOPs of peak compute performance. For comparison, the existing DGX A100 system is equipped with 8 A100 GPUs with 640 GB HBM2e memory and only produces a maximum of 5 PFLOPs of AI and 10 PFLOPs of INT8 compute power.\nThe system itself houses the 5th Generation Intel CPUs with full PCIe Gen 5 support. Display output is provided through a discrete DGX Display Adapter card which offers 4 DisplayPort outputs with up to 4K resolution support. The AIC features its own active cooling solution. The system features four NVSwitches, 2 TB of system memory, two 1.9 TB NVMe M.2 storage for the operating system, and 8 3.84 TB NVMe U.2 SSDs for internal storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nTalking about the cooling solution, the DGX H100 houses the H100 GPUs on the rear side of the chassis. All four GPUs and the CPU are supplemented by a refrigerant cooling system which is whisper quiet and also maintenance-free. The compressor for the cooler is located within the DGX chassis. Power consumption is rated at 10.2kW (peak). The DGX H100 is expected to launch in the third quarter of 2022.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD Targets NVIDIA\u2019s Grace & Intel Granite Rapids Xeon CPUs With New 5th Gen EPYC Performance Showcase, Up To 2.75x Power Efficiency\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel CEO Was Excited About Generative AI In 2022 Before ChatGPT Became Popular\n\nRamish Zafar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel Arrow Lake-S Desktop CPU Refresh Is Back On The Menu \u2013 Minor Upgrades Including Faster NPU\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBofA Goes Positive On Intel: Under Lip-Bu Tan, CDNS Stock Appreciated By 32x Vs. 16x Gains For SOX\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n153\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n87\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n75\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Bottlerocket is an open source project that focuses on security and maintainability, providing a reliable and consistent Linux distribution for hosting container-based workloads. Now, we are happy to announce that you can now run ECS NVIDIA GPU-accelerated workloads on ECS using Bottlerocket.\nIn this post, we will walk through how to create an Amazon ECS task to run an NVIDIA GPU workload on Bottlerocket.\nWhy Bottlerocket?\nCustomers have continued to adopt containers to run their workloads, and AWS saw a need for a Linux distribution designed and optimized to run these containerized applications. Bottlerocket OS was built to provide a secure foundation for hosts running containers, and minimizing operational overhead to manage them at scale. Bottlerocket is designed for reliable updates that can be applied through automation.\nYou can learn more about getting started with Bottlerocket and Amazon ECS in the\u00a0Getting started with Bottlerocket and Amazon ECS blog post.\nSetting up an ECS cluster with Bottlerocket and NVIDIA GPUs\nLet\u2019s have a look at how this is done in practice. We will be working in the us-west-2\u00a0(Oregon) Region.\nPrerequisites\n\nThe AWS CLI with appropriate credentials\nA default VPC in a region of your choice (you can also use an existing VPC in your account)\n\nFirst, let\u2019s create the ECS cluster named ecs-bottlerocket.\naws ecs --region us-west-2 create-cluster --cluster-name ecs-bottlerocket\nThe instance we\u2019re launching will need an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to communicate both with the ECS APIs and the Systems Manager Session Manager APIs as well. I have created an IAM role named ecsInstanceRole\u00a0that has both the\u00a0AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore and the\u00a0AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role managed policies attached.\nThe list of Bottlerocket Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) supported for use with NVIDIA GPUs is publicly available from AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, so let\u2019s get the AMI ID for the latest Bottlerocket release. (AMIs are available for both x86_64\u00a0and aarch64\u00a0architectures). In this blog post we are going to be using the x86_64\u00a0AMI.\n\nlatest_bottlerocket_ami=$(aws ssm get-parameter --region us-west-2 \\\n    --name \"/aws/service/bottlerocket/aws-ecs-1-nvidia/x86_64/latest/image_id\" \\\n    --query Parameter.Value --output text)\n\nNext, we get the list of subnets that are configured to allocate a public IP address.\n\naws ec2 describe-subnets \\\n   --region us-west-2 \\\n   --filter=Name=vpc-id,Values=$vpc_id \\\n   --query 'Subnets[?MapPublicIpOnLaunch == `true`].SubnetId'\n   \n[\n    \"subnet-bc8993e6\",\n    \"subnet-b55f6bfe\",\n    \"subnet-e1e27fca\",\n    \"subnet-21cbc058\"\n]\n\nTo associate our EC2 instance to the ECS cluster, we need to provide some information to the instance when we create it: a small config file (userdata.toml) that has the details of the ECS cluster, saved in a file in the current directory.\nA full set of supported settings is\u00a0here.\n\ncat > ./userdata.toml << 'EOF'\n[settings.ecs]\ncluster = \"ecs-bottlerocket\"\nEOF\n\nLet\u2019s deploy one Bottlerocket instance in one of the subnets above. We are choosing a public subnet for this blog post. It will be easier to debug and connect to the instances if needed. You can choose private or public subnets based on your use case.\nWe are using the p3.2xlarge instance type, which has one NVIDIA Tesla V100 Tesla Core GPU.\n\naws ec2 run-instances \\\n   --subnet-id subnet-bc8993e6 \\\n   --image-id $latest_bottlerocket_ami \\\n   --instance-type p3.2xlarge \\\n   --region us-west-2 \\\n   --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=bottlerocket,Value=quickstart}]' \\\n   --user-data file://userdata.toml \\\n   --iam-instance-profile Name=ecsInstanceRole\n\nNext, let\u2019s create the task definition for the sample application.\n\ncat > ./sample-gpu.json << 'EOF'\n{\n  \"containerDefinitions\": [\n    {\n      \"memory\": 80,\n      \"essential\": true,\n      \"name\": \"gpu\",\n      \"image\": \"nvidia/cuda:11.0-base\",\n      \"resourceRequirements\": [\n         {\n           \"type\":\"GPU\",\n           \"value\": \"1\"\n         }\n      ],\n      \"command\": [\n        \"sh\",\n        \"-c\",\n        \"nvidia-smi\"\n      ],\n      \"cpu\": 100,\n      \"logConfiguration\": {\n        \"logDriver\": \"awslogs\",\n        \"options\": {\n           \"awslogs-group\": \"/ecs/bottlerocket\",\n           \"awslogs-region\": \"us-west-2\",\n           \"awslogs-stream-prefix\": \"demo-gpu\"\n           }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"family\": \"example-ecs-gpu\"\n}\nEOF\n\n\nIn the task definition, assign one NVIDIA GPU to our task through the\u00a0resourceRequirements parameter.\u00a0We are also defining the awslogs-group configuration for our task to send the log output from our container into Amazon CloudWatch.\nThe log group configuration is as follows:\n\nregion: us-west-2\nlog group name: /ecs/bottlerocket\nlog stream prefix: demo-gpu\n\nCreate the CloudWatch log group specified above in the task definition.\naws logs create-log-group \u2013log-group-name \u2018/ecs/bottlerocket\u2019\u00a0\u2013region us-west-2\nRegister the task in ECS.\n\naws ecs register-task-definition \\\n   --region us-west-2 \\\n   --cli-input-json file://sample-gpu.json\n\nRun the task.\n\naws ecs run-task --cluster ecs-bottlerocket \\ \n   --task-definition bottlerocket-gpu:1\n\nThe task will run and execute a command () inside the container to provide information on the GPU configuration available, and then it will exit.\nWhen you go into the ECS console in your account, you will see a stopped task. Select Clusters on the left menu, select the ecs-bottlerocket\u00a0cluster, and then select the Tasks\u00a0tab.\n\nClick on the task ID and then select the Logs tab, which will show you the log output from the task that just ran:\n\nYou can also view the log output from the container from the command line. By passing in both the log group name, the log stream name and a timeframe.

Like rush hour, it\u2019s caused by a flood of travelers angling to get somewhere fast, crowding and sometimes colliding on the way.\nAI at the Intersection\nNetworks use congestion control to manage digital traffic. It\u2019s basically a set of rules embedded into network adapters and switches, but as the number of users on networks grows their conflicts can become too complex to anticipate.\nAI promises to be a better traffic cop because it can see and respond to patterns as they develop. That\u2019s why Dalal is among many researchers around the world looking for ways to make networks smarter with reinforcement learning, a type of AI that rewards models when they find good solutions.\nBut until now, no one\u2019s come up with a practical approach for several reasons.\nRacing the Clock\nNetworks need to be both fast and fair so no request gets left behind. That\u2019s a tough balancing act when no one driver on the digital road can see the entire, ever-changing map of other drivers and their intended destinations.\nAnd it\u2019s a race against the clock. To be effective, networks need to respond to situations in about a microsecond, that\u2019s one-millionth of a second.\nTo smooth traffic, the NVIDIA team created new\u00a0 reinforcement learning techniques inspired by state-of-the-art computer game AI and adapted them to the networking problem.\nPart of their breakthrough, described in a 2021 paper, was coming up with an algorithm and a corresponding reward function for a balanced network based only on local information available to individual network streams. The algorithm enabled the team to create, train and run an AI model on their NVIDIA DGX system.\nA Wow Factor\nDalal recalls the meeting where a fellow Nvidian, Chen Tessler, showed the first chart plotting the model\u2019s results on a simulated InfiniBand data center network.\n\u201cWe were like, wow, ok, it works very nicely,\u201d said Dalal, who wrote his Ph.D. thesis on reinforcement learning at Technion, Israel\u2019s prestigious technical university.\n\u201cWhat was especially gratifying was we trained the model on just 32 network flows, and it nicely generalized what it learned to manage more than 8,000 flows with all sorts of intricate situations, so the machine was doing a much better job than preset rules,\u201d he added.\nReinforcement learning (purple) outperformed all rule-based congestion control algorithms in NVIDIA\u2019s tests.\nIn fact, the algorithm delivered at least 1.5x better throughput and 4x lower latency than the best rule-based technique.\nSince the paper\u2019s release, the work\u2019s won praise as a real-world application that shows the potential of reinforcement learning.\nProcessing AI in the Network\nThe next big step, still a work in progress, is to design a version of the AI model that can run at microsecond speeds using the limited compute and memory resources in the network. Dalal described two paths forward.\nHis team is collaborating with the engineers designing NVIDIA BlueField DPUs to optimize the AI models for future hardware. BlueField DPUs aim to run inside the network an expanding set of communications jobs, offloading tasks from overburdened CPUs.\nSeparately, Dalal\u2019s team is distilling the essence of its AI model into a machine learning technique called boosting trees, a series of yes/no decisions that\u2019s nearly as smart but much simpler to run. The team aims to present its work later this year in a form that could be immediately adopted to ease network traffic.\nA Timely Traffic Solution\nTo date, Dalal has applied reinforcement learning to everything from autonomous vehicles to data center cooling and chip design. When NVIDIA acquired Mellanox in April 2020, the NVIDIA Israel researcher started collaborating with his new colleagues in the nearby networking group.\n\u201cIt made sense to apply our AI algorithms to the work of their congestion control teams, and now, two years later, the research is more mature,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s good timing. Recent reports of double-digit increases in Israel\u2019s car traffic since pre-pandemic times could encourage more people to work from home, driving up network congestion.\nLuckily, an AI traffic cop is on the way.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | NetworkingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Hardware | Machine Learning | NVIDIA BlueField | NVIDIA Research \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Featuring an extensive update to virtually every system to accommodate the new rules and aerodynamics, F1\u24c7 22 enables fans to take virtual control of the drivers from all 10 teams, or drop in as themselves, to see if they can best the likes of Max Verstappen, Lewis Hamilton, and Charles Leclerc.\nIn addition, F1\u24c7 22 introduces F1\u2019s new Sprint races, new interactive pit stop and formation lap mechanics to make or break your race, all the latest track additions and changes, a new F1 Life social hub, official PC VR support, and a whole lot more. Purchasing the Champions Edition grants you immediate access to the game, 3 days early; the general release follows on July 1st, just in time for the Silverstone race weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you own a GeForce RTX graphics card, desktop, or laptop, you can get the definitive F1\u24c7 22 experience thanks to the addition of NVIDIA DLSS and four high-fidelity ray tracing effects. \u00a0\nNVIDIA DLSS is our groundbreaking AI rendering technology that\u2019s available in over 180 games, increasing graphics performance using dedicated Tensor Core AI processors on GeForce RTX GPUs. By tapping into the power of a deep learning neural network, we boost frame rates significantly, and generate beautiful, sharp images for your games.\nWith the performance provided by NVIDIA DLSS, GeForce RTX gamers will have the headroom to enable F1\u24c7 22\u2019s immersive ray-traced effects, which add high-fidelity opaque reflections, transparent reflections, ambient occlusion, and shadows. See the perfectly-buffed race cars of Formula 1 with pixel-perfect reflections, wander the paddock with realistic reflections on its many glass facades, race through a world with accurate occlusion shadows, and see everything shadowed with unparalleled detail. See ray tracing and DLSS in action in our new 4K comparison video:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 4K, with max settings and every ray-traced effect enabled, NVIDIA DLSS accelerates performance with the power of a 1000 horsepower F1\u24c7 car, boosting frame rates by over 2X, enabling users with GeForce RTX 3060 Tis, or higher, to charge through the pack in each race at 60 FPS or higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re racing off to EA Play, Origin, or Steam to play F1\u24c7 22, be sure to download and install our new F1\u24c7 22 Game Ready Driver, which will optimize your GeForce RTX PC or laptop for peak performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet further info about F1\u24c7 22 on the official website, and stay tuned to GeForce.com for announcements about the addition of RTX tech to other leading games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s RTX 4090 might just be even faster than we anticipated, at least if a new rumor turns out to be true \u2013 and we\u2019ve also heard more on why Nvidia\u2019s launch plans might have recently changed (again, going by the GPU grapevine, so remain cautious around all this info).The fresh nugget around the potential performance of Nvidia\u2019s Lovelace flagship graphics card comes from well-known hardware leaker 'kopite7kimi', who believes that the final loadout of the RTX 4090 could be 16,384 CUDA Cores instead of 16,128 as was previously believed. That\u2019d represent an extra 2 streaming multiprocessors for a total of 128.The final specification may be 16384 instead of 16128. A little difference.June 12, 2022That\u2019s a relatively small bump in the core count, but not an insignificant one, giving the RTX 4090 just a bit more raw grunt in theory \u2013 remembering that this graphics card is already expected to be a huge leap in performance compared to its predecessor the RTX 3090.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nA possible Nvidia RTX 5090 prototype shows what might have been \u2013 an absolute monster with nearly 25K CUDA cores and an 800W TDP\n\n\n\n\nEvidence mounts that RX 9070 XT GPU could equal Nvidia RTX 4080\u2019s performance \u2013 I just hope AMD doesn\u2019t mess up pricing\n\n\n\nAnother interesting point to note on Nvidia\u2019s incoming next-gen GPUs comes via YouTube leaker RedGamingTech, who spotted the above tweet, and further chimed in regarding the purported release schedule for the RTX 4090 (and other Lovelace cards).Of course, we\u2019ve heard a lot of rumors around the launch dates for the RTX 4090, and RedGamingTech says that their sources are now agreeing that the latest speculation is correct in terms of a September launch for the Lovelace flagship, followed by October and November for the RTX 4080 and 4070 respectively.Why the apparent delay? RedGamingTech\u2019s best guess, based on the most reliable source the YouTuber taps, is that this isn\u2019t about RTX 4000 cards not being ready to go \u2013 but more a case of Nvidia putting on the brakes to give more time to sell through existing inventory of RTX 3000 GPUs.Analysis: Time for AMD to start getting a bit worried?We\u2019ve always thought that an August launch for the RTX 4090 \u2013 one of the more recent rumors to gain traction \u2013 seemed like an overly optimistic scenario, and that September felt more realistic as a release (on-sale) date. For us, it seems plausible enough that Nvidia might want to hold back to help clear existing GPU inventory, particularly as deflating crypto demand may factor into the equation here.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Of course, if this is true, then the purported mid-July reveal for RTX 4000 isn\u2019t likely to happen, either, as even teasing the performance of Lovelace cards is likely to make some gamers pause for thought before committing to buying, particularly in the case of an expensive high-end GPU \u2013 if they can see what\u2019s right around the corner.Especially if what\u2019s just around that bend is an RTX 4090 which is a bit beefier than rumors previously indicated, as theorized by kopite7kimi. Previously, the renowned Twitter leaker has guessed \u2013 and of course, we are very much in speculative territory here \u2013 that the RTX 4090 could be twice as powerful compared to the RTX 3090, or more than that. This fresh leak on the CUDA core count is another hint that we can expect better than double the performance, then.Another positive bit of news that has emerged for those keenly awaiting Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4090 \u2013 whenever it may emerge \u2013 is that RedGamingTech also underlined that we\u2019re supposedly still looking at a 450W power usage as more recently theorized, and not some of the more worrying much higher TDP figures which were floated in previous leaks (like 600W).Of course, it still looks like AMD\u2019s strongest line of attack in the war of the next-gen GPUs will be power-efficiency, as Team Red recently trumpeted just how much progress has been made with RDNA 3 graphics cards in terms of delivering better performance-per-watt \u2013 with a 50% or more increase promised above RDNA 2.With rising energy costs, and concerns around thermals and cooling \u2013 and the potential need to upgrade the power supply, even, for really power-hungry GPUs \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t underestimate how important that efficiency battle may be. But if Nvidia is going to really throw down the gauntlet for raw, galloping frame rate power, it\u2019s obviously imperative that AMD doesn\u2019t look far off the pace when it comes to gaming benchmarks\u2026Today\u2019s best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $38.99View $63ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

Sadly, with Intel's CEO saying the chip shortages could go on until 2024, it's likely to be bad news for a while long, especially with the next GPU generation approaching. However, there is a silver lining, as graphics hardware prices have been tumbling lately, and now it looks as though parts of Europe are seeing products from the two GPU giants getting closer and closer to their MSRPs. \nIn the most recent report from 3D Center, AMD and Nvidia graphics cards are continuing to come down in price. The graph on the report shows that while team green's products are just 6% above MSRP, team red's are closing the gap even more by being just 2% above the recommended selling price. While such GPUs as the Radeon RX 6800 are still 35% above retail value, the 6950 XT, which was released just last month, is only 1% higher than MSRP.\nRELATED: Rumor: Nvidia Ada Series Launch Schedule Confirmed, RTX 4090 to Be the First\nIt seems to be a similar story for Nvidia, with the RTX 3060 Ti currently at 21% above, while the 3090 is just 2% over. Even the beefy yet underwhelming RTX 3090 Ti, arguably the world's most powerful graphics card in the current market, is only 10% over. Of course, this all relates to parts of Europe. However, when it comes to US prices, a report over on Tom's Hardware states that American markets are being watched closely, with a recent Amazon listing showing that the Nvidia RTX 3080 12 GB had dropped to $884, while the AMD RX 6800 XT was selling for just $699 at B&H.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, it shows that graphics card prices are continuing to fall, with them looking to reach MSRP soon. This is obviously good news for anyone who's been waiting patiently for top of the line hardware to finally become more affordable again. However, there is still the issue of supplying graphics cards to consumers, and the ongoing deficit could see them still being difficult to get hold of.\nWith Nvidia looking to reveal its RTX 40-series this summer, and AMD also aiming to launch its RDNA 3 within the next few months, the race is on to get the next graphics tech generation under way. Hopefully, these prices will continue to drop, and once the next architecture hits the shelves, maybe the market will be a little better off. It's been a trying year or so for any gamer and PC enthusiast.\nMORE: With the GPU Shortage, Gaming Laptops and Pre-Builts Are The Only Alternative\nSource: 3D Center, Tom's Hardware \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming News\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nAMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThere's a New Catch to Consider With the PS5 Pro\n\t\t\n\n\nPlayStation 5 Pro\n\nThere are already a few drawbacks to the upcoming PlayStation 5 Pro console, and now fans discover yet another catch to Sony's enhanced console.\n\n\nPosts\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nJ Brodie Shirey\n\n\nOct 30, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhy Microsoft is Not Releasing an Xbox Rival to the PS5 Pro\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nAdam Corsetti\n\n\nOct 27, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWin a PlayStation 5 Pro With Game Rant\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nTim Lord\n\n\nNov 6, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS5 Pro Confirms Release Date and Massive Price Tag\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nDalton Cooper\n\n\nSep 10, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRumor: Sony May Be Working on Native PS3 Backwards Compatibility\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nEdiz Guner\n\n\nJun 23, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS5 Pro Launch Sales Numbers Compared to PS4 Pro\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nGabriel Machado Pureza\n\n\nNov 16, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAssassin's Creed Shadows: Where to Find All Eight Kabukimono \n\t\t\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows\n\nA complete guide to locating all eight Kabukimono in Assassin's Creed Shadows. \n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHow to Change Characters in Assassin's Creed Shadows\n\t\t\n\n\nVideo Games\n\nPlayers will need to wait until the game's ninth chapter before they can switch freely between Yasuke and Naoe in Assassin's Creed Shadows.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPlay PC Games On The Go With This Razer Mobile Gaming Controller Now Down By $20\n\t\t\n\nExperience mobile gaming differently with the discounted Razer Kishi Ultra controller.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 hour ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDeath Stranding 2 Shows What Happens When a Developer Has Total Creative Freedom\n\t\t\n\n\nDeath Stranding 2: On the Beach\n\nDeath Stranding 2 is proof that when developers are given total creative freedom, they can produce some of the most compelling worlds and narratives.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tParty Club: How to Change Characters\n\t\t\n\n\nParty Club\n\nThe different characters in Party Club each have a unique visual flair.

While there are many deals to go through, the most eye-catching ones are on the fastest GPUs from the top two graphics vendors.\nRelated Story AMD Targets NVIDIA\u2019s Grace & Intel Granite Rapids Xeon CPUs With New 5th Gen EPYC Performance Showcase, Up To 2.75x Power Efficiency\n\nCurrently, the retailer has listed a custom Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3090 Ti 24 GB graphics card for just $1539 US which is a 23% decrease over the $1999 US MSRP. This custom model rocks a triple-fan cooling solution and comes with a custom-designed PCB. This is in fact just $40 US more than the MSRP of the RTX 3090 ($1499 US) so those looking for the best performance that money can buy, well now you can get it way below MSRP.\n\nMoving on to AMD's camp, we have the Gigabyte Radeon RX 6900 XT Gaming OC, a custom design and factory overclocked variant of the RDNA 2 flagship. The graphics card is listed for $720 after we apply the rebate card and promo code 'VGAGBET249'. The price falls down to $720 US which is a 28 percent decrease versus the MSRP of $999 US for the graphics card. The Radeon RX 6900 XT is one of the fastest graphics cards around if you aren't into raytracing, beating the likes of the RTX 3090 & even coming close to the RTX 3090 Ti in a few titles. Gigabyte's AORUS Radeon RX 6900 XT is also on sale for $999 US (at MSRP).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Vision OC graphics card can also be purchased for $999 US, a $200 discount, and a 20% decrease over the MSRP of $1199 US. Besides graphics cards, Newegg has also listed various Z690 and X570 motherboards for under $200 US and there are also nice deals on various monitors which you can check out over here.\nFollowing are the retail links at Newegg for the above-mentioned NVIDIA GeForce and AMD Radeon graphics cards:\n\nGigabyte GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Gaming - $1539 US\nGigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Vision OC - $999 US\nGigabyte Radeon RX 6900 XT Gaming OC - $720 US\nGigabyte Radeon RX 6900 XT Master OC - $999 US\n\n\nWith the recent fall of Crypto and used GPUs flooding the reseller market, we can expect the prices of graphics cards to fall further within the coming weeks. Now is definitely the best time to buy the latest gaming graphics cards or you can wait for the next generation to arrive later this year.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n153\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n87\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n75\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

But the NVIDIA Shield TV starts at $150, a price that's only matched by Apple TV boxes. It's an outrageous amount of money to pay for a streaming stick, but still, the NVIDIA Shield TV is worth every penny. \n                        First, What Is NVIDIA Shield TV?\n               \nThe original NVIDIA Shield TV launched back in 2015. And at that time, it wasn't really called a \"streaming stick.\" Sure, it ran Android TV and was the first widely-available 4K UHD set-top box, but NVIDIA called the Shield TV a \"micro-console.\"\nThat's because Shield TV was primarily targeted toward gamers and enthusiasts. Most people did not have 4K TVs, and few streaming services aired content at a high resolution. The main selling point for this box was its library of supported Android games and the NVIDIA Grid (now called GeForce NOW) cloud gaming service.\nTinkerers were also attracted to the \"micro-console,\" which could be modified for several purposes. It could double as a Plex Media Server, for example, and offered smart home functionality through Samsung SmartThings (a feature that died because of Samsung).\nWe now think of NVIDIA Shield TV as a streaming stick, mainly because it offers the best video and audio quality of any small streaming device (and because cloud gaming took a while to pan out). But these additional features haven't gone anywhere, meaning that Shield TV is still the ultimate streaming device for gamers and tinkerers. \n                        High-End Video Quality with AI Enhancements\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\nMost people buy an NVIDIA Shield TV for the video quality. Yeah, other streaming sticks support 4K UHD and Dolby vision---that stuff isn't too rare. But the NVIDIA Shield also uses AI to upscale video, offering the best picture quality of any streaming device.\nBy default, all TVs try to upscale content to fit a native resolution. But these milquetoast upscaling algorithms mainly exist to make low-res content fill the whole screen. They rarely improve image quality.\nNVIDIA's AI upscaling tech actively improves image quality, effectively making low-res content look like crystal clear 4K (or 1080p if you don't have a 4K TV). It's an incredibly valuable feature in the world of streaming, as most of the movies and shows on your favorite services are only available in 720p or 1080p.\nI should also note that NVIDIA Shield TV is the king of audio quality. It supports\u00a032-bit 192 kHz audio over HDMI and can run 7.1 surround sound systems. \nAndroid TV Software and Chromecast Built-In\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\nI hate to throw the Chromecast under the bus, but NVIDIA Shield TV is the best way to experience the Android TV software. The expensive hardware is snappy and only somewhat buggy, which is more than you can say for most streaming sticks.\nThe Android TV software fits in its own little niche. It works with select Android apps and games, of course, but it's also incredibly customizable. And thanks to Google's algorithms, it offers advanced \"personalization\" features that save you time when looking for shows or movies.\nSome of these personalization features are very obvious. Android TV has a Discover tab that suggests shows and movies you may enjoy, freeing you from opening individual apps. But there's also a universal search function that digs through all available services. If you press the microphone button on your remote and say \"Scooby-Doo live action movie,\" for example, Android TV will show every service that hosts the\u00a0Scooby-Doo movie.\nRelated: Which Smart TV Should You Buy: Roku, Fire, or Google\nThe Android TV software also supports Google Cast functionality, meaning that you can beam a video from your phone or computer straight to your TV (you can even use it to mirror your screen). This is especially useful when you're watching something on a phone and want to quickly move it to the big screen.\nNow, I'll be the first to say that Android TV isn't perfect. It doesn't receive enough updates, smart home features are incredibly lacking, and if you just want a clean and simple interface, Roku or Apple TV are the way to go. But when it comes to personalization and tinkering, Android TV is king.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNVIDIA SHIELD Android TV Streaming Media Player; 4K HDR, live sports, Dolby Vision-Atmos, AI-enhanced upscaling, GeForce NOW cloud gaming, Google Assistant Built-In, Works with Alexa\n\t\t\t\n\n\nSome streaming services support 4K HDR, but most shows and movies are only streamable in 720p or 1080p. NVIDIA Shield devices use proprietary upscaling technology to bring this content to 4K resolution, making it the best streaming stick for your fancy, modern TV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$150 at Amazon\nBest Buy\n\n\n\n                        Cloud Gaming, Android Games, and Emulators on Your TV\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiguel Lagoa/Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile NVIDIA's plan to build a \"micro-console\" didn't really pan out, the NVIDIA Shield TV is still the best streaming stick for gamers. It can play a flurry of Android apps, it works with emulators (so you can play classic games), and of course, it's one of the best options for cloud gaming with NVIDIA GeForce Now.\nThe GeForce Now experience is especially compelling. NVIDIA's cloud gaming platform allows you to play AAA titles on any device without any huge downloads or extra hardware. The GeForce Now \"RTX 3080\" tier\u00a0offers top-of-the-line graphics that put the newest Xbox and PlayStation to shame, and of course, GeForce Now works with\u00a0Fortnite (even on iOS).\nYou can connect just about any gamepad to the NVIDIA Shield TV, by the way. If you want to use an Xbox or PlayStation controller, that's fine. Voice chat also works, and if you're more of a PC gamer, you can connect a keyboard and mouse with the console. \n                        The Pro Model Is More Than Just a Streaming Stick\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\nMost people just want a streaming stick, which is why NVIDIA sells two versions of the Shield TV. There's the standard model, which costs $150 and looks like a black hotdog, and there's the more advanced $200 Shield TV Pro.\nThe standard NVIDIA Shield TV has a microSD slot and an Ethernet jack, which are awesome but a bit limiting. By comparison, the Shield TV Pro (a set-top box) has two USB ports, an Ethernet jack, an extra 8GB of storage (16GB total), an extra 1GB of RAM (3GB total).\nThese extra perks enable the following features on NVIDIA Shield TV Pro: \n            Improved AI Upscaling\n    \nOne of the big drawbacks of the standard NVIDIA Shield TV is that it only runs AI upscaling on 30FPS video. Now, this is mainly an enthusiasts' problem, as you'll rarely stream 720p or 1080p content at 60FPS.\nBut it's a big disappointment when you're streaming custom content (from a PC via LAN, for example) or when using GeForce Now at a low resolution and high frame rate. If you plan to do anything beyond typical streaming with the NVIDIA Shield, you should buy the Pro model. \n            It Works with OTA TV!\n    \nAntenna TV is severely underrated. It's free TV, after all, and it actually offers a better picture quality than cable. While the standard NVIDIA Shield doesn't work with OTA TV, you can bring this feature to your NVIDIA Shield TV Pro using two accessories.\nAll you need are a TV antenna and a digital tuner, preferably an\u00a0HD HomeRun Duo ($110) or Hauppauge WinTV-dualHD USB ($75). Hook the antenna up to the tuner, connect the tuner to your NVIDIA Shield TV Pro over USB, and you're all set!\nWell, you will need an app to run a live TV service. You can either use the LiveTV app that comes standard with Android TV, install the HDHomeRun app, or use Plex to handle everything. Notably, both the HDHomeRun and Plex apps support DVR functionality. \n            It's a Plex Media Server!\n    \nHave you ever wanted to build your own streaming service? Well, it's easy with Plex. You just load your movies, TV shows, and music\u00a0into a Plex Media Server and let the software organize everything. Then, you can stream that content on any device inside or outside your home.\nRelated: Quick Tip: Plex Servers Are Easy With NVIDIA Shield Pro Android TV\nIt just so happens that the NVIDIA Shield TV Pro is an amazing Plex Media Server. All you need are a few hard drives (or a NAS device) and the Plex Android TV app. Because the NVIDIA Shield TV Pro has a relatively powerful processor, it can handle multiple simultaneous streams and 4K content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNvidia Shield TV Pro (2019)\n\t\t\t\n\n\nThe NVIDIA Shield TV Pro offers all the features of its cheaper, smaller sibling. But it also offers OTA TV functionality, can work as a Plex Media Server, and features AI upscaling at 60FPS. Plus, there's extra RAM and USB ports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$199 at Amazon\nBest Buy\n\n\n\n                        Should You Buy an NVIDIA Shield TV?\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to make the most of a 4K TV, an NVIDIA Shield TV is absolutely worth the money. It's expensive, but it offers the best 4K streaming experience thanks to AI upscaling technology.\nEnthusiasts and dorks can also get a lot out of the NVIDIA Shield TV, though they should buy the Pro model. It opens the door to building a Plex Media Server, upscaling content at a high frame rate, and streaming OTA TV with minimal hardware.\nBut here's the thing; you don't need to spend a ton of money for a good streaming experience. The average person, even if they own a 4K TV, should probably buy a cheaper streaming stick. Companies like Roku, Amazon, and Google sell 4K streaming sticks for $50 or less---they don't have NVIDIA's AI upscaling, but hey, that's the tradeoff for buying something that isn't ridiculously expensive. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nbigpic\n\n\n\n\ngooglenewsfeatures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

The power limits include both desktop & mobile parts.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Desktop & Mobile GPU Power Limits Detailed: Ada Lovelace Powered AD102 Flagship Desktop Maxes Out at 800W, Flagship Mobile AD103 Maxes Out at 175W\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series lineup based on the Ada Lovelace graphics architecture will come in both desktop and mobile flavors. We have heard various reports of how the flagship is going to feature a TGP of up to 900W but as we know, the power limits are the max the GPU can reach and are not reflective of the actual TGP/TBP figures. These limits may only be reachable by heavily overclocked and custom-cooled variants.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\nA truth. The power limits: AD102, 800W; AD103 (DT), 450W, AD103 (Mobile), 175W; AD104 (DT), 400W, AD104 (Mobile), 175W; AD106 (DT), 260W, AD106 (Mobile), 140W. But I don't think we need to use the full power cap.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) June 18, 2022\n\nSo coming to the power limits, we have four NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPU SKUs, the AD102, AD103, AD104, and AD106. All GPUs except the AD102 will receive a mobile variation and the reason is simply that the flagship chip has much higher power requirements that the laptop platform can't support. The same was the case with the GA102 GPU so the GA103 became the fastest mobile offering.\n\nStarting with the desktop lineup, the NVIDIA AD102 GPU will feature an 800W power limit, the AD103 GPU will feature a 450W power limit, the AD104 GPU will feature a 400W power limit & AD106 will feature a 260W power limit. As for mobile parts, the AD103 mobile GPU will feature a 175W power limit, AD104 mobile GPU will feature a 175W power limit and the AD106 mobile will rock a 140W power limit. Rounding up the figures, we have:\nNVIDIA Ada Lovelace Desktop GPUs:\n\nAD102 - 800W Max Power Limit\nAD103 - 450W Max Power Limit\nAD104 - 400W Max Power Limit\nAD106 - 260W Max Power Limit\n\nNVIDIA Ada Lovelace Mobile GPUs:\n\nAD103 - 175W Max Power Limit\nAD104 - 175W Max Power Limit\nAD106 - 140W Max Power Limit\n\nThis is a drastic increase in the power limits for the desktop and mobile parts. The AD102's 800W power limit is already bonkers but the actual graphics card that utilizes it will end up with a 600W TGP. The AD103 and AD104 GPUs are very similar to each other so the TGP figures are almost the same on mobile and a 50W difference on the desktop segment. The AD106 is in the mainstream 260W segment while the actual graphics cards using it will end up close to 200W TGPs. The mobile parts max out at 175W power limits because that's the best the platform could do in the given area. Anything more would require a major redesign of existing laptops and coolers for them and it looks like most manufacturers don't want to make that extra investment right now.\nBased on the power limit differences between the desktop and mobile parts, there's once again going to be a huge performance difference between the two NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU segments. But that's only due to the limitations on the mobile platform, still, we expect to see a major boost when it comes to performance on the mobile side while desktops take things to the next level.\nNVIDIA Ada Lovelace 'GeForce RTX 40' GPU Configurations\n\n\n\nGPU NameGPCs / TPCsSMs Per TPC / TotalCUDA CoresL2 CacheMemory BusPower Limit Desktop (Peak)Power Limit Mobile (Expected)\n\n\n\n\nAD10212 / 62 / 1441843296 MB384-bit800WN/A\n\n\nAD1037 / 62 / 841075264 MB256-bit450W175W\n\n\nAD1045 / 62 / 60768048 MB192-bit400W175W\n\n\nAD1063 / 62 / 36460832 MB128-bit260W140W\n\n\nAD1073 / 42 / 24307232 MB128-bit180W80W\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n97\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n51\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n34\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n32\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The said performance is purely rasterization so overall performance within games should vary but still, that's a big leap versus what the last generation had to offer. It also means that NVIDIA is putting that TDP-bump to good use since we are talking about a card that's expected to feature up to 450-500W TDP out of the box.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\nI mean RTX 4090>2x RTX 3090. \ud83d\ude05\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) June 6, 2022\n\nMore importantly, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 is said to feature a cut-down AD102 'Ada Lovelace' GPU core which means that the full variant, possibly a Titan or RTX 4090 Ti, could end up with much higher performance than the RTX 3090. This increase should also be expected considering that we are looking at over 70% CUDA cores than the RTX 3090 Ti plus the clock speeds which are rumored to be much higher than the current generation thanks to the shift to the TSMC 4N process node. It will also get a major uplift with the new architecture which includes a meaty 96 MB of L2 cache vs just 6 MB on the existing flagship GPU.\n\nBesides the GeForce RTX 4090, Kopite7kimi also states that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 is getting a spec update. Previously, the graphics card was rumored to feature a TBP of 350W but this is now changed to 420W which is a higher board power figure than the RTX 3090. The GeForce RTX 4080 is still going to utilize the AD103 GPU, a slightly more optimized variant of the AD104 GPU. This would also mean a 100W higher TDP than the existing RTX 3080 so the card could end up with some really fast specs.\n\nPossible RTX 4080, PG139-SKU360, has a 420W TGP, still uses AD103.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) June 6, 2022\n\nWe also recently reported the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 with a TGP of 220W which is also much higher than its predecessor. So if you look at the overall lineup, you can expect Ada Lovelace to go bonkers with the power figures but at the same time, we can expect some massive performance gains.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti 'Expected' Specifications\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti is going to be the full-fat configuration with all of the 144 SMs enabled for a total of 18432 CUDA cores. The GPU will come packed with 96 MB of L2 cache and a total of 384 ROPs which is simply insane. The clock speeds are not confirmed yet but considering that the TSMC 4N process is being used, we are expecting clocks between the 2.0-3.0 GHz range.\nAs for memory specs, the GeForce RTX 4090 Ti is expected to rock 24 GB GDDR6X capacities that might come at faster 24 Gbps speeds across a 384-bit bus interface. This will provide up to 1.152 TB/s of bandwidth. Now all these boosted specifications will result in higher power draw too and the flagship is expected to operate at a TBP of around 600W. Now for 600W, a single 16-pin Gen 5 connector should be enough but most of the custom variants will definitely end up utilizing dual Gen 5 connectors since AIBs don't necessarily stay within spec and even the slightest of factory overclocks will push the TBP above 600W which is the limit of a single Gen 5 power connector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nWe have also seen an alleged NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti heatsink and cooler shroud which hints at the use of a beefier cold plate that provides coverage for both the GPU and memory dies along with an overall larger structure. The leaked cooler is a Founders Edition design and judging by how big it looks, the AIB models will end up being vastly bigger and we may even end up with quad-slot designs from all partners.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 'Expected' Specifications\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 is going to be a cut-down configuration with either than same cores as the existing GA102 part but tuned with much higher frequency or between 9000-1000 cores that allow some room for a 'Ti' variant in the future with the full-fat configuration. The GPU will come packed with 64 MB of L2 cache and up to 224 ROPs which is simply insane.\n\nThe clock speeds are not confirmed yet but considering that the TSMC 4N process is being used, we are expecting clocks between the 2.0-3.0 GHz range. The higher than usual clock speed bump comes from the fact that NVIDIA is making a two-node jump considering the Ampere GPUs with Samsung 8nm node was in reality a 10nm process node with some optimizations. NVIDIA is skipping 7nm and going straight for a 5nm node and not even the vanilla variant but an optimized version of it. With Pascal on the TSMC 16nm node, NVIDIA delivered a huge frequency leap and we can expect a similar jump this time around too.\nAs for memory specs, the GeForce RTX 4080 is expected to rock 16 GB GDDR6X capacities that might come at faster 21 Gbps speeds across a 256-bit bus interface. This will provide up to 672 GB/s of bandwidth. Now all these boosted specifications will result in higher power draw too and the flagship is expected to operate at a TBP of around 420W. Now for 420W, a single 16-pin Gen 5 connector should be enough for both reference and custom models. As for the launch, the graphics card lineup is expected in Q3-Q4 2022, a more detailed schedule can be seen here.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series Graphics Card Lineup (Rumored):\n\n\n\nGraphics CardGPUPCB VariantSM Units / CoresMemory / BusMemory Clock / BandwidthTBPPower ConnectorsLaunch\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Titan RTX ADAAD102-400?TBD144 / 18176?48 GB / 384-bit24 Gbps / 1.15 TB/s~800W2x 16-pinTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 TiAD102-400?TBD144 / 18176?24 GB / 384-bit24 Gbps / 1.15 TB/s~600W1x 16-pinTBD\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 AD102-300PG136128 / 1638424 GB / 384-bit21 Gbps / 1.00 TB/s450W1x 16-pinQ4 2022\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080AD103-301/300PG139 SKU 36076 / 972816 GB / 256-bit23 Gbps / 716.8 GB/s320W1x 16-pinQ4 2022\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 TiAD104-400PG141 SKU 33160 / 768012 GB / 192-bit21 Gbps / 504.0 GB/s285W1x 16-pinQ1 2023\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070AD104-251/250PG141-SKU 345/344/34346 / 588812 GB / 192-bit21 Gbps / 504.0 GB/s200W1x 16-pin / 8-PinQ2 2023\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 TiAD106-350PG190 SKU 36134 / 43528 GB / 128-bit18 Gbps / 288.0 GB/s160-150W1x 16-pin / 8-PinQ2 2023\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060AD107-400PG173 SKU 37124 / 30728 GB / 128-bit18 Gbps / 288.0 GB/s115-110W1x 16-pin / 8-PinQ2 2023\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050AD107?TBDTBD6 GB / 96-bit?TBD100W1x 16-pin / 8-PinQ3 2023?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n153\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n87\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n75\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.
