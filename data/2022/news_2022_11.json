My name is Emma, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the NVIDIA's third quarter earnings call. [Operator instructions] Simona Jankowski, you may begin your conference.\nSimona Jankowski -- Vice President, Investor Relations\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. With me today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, president and chief executive officer; and Colette Kress, executive vice president and chief financial officer. I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's investor relations website.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2023. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations.\nThese are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made as of today, November 16, 2022, and based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements.\nDuring this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks, Simona. Q3 revenue was $5.93 billion, down 12% sequentially and down 17% year on year. We delivered record data center and automotive revenue. while our gaming and pro visualization platforms declined as we work through channel inventory corrections and challenging external conditions.\nStarting with data center. Revenue of $3.83 billion was up 1% sequentially and 31% year-on-year. This reflects very solid performance in the face of macroeconomic challenges new export controls and lingering supply chain disruptions. Year-on-year growth was driven primarily by leading U.S.\ncloud providers and a broadening set of consumer Internet companies for workloads such as large language models, recommendation systems and generative AI. As the number and scale of public cloud computing and Internet service companies deploying NVIDIA AI grows our traditional hyperscale definition will need to be expanded to convey the different end market use cases. We will align our data center customer commentary going forward accordingly. Other vertical industries, such as automotive and energy, also contributed to growth with key workloads relating to autonomous driving, high-performance computing, simulations and analytics.\nDuring the quarter, the U.S. government announced new restrictions impacting exports of our A100 and H-100 based products to China, and any product destined for certain systems or entities in China. These restrictions impacted third quarter revenue, largely offset by sales of alternative products into China. That said, demand in China more broadly remains soft, and we expect that to continue in the current quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe started shipping our flagship 100 data center GPU based on the new hopper architecture in Q3. A100-based systems are available starting this month from leading server makers including Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and SuperMicro. Early next year, the first H-100 based cloud instances will be available on Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. A100 delivered the highest performance and workload versatility for both AI training and inference in the latest MLPerf industry benchmarks.\nH-100 also delivers incredible value compared to the previous generation for equivalent AI performance it offers three x lower total cost of ownership while using five x fewer server nodes and 3.5 x less energy. Earlier today, we announced a multiyear collaboration with Microsoft to build an advanced cloud-based AI supercomputer to help enterprises train, deploy and scale AI including large state-of-the-art models. MacBook Azure will incorporate our complete AI stack, adding tens and thousands of A100 and A100 GPUs. Quantum 2 400 gigabit per second InfiniBand networking and the NVIDIA AI enterprise software suite to its platform.\nOracle and NVIDIA are also working together to offer AI training and inference at scale to thousands of enterprises. This includes bringing to Oracle Cloud infrastructure, the full NVIDIA accelerated computing stack and adding tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs, including the A100 and H-100. Cloud-based high-performance in the company, new scale is adopting NVIDIA AI enterprise and other software to address the industrial scientific communities, rising demand for AI in the cloud. NVIDIA AI will bring new capability to rescale high-performance computing as a service offerings, which include simulation and engineering software used across industries.\nNetworking posted strong growth driven by hyperscale customers and easing supply constraints. -- our new Quantum 240 gigabit per second InfiniBand and Spectrum Ethernet networking platforms are building momentum. We achieved an important milestone this quarter with VMware. And whose leading server virtualization platform, vSphere, has been rearchitected over the last two years to run on DPUs and now supports our BlueField DPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur joint enterprise AI platform is available first on Dell PowerEdge servers. The BlueField DPU design win pipeline is growing and the number of infrastructure softer partners is expanding, including Arista, Check Point, Juniper, [Inaudible] Networks and Red Hot. The latest top 500 list of supercomputers released this week at Supercomputing '22 and has the highest ever number of NVIDIA-powered systems, including 72% of the total and 90% of new systems on the list. Moreover, NVIDIA powers 23 of the top 30 of the Green 500 list, demonstrating the energy efficiency of accelerated computing.\nThe No. 1 most energy-efficient system is the Flat Iron Institute Henry, which is the first top 500 system featuring our H-100 GPUs. At GTC, we announced the NVIDIA Omniverse Computing System, or OVS, reference designs featuring the new L4 GPU based on the ADA Lovelace architecture. These systems are designed to build and operate 3D virtual world using NVIDIA Omniverse enterprise.\nNVIDIA OBX systems will be available from Inspur, Lenovo and Super Micro by early 2023. We Lockheed Martin and Jaguar Land Rover will be among the first customers to receive OVS systems. We are further expanding our AI software and services offerings with NVIDIA and Bio Nemo large language model services, which are both entering early access this month. These enable developers to easily adopt large language models and deploy customized AI applications for content generation, tech summarization, chatbox, co-development, protein structure and biomolecular property predictions.\nMoving to gaming. Revenue of $1.57 billion was down 23% sequentially and down 51% from a year ago, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with current demand expectations. We believe Channel inventories are on track to approach normal levels as we exit Q4. Sell-through for our gaming products was relatively solid in the Americas and EMEA and but softer in Asia Pac as macroeconomic conditions and covered lockdowns in China continued to weigh on consumer demand.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur new Ada Lovelace GPU architecture had an exceptional launch. The first ADA GPU, the GeForce RTX 4090 became available in mid-October and a tremendous amount and positive feedback from the gaming community. We sold out quickly in many locations and are working hard to keep up with demand. The next member of the ATA family, RTX 4080 is available today.\nThe RTX 40 Series GPUs features DLSS 3, the neuro rendering technology that uses AI to generate entire frames for faster game play. Our third-generation RTX technology has raised the bar for computer graphics and help supercharge gaming. For example, the 15-year old classic game portal, now reimagined with full ray tracing and DLSS 3 has made it on Steam's top 100 most wish-listed gains. The total number of RTX games and applications now exceeds 350.\nThere is tremendous energy in the gaming community that we believe will continue to fuel strong fundamentals over the long term. The number of simultaneous users on steam just hit a record of $30 million, surpassing the prior peak of $28 million in January. Activision's Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 set a record for the franchise with more than $800 million in opening weekend sales. topping the combined box office openings of movie blockbusters, TopGun Maverick and Dr.\nStrains in the Multiverse of [Inaudible]. And this month's League of Legends World Championship in San Francisco sold out minutes with 18,000 esports fans packed the arena where the Golden State Warriors play. We continue to expand the GeForce NOW cloud gaming service. In Q3, we added over 85 games to the library, bringing the total to over 1,400.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also launched GeForce now on the new gaming devices, including Logitech, Cloud handheld, cloud gaming Chromebooks and Razor 5G Edge. Moving to Probi Revenue of $200 million was down 60% sequentially and down 65% from a year ago, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with the current demand expectations. These dynamics are expected to continue in Q4. Despite near-term challenges, we believe our long-term opportunity remains intact, fueled by AI simulation, computationally intensive design and engineering workloads.\nAt GTC, we announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Services, our first software and infrastructure as a service offering, enabling artists, developers and enterprise teams to design, publish and operate metaverse applications from anywhere on any device. Omniverse Cloud Services runs on Omniverse cloud computer, a computing system comprised of NVIDIA OBX for graphics and physics simulation. NVIDIA HDX for AI workloads and the NVIDIA graphics delivery network, a global scale, distributed data center network for delivering low-latency metaverse graphics on the edge. Leaders in some of the world's largest industries continue to adopt Omniverse.\nHome improvement retailer, Lowe's is using it to help design, build and operate digital twins for their stores. Charter Communications and advanced analytics company, heavy AI are creating Omniverse power digital twins to optimize Charter's wireless network. In Deutsche Bahn, operator of German National Railway is using Omniverse to create digital twins of its rail network and train AI models to monitor the network, increasing safety and reliability. Moving to automotive.\nRevenue of $251 million, increased 14% sequentially and 86% from a year ago. Growth was driven by an increase in AI automotive solutions as our customers drive or on-based production ramp, continue to scale. Automotive has great momentum and is on its way to be our next multibillion-dollar platform. Global cars unveiled the all-new flagship Volvo EX90 SUV powered by the NVIDIA Drive platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the first model to use Volvo's software-defined architecture with a centralized core computer containing both drive Orin and DRIVEXaviar, along with 30 sensors. Other recently announced design wins and new model introductions include ton, auto, Neo, Polystar and [Inaudible]. At GTC, we also announced that NVIDIA Drive Super Chip, the successor to Orin in our automotive SoC road map, drive [Inaudible] delivers up to 2,000 tariff lots of performance and leverages technologies introduced in our Grace Hopper and ADA architectures. It is capable of running both the automated drive and in-vehicle infotainment systems.\nSimultaneously offering a LIFA performance while reducing cost and energy consumption. Driver will be available for automakers 25 models with Geely owned automaker, Zika as the first announced customer. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 53.6% and and non-GAAP gross margin was 56.1%.\nGross margins reflect $702 million in inventory charges largely related to lower data center demand in China, partially offset by a warranty benefit of approximately $70 million. Year-on-year, GAAP operating expenses were up 31%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 30%, primarily due to higher compensation expenses related to headcount growth and salary increases and higher data center infrastructure expenses. Sequentially, both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expense growth was in the single-digit percent, and we plan to keep it relatively flat at these levels over the coming quarters. We returned $3.75 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends.\nAt the end of Q3, we had approximately $8.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 23. Let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We expect our data center revenue to reflect early production shipments of the A100, offset by continued softness in China. In gaming, we expect to resume sequential growth with our revenue still below end demand as we continue to work through the channel inventory correction.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in automotive, we expect the continued ramp of our Oren design wins. All in, we expect modest sequential growth driven by automotive, gaming and data center. Revenue is expected to be $6 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be $63.2 million and 66%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.\nGAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.56 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.78 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $40 million, excluding gains and losses on nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.\nCapital expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million to $550 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be attending the Credit Suisse conference in Phoenix on November 30.\nThe rate Virtual Tech Conference on December 5 and and the JPMorgan Forum on January 5 in Las Vegas. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 are scheduled for Wednesday, February 22. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please poll for questions?\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.\nVivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my question. Colette, just wanted to clarify first, I think last quarter, you gave us a sell-through rate for your gaming business at about $2.5 billion a quarter. I think you said China is somewhat weaker. So I was hoping you could update us on what that sell-through rate is right now for gaming.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then, Jen-Hsun, the question for you. A lot of concerns about large hyperscalers cutting their spending and pointing to a slowdown. So if, let's say, U.S. cloud capex is flat or slightly down next year, do you think your business can still grow in the data center and why?\nColette Kress -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Thanks for the question. Let me first start with the sell-through on our gaming business. we had indicated, if you put two quarters together, we would see approximately $5 billion in normalized sell-through for our business.\nNow, during the quarter, sell-through in Q3 three was relatively solid. We've indicated that although China lockdowns continue to channel -- excuse me, challenge our overall China business. It was still relatively solid. Notebook sell-through was also quite solid.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd desktop, a bit softer, particularly in that China and Asia areas. We expect though stronger end demand, though, as we enter into Q4, driven by the upcoming holidays, as well as the continuation of the ADA adoption.\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nVivek, our data center business is indexed to two fundamental dynamics. The first has to do with general purpose computing no longer scaling. And so, acceleration is necessary to achieve the necessary level of cost efficiency scale and energy efficiency scale so that we can continue to increase workloads while saving money and saving power. Accelerated computing is recognized generally as the path forward as general purpose computing slows.\nThe second dynamic is AI. And we're seeing surging demand in some very important sectors of AIs in important breakthroughs in AI. One is called deep recommender systems, which is quite essential now to the best content or item or product to recommend to somebody who's using a device that is like a selfie or interacting with a computer just using voice. You need to really understand the nature, the context of the person making the request and make the appropriate recommendation to them.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second has to do with large language models. This is -- this started several years ago with the invention of the transformer, which led to Bert, which led to GP3, which led to a whole bunch of other models now associated with that. We now have the ability to learn representations of languages of all kinds. It could be human language.\nIt could be the language of biology. It could be the language of chemistry. And recently, I just saw a breakthrough called Jeans LM, we just one of the first example of learning the language of human genomes. The third has to do with generative AI.\nYou know that the first 10 years, we've dedicated ourselves to perception AI. But the goal of perception, of course, is to understand context. But the ultimate goal of AI is to make a contribution to create something to generate product. And this is now the beginning of the era of generative AI.\nYou probably see it all over the place, whether they're generating images or generating videos or generating text of all kinds and the ability to augment our performance to enhance our performance to make productivity enhanced to reduce cost and improve whatever we do with whatever we have to work with, productivity is really more important than ever. And so, you could see that our company is indexed to two things, both of which are more important than ever, which is power efficiency, cost efficiency and then, of course, productivity. And these things are more important than ever. And my expectation is that we're seeing all the strong demand and surging demand for AI and for niche reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nC.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nYeah, Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. You started to bundle on NVIDIA enterprise now with the H-100. I'm curious if you can talk about how we should think about timing around software monetization? And how we should kind of see this flow through the model, particularly with the focus on the AI enterprise and Omnivere side of things?\n\n\n\n\n\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Thanks, CJ. We're making excellent progress in NVIDIA AI enterprise. In fact, you saw probably that we made several announcements this quarter associated with clouds.\nYou know that NVIDIA has a rich ecosystem. And over the years, our rich ecosystem and our software stack has been integrated into developers and start-ups of all kinds, but more so -- more than ever, we're at the tipping point of clouds, and that's fantastic. Because if we could get NVIDIA's architecture and our full stack into every single cloud, we could reach more customers more quickly. And this quarter, we announced several initiatives, one has several partnerships and collaborations, one that we announced today, which has to do with Microsoft and our partnership there.\nIt has everything to do with scaling up AI because we have so many start-ups clamoring for large installations of our GPU so that they could do large language model training and building their start-ups and scale out of AI to enterprise and all of the world's Internet service providers. Every company we're talking to would like to have the agility and the scale, flexibility of clouds. And so, over the last year or so, we've been working on moving all of our software stacks to the cloud are of our platform and software stacks to the cloud. And so, today, we announced that Microsoft and ourselves are going to standardize on the NVIDIA stack, for a very large part of the work that we're doing together so that we could take a full stack out to the world's enterprise.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's all software included. We, a month ago, announced the same similar type of partnership with Oracle. You also saw that rescale a leader in high-performance computing cloud has integrated NVIDIA AI into their stack. [Inaudible] has been integrated into GCP.\nAnd we announced recently Nemo, large language model and bionemo large language model to put NVIDIA software in the cloud. And we also announced Omniverse is now available in the cloud. The goal of all of this is to move the NVIDIA platform full stack off boarding the cloud so that we can engage customers much, much more quickly and customers could engage our software if they would like to use it in the cloud, it's per GPU instance hour if they would like to utilize our software on-prem, they could do it through software license. And so, license and subscription.\nAnd so, in both cases, we now have software available practically everywhere you would like to engage it. The partners that we work with are super excited about it because MBDA's rich ecosystem is global, and this could bring both new consumption into their cloud for both them and ourselves, but also connect all of these new opportunities to the other APIs and other services that they offer. And so, our software stack is making really great progress.\nOperator\n\n\n\n\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nChris Caso -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nYes. Thank you. Good evening. I wonder if you could give some more color about the inventory charges you took in the quarter and then internal inventory in general.\nIn the documentation, you talked about that being a portion of inventory on hand plus some purchase obligations. And you also spoke in your prepared remarks that some of this was due to China data centers. So if you can clarify what was in those charges. And then, in general, for your internal inventory.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes that still need to be worked down? And what are the implications if that needs to be worked down over the next couple of quarters?\nColette Kress -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks for the question, Chris. So as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, we booked an entry of $702 million for inventory reserves within the quarter. Most of that, primarily, all of it is related to our data center business, just due to the change in expected demand looking forward for China. So when we look at the data center products, a good portion of this was also the A100, which we wrote down.\nNow, looking at our inventory that we have on hand and the inventory that has increased, a lot of that is just due to our upcoming architectures coming to market. our ADA architecture, our hopper architecture and even more in terms of our networking business. We have been building for those architectures to come to market and as such to say. We are always looking at our inventory levels at the end of each quarter for our expected demand going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I think we've done a solid job that we used in this quarter just based on that expectation going forward.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.\nTimothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks a lot. Colette, can you -- I have a two-part question. First, is there any effect of stockpiling in the data center guidance? I ask because you now have the A800 that is sort of a modified version of the A100 with the lower data transfer rate. So one could imagine that customers might be stocking that while they can still get it.\nAnd I guess the second part of that is related to the inventory charge, can you just go into that a little bit more? Because last quarter, it made sense that you took a charge because revenue was less than you thought, but revenue came in pretty much in line. And it sounded like China was a net neutral. So is the charge related to just working A100 inventory down faster? Is that what the charges related to?\nColette Kress -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSure. So let me talk about the first statement that you indicated. Most of our data center business that we see is we're working with customers specifically on their needs to build out accelerated computing and AI. It's just not a business in terms of where units are being held for that.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're usually four very, very specific products and projects that we see. So I'm going to answer no. Nothing that we can see. Your second question regarding the inventory provisions.\nAt the end of last quarter, we were beginning to see softness in China. We've always been looking at our needs long term. It's not a statement about the current quarter in inventory, as you can see. It usually takes two or three quarters for us to build product for the future demand.\nSo that's always a case of the inventory that we are ordering. So now looking at what we've seen in terms of continued lockdowns, continued economy challenges in China it was time for us to take a hard look of what do we think we'll need for data center going forward and not leg for write-downs.\nOperator\n\n\n\n\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nStacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Colette, I had a question on the commentary you gave on the sequentials. It kind of sounded like data center maybe had some China softness issues.\nYou said gaming resumed sequential growth. But then you said sequential growth for the company driven by auto gaming and data center. How can all three of those grow sequentially if the overall guidance is kind of flattish? Are they all just like growing just a little bit? Or is one of them actually down? Like how do we think about the segments into Q4 given that commentary?\n\n\n\n\n\nColette Kress -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. So your question is regarding the sequentials from Q3 to our guidance that we provided for Q4. As we are seeing the numbers in terms of our guidance, you're correct, is only growing about $100 million. And we've indicated that three of those platforms will likely grow just a little bit.\nBut our pro visualization business we think is going to be flattish and likely not growing as we're still working on correcting the channel inventory levels. to get to the right amount. It's very difficult to say which will have that increase. But again, we are planning for all three of those different market platforms to grow just a little bit.\nOperator\n\n\n\n\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nMark Lipacis -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Jen-Hsun, I think for you, you've articulated a vision for the data center we're a solution with an integrated solution set of a CPU, GPU and DPU is deployed for all workloads or most workloads, I think. Could you just give us a sense of or talk about where is this vision in the penetration cycle? And maybe talk about Grace Grace's importance for realizing that vision, what will Grace deliver versus an off-the-shelf x86 where -- do you have a sense of where Grace will get embraced first or the fastest within that vision?\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n\nGrace's data moving capability is off the charts. Grace also is memory coherent to our GPU, which allows our GPU to expand its effective GPU memory, fast GPU memory by a factor of 10. That's not possible without special capabilities that are designed between hopper and Grace and the architecture of Grace. And so, it was designed.\nGrace is designed for very large data processing at very high speeds. Those applications are related to, for example, data processing is related for recommender systems, which operates on petabytes of live data at a time. It's all hot. It all needs to be fast, so that you can make a recommendation within milliseconds to hundreds of millions of people using our service.\nIt is also quite effective at AI training, machine learning. And so, those kind of applications are really terrific. We -- Grace, I think I've said before that we will have production samples in Q1, and we're still on track to do that.\nOperator\n\n\n\n\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nHarlan Sur -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nGood afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Your data center networking business, I believe, is driving about $800 million per quarter in sales, very, very strong growth over the past few years. Near term, as you guys pointed out, and the team is driving strong Nick and blue food attached to your own compute solutions like DGX and more partner announcements like VMware, but we also know that networking has pretty large exposure to general purpose cloud and hyperscale compute spending trends. So what's the visibility and growth outlook for the networking business over the next few quarters?\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. If I could take that. First, thanks for your question. Our networking, as you know, is heavily indexed to high-performance computing.\nWe're not -- we don't serve the vast majority of commodity networking. All of our network solutions are very high end, and they're designed for data centers that move a lot of data. Now, if you have a hyperscale data center these days, and you are deploying a large number of AI applications. It is very likely that the network bandwidth that you provision has a substantial implication on the overall throughput of your data center.\nSo the small incremental investment they make in high-performance networking translates to billions of dollars of savings slightly in provisioning the service or billions of dollars more throughput, which increases their economics. And so, these days, with disaggregated and I application, AI provisioning and data centers, high-performance networking is really quite fantastic and it pays for itself right away. But that's where we are focused in high-performance networking and provisioning AI services in -- well, the AI applications that we focus on. You might have noticed that NVIDIA and Microsoft are building one of the largest AI infrastructures in the world.\nAnd it is completely powered by NVIDIA's InfiniBand 400 gigabits per second network. And the reason for that is because that network pays for itself instantaneously. The investment that you're going to put into the infrastructure is so significant that if you were to be dragged by slow networks, obviously, the efficiency of the overall infrastructure is not as high. And so, in the places where we focus networking is really quite important.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt goes all the way back to when we first announced the acquisition of Mellanox. I think at the time, they were doing about a few hundred million dollars a quarter, about $400 million a quarter. And now we're doing what they used to do in the old days, in a year, practically coming up in a quarter. And so, that kind of tells you about the growth of high-performance networking.\nIt is an indexed to overall enterprise and data center spend but it is highly indexed to AI adoption.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\n\n\n\n\nAaron Rakers -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\nThanks for taking the question. I want to expand on the networking question a little bit further. When we look at the Microsoft announcement today, we think about what Meda is doing on the AI footprint that they're deploying. Jen-Hsun, can you help us understand like where your InfiniBand networking sits relative to like traditional data center switching? And maybe kind of build on that, how you're positioning spectrum for in the market, does that compete against a broader set of opportunities in the Ethernet world for AI fabric networking?\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Thanks, Erin. The math is like this. If you're going to spend $20 billion on an infrastructure and the efficiency of that overall data center is improved by 10%.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe numbers are huge. And when we do these large language models and recommender systems, the processing is done across the entire data center. And so, we distribute the workload across multiple GPUs, multiple nodes and it runs for a very long time. And so, the importance of the network can be overemphasized.\nAnd so, the difference of 10% in overall improvement in efficiency, which is very to achieve. The difference between NVIDIA's InfiniBand, the entire software stack with what we call Magnum IO, which allows us to do computing in the network itself. A lot of software is running in the network itself, not just moving data around. We call it in-network computing because a ton of software is done at the edge at the -- within the network itself.\nWe achieved significant differences in overall efficiency. And so, if you're spending billions of dollars on the infrastructure, or even hundreds of millions of dollars of interest on the infrastructure. The difference is really quite profound.\nOperator\n\n\n\n\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Your line is now open.\nAmbrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nHi. Thank you very much. I actually had a couple of clarifications. Colette, in the data center side, is it a fair assumption that compute was down Q-over-Q in the reported quarter because the quarter before, Mellanox or the networking business was up as it was called out.\nAnd again, you said it grew quarter over quarter. So is that a fair assumption? And then, I had a clarification on the USG band. Initially, it was supposed to be a $400 million, really going to what the government was trying to firewall. Is the A800 -- I'm just trying to make sure I understand it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsn't that against the spirit of what the government is trying to do, i.e., firewall, high-performance compute? Or is A800 going to a different set of customers?\nColette Kress -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThank you for the question. So looking at our compute for the quarter is about flattish. Yes, we're seeing also growth growth in terms of our networking, but you should look at our Q3 compute is about flatters with last quarter.\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbrish, A800 hardware, the hardware of ensures that it always meets U.S. government's clear test for export control. And it cannot be customer reprogrammed or application reprogrammed to exceed it. It is hardware limited.\nIt is in the hardware that determines 800s capabilities. And so, it meets the clear test in letter and in spirit. We raised the concern about the $400 million of A100s because we were uncertain about whether we could execute. The introduction of A800 to our customers and through our supply chain in time.\nThe company did remarkable feeds to swarm this situation and make sure that our business was not affected and our customers were not affected. But A800 hardware surely ensures that it always meets U.S. government's clear tests for export control.\nOperator\n\n\n\n\n\nYour next question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nWilliam Stein -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\nThank you. I'm hoping you can discuss the pace of 100 growth as we progress over the next year. We've gotten a lot of questions as to whether the ramp in this product should look like a sort of traditional product cycle where there's quite a bit of pent-up demand for this significant improved performance product and that there's supply available as well. So does this rollout sort of look relatively typical from that perspective? Or should we expect a more perhaps delayed start of the growth trajectory where we see maybe substantially more growth in, let's say, second half of '23.\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n\nH-100 ramp is different than the A100 ramp in several ways. The first is that the TCO, the cost benefits, the operational cost benefits because of the energy savings because every data center is now Power Limited. And because of this incredible transformer engine that's designed for the latest AI models. The performance over Ampere is so significant that I -- and because of the pent-up demand for hopper because of these new models that are that I spoke about earlier, deep recommender systems and large language models and generative AI models.\nCustomers are clamoring to ramp hopper as quickly as possible, and we are trying to do the same. We are all hands on deck to help the cloud service providers stand up the supercomputers. Remember, I is the only company in the world that produces and ships semi-custom supercomputers in high volume. It's a miracle to ship one supercomputer every three years.\nit's unheard of to ship supercomputers to every cloud service provider in a quarter. And so, we're working hand with every one of them, and every one of them are racing to stand up hoppers. We expect them to have hopper cloud services stood up in Q1. And so, we are expecting to ship some volume, we're expecting to ship production in Q4, and then we're expecting to ship large volumes in Q1.\nThat's a faster transition than MPIR. And so, it's because of the dynamics that I described.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nMatt Ramsay -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nYeah. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I guess, Colette, I heard in your script that you had talked about maybe a new way of commenting on or reporting hyperscaler revenue in your data center business.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I wonder if you could maybe give us a little bit more detail about what you're thinking there and what sort of drove the decision? And I guess the derivative of that, Jen-Hsun, how -- that decision to talk about the data center business to hyperscalers differently. I mean, what does that mean for the business that is just a reflection of where demand is and you're going to break things out differently? Or is something changing about the mix of I guess, internal properties versus vertical industry demand within the hyperscale customer base.\nColette Kress -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, Matt, thanks for the question. Let me clarify a little bit in terms of what we believe we should be looking at when we go forward and discussing our data center business. Our data center business is becoming larger and larger and our customers are complex. And when we talk about hyperscale, we tend to talk about seven, eight different companies.\nBut the reality is there's a lot of very large companies that we could add to that discussion based on what they're purchasing. Additionally, looking at the cloud, looking at our cloud purchases and what our customers are building for the cloud is an important area to focus on because this is really where our enterprise is where our researchers, where our higher education is also purchasing. So we're trying to look for a better way to describe the color of what we're seeing in the cloud and also give you a better understanding of some of these large installments that we're seeing in the hyperscales.\n\n\n\n\n\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Let me double click on what Colette just said, which is absolutely right. There are two major dynamics that's happening. First, the adoption of NVIDIA in Internet service companies around the world, the number and the scale by which they're doing it has grown a lot.\nInternet service companies. And these are Internet service companies that offer services, but they're not public cloud computing companies. The second factor has to do with cloud computing. We are now at the tipping point of cloud computing.\nAlmost every enterprise in the world has both a cloud-first and a multi-cloud strategy. It is exactly the reason why all of the announcements that we made this year -- this quarter, this last quarter since GTC about all the new platforms that are now available in the cloud. a CSP, a hyperscaler is both -- are two things to us, therefore, a hyperscaler can be a sell to customer. They are also a cell with partner on the public cloud side of their business.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of the richness of NVIDIA's ecosystem because we have so many Internet service customers and enterprise customers using NVIDIA's full stack. The public cloud side of their business really enjoys and values the partnership with us and the cell with relationship they have with us. And it's pretty clear now that for all of the hyperscalers, the public cloud side of their business will likely would very likely be the vast majority of their overall consumption. And so, because the world CSPs, the world's public clouds is only at the early innings of their enterprise to lifting enterprise to the cloud world it's very, very clear that the public cloud side of the business is going to be very large.\nAnd so, increasingly, our relationship with CSPs, our relationship with hyperscalers will -- will include, of course, continuing to sell to them for internal consumption but very importantly, sell with for the public cloud side.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk to looking backward at the crypto impact. Obviously, that's gone from your numbers now, but do you see any potential for liquidation of GPUs that are in the mining network, any impact going forward? And do you foresee blockchain being an important part of your business at some point down the road?\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWe don't expect to see blockchain being an important part of our business down the road. There is always a resell market. If you look at any of the major resell sites, eBay, for example, there are secondhand graphics cards for sale all the time. And the reason for that is because a 3090 that somebody bought today, is upgraded to a 4090 or 3090 by a couple of years ago, it was up are until 4090 today.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat 3090 could be sold to somebody and enjoyed it sold at the right price. And so, the volume of -- the availability of secondhand and used graphics cards has always been there. And the inventory is never zero. and when the inventory is larger than usual, like all supply demand, it would likely drift lower price and affect the lower ends of our market.\nBut my sense is that where we're going right now with ADA is targeting very clearly in the upper range, the top half of our market. And and early signs are, and I'm sure you're also seeing that the ADA launch was a home run. That we shipped a large volume of 4090s because as you know, we were prepared for it. And yet within minutes, they were sold out around the world.\nAnd so, the reception of 4090 and the reception of 4080 today has been off the charts. And that says something about the strength and the health and the vibrancy of the gaming market. So we're super enthusiastic about the ADA launch. We have many more ad products to come.\nOperator\n\n\n\n\n\nYour last question today comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nToshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you so much for squeezing me in. I had two quick ones for Colette. On supply, I think there was some mixed messaging in your remarks.\nI think you talked about supply being a headwind at one point. And then, when you were speaking to the networking business, I think you talked about supply easing. So I was hoping you can kind of speak to supply if you're caught up to demand at this point. And then, secondly, just on stock-based compensation, pretty mundane topic I realize, but it is -- I think in the quarter, it was about $700 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's becoming a bigger piece of your opex. So curious how we should be modeling that going forward.\nColette Kress -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSure. When we look at our supply constraints that we have had in the past, each and every quarter, this is getting better Networking was one of our issues probably a year ago, and it has taken us probably to this quarter. and next quarter to really see our supply improved so that we can support the pipeline that we have for our customers that are -- now that's our supply. We've also made a discussion regarding our customers, supply constraints, issues when setting up a data center, even getting data center capacity has been very difficult.\nAnd therefore, that challenges them in their purchasing decisions as they're still looking for certain parts of that supply chain to come through. So that hopefully clarifies what we were talking about regarding two areas of supply. In our stock-based compensation, what we'll see, it's very difficult to predict what our stock-based compensation would be when it arrives. We have provided to our incoming employees but also once a year to our employees, and it's a single date in terms of when that is priced.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it's difficult to determine, but stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and will continue to be. So we look at it from an overall compensation perspective. So up until now and when we do the focal, we'll see about the same size with a few additions for the reduced level of employee hiring that we have right now.\nOperator\nThank you. I will now turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun Huang for closing remarks.\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks, everyone. We are quickly adapting to the macro environment. Correcting inventory levels, offering alternative products to data center customers in China and keeping our opex flat for the next few quarters. Our new platforms are off to a great start and formed the foundation for our resumed growth.\nMRTX is reinventing 3D graphics with ray tracing and AI. The launch of [Inaudible] is phenomenal. Gamers waited in long lines around the world, 4090 stocks sold out quickly. Hopper, with its revolutionary transformer engine is just in time to meet the surging demand for recommender systems, large language models and generative AI.\nNVIDIA networking is synonymous with the highest data center throughput and enjoying record results. Oren is the world's first computing platform designed for AI-powered autonomous vehicles and robotics and putting automotive on the road to be our next multibillion-dollar platform. These computing platforms run NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse, software libraries and engines that help the companies build and deploy AI to products and services. we this pioneering work and accelerated computing is more vital than ever.\nLimited by business, general purpose commuting has slowed to a crawl just as AI demands more computing. Scaling through general purchase computing alone is no longer viable, both from a cost or power standpoint. Accelerated computing is the path forward. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\n[Operator signoff]\nDuration: 0 minutes\nCall participants:\nSimona Jankowski -- Vice President, Investor Relations\n\n\n\n\n\nColette Kress -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nVivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nC.J.

(PHOTO: Getty)  \u00b7 Petegar via Getty Images SINGAPORE \u2013 The Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) rates at three locations will be raised by S$1 over five time periods from 19 November. In a statement on Monday (14 November), the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said that based on its monitoring of traffic conditions in October 2022, traffic has built up at these stretches of expressways. The locations are: Southbound CTE auxiliary lane to PIE (Changi)/Serangoon Road, PIE Kallang Bahru and slip road into Bendemeer (set of two gantries), and KPE (ECP) after Defu Flyover.

However, for these locations, the S$1 ERP rate increase will be implemented only after the school holidays, as \"their traffic speeds are projected to improve temporarily during the December school holidays\", the LTA said. These locations are: AYE before Alexandra towards the city, AYE after Jurong Town Hall towards the city (set of three gantries), and PIE Adam and Mount Pleasant (set of two gantries).   Table showing the deferred ERP rate increases at three locations; the increase will be effective from 3 January 2023.   Meanwhile, the LTA said, there will be an ERP rate reduction during seven time periods across four locations during the December school holiday period, starting from 19 November. These rates will revert to the pre-school holiday charges from 3 January 2023 onwards. These locations are: AYE before Alexandra towards the city, Southbound CTE before Braddell Road, Southbound CTE after Braddell Road and PIE slip road into Southbound CTE (set of four gantries) and KPE (ECP) after Defu Flyover.   Table showing the ERP rate reduction at four locations over seven time period during the December school holiday.   The LTA said it will continue to monitor traffic speeds and congestion levels closely and assess if ERP rates need to be further adjusted. Follow us on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter.

However, the group's revenue for the first half rose 31.1 per cent from S$731.4 million during the same period a year ago to S$958.9 million currently. This hike was led by growth in the logistics segment which included the consolidation of 51 per cent-owned FMH, which operates a fourth-party logistics service business that provides integrated supply chain and distribution solutions. \"The group is evolving into a global logistics player with digitally-enabled capabilities and sustainable cost-effective solutions,\" said Vincent Phang, SingPost\u2019s group chief executive officer. \"We continue to execute our transformation efforts with investments made in Australia, executing our Future of Post strategy for our Domestic business, and reigniting the International business. In Australia, we are building a technology-led integrated B2B and B2C logistics business, where revenues now make up over 42 per cent of the group's, up from 17 per cent a year ago,\" he added.

The logistics segment now represents the group's largest segment by revenue and profit contribution. Meanwhile, the logistics segment's operating profit grew to S$41.5 million, or more than double the S$16.2 million in the same period last year. In the post and parcel segment, revenue declined 19.6 per cent to S$261.7 million due to the challenging operating environment, mostly in the first quarter. For the first half of FY2022/2023, SingPost has declared an interim dividend of 0.18 cent per ordinary share. This dividend will be paid on 30 November 2022.

Its impact on energy efficiency is staggering.\n We estimate the TOP500 systems require more than 5 terawatt-hours of energy per year, or $750 million worth of energy, to operate.\nBut that could be slashed by more than 80% to just $150 million \u2014 saving 4 terawatt-hours of energy \u2014 if these systems were as efficient as the 30 greenest systems on the TOP500 list.\nConversely, with the same power budget as today\u2019s TOP500 systems and the efficiency of the top 30 systems, these supercomputers could deliver 5x today\u2019s performance.\nAnd the efficiency gains highlighted by the latest Green500 systems are just the start. NVIDIA is racing to deliver continuous energy improvements across its CPUs, GPUs, software and systems portfolio.\nHopper\u2019s Green500 Debut\nNVIDIA technologies already power 23 of the top 30 systems on the latest Green500 list.\nAmong the highlights: the Flatiron Institute in New York City topped the Green500 list of most efficient supercomputers with an air-cooled ThinkSystem built by Lenovo featuring NVIDIA Hopper H100 GPUs.\nThe supercomputer, dubbed Henri, produces 65 billion double-precision, floating-point operations per watt, according to the Green500, and will be used to tackle problems in computational astrophysics, biology, mathematics, neuroscience and quantum physics.\nThe NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU, based on the NVIDIA Hopper GPU architecture, has up to 6x more AI performance and up to 3x more HPC performance compared to the prior-generation A100 GPU. It\u2019s designed to perform with incredible efficiency. Its second-generation Multi-Instance GPU technology can partition the GPU into smaller compute units, dramatically boosting the number of GPU clients available to data center users.\nAnd the show floor at this year\u2019s SC22 conference is packed with new systems featuring NVIDIA\u2019s latest technologies from ASUS, Atos, Dell Technologies, GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, QCT and Supermicro.\nThe fastest new computer on the TOP500 list, Leonardo, hosted and managed by the Cineca nonprofit consortium, and powered by nearly 14,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, took the No. 4 spot, while also being the 13th most energy-efficient system.\nThe latest TOP500 list boasts the highest number of NVIDIA technologies so far.\nIn total, NVIDIA technologies power 361 of the systems on the TOP500 list, including 90% of the new systems (see chart).\nThe Next-Generation Accelerated Data Center\nNVIDIA is also developing new computing architectures to deliver even greater energy efficiency and performance to the accelerated data center.\nThe Grace CPU and Grace Hopper Superchips, announced earlier this year, will provide the next big boost in the energy efficiency of the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform. The Grace CPU Superchip delivers up to twice the performance per watt of a traditional CPU, thanks to the incredible efficiency of the Grace CPU and low-power LPDDR5X memory.\nAssuming a 1-megawatt HPC data center with 20% of the power allocated for CPU partition and 80% toward the accelerated portion using Grace and Grace Hopper, data centers can get 1.8x more work done for the same power budget compared to a similarly partitioned x86-based data center.\nDPUs Driving Additional Efficiency Gains\nAlong with Grace and Grace Hopper, NVIDIA networking technology is supercharging cloud-native supercomputing just as the increased usage of simulations is accelerating demand for supercomputing services.\nBased on NVIDIA\u2019s BlueField-3 DPU, the NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand platform delivers the extreme performance, broad accessibility and strong security needed by cloud computing providers and supercomputing centers.\nThe effort, described in a recent whitepaper, demonstrated how DPUs can be used to offload and accelerate networking, security, storage or other infrastructure functions and control-plane applications, reducing server power consumption up to 30%.\nThe amount of power savings increases as server load increases and can easily save $5 million in electricity costs for a large data center with 10,000 servers over the three-year lifespan of the servers, plus additional savings in cooling, power delivery, rack space and server capital costs.\nAccelerated computing with DPUs for networking, security and storage jobs is one of the next big steps for making data centers more power efficient.\nMore With Less\nBreakthroughs like these come as the scientific method is rapidly transforming into an approach driven by data analytics, AI and physics-based simulation, making more efficient computers key to the next generation of scientific breakthroughs.\nBy providing researchers with a multi-discipline, high-performance computing platform optimized for this new approach \u2014 and able to deliver both performance and efficiency \u2014 NVIDIA gives scientists an instrument to make critical discoveries that will benefit us all.\nMore Resources\n\nTake the Green Train: NVIDIA BlueField DPUs Drive Data Center Efficiency\nNVIDIA Omniverse Opens Portals for Scientists to Explore Our Universe\nNVIDIA H100 and Quantum-2 Systems Announced Worldwide\nGoing the Distance: NVIDIA Platform Solves HPC Problems at the Edge\nSupercomputing Superpowers: NVIDIA Brings Digital Twin Simulation to HPC Data Center Operators\nSpeaking the Language of the Genome: Gordon Bell Finalist Applies Large Language Models to Predict New COVID Variants\nExplainer: What Is Green Computing?\n\n\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Data Center | SupercomputingTags: Climate | GPU | NVIDIA BlueField \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

Heijmans (Bloomberg) \u2014 Singapore\u2019s planned political succession that would see Finance Minister Lawrence Wong become the country\u2019s next leader will coincide with general elections due by 2025, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said. The political landscape is getting more competitive, and Lee told members of his People\u2019s Action Party that it\u2019s imperative for them to keep Singaporeans on their side to ensure a hold on power with a strong mandate. Party members later voted on its central executive committee at the Sunday gathering.  \u201cWe will be tested on all fronts domestically as well as abroad,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI have no doubt our neighbors will be watching closely whether Singaporeans continue to support the government. Whether Singapore will continue to function and to succeed the way it has been doing.\u201d While it remains unclear whether the ruling party will seek a fresh mandate through early elections or if Lee, 70, plans to lead them, he said the PAP would keep on working at succession and leadership renewal of the so-called fourth generation of party cadres. Lee previously said he would hand the reins to Wong, 49, once he is ready. The PAP is seeking to strengthen its hand after its worst showing in the 2020 election. Wong, who is also deputy prime minster, warned party members on Sunday it shouldn\u2019t take winning the next election for granted, despite having held power since the city state\u2019s independence in 1965. The party elected its 14-member central executive committee, renewing many of its standing members. While Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong stepped down as its chair, Prime Minister Lee, Deputy Prime Ministers Wong and Heng Swee Keat, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing and Health Minister Ong Ye Kung are among those who will remain.  \u201cContinuity remains the name of the game, which bodes well for companies,\u201d said Nydia Ngiow, Singapore-based managing director at strategic policy advisory firm Bower Group Asia. There may still be one more party election before a national vote, so for Lee \u201cat this stage the results perhaps indicate he\u2019s not quite ready to ease off just yet and the 4G leaders still need to prove themselves for the next few years.\u201d Wong said the opposition will be stronger at the next election, and reminded delegates that their challengers had won more seats and votes in recent contests. \u201cWhile we put up good candidates and fight to win every seat, we have to be prepared that we will not win all of them and nor can we assume that we\u2019ll form the next government,\u201d Wong said at the party\u2019s congress. \u201cWhether it happens before or in 2025, we already know it\u2019ll be a tough battle.\u201d   Story continues Wong said the government wants to tilt its \u201cpolicies further in favor of the less fortunate and vulnerable,\u201d as many in the wealthy island nation battle rising prices. The low inflation and interest rates of the past few decades have come to an end, said Wong.He also warned the free flow of goods and investments that Singapore has grown accustomed to in recent decades is set to shift, if not reverse, with the emergence of a new \u201ccold war\u201d between the US and China, which \u201cwill be more dangerous than the first cold war.\u201d\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.

Throughout his career, he\u2019s been intrigued by the intersection between art and AI. His first encounter with AI as an artistic tool was at Google, where he used deep learning \u2014 and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti \u2014 to create dynamic digital artworks.\nIn 2017, he started working with one of the first generative AI tools, StyleGAN, created at NVIDIA Research, which was able to generate synthetic images of faces that are incredibly realistic.\nAnadol was more intrigued by the ability to use the tool to explore more abstract images, training StyleGAN not on images of faces, but of modern art, and guiding the AI\u2019s synthesis using data streaming in from optical, temperature and acoustic sensors.\nDigging Deep With MoMA\n\nThose ideas led him to an online collaboration with The Museum of Modern Art in 2021, which was exhibited by Feral File, using more than 138,000 records from the museum\u2019s publicly available archive. The Feral File exhibit caused an online sensation, reimagining art in real time and inspiring the wave of AI-generated art that\u2019s spread quickly through social media communities on Instagram, Twitter, Discord and Reddit this year.\nThis year, he returned to MoMA to dig even deeper, collaborating again with MoMA curators Michelle Kuo and Paola Antonelli on a new major installation. On view from Nov. 19 through March 5, 2023, \u201cRefik Anadol: Unsupervised\u201d will use AI to interpret and transform more than 200 years of art from MoMA\u2019s collection.\nIt\u2019s an exploration not just of the world\u2019s foremost collection of modern art \u2014 pretty much every single pioneering sculptor, painter and even game designer of the past two centuries \u2014 but a look inside the mind of AI, allowing us to see results of the algorithm processing data from MoMA\u2019s collection, as well as ambient sound, temperature and light, and \u2018dreaming,\u2019\u201d Anadol said.\nPowering the system is a full suite of NVIDIA technologies. He relies on an NVIDIA DGX server equipped with NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs to train the model in real time. Another machine equipped with an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU translates the model into computer graphics, driving the exhibit\u2019s display.\n\u2018Bending Data\u2019\n\u201cRefik is bending data \u2014 which we normally associate with rational systems \u2014 into a realm of surrealism and irrationality,\u201d Michelle Kuo, the exhibit\u2019s curator at the museum, told the New York Times. \u201cHis interpretation of MoMA\u2019s dataset is essentially a transformation of the history of modern art.\u201d\nThe installation comes amid a wave of excitement around generative AI, a technology that\u2019s been put at the fingertips of amateur and professional artists alike with new tools such as Midjourney, OpenAI\u2019s Dall\u00b7E, and DreamStudio.\nAnd while Anadol\u2019s work intersects with the surge in interest in NFT art that had the world buzzing in 2021, like AI-generated art, it goes far beyond it.\nInspired by Cutting-Edge Research\nAnadol\u2019s work digs deep into MoMA\u2019s archives and cutting-edge AI, relying on a technology developed at NVIDIA Research called StyleGAN. David Luebke, vice president of graphics research at NVIDIA, said he first got excited about generative AI\u2019s artistic and creative possibilities when he saw NVIDIA researcher Janne Hellsten\u2019s demo of StyleGAN2 trained on stylized artistic portraits.\n\u201cSuddenly, one could fluidly explore the content and style of a generated image or have it react to ambient effects like sound or even weather,\u201d Luebke said.\nNVIDIA Research has been pushing forward the state of the art in generative AI since at least 2017 when NVIDIA developed \u201cProgressive GANs,\u201d which used AI to synthesize highly realistic, high-resolution images of human faces for the first time. This was followed by StyleGAN, which achieved even higher quality results.\nEach year after that, NVIDIA released a paper that advanced the state of the art. StyleGAN has proved to be a versatile platform, Luebke explained, enabling countless other researchers and artists like Anadol to bring their ideas to life.\nDemocratizing Content Creation\nMuch more is coming. Modern generative AI models have shown the capability to generalize beyond particular subjects, such as images of human faces or cats or cars, and encompass language models that let users specify the image they want in natural language, or other intuitive ways, such as inpainting, Luebke explains.\n\u201cThis is exciting because it democratizes content creation,\u201d Luebke said. \u201cUltimately, generative AI has the potential to unlock the creativity of everybody from professional artists, like Refik, to hobbyists and casual artists, to school kids,\u201d Luebke said.\nAnadol\u2019s work at MoMA offers a taste of what\u2019s possible. \u201cRefik Anadol: Unsupervised,\u201d the artist\u2019s first U.S. solo museum presentation, features three new digital artworks by the Los Angeles-based artist that use AI to dynamically explore MoMA\u2019s collection on a vast 24-by-24-foot digital display. It\u2019s as much a work of architecture as it is one of art.\n\u201cOften, AI is used to classify, process and generate realistic representations of the world,\u201d the exhibition\u2019s organizer Michelle Kuo, told Archinect, a leading publication covering contemporary art and architecture. \u201cAnadol\u2019s work, by contrast, is visionary: it explores dreams, hallucination and irrationality, posing an alternate understanding of modern art \u2014 and of artmaking itself.\u201d\n\u201cRefik Anadol: Unsupervised\u201d also hints at how AI will transform our future, and Anadol thinks it will be for the better. \u201cThis will just enhance our imagination,\u201d Anadol said. \u201cI\u2019m seeing this as an extension of our minds.\u201d\nFor more, see our exploration of Refik Anadol\u2019s work in NVIDIA\u2019s AI Art Gallery.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Art | Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA Research | NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

Here in Singapore, while we buy a lot of insurance products, we don\u2019t actually have that many listed insurance stocks that we can invest in on the local Singapore Exchange (SGX). One of the good things about the Hong Kong Stock Exchange is that it offers investors access to a wide range of large companies in various sectors.  In the insurance sector, Hong Kong\u2019s stock market is home to Asia\u2019s largest listed insurance company by market capitalisation \u2013 AIA Group Ltd (HKEX: 1299). Currently, AIA has a market cap of HK$797 billion (US$101.5 billion). For context, in Singapore the largest insurance stock on the SGX is Great Eastern Holding Ltd (SGX: G07), which has a market cap of around S$8.6 billion (US$6.1 billion). So, for investors interested in AIA Group and its business, here\u2019s what investors should know about Asia\u2019s largest listed insurance company. A Brief History Of AIA Group AIA Group was founded in Shanghai in 1919, meaning that the company originally has its roots in Asia. While it was a subsidiary of US-based insurer American International Group Inc (AIG) (NYSE: AIG) \u2013 that was a key victim of the Global Financial Crisis \u2013 none of AIA\u2019s business was related to its parent. In 2010, AIG spun off AIA in a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) that raised US$17.9 billion, making it the world\u2019s third-largest IPO at the time. Shares were priced at HK$19.68. Today, the company is present in 18 Asia-Pacific markets, from Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore to China, India, South Korea, and Australia, among others. It serves mainly the health and life insurance segments, which is a sizeable and growing market in Asia. A China focus for AIA Group AIA was known as a pan-Asian insurance company when it was first listed in 2010. While that still applies, its business has become more geared towards the growth of the insurance industry in Mainland China. It\u2019s currently the only foreign life insurance company with a wholly-owned subsidiary (AIA China) that operates in Mainland China. Initially confined to business in coastal cities in China, the company has increasingly been receiving approvals to start branches of operations in new provinces. Over the past two or three years,\u00a0the company has received approval from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) to open branches in new Chinese provinces and cities, including Hubei, Sichuan, and Henan. This focus on expansion in China can be seen through its earnings makeup. For insurance companies, many investors look at the Value of New Business (VONB) as a measure of growth.   Story continues In the first half of 2022, AIA recorded VONB of US$1.54 billion, down 13% year-on-year. Most of this fall was attributed to movement restrictions in China during the period, which negatively impacted AIA China\u2019s VONB growth.As investors can see, China made up over one-third of AIA\u2019s overall VONB in the first half of this year and Hong Kong made up 19% (see below).Meanwhile, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Other Markets (which include Vietnam, Australia, India, South Korea, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, New Zealand, Indonesia, Cambodia, Brunei, and Myanmar) combined make up nearly 50% of the group\u2019s VONB.  Source: AIA Group H1 2022 earnings presentationOperating & Business Metrics For AIA GroupAIA sells a lot of its policies via its own agency force, as can be seen from the chart above. The rest comes from partnerships such as bancassurance agreements with large financial institutions and banks.This model has seen the company grow its operating profit after tax (OPAT) at a steady rate over the years.In the first half of 2012, the company\u2019s OPAT was US$1.08 billion while in the first half of 2022 AIA posted an OPAT of US$3.22 billion (see below).Quite a bit of this OPAT growth in the first half of 2022 came from Hong Kong, Mainland China, and Singapore.  Source: AIA Group H1 2022 earnings presentationIn terms of capital allocation, in March of this year, AIA announced that it would be carrying out a US$10 billion share buyback over three years given the strong free surplus that it holds.The company\u00a0has also been paying shareholders a dividend since 2011. It has grown this annual dividend per share (DPS) from HK$0.33 per share in 2011 to HK$1.46 in 2021.That equates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in its dividend of 16% over the past decade.At its current price, AIA shares provide investors with a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.2%.If individuals want to buy its stock, you will have to be aware that the company sells its shares in board lots of 200 shares each.That means \u2013 based on its latest price of HK$68.05 \u2013 the minimum amount required to purchase AIA shares would be HK$13,610, which at current exchange rates is S$2,423.AIA Group Is A Big Insurance Stock To MonitorOverall, AIA is a large insurance company that is also a constituent member of the Hang Seng Index (Hong Kong\u2019s equivalent of the Straits Times Index).The company is continuing to see a recovery in key markets in which it operates in. In its latest brief Q3 2022 business update,\u00a0the company stated that group VONB was up 7% year-over-year to US$741 million.For investors who are interested in insurance stocks in Asia, AIA is a big company worth following.Investors Guide To Understanding How The Hong Kong Stock Connect Scheme Works The post What Investors Should Know About AIA Group (HKEX: 1299), Asia\u2019s Largest Insurance Stock appeared first on DollarsAndSense.sg.

What should you expect as an SIA shareholder?   investment app on phone   An interim dividend will be issued to shareholders at 10 cents a share. The dividends will be paid out to shareholders who bought SIA stock before the ex-dividend date of 9th Dec 2022 (one working day before the release date of 12th Dec 2022). This means that if you have 50,000 shares of SIA stock, you will expect to receive S$5,000 in dividends.  The dividends will be credited to the bank account linked to your CDP account on the 22nd of December. For individuals using trading platforms such as Tiger Brokers where your stocks are held in a holding account, the dividends will be automatically paid to your account within a few days after the platform has received it. Singapore follows a single-tier corporate tax system. SIA Group is responsible for paying taxes on its profits prior to issuing a dividend. Hence, the burden to pay the tax is on the company and the dividend you will receive will be tax-exempt.

Their initiatives to fundraise, retain talent and deploy resources allowed them to be one of the first carriers to launch flights and start sales when the Singapore government made the decision to reopen their borders earlier last year, starting with the Vacinated Travel Lanes (VTLs) in September 2021. SIA and Scoot carried 11.4 million passengers between April to September 2022, a 14 times increase from the same period the year before. By July - September 2022, passenger capacity rose to 68% of pre-pandemic levels.  As a result in April to September 2022, passenger flown revenue increased by 694% year on year to S$5.979 billion. This was due to an 11-fold increase in traffic and a 66.8% increase in passenger load factor. Cargo revenue also increased by 11.9% despite a decline in cargo loads due to an increase in prices. Altogether, this translated to an increase in group revenue of 197.7% from S$2.817 billion in April to September 2021 to S$8.416 billion in the same period this year. This is the first time since the pandemic that the SIA group has paid out a dividend. This is because of their strong balance sheet, with cash reserves rising steadily on the back of a strong recovery in the demand for passenger air travel. This is a good sign for the group as this suggests that they are in a good financial position and have the ability to give back to their shareholders.   Story continues SIA Group Going Forward  airport runway view of planes  The SIA group has benefited from the uptick in passenger travel demand. Travellers are booking flights in droves following 2 years of being unable to go on holiday. This trend of \u201crevenge travelling\u201d has given SIA substantial pricing power, allowing them to charge higher prices for their airfares. This is the main contributing factor behind the group\u2019s highest-ever quarterly operating profit.However, there are some headwinds for the aviation industry. The cost of jet fuel is currently very high, During the pandemic, jet fuel demand plummeted to near zero. This pushed a lot of refineries to switch off their production of jet fuel. It is not easy to switch refineries back on or change what they are producing. As the demand for travel has picked up in recent months, the demand for jet fuel has outpaced its supply. This could have an impact on SIA\u2019s total expenditure, which would eat into their profit margins.Furthermore, the high demand for passenger air travel at the moment is a reflection of pent-up demand from people not being able to travel for the last few years. This level of demand is likely to temper in the long run. High cost-of-living inflation and a possible oncoming global recession may further diminish demand for passenger air travel in the near future.ConclusionOur national carrier has weathered the worst of the pandemic and is positioned to do well due to booming passenger travel demand. The issuance of interim dividends in 2022 is a signal towards its strong cash balances.

This would mean a total of 20 stations out of the 32 planned would be in operation under the third stage (out of five) of construction. The 11 new stations are Stevens, Napier, Orchard Boulevard, Orchard, Great World, Havelock, Outram Park, Maxwell, Shenton Way, Marina Bay, and Gardens by the Bay. This will initially benefit around 80,000 households along the north-south corridor, with shorter travel times to the city centre.  While this would bring out even better connectivity to some traditional office locations, other less prominent locations would also get boosted visibility due to the TEL. We pick out a few of these office locations where workers in the north-south corridor may now find it more appealing with the opening of these new stations. #1 (TEL14) \u2013 Orchard Road    Orchard Road has long been the heart of Singapore\u2019s main shopping belt. Flanked on both sides by long-standing malls like Shaw House and Lucky Plaza and the newer-built malls like Ion Orchard,\u00a0it is a vibrant place for both tourists and locals alike. The TEL 14 \u2013 Orchard Station is one of the six interchange stations that would be operational in Stage 3. It will link to the North-South Line (NSL), giving commuters in the north-south corridor an alternative and faster travel route to the city centre.  Some of the office buildings surrounding Orchard Station are Ngee Ann City, Wheelock Place, and Wisma Atria. Office rents in the Orchard area range between $8.00 and $11.001 per square foot (PSF). For workers, there are plenty of lunch and dinner options, from value-for-money meals at Far East Plaza to posh dining at Ion Orchard. Also, no one is going to fault you if you used your lunchtime to do some window shopping (though you probably shouldn\u2019t!). There also are more than a handful of gyms and fitness centres like Max Out Fitness and PURE Fitness located around the vicinity to work out a sweat for the fitness-conscious employees. It is an exciting office location for shopaholic workers and those who like to unwind with food and drinks after work. #2 (TEL15) \u2013 Great World City    Great World City was once known as the Great World Amusement Park when it was a popular nightlife hotspot in the 1950s. Today, it is mainly a private residential enclave. The Great World City station, located along River Valley Road, will bring rail connectivity to the previously unconnected area. The train station will have five entry/exit links, including to the Great World City. This will benefit the namesake integrated property development, which has 420,000 sq ft of retail space, 300,000 sq ft of office space, and 304 service apartments. Office rent at Great World City starts at $7.501 PSF.   Story continues Workers would be able to enjoy the one-stop convenience offered by the retail podium, which includes a wide range of amenities, including dining options like Tim Ho Wan, McDonald\u2019s, and Food Junction. You could even catch a movie after work at the theatre operated by Golden Village or get in shape at True Fitness, which are all located within Great World City. There are also child-friendly services like a childcare centre (Pat\u2019s Schoolhouse), children\u2019s enrichment centres (Kumon, The Eton Academy), and a toy shop (Toys \u201cR\u201d Us). These amenities might appeal to young working parents, as they may find it convenient to care for their preschool child(ren) close to their workplace.#3 (TEL 17) \u2013 Outram Park And (TEL 18) \u2013 Maxwell    Outram Park is one of the oldest commercial hubs in Singapore. Though it\u2019s now more commonly associated with the SGH Medical Campus, consisting of the Singapore General Hospital, Outram Community Hospital, and others, the many surrounding pre-war shophouses are still buzzing with commercial activities. The new TEL Outram Park station \u2013 which is also close to the Maxwell TEL station \u2013 joins with the existing interchange station, connecting commuters to both the East West Line (EWL) and North East Line (NEL). For commuters in the north, this is a more convenient and direct rail service as opposed to transferring from the NSL to the NEL to reach Outram/Maxwell.While there is no major office building of note, there are plenty of shophouses bordering New Bridge Road, Neil Road, Southbridge Road, and Upper Cross Street that are used by small businesses as office spaces. Furnished office space rents in the area range from $7.00 to $14.002 PSF. Unlike typical office locations, there is a different vibe to the Maxwell area, which may feel slower-paced and bring about a nostalgic feeling that is reminiscent of its history.Though you may not get the modern amenities found in most office buildings, you could still get a wide variety of affordable food options from places like the Maxwell Food Centre and Chinatown Complex Market that should meet the basic needs of most workers. Workers in this location will also not be disadvantaged when it comes to shopping or gym options, with more than a handful of boutique gyms around like CrossFit Urban Edge and Anytime Fitness. The Outram/Maxwell office location might appeal to workers who desire individuality.#4 (TEL 19) \u2013 Shenton Way And (TEL 20) \u2013 Marina Bay    The Marina Bay and Shenton Way areas are part of the Central Business District or CBD, where the main commerce activities in Singapore are conducted. Prior to the government\u2019s initiative to bring jobs closer to homes by constructing regional hubs, most people had to travel to the CBD for work.The new TEL station at Marina Bay will join the existing interchange station, connecting to both the NSL and Circle Line (CCL); whereas, the Shenton Way TEL station, which is sited at Shenton Way and Marina View, would have exits at Asia Square Tower 2 and Marina One West Tower.The opening of these two stations would give workers travelling from the north south an alternative travel route compared to the current means via the NSL. This would also help to alleviate the passenger load on the NSL, making commuting during peak hours more enjoyable. Office rents in the CBD area range between $8.00 PSF and $14.001 PSF.

(PHOTO: Getty)   By Sandy Pramuji  SINGAPORE \u2013 Some nine in 10 men have no problems dating women who earn more, but only one in five women are happy to date men who earn less. In a Lunch Actually survey of 500 singles \u2013 a 50-50 split between men and women \u2013 in Singapore, 92 per cent of single men are okay if their dates earn more, and this has increased from 88 per cent in 2021.  On the contrary, 41 per cent of Singapore women say they would not date men who earn less. This is a decrease from 42 per cent last year. In a press release on Tuesday (22 November), alongside its announcement of the annual survey results, dating agency Lunch Actually, said that \"economic uncertainty could be one of the reasons why women are getting more specific about men's earnings\". In total, 2,390 singles from six territories \u2013 Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong and Taiwan\u2014 completed the survey. It was sent to them through e-mail and social media over two weeks in November 2022. \"Coming out of the pandemic this year, it has been challenging for most of us, as we are now facing financial uncertainty. However, our survey has shown that for most singles in Singapore, price increases have not impacted much on their dating life,\" said Violet Lim, CEO and co-funder of Lunch Actually.

An interesting finding, Lunch Actually said, was that 50 per cent of singles surveyed still believe that the man needs to pay for dates. In comparison, 39 per cent of singles agreed to going Dutch. With the possibility of a financial winter coming, 52 per cent of singles said it is important to know their partner's financial situation once they get into a relationship. However, aside from having a financially stable partner, the survey showed that 49 per cent of respondents will still consider going on a second date if they get along well with the other party during the first date. Finally, some 39 per cent say the date's character matters more than their employment status. What's important in a partner What are the three most important characteristics that Singaporeans look for in a future partner or date? For men, it's age (71 per cent said so) followed by body type (59 per cent) and religion (36 per cent). For women, education level comes first (56 per cent), then income level (54 per cent), and age (51 per cent).

See our ethics statement.Image: NvidiaUmar Shakir is a news writer fond of the electric vehicle lifestyle and things that plug in via USB-C. He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.Nvidia\u2019s about to launch its new for-serious-work-only RTX 6000 graphics card, and it\u2019s going to be expensive. The new workstation card apparently showed up in retail listings on sites like ShopBLT and CompSource, according to VideoCardz, with prices coming in at a business expense-busting $7,378 to over $8,000.Announced in September, the RTX 6000 is powered by the same Ada Lovelace architecture as Nvidia\u2019s new RTX 40XX-series gaming offerings. We didn\u2019t get information about the 6000\u2019s pricing at that time, but competing top-end workstation cards like AMD\u2019s Radeon Pro W6800 with 32GB of VRAM can cost less than $4,000 in comparison. Even Apple\u2019s overpriced W6900X doesn\u2019t go over $6,000.To be fair, the new RTX 6000 has 48GB of GDDR6 ECC RAM, and based on specs published by Leadtek, it has over four times the single-precision performance at about 91.1 teraflops compared to 22.2 on the W6900X. So with that kind of arsenal, Solidworks users could potentially load all of the objects.That\u2019s the same amount of memory that Nvidia\u2019s current Ampere-based (and confusingly named) RTX A6000 has. The A6000 is less than $7,000 at some retailers, carrying a large premium compared to its gaming twin, the $1,000 RTX 3090. That gap is actually quite similar between both the $7,000-plus RTX 6000 and Nvidia\u2019s new hugely impressive RTX 4090 gaming GPU at $1,599.Although the RTX 4090 with 24GB of VRAM has half the amount of memory as the RTX 6000, they\u2019re almost on par with other specs, like memory bandwidth and both tensor and ray-tracing cores. Also, differentiating the products is tougher now since Nvidia decided not to use its workstation Quadro branding on the 6000.But most importantly for engineering firms, the RTX 6000 apparently requires less power with a max 300W compared to the 4090\u2019s gulping 450W draw to go along with its pricey ECC RAM. So upgrading will technically be easier for some workstations that aren\u2019t ready for that overhead. What won\u2019t be easier is actually affording to do it.See More: BusinessNewsNvidiaTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

(PHOTO: Getty)  \u00b7 Witthaya Prasongsin via Getty Images SINGAPORE \u2013 A 55-year-old man has been sentenced to 15 months' jail on Thursday (3 November) for facilitating a money laundering scheme. Leo Shiou Juanq, who was also fined S$5,000, had more than US$200,000 (S$284,000) channelled through two of his company's bank accounts, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) said in a statement.  In May 2018, an unidentified man named Max had, via text messages, offered Lee loans and a way to \"earn money without having to borrow from him\". Leo assisted Max to register a company, Oasis Mg Pte Ltd, and open two corporate bank accounts between August and September 2018. Then Leo gave full access to the accounts to Max by giving the bank tokens, ATM cards, and cheque books for the said accounts to an unidentified runner working for Max.

Between March and May 2019, criminal proceeds totalling US$204,901 were channelled through the accounts. \"The criminal proceeds originated from several victims, who had made the transfers believing that they were purchasing investment shares,\" the police added. Received police warning According to the police, Leo had reasonable grounds to believe that Max had engaged in criminal conduct, and that the relinquishment of his control over Oasis' bank accounts to Max would facilitate Max's control of his benefits from criminal conduct. \"In particular, Leo had received a warning from the Police in early 2019 to refrain from giving up control over his bank accounts to others, and was informed that he may be exposing himself to criminal liability if he continued to do so,\" the police said. \"He had also received multiple fund recall requests from banks regarding suspicious transactions using Oasis' bank accounts. Despite these circumstances, Leo continued to act on the instructions of Max, and did not choose to report the matter or close the accounts.\"  Leo was convicted of an offence under Section 44(1)(a) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Offences (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (\"CDSA\"), Chapter 65A, for being concerned in an arrangement to facilitate another person\u2019s control of benefits from criminal conduct, and an offence under Section 157(1) of the Companies Act, Chapter 50, for failing to exercise reasonable diligence as the director of a company.   Story continues \"To avoid being an accomplice to crimes, members of the public should reject requests from others to register companies and/or open bank accounts or receive money in their bank accounts as they will be held accountable if these are linked to criminal activities,\" the police said.

The increasing amount of data that needs to be stored, transmitted and analyzed only compounds the challenge.\nTo overcome this problem, NVIDIA has introduced a high performance computing platform that combines edge computing and AI to capture and consolidate streaming data from scientific edge instruments, and then allow the devices to talk to each other over long distances.\nThe platform consists of three major components. NVIDIA Holoscan is a software development kit that data scientists and domain experts can use to build GPU-accelerated pipelines for sensors that stream data. MetroX-3 is a new long-haul system that extends the connectivity of the NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand platform. And NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs provide secure and intelligent data migration.\nResearchers can use the new NVIDIA platform for HPC edge computing to\u00a0 securely communicate and collaborate on solving problems and bring their disparate devices and algorithms together to operate as one large supercomputer.\nHoloscan for HPC at the Edge\nAccelerated by GPU computing platforms \u2014 including NVIDIA IGX, HGX, DGX systems \u2014 NVIDIA Holoscan delivers the extreme performance required to process massive streams of data generated by the world\u2019s scientific instruments.\nNVIDIA Holoscan for HPC includes new APIs for C++ and Python that HPC researchers can use to build sensor data processing workflows that are flexible enough for non-image formats and scalable enough to translate raw data into real-time insights.\nHoloscan also manages memory allocation to ensure zero-copy data exchanges, so developers can focus on the workflow logic and not worry about managing file and memory I/O.\nThe new features in Holoscan will be available to all the HPC developers next month. Sign up to be notified of early access to Holoscan 0.4 SDK.\nMetroX-3 Goes the Distance\nThe NVIDIA MetroX-3 long-haul system, available next month, extends the latest cloud-native capabilities of the NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand platform from the edge to the HPC data center core. It enables GPUs between sites to securely share data over the InfiniBand network up to 25 miles (40km) away.\nTaking advantage of native remote direct memory access, users can easily migrate data and compute jobs from one InfiniBand-connected mini-cluster to the main data center, or combine geographically dispersed compute clusters for higher overall performance and scalability.\nData center operators can efficiently provision, monitor and operate across all the InfiniBand-connected data center networks by using the NVIDIA Unified Fabric Manager to manage their MetroX-3 systems.\nBlueField for Secure, Efficient HPC\nNVIDIA BlueField data processing units offload, accelerate and isolate advanced networking, storage and security services to boost performance and efficiency for modern HPC.\nDuring SC22, system software company Zettar is demonstrating its data migration and storage offload solution based on BlueField-3. Zettar software can consolidate data migration tasks to a data center footprint of 4U rack space, which today requires 13U with x86-based solutions.\nLearn more about the new NVIDIA platform for HPC computing at the edge.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | High-Performance Computing | NVIDIA BlueField | NVIDIA Quantum-2 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

Nvidia notes that \"about 50 cases globally\" have been reported thus far. Nvidia also suggested what may be causing the issues, telling readers that the connectors may not be fully plugged into the GPU, as seen in the image below. Image: NvidiaAn RTX 4090 owner has filed a class-action lawsuit against Nvidia over the company's controversial connector cable.As reported by Tom's Hardware, a lawsuit filed last week concerning the 12VHPWR 16-pin connector used for the company's current high-end graphics card, the GeForce RTX 4090. In the legal complaint, the plantiff purchased an RTX 4090 graphics card and noticed the connector cable began to melt shortly after the GPU was installed into the PC.Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition \u2013 Photos14 Images\"The cause of the melting appears to be a design flaw, relating to the high wattage flowing through each of the 16 pins,\" the legal complaint notes. \"If there is even a temporary break in the electrical connection for any of the pins, too high a current will flow through the remaining pins, causing a meltdown.\"Several other RTX 4090 owners have also expressed issues with the connector cable melting on websites like Reddit. Nvidia revealed it was still investigating reports. The suit calls for relief in the form of Nvidia paying damages to the plaintiff and all other RTX 4090 owners affected by the 16-pin cable connector melting.

ION Orchard now houses Christian Dior\u2019s first standalone facial boutique in Asia, Dior Prestige La Suite, and South Korean skincare brands The History of Whoo and Su:m37. Tan-Wijaya says Raffles City Shopping Centre\u2019s major revamp saw the opening of outlets from Sephora, new Anglo-French luxury fragrance house Creed and Australian beauty and wellness spa Rationale. French brands Guerlain and Givenchy Beauty will open their first standalone flagship boutiques in November.

Luxury giants Balenciaga and Gucci both launched collaborations with Adidas. Louis Vuitton\u2019s Nike Air Force 1 sneakers can sell for US$2,000 ($2825), while Dior\u2019s limited-edition Air Jordan 1 retailed at US$2,000 to US$2,200, adds Tan-Wijaya. Work-from-home during the pandemic has also created a trend towards more casual and comfortable work wear. Athleisure brands like Lululemon, Adidas and Nike have benefitted as more workers opt for sneakers and fashionable sportswear.    Sulian Tan-Wijaya: Street fashion becoming a cultural phenomenon with\u00a0luxury giants Balenciaga and Gucci both launching collaborations with Adidas (Photo: Savills Singapore) Adidas Brand Centre with its largest store in Singapore opened in January. The store occupies 18,000 sq ft across three floors at 270 Orchard Road. Puma opened their 7,100 sq ft flagship store at 313@somerset in July. Meanwhile, in September, Korean streetwear retailer MLB opened its new flagship 1,292 sq ft store at Mandarin Gallery. Japanese sneaker platform SNKRDUNK opened its flagship 1,370 sq ft store at Mandarin Gallery in mid-October.   Story continues \u201cThe pandemic also drew more people to the gym, resulting in a proliferation of new fitness and spinning studios all over Singapore,\u201d she adds. Fitness operators have aggressively grown their footprint by taking over retail and F&B spaces.  The new Adidas Brand Centre has an 18,000 sq ft store across three floors at 270 Orchard Road (Photo: Google Maps)\u201cWhen Singapore lifted their last Covid restrictions, we received a flood of enquiries from operators looking for new space for clubs, KTVs and live bands,\u201d says Tan-Wijaya. \u201cHowever, the spaces allowing such trades are few and far between.\u201d Some retail or coworking spaces have also been converted to other uses, such as e-sports, she adds.GR.iD, the repositioned POMO on Selegie Road, is a youth-themed, 92,000 sq ft mall. One of its anchors is Wave, a 16,000 sq ft family KTV and casual dining space which Tan-Wijaya had placed in the mall. GR.iD officially opened in February.Meanwhile, established brands like Zara are consolidating their store count in Singapore, having exited their Liat Towers and Ngee Ann City spaces. Apparel brand The Editor\u2019s Market took over Zara\u2019s Ngee Ann City space. Its 8,000 sq ft flagship includes a gourmet cafe and The Market Square to host events and workshops. Taking Zara\u2019s place at Liat Towers is homegrown furniture Castlery\u2019s flagship store, a street-front duplex of 24,000 sq ft. Tan-Wijaya was involved in the deal.  German sportswear maker Puma opened its largest outlet of 7,100 sq ft at 313@Somerset in July (Photo: Puma)She was also instrumental in bringing in the local retailer of European luxury furniture\u00a0Marquis, which took up 15,000 sq ft at Marina Square. Marquis QSquare opened last October.\u201cAs long as Singapore continues to attract tourists, the Central and Orchard area will continue to shine into 4Q2022 and 2023,\u201d says Tan-Wijaya. \u201cBadly hit during the pandemic, the buzz has returned to CBD while tourists throng Orchard Road in great numbers.\u201dHowever, she adds that this positive outlook is somewhat dampened by inflation and recession fears, \u201cwhich may force consumers to cut their discretionary spending\u201d.

Value of Covent Garden estate drops 2% as property market feels the heat      Rhiannon Curry   1 November 2022 2 min read            Capco owns a large amount of the Covent Garden estate (Covent Garden Ros\u00c3\u00a9 Festival 2021)   The value of prime properties around Covent Garden fell 2% in the last three months on the back of a \u201cvolatile macroeconomic environment\u201d, the area\u2019s major landlord has said. According to a trading statement from Capco, its Covent Garden holdings were worth almost \u00a31.8 billion at the end of September, 2% less than three months previously.  Values of commercial property are still languishing way below pre-pandemic levels, with Capco\u2019s Covent Garden portfolio value still 25% below what it was at the end of 2019. But the company said leasing in the area had held up well, with new brands including jewellers Mejuri and trainer brand Hoka recently moving in. Luxury watch brand Tudor and late night music venue Stereo are also set to open before Christmas, and clothing company Uniqlo has also agreed to open a new flagship store early next year. Ian Hawksworth, chief executive of Capco, said: \u201cTrading activity at Covent Garden remains resilient with strong leasing demand across all uses, and positive footfall and sales metrics. \u201cThe volatile macroeconomic environment is having an impact on asset valuations, however we are encouraged to continue to see rental growth in our portfolio.\u201d In total, 35 new leases and renewals were signed since June, securing \u00a33 million of income, 6.2% ahead of June\u2019s estimated rental value (ERV), suggesting that companies are still willing to pay a premium to be in one of London\u2019s most famous shopping districts.  It was a similar story at neighbouring landlord Shaftesbury, which reported a 3.6% decline in the value of its portfolio since the end of March. It suggested that the \u201cimpact on investment market sentiment of globally-rising finance rates and the deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook\u201d had affected property prices. But it too said businesses in the area were enjoying good trading conditions. Shaftesbury CEO Brian Bickell said: \u201cThe West End has enjoyed its first summer of trading unaffected by Covid restrictions since 2019, with strong domestic footfall and a rebound in international visitor numbers, which have continued into the first weeks of autumn.\u201d In June, Capco agreed to merge with Shaftesbury, creating a company with a central London property portfolio worth more than \u00a35 billion. But the latest figures show that the value of Capco\u2019s stake in Shaftesbury has plunged in recent months because of a drop in the price of Shaftesbury\u2019s shares, and is now valued at \u00a3357 million, compared to \u00a3506 million at the end of June. The proposed merger is expected to become effective during the first quarter of 2023, subject to clearance by the Competition and Markets Authority. The new company will be called Shaftesbury Capital, and will own swaths of London\u2019s West End, including Covent Garden, Carnaby Street, Chinatown and Soho.

Currently, and until March next year, Chinese businesses can still acquire A100 GPUs via official channels, but new US sanctions come into play before April, meaning that NVIDIA\u2019s most powerful enterprise GPUs can no longer be exported to the country. The answer, it seems, is a slightly modified version of the A100, dubbed the A800 GPU.\n\n\nThe US Government is pressing forward with these tech sanctions, as it reckons slowing the supply of leading edge electronics to China will help keep it in the rearview mirror with regard to military capabilities. Superfast GPUs aren\u2019t only useful for benign tasks like weather modeling, or finding wonder-drugs for terrible diseases, they can also be purposed for deadly advantage\u2014hypersonic missiles, AI-attack drones, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is interesting to see how NVIDIA has sidestepped (we won\u2019t say evaded) the US government\u2019s China sanctions. The NVIDIA Ampere A100 had a quoted interconnect speed of 600 GB/s, however the new A800 is said to have had this speed reduced to 400 GB/s. According to various reports on the matter, other key specs of the A100 / A800 remain the same or virtually unchanged. Importantly, the 600 GB/s interconnect speed is the specified performance threshold in the US regulations about tech export controls,\u00a0thus the A100 spec is beyond what is permitted. Has NVIDIA left a sizable gap here, so it can sell refreshed 500 GB/s GPUs to the Chinese next year? We don\u2019t know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders might ponder whether NVIDIA\u2019s customers in China will be able to \u2018overclock\u2019 the A800 to achieve similar to the same performance as an A100. According to an NVIDIA spokesperson, such tinkering won\u2019t be possible; the new GPU\u2019s performance is below the US regulatory threshold, \u201cand cannot be programmed to exceed it.\u201d It sounds like NVIDIA has put in some kind of \u2018LHR-like\u2019 lock, but seems confident a nation state can\u2019t hack it.\n\n\r\n\u201cThe A800 looks to be a repackaged A100 GPU designed to avoid the recent Commerce Department trade restrictions,\u201d said Wayne Lam, an analyst at CCS Insight, who based his statement on the A800 specs revealed by Reuters. Lam also commented that the A800 could be important to NVIDIA, which gets a sizable proportion of its revenue from China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, GPU, China, Sanctions, trade, (nasdaq:nvda), us-government, ampere-a100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing...\nBeep-Beep!

Interest      ValueChampion Editorial Team   11 November 2022 7 min read            Trust Bank and Other Savings Accounts With At Least 2.5% p.a. Interest   A collaboration between Standard Chartered Bank and NTUC FairPrice, Trust Bank is a newly launched bank that offers a savings account, debit card, credit card and personal accident insurance. Its main selling point is centred on helping consumers save, either via partner discounts, zero-fee card services, or high-interest savings accounts. Here\u2019s a closer look at what Trust Bank has to offer. What is Trust Bank All About? Trust Bank, in a nutshell, offers a savings account, payment services and insurance. Deposits are secured by SDIC for up to S$75,000, and account-holders can earn up to 2.5% p.a. interest on savings deposits. As an added plus, it charges no card fees, account fees, or foreign transaction fees. NTUC Union members get up to 21% savings with NTUC Link Credit Card, and 11% savings with NTUC Link Debit Card (with minimum monthly spend of S$350). Meanwhile, non-NTUC Union members get up to 15% savings with Trust Link Credit Card, and 5% savings with Trust Link Debit Card (with minimum monthly spend of S$450). (Link Card and Trust Link card savings applicable to FairPrice Group businesses only, and come in the form of Linkpoints.) Key Features of Trust Bank 1. Digital-Only Banking Platform   Digital Bank   Trust Bank is an online-only entity, which means you won\u2019t find any physical outlets or branches around. Everything is done completely online, via the Trust Bank mobile app. While some may find the idea of a completely-online bank to be anxiety-inducing (for instance, if something goes wrong, there\u2019s no way for you to speak face-to-face with someone from the bank and work out a solution together), others might appreciate it for its fuss-free convenience and efficiency. 2. Earn Up To 2.5% p.a. On Your Savings   interest rates   Trust Bank\u2019s savings account offers up to 2.5% p.a. interest on the first S$75,000 of your deposits. This would have inspired more than a few double-takes, but in today\u2019s climate of interest rate hikes and looming credit crunch, it is unfortunately washed out by the bigger numbers larger and more established banks are waving around. Nevertheless, with a base interest rate clocking in at a competitive 1.5% p.a., parking your spare funds in a Trust Bank savings account may not be a bad idea for certain savers. 3. Zero-Fee Card Services   card payment   Another differentiator of Trust Bank\u2019s is its zero-fee card offerings. The bank offers both debit and credit cards, which help you save on your expenses in different ways. Specifically, its Trust Link Credit Card comes with no annual fee, no foreign exchange fee (not even those charged by payment networks such as Visa), no cash advance fee and no care replacement fee.   Story continues There are also no ATM withdrawal fees and no overlimit fees, making Trust Bank\u2019s credit card one of the lowest-cost options for cardholders.How Does Trust Bank Measure Up Against Other Popular Savings Accounts?As one of two digital-only banks in Singapore (the other being GXS Bank, a collaboration between Grab and Singtel), Trust Bank promises to bring a new dimension to the banking sector.Yet, how does it stack up against other traditional banks?Savings Accounts Comparison \u2013 Trust Bank vs OCBC, DBS and SCBSavings account Interest offered (per annum)  Savings Account by TrustUp to 2.5% p.a. on first S$75,000Base: 1.5% p.a. NTUC Union member: 1% p.a. 5 card transactions per month: 0.5% p.a.  OCBC 360 AccountUp to 7.65% p.a. Credit salary, save and spend: 4.65% p.a. Invest and insure: 3% p.a.

Min. monthly spend of S$2,000: 1.61% p.a. Min. salary crediting of S$3,000: 1.2% p.a. Min. 3 GIRO bill payments online: 0.07% p.a.  The table above shows a quick comparison between Trust Bank and three other established players \u2013 OCBC, DBS and SCB.Read Also: Average Effective Interest Rate for Savings AccountsYou will notice that out of all these four banks Trust Bank offers the lowest maximum savings interest account, capping out at 2.5% p.a. Meanwhile, OCBC, DBS and SCB all offer maximum savings account interest of over 4% p.a. (and in OCBC\u2019s case, up to 7.65% p.a.).While these higher ceilings appear attractive, reaching them requires several conditions to be fulfilled. If your circumstances or preferences simply do not match with them, you won\u2019t be able to enjoy the high interest rates.Just to illustrate, reaching the cap of 4.1% p.a. in the DBS Multiplier Account requires at least S$30,000 worth of eligible banking transactions (salary crediting, investments, home loan, investments, etc) per month.Viewed in this context, you may find it easier to max out your savings account interest with Trust Bank. You\u2019ll earn 1.5% p.a. by default, and another 1% if you hold an NTUC Union membership \u2013 both of these don\u2019t require any active action on your part.If you do not have an NTUC membership, you will only earn the base rate of 1.5% p.a.. You can, however, earn an additional 0.5% p.a. interest (for a total of 2% p.a.) by making at least five eligible card transactions each month.Who Should Apply For a Trust Bank Savings Account  grocery shopping  The Trust Bank savings account makes a natural fit for those who are NTUC Union members.These consumers will enjoy a bonus 1% p.a. interest on their savings deposits, earning the maximum rate of 2.5% p.a. by default.Additionally, they can also earn Linkpoints for groceries and food at any FairPrice Group outlet (FairPrice supermarkets, Unity pharmacy, Kopitiam, Foodfare, Cheers, etc) when they spend on their Trust creditor debit cards.These Linkpoints can be redeemed for cash rebates towards future purchases, offering up to 21% savings.Non-members may also find the Trust Bank savings account to be a good option for a relatively fuss-free way to earn a respectable 1.5% p.a. on their savings. This increases to 2% p.a. with at least five card transactions each month.Further strengthening its appeal, the Trust Bank savings account comes with no minimum deposit required. Neither are there any fall-below fees or account fees.What Fees and Charges Are There?Trust Bank does away with most fees commonly charged by other banks, but that doesn't mean there aren\u2019t any. Take note of the following fees and charges, and refer to this fact sheet for more details.Late payment charges: S$100 Card replacement fee: S$50 (waived until further notice) How to Apply For a Trust Bank Savings Account?You can apply for a Trust Bank account by downloading the Trust mobile app. Follow the onscreen instructions to open your savings account.Alternatively, go to the Trust Bank savings account page, click on \u201cOpen account\u201d, and scan the QR code with your smartphone to download the Trust Bank app.We\u2019ve identified the best bank savings accounts in Singapore, and explain how they work in simple terms.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

OCBC Bank has opened its second-largest branch at Wisma Atria, a 20,000 sq ft lifestyle and banking space featuring six retail and F&B partners. Since the branch\u2019s soft launch in August, OCBC says monthly applications for credit cards at Wisma Atria have been five times higher than that of an average branch. The value of monthly personal loans disbursed at the branch, too, has been 1.5 times higher.  According to OCBC, monthly wealth income from the Wisma branch is 30% higher than the monthly wealth income from its former Orchard Gateway branch, a 10,000 sq ft space that closed in August. The bank\u2019s relationship managers can meet with personal banking customers across five open pods and seven enclosed rooms. The new branch also boasts nine meeting rooms for its premier banking clients.    A third of the branch\u2019s floor area is dedicated to retail, featuring homeware from SCENE SHANG, lifestyle products from Crane Living and over 5,000 titles by Malaysian bookstore chain BookXcess. The Wisma Atria branch also features Orange Mocha Caf\u00e9, artworks by Art Porters Gallery and Sushi Moka, a 10-seater omakase restaurant.    The branch is open daily; banking services will be available from 11am to 7pm, while the retailers will operate for two additional hours in the evenings. OCBC cardholders enjoy 10% off retail purchases and 8% off art pieces. According to OCBC, about 20% of the Wisma Atria branch\u2019s walk-in customers are foreigners. \u201cOrchard Road is still one of the \u2018must go\u2019 places for locals and our overseas visitors,\u201d says OCBC Group CEO Helen Wong at the launch on Nov 25. \u201cOCBC Wisma Atria is a part of the group\u2019s strategy to capture the rising Asian wealth, through our twin hubs of Singapore and Hong Kong. This space, therefore, is key to attracting new customers, Singaporeans and foreign customers alike.\u201d  OCBC Bank has another branch along the underpass between ION Orchard and Wisma Atria. With high footfall there, the bank has no plans to close that branch. Instead, it could also serve to direct curious customers to the new Wisma Atria branch upstairs, says Sunny Quek, head of global consumer financial services at OCBC Bank.    OCBC Bank currently has 31 branches across the island, along with four FRANK branches in campuses. This year, the bank refreshed three branches with lifestyle concepts, located in Ang Mo Kio Central, Jurong Point and Tampines. Quek says: \u201cEven as we bolster our digital capabilities, branches remain an important touchpoint for many customers. When it comes to complex and deeper financial advisory conversations, they still prefer the intimacy, clarity and trust that face-to-face conversations with a qualified financial consultant provide. In fact, we expect footfall to increase in a branch like Wisma, because we give customers more reasons to come.\u201d   Story continues He adds: \u201cWhile the physical branch evolves, it should not be seen as an independent touchpoint siloed from the rest like our OCBC Digital app, or ATMs. We continue to pour resources into data analytics and management to ensure seamlessness across all our channels, with the goal that any customer can use the various touchpoints interchangeably without having to repeat their requests or needs.\u201dSee Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore Recessionary risks still abound in increasingly 'two-sided economy': Analysts Following 3QFY2022 results, analysts divided on OCBC's net interest margin outlook OCBC reports record quarterly earnings of $1.6 billion, up 31% y-o-y Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeWeeks after Nvidia announced that it was investigating reports that the power cables for its RTX 4090 graphics card were melting and burning, the company says it may know why: they just weren\u2019t plugged in all the way.In a post to its customer support forum on Friday, Nvidia says that it\u2019s still investigating the reports, but that its findings \u201csuggest\u201d an insecure connector has been a common issue. It also says that it\u2019s gotten around 50 reports of the issue.Nvidia\u2019s flagship card uses what\u2019s known as a 12VHPWR power connector, a new standard that isn\u2019t natively supported by most of the power supplies that people already have in their PCs. Because of that, it ships an adapter \u2014 or \u201cpower dongle,\u201d as Friday\u2019s post calls it \u2014 in the box. Users\u2019 initial reports blamed the adapter, with some saying that the melting cable had damaged their $1,599 GPU as well.It could be easy to read the company\u2019s findings as shoving blame onto the users. Sure, Nvidia doesn\u2019t come right out and say that it\u2019s user error, but it\u2019s heavily implied in the post. It also seems like a very convenient explanation, since people have been speculating for almost a month that the issue is caused by something more complex, like bad soldering or wires too small to reliably handle the massive amounts of power pumped through.That\u2019s a significant amount of connector that would be out of the socket. Image: GamersNexusHowever, GamersNexus, an outlet that\u2019s respected in the PC-building community for its rigorous testing, basically came to the same conclusion earlier this week. A video posted on Wednesday by the outlet, which inspected damaged adapters sent in by viewers and done extensive testing and reporting on the issue, showed that the connectors had wear lines, implying that they hadn\u2019t been completely inserted into the slot. GamersNexus even says that some people seem to have missed a full connection by several millimeters. Its video shows that a loose connection could cause the plug to heat up dramatically, if it were plugged in poorly and tilted at an angle.Nvidia\u2019s post includes a picture of what the connector looks like when it\u2019s not fully plugged in, and it seems much easier to miss than something that\u2019s out by a full 2mm and being held at an angle (potentially because of the cables being pulled back too tightly during installation). It\u2019d be even easier to miss with a third-party RTX 4090 card instead of the Nvidia version shown in the images below.If you\u2019ve got one of these cards in your computer, you should probably double-check yours looks like the bottom one.Nvidia says you should make sure the cable is fully plugged in before booting your computer. Image: NvidiaIt\u2019s worth noting though, that Nvidia may not be completely blameless here. Another thing that jumps out about the picture it posted is that the connector has a locking key. In theory, that\u2019s a feature that would prevent this sort of thing from happening, as long as it gives good feedback when you plug it in. According to GamersNexus, however, the adapters don\u2019t really audibly click into place, even when fully inserted.That aside, the testing done by Nvidia and GamersNexus doesn\u2019t seem to point to manufacturing defects as the main culprit (the outlet\u2019s video on Wednesday did say that debris left during manufacturing may have been an aggrevating factor). Either way, though, an unnamed spokesperson for the company told GamersNexus on Friday that \u201cany issues with the burned cable or GPU, regardless of cable or GPU, it will be processed\u201d for a replacement.See More: EntertainmentGamingNewsNvidiaPC GamingTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

A subsidiary of the Catalist-listed VCPlus Limited has received in-principle approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to provide custodial services for capital market products, including tokenised securities.  In a Nov 18 press release, the subsidiary, Custody Plus, announced its successful application for a capital markets services licence. VCPlus Limited, formerly\u00a0Anchor Resources,\u00a0is a financial technology company listed in Singapore. Its fintech business offers consultancy services related to financial and blockchain technology and fintech regulation and licensing. The company secured shareholders\u2019 approval in April 2021 to diversify into the new business of custodian for digital assets and consultancy in the financial and blockchain technology sector. Coupled with the completion of the company\u2019s disposal of its only gold mining asset in May, the Group\u2019s business going forward comprises solely the new business, says VCPlus. Clarence Chong, CEO of VCPlus, says: \u201cIt is an honour to receive MAS\u2019s in-principle approval to provide custodial services in Singapore. This is a major step towards VCPlus\u2019 vision to be a leading player in the growing digital assets ecosystem\u201d. He adds: \u201cWe firmly believe that the transparent regulatory framework in Singapore is critical to the progressive and sustainable development of Singapore as a digital assets hub, instilling greater confidence and trust in the market. As a listed company in Singapore, it will provide additional assurance to our customers to custodise their digital assets with us.\u201d  According to the company, tokenisation of global illiquid assets is estimated to be a US$16 trillion ($21.99 trillion) business opportunity by 2030 and the growth in tokenised assets is expected in real estate, equities, bonds and investment funds, as well as less traditional assets such as car fleets and patents. Riding on the growth of digital assets, Custody Plus is committed to protecting investor interests by offering custodial services as an independent oversight and safekeeping of investor assets with robust compliance standards, says the company. \u201cWe will be working closely with other stakeholders to build an innovative and responsible digital asset ecosystem in Singapore and globally.\u201d Last month, VCPlus announced an expansion of its\u00a0consultancy services to Indonesia. VCPlus signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with two cooperative agencies in Indonesia and Indonesian business partner PT Alpha Millennia Indonesia to provide the Koperasi and their over 2,300 members with access to a suite of technology solutions for their operations.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Warren Buffett's Stock Portfolio and 5 Newest Investments in 2022.\u00a0 Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway acquiring a $4.1 billion stake in chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) during the third quarter of 2022 has made headlines since the latest securities filings were disclosed. Wall Street is taking Buffett\u2019s new stock investment as an indication that the semiconductor stocks might be due for a rebound soon.\u00a0   On November 15, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) shares climbed more than 12% to $81.62 in mid-day trading as Buffett disclosed his stake, while other chip makers also rose, including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL). These firms are also TSMC\u2019s customers. In recent years, Warren Buffett has been willing to invest in technology, with the Berkshire portfolio featuring notable stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ). Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones, noted that tech and communications businesses now represent approximately half of Berkshire\u2019s portfolio, which he said provides a good balance as the firm\u2019s \u201cportfolio companies are more old economy\u201d. Our Methodology\u00a0 We selected the 10 stocks which were either new additions to the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, or where the fund increased its holdings during the end of the third quarter of 2022, for this analysis. Two of these ten stocks were added to the Berkshire holdings in the last two years. The stocks are arranged according to the hedge fund\u2019s stake value in each holding. Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities.\u00a0   Warren Buffett's Stock Portfolio and 10 Newest Investments in 2022   Warren Buffett's Stock Portfolio and Newest Investments in 2022 10. Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33 Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Stake Value: $12,790,000 Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) is a New York-based company that engages in investment banking, capital markets, and asset management businesses in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The company operates through Investment Banking and Capital Markets, Asset Management, Merchant Banking, and Corporate segments. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway added Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) to its Q3 2022 portfolio by purchasing 433,558 shares worth $12.8 million.\u00a0   Story Continues   On September 28, Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) declared a $0.30 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on November 29, to shareholders of record on November 14. Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF)\u2019s dividend yield on November 18 came in at 3.22%.\u00a0 Keefe Bruyette analyst Michael Brown on September 5 upgraded Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $38, up from $30. The analyst said Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) is an attractive way to play an investment banking recovery \"with idiosyncratic catalysts and limited downside.\"\u00a0   According to Insider Monkey\u2019s data, 33 hedge funds were bullish on Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 29 funds in the prior quarter. Robert Rodriguez and Steven Romick\u2019s First Pacific Advisors is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 5.7 million shares worth $169.5 million.\u00a0 Like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) is also backed by Warren Buffett.\u00a0 Here is what GoodHaven Capital Management specifically said about Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter: \u201cJefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) was our next biggest dollar detractor, and had also been a strong contributor in prior periods. As we have previously mentioned, while Jefferies has become a better business it is still a cyclical business, and that some moderating earnings after the recent boom were to be expected. In the first six months of their fiscal 2022, Jefferies earned a ROATE (Return on Adjusted Tangible Equity) of over 11%, reasonable given the very material slowdown in the capital markets lately. They also repurchased over $620 million of their shares at $34+ per share and Jefferies\u2019 stock now trades below tangible book value/share. Given the obvious slowdown in capital raising transactions industry wide, we expect continued muted results in the near-term but also continued share buybacks. Our long-term enthusiasm remains, as does our view of the material upside for the shares from recent levels.\u201d  9. Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28 Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Stake Value: $296,692,000 Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) is an American company that manufactures and markets building products primarily for use in new home construction, repair and remodeling, and outdoor structure markets. Warren Buffett added Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) to his Q3 portfolio by purchasing 5.8 million shares worth about $297 million, representing 0.10% of the total holdings.\u00a0 On October 28, Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) declared a $0.22 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 1, to shareholders of record on November 9. Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX)\u2019s dividend yield on November 18 came in at 1.44%.\u00a0   BofA analyst George Staphos on September 20 downgraded Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) to Underperform from Neutral, trimming the price target to $56 from $64. The analyst lowered operating rate and pricing forecasts across primary wood products to reflect BofA's housing and building product views. He believes Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) shares will have a hard time outperforming given a tough macro and a \"looming recession.\" According to Insider Monkey\u2019s data, 28 hedge funds were bullish on Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) at the end of September 2022, with collective stakes worth $514.2 million, compared to 28 funds in the prior quarter worth $213.3 million. Jim Simons\u2019 Renaissance Technologies is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 953,400 shares worth $48.80 million.\u00a0 Here is what L1 Capital International specifically said about Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) in its Q2 2022 investor letter: \u201cWe have invested in Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) due to its Smartside siding business. Smartside has consistently increased its share of the siding market in the U.S., not just new residential construction but repair and renovation, shed and other markets. Louisiana Pacific has not been able to keep up with demand for Smartside and is sold out to the end of 2022. New capacity is being added currently which will support future growth.  8. RH (NYSE:RH) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48 Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Stake Value: $580,724,000 RH (NYSE:RH) is a California-based retailer of home furnishings, providing furniture, lighting, textiles, bathware, and home decor. In Q3 2022, Warren Buffett strengthened his hold on RH (NYSE:RH) by 9%. The hedge fund had 2.36 million shares of RH (NYSE:RH) worth $580.7 million at the end of September, representing 0.19% of the total 13F securities. Buffett has held a position in RH (NYSE:RH) since the third quarter of 2019.\u00a0   On November 18, Wedbush analyst Seth Basham downgraded RH (NYSE:RH) to Neutral from Outperform but trimmed the price target to $270 from $274. RH (NYSE:RH) has been successful in safeguarding its brand without discounting, but this has contributed to higher market share losses, the analyst wrote in a research note. He sees increasing evidence of a course-correction to its strategy of \"climbing the luxury mountain.\" The analyst, however, \"surprisingly found\" that RH (NYSE:RH) slashed prices by 2%-9% since March on half of the products. This \"potential course-correction\" in the company's strategy and the worsening macro outlook led to the downgrade.\u00a0 Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 48 funds were long RH (NYSE:RH) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 59 funds in the earlier quarter. Stephen Mandel\u2019s Lone Pine Capital held a notable stake in the company, comprising 1.7 million shares worth $436.2 million.\u00a0 Here is what GreenWood Investors specifically said about RH (NYSE:RH) in its Q2 2022 investor letter: \u201cGary Friedman, the owner manager of RH (NYSE:RH), has been talking about the company climbing the luxury mountain over the past few years. Wall Street is skeptical RH can hold its leading margin profile after elevated demand during Covid, and it surely doubts that it is a luxury company, at 10x earnings. We\u2019ve been looking to get involved in the housing ecosystem given the dramatic selloff in the sector over the past year, and our first investment here is via RH. Demographically, we expect US household formation to remain very strong after a decade of underinvestment in housing supply. Gary strategically with-held new product launches in the aftermath of Covid, when times were easiest, and is now releasing a new premium product lineup. We believe there is a lot of latent pricing power in home furnishing, and while high interest rates are trapping people in a home they would otherwise possibly leave, we believe the consumer, particularly the high-end consumer, will look to continue to upgrade their homes.  7. Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42 Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Stake Value: $834,901,000 Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) is a Michigan-based digital financial services company that provides its products and services to consumer, commercial, and corporate customers in the United States and Canada. The company operates through four segments \u2013 Automotive Finance Operations, Insurance Operations, Mortgage Finance Operations, and Corporate Finance Operations.\u00a0 Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) is one of the newest investments in the Berkshire portfolio. The hedge fund added Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) to its portfolio in the first quarter of 2022, and as of Q3 2022, Berkshire had 30 million shares of the company worth $835 million, representing 0.28% of the total holdings.\u00a0   On October 26, Compass Point analyst Giuliano Bologna downgraded Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $27, down from $50, following Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY)\u2019s Q3 earnings miss and issuance of a \"significantly weaker\" guidance for earnings through FY23.\u00a0 According to Insider Monkey\u2019s data, 42 hedge funds were bullish on Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) at the end of September 2022, and Harris Associates held a significant stake, comprising 26.7 million shares worth $745.7 million.\u00a0 Here is what Moon Capital Management specifically said about Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) in its Q3 2022 investor letter: \u201cWe recently purchased shares of Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY), the world\u2019s largest digital-only bank. Ally\u2019s legacy dates back more than 100 years when it was originally launched as GMAC, the in-house financing arm of General Motors. The company was spun out from GM and rebranded as Ally more than a decade ago, but has retained an automotive focus on the lending side, where it holds the largest position in prime auto lending.  6. Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36 Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Stake Value: $877,219,000 Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) is a Texas-based technology and specialty materials company that manufactures and sells high performance engineered polymers in the United States and internationally. The company operates through three segments \u2013 Engineered Materials, Acetate Tow, and Acetyl Chain.

He said that an EPS of $13 to $14 is achievable in 2023.

Thomas E. Claugus\u2019 GMT Capital held a significant stake in the company, comprising 1.3 million shares valued at $116.6 million.\u00a0 In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ),\u00a0 Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) is one of the top picks of Warren Buffett.\u00a0 Here is what Vltava Fund has to say about Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) in its Q1 2022 investor letter: \u201cWe then used the money freed up to, among other things, open three new positions. The stock price declines during the Russian invasion brought a lot of good prices to the market. Out of all the possibilities we considered, we picked the stocks of Celanese (CE).

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Harvard University Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Picks.\u00a0 Harvard Management Company was established in 1974 and manages Harvard University's endowment and financial assets. Over the years, the market-beating performance of Harvard Management Company has contributed billions of dollars to Harvard University. The value of Harvard University\u2019s endowment declined by $2.3 billion in 2022, after Harvard Management Company posted a 1.8% loss on its investments. This marks the first year of negative returns since 2016. This is a distinct contrast to the record-high 33.6% returns that Harvard Management Company reported last year.  Harvard Management Company\u2019s loss is primarily attributed to skyrocketing inflation and high interest rates, which have created havoc in the global financial markets. The endowment underperformed due to \u201cthe poor performance of global equity markets\u201d, noted HMC CEO N.P. Narvekar. Overall, the performance of the Harvard University stock portfolio was satisfying relative to the global equity markets. The portfolio was previously managed by Jane Mendillo, and she served as the president and chief executive officer of the endowment before departing from her position in 2014, after 21 years with HMC. She is an American investor, endowment fund manager, and philanthropist.\u00a0 The endowment contributed $2.1 billion towards the university\u2019s operational budget for the fiscal year 2022, accounting for 36% of the annual revenue. Harvard concluded the fiscal year with a budget surplus of $406 million. Harvard Management Company has delivered upbeat returns historically, which makes it a good idea to follow its investment strategy. Some of the best stocks in the Harvard University stock portfolio include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM).\u00a0    benjamin-rascoe-RxIIEFEvybo-unsplash  Our Methodology\u00a0 We used Harvard Management Company\u2019s stock portfolio for the second quarter of 2022 for this analysis.

Mobileye, which was spun off from Intel (INTC 0.78%) earlier this year, is the world's leading producer of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and computer vision chips for semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles.\nNvidia is the world's largest producer of discrete GPUs for gaming PCs and data centers. It also generates a small percentage of its revenue (4% in its latest quarter) from automotive chips for connected and driverless cars. It also sells GPUs for the professional visualization market. So which of these stocks is the better overall investment in this challenging market?\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nMobileye: A focused play on smarter cars\nMobileye controls about 70% of the ADAS market. These systems use sensors and cameras to detect parking hazards, keep a vehicle centered in a single lane, and automate other tasks to make driving a lot easier and safer. They also serve as the technological bedrock of driverless vehicles.\nMobileye's systems run on its own EyeQ computer vision chips. Its newest chip, the EyeQ5, entered mass production last year and is designed for Level 4 (nearly autonomous) and Level 5 (fully autonomous) cars. It outsources the production of these chips to the Dutch chipmaker STMicroelectronics (STM 1.46%).\n\nMobileye's revenue fell 10% in 2020 as the pandemic disrupted the auto market. But in 2021 its revenue jumped 43% as those headwinds waned and automakers ramped up production. In the first half of 2022, the company's revenue rose 21% year over year as it lapped that post-pandemic recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe market's demand is still outstripping its available supply of chips, but supply chain constraints at STMicroelectronics are preventing it from fulfilling those orders.\nMobileye's growth could stabilize once those supply chain issues are resolved. It still expects its ADAS solutions to be installed in \"more than an additional 266 million vehicles by 2030,\" while analysts expect its revenue to increase 29% this year and another 21% in 2023.\nThat rosy outlook makes Mobileye a promising play on the driverless market, but it's still unprofitable on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis. On a non-GAAP basis, its net income surged 467% in 2020 and another 64% in 2021, but only rose 2% year over year in the first half of 2022 as the company increased spending (especially on building up inventories of its EyeQ chips from STMicro) to overcome supply chain constraints.\nNvidia: Still heavily exposed to two wobbly markets\nNvidia controlled 80% of the discrete GPU market in the second quarter of 2022, according to JPR. In its latest quarter, it generated a combined 91% of its revenue from the gaming and data center markets.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's heavy exposure to those two markets paid off during the pandemic as consumers upgraded their PCs to play new video games, work from home, and attend remote classes. The soaring usage of cloud-based services also prompted data centers to buy its high-end GPUs to process AI tasks more efficiently. That growth was amplified by rising cryptocurrency prices, which drove more people to mine cryptocurrencies with Nvidia's gaming and dedicated mining GPUs.\n\nNvidia's revenue and non-GAAP EPS surged 53% and 73%, respectively, in fiscal 2021 (which ended in January 2021). In fiscal 2022, its revenue rose 61% as its non-GAAP EPS increased another 78%.\nBut those tailwinds dissipated over the past year. PC sales withered, macro headwinds caused enterprise customers to postpone big cloud deals, and plummeting crypto prices prompted miners to flood the market with second-hand GPUs. The Biden administration also recently barred Nvidia from shipping its top-tier data center chips to China, which was already a soft spot due to China's pandemic lockdowns and video game playtime restrictions for minors.\nAs a result, Nvidia's revenue grew a mere 9% year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 as its non-GAAP EPS tumbled 21%. Analysts expect its revenue to flatline for the full year and only rise 9% in fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is growing a lot slower than Mobileye, and its gaming and data center markets could remain wobbly for the foreseeable future. However, Nvidia is also firmly profitable on a GAAP basis -- which might make it a sturdier investment if interest rates keep rising.\nThe valuations and verdict\nNeither of these stocks is a screaming bargain yet. Mobileye trades at 47 times forward earnings and 11 times next year's sales, while Nvidia trades at 37 times forward earnings and 14 times next year's sales.\nBut if I had to choose one over the other right now, I'd pick Mobileye because it's growing faster, it's mainly struggling with near-term supply chain issues instead of softening demand across its core markets like Nvidia, and it's more tightly focused on a single growing market.\nNvidia's still a solid long-term investment, but it deserves to trade at a lower valuation.\n\n\n\nLeo Sun has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Intel and Nvidia. The Motley Fool recommends the following options: long January 2023 $57.50 calls on Intel, long January 2025 $45 calls on Intel, and short January 2025 $45 puts on Intel.

If you want to skip our detailed introduction of the ESG investing dynamics and challenges in the industry, you can go directly to read Top 5 ESG Companies in 2022.\u00a0 Over the past few years the concept of ESG has evolved dramatically. Environmental, Social, and Governance principles no longer belong to the vague realm of fancy words but rather play a key role in investing circles. Environmentally-conscious investors and activist hedge funds now pay serious attention to ESG metrics of companies before making investment decisions. Data from Bloomberg Intelligence shows that global ESG assets are expected to surpass a whopping $50 trillion by 2025.  Regulatory pressure from governments around the world is also causing the companies to take ESG seriously. The Securities and Exchange Commission is working to develop a common benchmark on how sustainable products are assessed and reported. However, as outlined in a whitepaper titled \u201cESG Portfolio Monitoring \u2013 A Best Practice for All Sides\u201d in detail, this pressure is resulting in a backlash from several circles.\u00a0 Many fund managers believe these ESG regulations sometimes tend to be too harsh, and can affect their ability to perform to ensure maximum returns for their clients. A Key Challenge in ESG Investing It\u2019s also becoming increasingly difficult for average investors as well as fund managers and asset owners to assess ESG risks of companies they want to invest in. Apparently, ESG rating agencies solve this problem. They evaluate companies and provide ESG risk scores and ratings based on their analysis. However, these ratings could further confuse the investor. This is the problem highlighted in the whitepaper we referred to above, authored by Steve Glass, the co-CEO of Abel Noser Holdings, a New York-based firm that provides Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) and trade surveillance for investment managers and consultants.  The whitepaper argues that because of the lack of standardization and benchmarking in the industry, each ESG ratings agency uses different data sources, methodologies and processes to assess a company. This results in huge variance and subjectivity in ESG scores. The whitepaper recommends using machine learning and AI to resolve this problem. The paper mentions an interesting example of OWL ESG, a California-based ESG analysis company that uses machine learning to process millions of data points from a plethora of sources to come up with consensus ESG ratings. These consensus ratings minimize divergence and discrepancies in ESG ratings.

Where to Buy?\nImage via Unsplash\n\nThe RTX 4090 was introduced by Nvidia in October with a suggested retail price of $1,499. According to The Register, the high-end GPU debuted the new 12VHPWR power connector, which features a 12-volt high-power to maintain sufficient energy levels due to the 450 watts needed for typical power usage and 600 watts for overclocking. Four additional \"sensing\" pins track the card's wattage while the remaining 12 pins of the cable power the card.Since the GeForce RTX 4090 was released, Nvidia has received several complaints regarding the 12VHPWR connector, which is designed to provide sufficient power and is included free of charge with the unit.Read Also\u00a0:\nNvidia RTX 4090 Capabilities: Can It Run 'Genshin Impact' at 13K Resolution?Nvidia Gives Insight Into Melting Power Cable IssueAccording to a recent statement by Nvidia, their findings suggest that the reason for the melting power cords may be due to this issue.\"Our findings to date suggest that a common issue is that connectors are not fully plugged into the graphics card,\" Nvidia stated. \"To help ensure the connector is secure we recommend plugging the power dongle into the graphics card first to ensure it's firmly and evenly plugged in, before plugging the graphics card into the motherboard.\"Nvidia, however, stated that it is still looking into the complaints but that its current findings point to the loose connector as the most common problem to the melting power cables.Nvidia Lawsuit Over Melting Power CablesAccording to Tom's Hardware, Nvidia customer Lucas Genova filed a class action lawsuit against Nvidia regarding his complaint on the meltdown of the 16-pin power adaptor. According to the complaint, Genova is suing Nvidia for unjust enrichment, breach of warranty, fraud, and violations of New York's General Business Law.Genova appears to be bringing the class action lawsuit on behalf of himself and all buyers of the GeForce RTX 4090, one of the best graphics cards on the market, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit was filed on Nov. 11 in the California federal court.Nvidia Customer Support on GeForce RTX 4090 Issues and ComplaintsIn a statement released to PCWorld, a company spokesman for Nvidia stated that they are working towards resolving all complaints regarding the graphics card.\"NVIDIA and our partners are committed to supporting our customers, regardless of the cable or power supply used,\" an Nvidia spokesman said. \"Anybody who has an issue [relating to this] will be taken care of.\"According to board partners, 125,000 GeForce RTX 4090 cards have been shipped. Thus, PC World estimates that the known failure rate of the melting power cables is currently at 0.04% since 50 complaints have been filed.Related Article\u00a0:\nNvidia Is Facing Lawsuit Over RTX 4090's Melting ConnectorThis article is owned by TechTimesWritten by: Andi C.  \u24d2 2024 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

            "response": "NVIDIA: When will the turning point come as profits are reduced by 70%? - LongPortFeedResearchNewsLivePortAIMarketsMarketScreenerLearnInvestment WikiResourceDownloadDeveloperENEnglish\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587Dolphin ResearchLikes ReceivedPosts2022.11.18 07:44NVIDIA: When will the turning point come as profits are reduced by 70%?I'm PortAI, I can summarize articles.StartOn the morning of November 17, Beijing time, Nvidia (NVDA.O) released its financial report for the third quarter of the 2023 fiscal year (ending in October 2022) after the US stock market closed:\n1. Overall performance: mediocre, with inventory being the main reason for the decline in gross margin. This quarter, Nvidia achieved revenues of $5.93 billion, down 16.5% year-on-year, which is in line with the company's previous guidance ($5.9 billion). The gross margin (GAAP) achieved by Nvidia this quarter was 53.6%, far lower than the expected guidance (62.4%), and the gross margin on the financial statement has not completely recovered from its low point. The main reason for the low gross margin is the reduction in inventory. The net profit in this financial report was only $680 million, down 72.4% year-on-year, which is much lower than the market's expectation of $1 billion, mainly due to the impact of lower-than-expected gross margin data.\n2. Core business situation: gaming business continues to decline, data center concerns gradually emerging. Gaming and data center businesses account for about 90% of the company's revenue, but both performed poorly this quarter.\n1) The sharp decline in gaming business this quarter is the main reason for the weak performance. Dolphin Analyst believes that the main reasons for the continued downturn in gaming this quarter are: \u2460 the global PC market is still sluggish in the third quarter and there is no sign of recovery; \u2461 the continuous decline in virtual currency prices this year has weakened the demand for mining; \u2462 the dealer hoarding model directly affects the current pulling power.\n2) The growth rate of the data center business in this quarter has begun to slow down significantly, and the impact of the macro economy on the cloud business has begun to emerge. As the large American tech companies begin to slow down their capital spending, the \"hidden worries\" of the company's data center business are gradually emerging.\n3. Major financial indicators: cost expenditures are showing rigidity, and inventory pressure continues to rise. Nvidia's operating expense ratio continued to rise this quarter, reaching over 40%. In absolute terms, research and development, sales, and administrative expenses are all growing. On the inventory side, there is still no sign of improvement. The company added $565 million in inventory this quarter, and inventory throughout the industry chain has risen due to sluggish downstream demand.\n4. Guidance for next quarter: Nvidia expects revenue of $6 billion (+/-2%) and a year-on-year decline of 20% for the fourth quarter. The gross margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be 63.2%-66%, returning to the normal level.\nOverall view: Nvidia's performance in the third quarter was mediocre. The revenue end of this quarter's performance is in line with the company's guidance and market expectations, while the gross margin end is far lower than the company's guidance and market expectations, mainly because the company has once again processed inventory worth $702 million this quarter. Excluding the impact of inventory processing, the company's gross margin will return to the normal level of over 60%.\nLooking ahead to the next quarter, the company has given revenue guidance of $6 billion and gross margin guidance of over 63%. From the guidance, there are still no obvious signs of a rebound in the company's revenue end, but the gross margin guidance of 63% or higher seems to indicate a significant rebound.\n**However, based on the company's continued high inventory situation this quarter, Dolphin Analyst believes that the company may still conduct inventory processing in the next quarter, which will increase pressure on gross profit margin to return to above 63%.\nIn addition, Nvidia's continued high operating expenses this quarter will seriously erode the company's performance.** The last two quarters have seen a slowdown in the company's revenue, but expenses still exhibit rigid characteristics. This quarter, the company's operating expense ratio has reached over 40%. In other words, for every 100 yuan of product revenue, the company has to spend more than 40 yuan on operating expenses, which seriously erodes the company's net profit margin. Although the company has provided operating expense guidance of more than $2.5 billion for the next quarter, the operating expense ratio will still reach 42%. However, Dolphin Analyst believes that Nvidia may also initiate measures to control costs in the future.\nOf course, as a growth stock, the market is most concerned about the company's business growth. As long as the company's business continues to grow rapidly, this will also be able to conceal the impact of expense spending and other aspects. In recent quarters' financial reports, revenue growth has slowed down and inventory continues to rise. Dolphin Analyst believes that Nvidia's gaming business is still in demand and the data center business is also affected by macroeconomic and large technology companies controlling costs. The constantly rising inventory not only indicates sluggish downstream demand but also puts continued pressure on the company's gross margin. The slowing increase in Fed rate hikes will have some impact on the company's stock performance, but there is still no clear sign of a rebound in the company's business.\n\nFor detailed content of this financial report, please refer to the following text:\nI. What do we need to know about Nvidia?\nNvidia is the world's leading computing chip company. The company's chips are not only used in traditional fields such as gaming and data centers but also in emerging fields such as autonomous driving and metaverse. Wherever there is a need for data computing, Nvidia can be seen.\nIn researching Nvidia, Dolphin Analyst started with two aspects: the \"fundamental strength of computing power + the future of computing power.\" The \"fundamental strength of computing power\" is the company's main source of revenue now, while \"the future of computing power\" is the breakthrough Nvidia can make in emerging fields.\n\nThis quarter, Jensen Huang participated in the GTC keynote speech again, mainly introducing new cloud services and the next generation of GeForce RTX GPUs that support AI workflows, as well as various new systems, chips, and software.\n1) Fundamental strength of computing power:\n\u2460 Gaming Business: Nvidia has brought to market the highly anticipated new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU this time, which utilizes TSMC's 4nm process. The performance of the new GeForce RTX 4090 will be four times that of the previous generation RTX 3090 Ti.\n\u2461 Data Center: NVIDIA's H100 Tensor Core GPU and the new generation Transformer Engine of Hopper have been fully put into production. Grace Hopper combines the Arm-based NVIDIA Grace data center CPU with the Hopper GPU, whose fast memory capacity has increased by 7 times. This will bring a \"huge leap\" to recommendation systems.\n2) The Future of Computing Power:\n\u2460 Autonomous Driving: The brand new Thor super chip can provide 20 million trillion floating-point calculations per second, replacing Atlan in the DRIVE development roadmap. It can seamlessly connect with DRIVE Orin, which is currently used in mass-produced cars and can provide 2.54 million trillion floating-point calculations per second.\n\u2461 Metaverse: Expanded through 3D technology, Omniverse is NVIDIA's platform for building and running metaverse applications. NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud is an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) that connects Omniverse applications running in the cloud, locally, or on devices.\nThe GTC conference held smoothly this quarter has brought new products to the computing base and confidence to the future of computing power. So, can this quarter's financial report turn around the decline in last quarter's financial report?\nII. Dolphin Analyst's detailed financial report analysis\nI. Overall performance: Average, inventory is the main reason for gross margin decline\n1.1 Revenue: In the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, NVIDIA achieved a revenue of 5.93 billion U.S. dollars, a year-on-year decrease of 16.5%, in line with the company's previous guidance (5.9 billion U.S. dollars). The company's revenue continued to decline this quarter, mainly due to the \"computing base\" business.  \u2460 The game business plummeted under the condition of weak demand.  \u2461 The growth rate of the data center business also slowed significantly due to the impact of export restrictions in some regions this quarter.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, the company's guidance is also difficult to improve. NVIDIA expects fourth-quarter revenue to be 6 billion U.S. dollars (plus or minus 2%), still a 20% year-on-year decline. Although the year-on-year decline is still significant, it has stabilized on a quarter-on-quarter basis.\n\n1.2 Gross margin (GAAP): In the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, NVIDIA's gross margin (GAAP) was 53.6%, far below the expected guidance (62.4%, plus or minus 0.5%). The gross margin on the quarterly report has not completely emerged from the low point.\nThe continued low gross margin this quarter is mainly due to weak downstream demand and high inventory in the industry chain. The company made an inventory provision of US$702 million this quarter.\nCompared with inventory changes of $1.22 billion in Q2, this quarter has decreased. Dolphin Analyst estimates that if the impact of the US$702 million inventory reduction is excluded, the company's gross margin in the third quarter will return to about 65%. However, due to the impact of the downturn in the semiconductor cycle and weak demand, the company has made some inventory adjustments.\nNVIDIA expects gross margins for the fourth quarter to return to 63.2% to 66%. Whether the company can return to over 60% in the short term depends mainly on downstream demand recovering to digest inventory. If inventory remains high next quarter, the company will continue to work on inventory adjustments.\n\n1.3 Operating indicators: inventory pressure is still increasing\n1) Inventory/revenue: the ratio for this quarter is 75%, up 17 percentage points from the previous quarter. Weak revenue at the top end has pushed up the ratio. In absolute terms, inventory increased by $565 million this quarter, up from the previous quarter, and the company's inventory pressure is still increasing.\n2) Accounts receivable/revenue: the ratio for this quarter is 83%, up 4 percentage points from the previous quarter. Weak revenue at the top end has pushed up the ratio. In absolute terms, accounts receivable decreased by $409 million this quarter from the previous quarter.\n\nNVIDIA's high inventory mainly comes from insufficient demand in the gaming business, and its continuously high inventory also reflects that downstream areas have entered a downward channel. Combining the company's weak revenue guidance for next quarter, Dolphin Analyst believes that the company's inventory pressure will still be significant in the next quarter. At the same time, under the pressure of high inventory, NVIDIA may continue to work on inventory adjustments, thereby putting pressure on achieving gross margins of over 60% next quarter.**\nII. Core Business Situation: Gaming Business Continues Decline, Data Center Hidden Risks Gradually Emerge\nDue to the continued downturn in the gaming business, the revenue proportion of NVIDIA's data center business in 2023 Q3 continued to increase, exceeding 60%. The declining performance of the gaming market has reduced the share of the gaming business in the company's overall business to less than 30%.\nGaming and data center businesses are still the most critical businesses affecting the company's performance, and their total revenue accounts for about 90%.\n\n2.1 Gaming Business: NVIDIA's gaming business achieved revenue of $1.574 billion in Q3 2023, a year-on-year decline of 51.1%. The company believes that it is affected by macroeconomic conditions and the pandemic, as global desktop and laptop GPU sales have declined, directly affecting NVIDIA's gaming business.\n**\n\nDolphin Analyst believes that the main reason for the continued weakness of the gaming business is:\n\u2460 The global PC market is still weak in the third quarter and there is no sign of recovery. According to the latest data from IDC, the global PC market in the third quarter of 2022 accelerated its decline, with only 74.25 million units shipped, a year-on-year decrease of 14.3%. As graphics cards are mainly used on the PC side in the game field, the demand for PC in the market has clearly declined during the post-epidemic period. At the same time, the impact of local epidemic control has weakened the demand for game graphics cards;\n\n\u2461 The continuous decline in virtual currency prices this year has weakened the demand for mining. Like games, both mining and games have high computing power requirements, so some graphics cards are used for mining. Due to the continuous decline in virtual currency prices since the fourth quarter of last year, the demand for graphics cards in the \"mining market\" has been affected. Taking Bitcoin as an example, the price of Bitcoin has fallen below $20,000 from a high point of $69,000 in the second half of 2021.\n\nSource: Wind, Dolphin Research\n\u2462 The dealer's hoarding model directly affects the current hauling power. As many game graphics cards are sold through dealerships, when dealers hoard goods at the beginning of a downturn cycle, hauling power is significantly reduced. It is transmitted to the company through the industrial chain, and the company's shipment situation has shown a significant decline, and inventory has continued to rise.\nDolphin Analyst believes that there are cycles in the industry, and in recent quarters, the game business of the company is similar to the downstream industry demand slump in 2018, which has led to high inventory levels and \"thunderous\" performance. NVIDIA's game business has returned to growth, and the stimulation of downstream demand requires the company to introduce new products and a rebound in virtual currency prices. However, from the company's weak guidance for the next quarter, the game business is still not optimistic.\n2.2 Data center business: In the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, NVIDIA's data center business achieved revenue of 3.83 billion U.S. dollars, a significant year-on-year growth slowdown of 31%, but a month-on-month growth of only 1%. The company explained that sales in North America's ultra-large-scale and cloud computing customers are still increasing, while sales in China are affected by economic conditions. The export of A100 and H100 has been restricted, which has been largely offset by replacement products in the third quarter.\n\nAlthough the decline in performance of NVIDIA in this quarter is mainly due to the drag of the gaming business, the obvious slowdown in growth should not be ignored. Although data centers had a growth of 61% in the previous quarter's financial report, Dolphin Analyst also reminded that \"growth risks cannot be ignored,\" and the growth of data centers has also slowed down significantly this quarter. Dolphin Analyst still believes that in the macro background of growth slowdown and inflation, the changes in revenue in a single region cannot be attributed, and at the same time, attention should also be paid to the layoffs and shrinking expenses of US technology giants such as Amazon and FB. Due to the impact of the downgrading of capital expenditures by large companies, there is a downtrend risk in the growth expectations of NVIDIA's data center business.\n2.3 Automobile Business: NVIDIA's automobile business achieved revenue of 250 million US dollars in Q3 of fiscal year 2023, with a year-on-year growth of 85.9%, which mainly comes from the revenue of self-driving and AI driving cabin solutions.\nWith the promotion of new energy vehicles, the company's auto business has reached a historical high this quarter. As applications such as self-driving continue to penetrate, the auto business is expected to bring new growth to the company.\nWhat cannot be ignored is that the contribution of the two hundred million-plus automobiles to revenue is still less than 5%, which is difficult to hold up the main performance. Dolphin Analyst will continue to pay attention to the progress of NVIDIA's automobile business.\n\nIII. Main Financial Indicators:\n3.1 Operating Profit Margin: The growth of expenses is still increasing\nNVIDIA's operating profit margin rebounded to 10.1% in Q3 of fiscal year 2023, but is still at a low level. The rebound in operating profit margin this quarter is mainly due to the gross profit margin, but it can also be noted that the company's expenses are slightly rigid.\nTo analyze the composition of the operating profit margin, the specific changes are:\n\"Operating profit margin = Gross profit margin - research and development expense ratio - sales, administrative and other expense ratio\"\n\n\nGross profit margin: 53.6% this quarter, down 9.6pct year-on-year, mainly affected by the weak gaming business and the reduction of inventory depreciation.\n\n\nResearch and development expense ratio: 32.8% this quarter, up 13pct year-on-year. This is mainly due to the relative rigidity of research and development expenses. Although the company's revenue is weak this quarter, the absolute value of research and development expenses will not have a significant decrease.\n\n\nSales, administrative, and other expense ratio: 10.6% this quarter, up 2.8pct year-on-year. There will be certain changes in sales expenses with revenue changes, and the rigid performance of administrative expenses has caused an overall increase in expense ratio.\n\n\nNVIDIA's operating expense guidance for the fourth quarter is still as high as 2.56 billion US dollars. Although it has slightly decreased compared to the third quarter, in the face of weak revenue guidance, the operating expense ratio for the fourth quarter is still as high as 42%. Compared with the high expenses and weak performance guidance, NVIDIA will not rule out cost control measures in personnel and other areas in the future.\n**\n\n3.2 Net Profit (GAAP): Continues to stay at a low level\nNVIDIA's net profit in Q3 FY2023 was 680 million US dollars, a year-on-year decrease of 72.4%. The net profit margin of this quarter has rebounded slightly to 11.5% compared to the previous quarter. The significant decline in profit this quarter is mainly due to the decrease in gross profit margin while the cost rate has been increasing under the continued weakness in revenue, ultimately squeezing the company's profit.\n\nDolphin NVIDIA historical articles:\nIn-depth\nJune 6, 2022, \"Did the US stock market earthquake mistakenly target Apple, Tesla, and NVIDIA?\"\nFebruary 28, 2022, \"NVIDIA: High growth is not false, but the cost-effectiveness is still below average\"\nDecember 6, 2021, \"NVIDIA: Valuations cannot be supported by imagination alone\"\nSeptember 16, 2021, \"NVIDIA (Part 1): How did this chip giant achieve a twenty-fold increase in five years?\"\nSeptember 28, 2021, \"NVIDIA (Part 2): The dual-wheel drive is no longer, will Davis strike again?\"\nEarnings season\nAugust 25, 2022, Conference Call \"How Does Management Explain the Collapse of Gross Margin?

Interestingly, at the same time, Gigabyte also filed Radeon RX 7900 models with the EEC too, but we know those are coming (on December 13, though we aren\u2019t sure if third-party cards will be present on shelves right from the off).Notably, Gigabyte is unleashing a couple of vanilla reference board models, so those may be first to arrive if the rumor mill is right (although the latest word on the grapevine is that some custom RX 7900 models may actually be available right out of the gate, and not just reference cards, which are those built to AMD\u2019s default base spec).Analysis: Return of the lower-tier RTX 4080 \u2013 but how will it be priced?This is another strong hint that Nvidia has an RTX 4070 Ti in the pipeline for the near future, and the fact that the filings have been made at the same time as RX 79000 models \u2013 which are due out next month \u2013 suggests a release date that might well marry up with what previously speculation pointed to: namely January 5th. That would be a CES launch, of course, so we shall see\u2026Remember, it should be no surprise that Nvidia would have this GPU ready to go when you recall that the RTX 4080 12GB was canceled, and this is supposedly going to be the return of that GPU in a different guise (or that\u2019s the theory, anyway).

How differently will Nvidia pitch it to the canned RTX 4080 12GB, which had an MSRP of $899 in the US? Obviously it will need to be cheaper than this, but how much lower will Team Green go?Will Nvidia take into account the reaction to the costly RTX 4080 16GB, which has been a clearly unpopular GPU due to its price/performance ratio? (It makes the RTX 4090 look like the high-end graphics card to go for in no uncertain terms, if you can afford what in some instances is only a little bit of an extra outlay, depending on what exact models you compare).We can perhaps hope for a $699 MSRP in the US for the 4070 Ti, but the reality is given Nvidia\u2019s past pricing form, it\u2019ll probably turn up with a bit of a higher recommended price tag than this; perhaps $749, or even $799. Time will tell, but it\u2019d be nice to see Team Green give consumers a bit of a break in the higher-end GPU market at this point.Today\u2019s best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $39.99 $34.99ViewDeal ends Tue, Apr 1, 2025 $99.99 $79.99ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\nAMD\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

NVIDIA impressed investors with its stellar financial performance and experienced robust top and bottom-line growth in the past several quarters. However, the weakening demand for its chips used in gaming and data center end markets has put a break on its growth momentum as depicted from the last reported quarter.  In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, though NVIDIA\u2019s revenues of $6.7 billion met the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues came lower than management\u2019s May 2022 forecast of $8.10 billion (+/-2%) due to weaker sales across its Gaming and Data Center business segments. Moreover, non-GAAP earnings plunged 51% year over year to 51 cents per share. The trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter. In its second-quarter earnings release, the company stated that revenues from its Gaming market segments would decline sequentially as OEMs and channel partners continue to reduce inventory levels. NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote Softness in Gaming Chip Demand NVIDIA experienced robust sales for its chips used in gaming end markets for the past couple of years. This was driven by pandemic-induced stay-at-home instructions. The demand for NVIDIA\u2019s gaming chips increased immensely as people were surfing games to stay engaged and entertained indoors during lockdowns. Moreover, with the massive emergence of multiplayer online games and Gaming-as-a-Service concepts, the demand for graphic processing units shot up exponentially. However, the reopening of economies, along with the rising global slowdown concern amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the U.S.-China trade war, has been hurting the demand for gaming chips.  The company\u2019s revenues from the Gaming market platform plunged 33% year over year and 44% sequentially in the last reported quarter. We believe that the trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Gaming segment\u2019s revenues is pegged at $1.4 billion, indicating a 56.6% decline from the year-ago quarter\u2019s revenues of $3.22 billion.

Because while I know some people that are really into playing AAA titles at 4K max settings, the majority of folks I talk to just want to play games with their friends at 1080p, or sometimes 1440p. Most of the graphics cards I\u2019ve bought in my life have been around the $249 price point, with GPUs like the Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 and AMD Radeon 5870 being some of my all-time favorite graphics cards. But starting with the Nvidia RTX 2000 series, graphics cards started seeing stratospheric price increases. I thought it was over when the RTX 3080 launched for a lower MSRP than the RTX 2080, but obviously, with the RTX 4080 starting at an eye-watering $1,199, I was wrong. What\u2019s a GPU? My What is a graphics card explainer will fill you inSubscribe(Credit: Jackie Thomas, The Shortcut)Rising watersLook how expensive the RTX 4080 is lolIt\u2019s not just Nvidia graphics cards that are more expensive these days, though. Even AMD has seen higher prices for its equivalent GPUs. To be fair, AMD did say at its \u201cAdvance Gaming\u201d conference it claimed it didn\u2019t even want to touch the RTX 4090, instead wishing to compete at the \u201c$1000 and less\u201d level, reported here by PC Gamer. However, the AMD Radeon 7900 XTX is still a $999 product and the AMD Radeon 7900 XT is just $100 less at $899 \u2013 and let\u2019s be honest, the latter is just the 7800 XT with a more confusing name. We still don\u2019t know how the 7900 XTX is actually going to perform, but even if it does dethrone the RTX 4080, the 7900 XT is a way weaker graphics card, and it\u2019s going to face the same problem as the RTX 4080. It kind of feels like no matter which brand of components you go for, they\u2019re just trying to push you to pay for the halo product by making everything else look like shit in comparison. (Credit: Getty Images)The appeal of PC gamingHere's a more affordable GPUDon\u2019t get me wrong, PC gaming has always had a heavier up-front cost than, for instance, buying a PS5. But it has always made up for that in cheaper games and no subscription for the privilege of playing games online. Plus, we were the platform that made free-to-play multiplayer games actually work. Looking at you, League of Legends. But I\u2019m not so sure that saving a few bucks on games is worth the hugely inflated price of PC gaming in 2022. I used to be able to build an extremely high-end gaming rig for around $1,000-1,200 that would max out everything under the sun. Now, I\u2019m lucky if that covers the graphics card by itself \u2013 never mind  the rest of the system. It just seems like PC gaming is becoming a caricature of what its reputation was a decade ago: rich kids wasting money on a high-end system to play games that everyone else can play for cheaper elsewhere. And while I don\u2019t have a problem with people building blinged-out systems for bragging rights, it doesn\u2019t mean that everyone should have to pay these frankly obnoxious prices for components. And don\u2019t tell me to wait for the RTX 4060, because I can already see Nvidia slapping a $499 price tag on it. (Credit: Jackie Thomas, The Shortcut)Is PC gaming even worth it anymore?PC gaming is basically my life, and I\u2019ll probably never stop upgrading my PC or even trying to get more people to jump in on the hobby. But, I definitely have a lot more to think about before I tell someone to just build and/or buy a new PC. Integrated graphics are becoming so good that if someone just wants to play something like World of Warcraft, I\u2019ll just tell them to buy one of the best laptops and call it good. But building a traditional gaming rig is so prohibitively expensive now that I will only recommend it to someone with a huge budget to start. Anyone that asks me to recommend a gaming PC under $1,000\u2026 well, I\u2019ll probably just tell them to buy a PS5 instead. At least that way you can get next-generation technologies like ray tracing and reconstructive super-sampling without taking out a second mortgage on their home. The TL;DR here is that PC gaming is still wonderful and still the best place to play games \u2013 especially with continued PS5 restock troubles. But even that isn\u2019t worth a $2,000 investment unless you literally have a pile of cash burning a hole in your wallet. That\u2019s more than most people pay for rent.

(NASDAQ:NVDA) shares were advancing on Thursday following the release of its fiscal year 2023, third-quarter results.\nThe Nvidia Analyst: KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh  maintained an Overweight rating and $230 price target for Nvidia shares.\nThe Nvidia Thesis:  Nvidia reported mixed quarterly results, with a revenue beat but earnings per share, or EPS, miss and guided in line, Vinh said in a note. The EPS miss reflected a $702 million write-down of the A100 chips, likely due to the China export ban, he said.\nAmong business segments, gaming revenue fell 23% quarter-over-quarter and 51% year-over-year, mainly due to softness in Asia, the analyst noted. The company continues to under-ship in the fourth quarter, with channel inventories likely reaching normal levels exiting the fourth quarter, Vinh said, citing the company.\nSee Also:\u00a0Trading Strategies For Nvidia Stock Before And After Q3 Earnings\n\n\n\nVinh noted that data center revenue grew 1% sequentially and 31% year-over-year, with continued robust demand in the U.S. cloud and vertical industries such as auto and energy. The company managed to offset the impact of China export restrictions with the alternative A800 chips, he added.\nDespite China softness, the analyst expects Hopper GPU ramp to outpace Ampere.\nNvidia\u2019s fourth-quarter guidance, Vinh said, implied modest growth in data center, gaming and auto, offset by weak China data center and inventory headwinds in gaming.\n\u201cWe are encouraged with results/guidance as NVDA overcame the China export restrictions and put in a bottom,\u201d Vinh said.\nPrice Action:  In premarket trading, Nvidia shares were rising 2.06% to $162.37, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\t\t\n\n\nRead Next: Best Semiconductor Stocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNVIDIA NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA to Build Accelerated Quantum Computing Research CenterGlobeNewswire 3m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA and GE HealthCare Collaborate to Advance the Development of Autonomous Diagnostic Imaging With Physical AIGlobeNewswire 6m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA, Alphabet and Google Collaborate on the Future of Agentic and Physical AIGlobeNewswire 8m \n\n\n\nClimate Tech Companies Adopt NVIDIA Earth-2 for High-Resolution, Energy-Efficient, More Accurate Weather Predictions and Disaster PreparednessGlobeNewswire 9m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA and Storage Industry Leaders Unveil New Class of Enterprise Infrastructure for the Age of AIGlobeNewswire 11m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell Accelerates Computer-Aided Engineering Software by Orders of Magnitude for Real-Time Digital TwinsGlobeNewswire 13m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Omniverse Physical AI Operating System Expands to More Industries and PartnersGlobeNewswire 14m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell Ultra DGX SuperPOD Delivers Out-of-the-Box AI Supercomputer for Enterprises to Build AI FactoriesGlobeNewswire 15m \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStart Trading Futures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n\n\n\n\nNVDA\n\n\n\n115.89\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-3.64 (-3.05%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t03:35:44 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time NVDA charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFind News\n\t\t\t\tNews\n\n\n\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n            See also:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                - Explore more categories\n            \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

Well, probably nothing really (maybe?)Today, Microsoft and NVIDIA announced a multi-year partnership to develop a new type of AI cloud computer for Azure customers, powered by NVIDIA GPU tech.Leveraging \"tens of thousands\" of NVIDIA GPUs, Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking at 400 Gb/s, and NVIDIA's nascent AI platform, the two firms are aiming to speed up the rollout and development of AI-based tools and apps powered by NVIDIA's tech and Microsoft's cloud footprint. This is the first time NVIDIA will have made the full stack of its cloud AI infrastructure available to the public, in partnership with Microsoft Azure.\u00a0With NVIDIA bringing its hardware clout to the table, Azure is bringing its unique blend of global scalability in virtual machine instances, which NVIDIA says will help speed up the training and deployment of all sorts of AI tools. NVIDIA says foundational models like Megatron Turing NLG 530B will see rapid advancement under the program, with the goal of developing \"unsupervised\" self-learning algorithms for building code, text, digital imagery, audio, and video. NVIDIA and Microsoft will also collaborate on Microsoft's own DeepSpeed algorithmic refinement platform, which is designed to help AI instances self-learn more rapidly.\u00a0Scott Guthrie, EVP at Microsoft for Cloud + AI hailed the partnership, as the firms collaborate to explore the next wave in automated industry. \"AI is fueling the next wave of automation across enterprises and industrial computing, enabling organizations to do more with less as they navigate economic uncertainties. Our collaboration with NVIDIA unlocks the world\u2019s most scalable supercomputer platform, which delivers state-of-the-art AI capabilities for every enterprise on Microsoft Azure.\u201d(Image credit: Microsoft)Microsoft's interest in developing AI platforms has been increasing exponentially in recent years. Microsoft has internal teams across the entirety of its portfolio exploring ways to incorporate AI self-learning algorithms across practically every product group. We've seen Copilot programming editing appear in GitHub and Visual Studio. We've heard how AI can enhance and speed up Xbox and PC video game development, handing off intensive tasks to AI. We've also seen piles of creepy AI-generated images that, while fun, also raise a question of copyright theft, given that AI train themselves using real-world art.\u00a0Indeed, as Microsoft's investments in the space grow, there will doubtless be teething problems of every stripe. From copyright claims on content used to train algorithms, to morality questions over AI behavior. There are also hard questions about AI and automation putting the human labor force out of work as well. And hey, there's always the chance the AI cloud computer becomes sentient and takes over the world, right? Well, maybe not.\u00a0Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.However it all goes, it seems like Microsoft is poised to be on the cutting edge of this nascent tech, along with its enterprise partners on Azure.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nToday's best Sandisk 32GB SD Class 10 SDHC Flash 48MB/s Memory Card, Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and  dealsSandisk 32GB SD...Sandisk 32GB SD Class 10 SDHC Flash 48MB/s Memory Card, FBA_118882 $11.27Viewat AmazonMicrosoft Office...Microsoft Office 365 For Beginners: The 1# Crash Course From Beginners To Advanced.

Wilson, Wccftech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's decade-old Kepler GPUs, the GeForce 700 & 600 series have received their first driver update to fix two critical vulnerabilities. This critical update will ensure that vulnerabilities that allow users the exploited ability to push malicious code to PCs would be removed for good.\nNVIDIA Releases Driver For Kepler-Based GeForce 700 & 600 GPUs After A Year, Fixes Two Critical Vulnerabilities\nThe two malicious attacks, CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786, have significantly affected the ten-year-old GPU series.\nRelated Story NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDPNVIDIA's Kepler architecture, released in 2012, introduced the NVIDIA GTX 680 which marked a big return to form in the efficiency and performance department for the green team. In a previous statement, NVIDIA assured users of the above series GPUs that NVIDIA would continue to offer support until 2024 when they officially retire the Kepler architecture. The GeForce Game Ready driver support ended back in October 2021.\nThe affected NVIDIA GeForce 700 / 600\u00a0 graphics cards listed below are compatible with Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, and 11.\n\nGeForce GTX 690\nGeForce GTX 680\nGeForce GTX 670\nGeForce GTX 660 Ti\nGeForce GTX 660\nGeForce GTX 650 Ti BOOST\nGeForce GTX 650 Ti\nGeForce GTX 650\nGeForce GTX 645\nGeForce GT 640\nGeForce GT 635\nGeForce GT 630\nGeForce GTX 780 Ti\nGeForce GTX 780\nGeForce GTX 770\nGeForce GTX 760\nGeForce GTX 760 Ti (OEM)\nGeForce GT 740\nGeForce GT 730\nGeForce GT 720\nGeForce GT 710\nGeForce GTX Titan\nGeForce GTX Titan Black\nGeForce GTX Titan Z\n\nAt the beginning of November, several platforms, including Linux, were found to be carrying the two specific exploits. OpenSSL 3, the cryptographic-based library focused on network-connected utilization, was the original point of impact. The vulnerabilities affected mail servers and open-source VPN protocols, such as OpenVPN. Network product devices, container images, and embedded-based systems utilize OpenSSL.\nThe National Cyber Security Centre (Netherlands branch), or NCSC-NL, has listed the software that may or may not currently be affected by the recent vulnerabilities. In the group's continued investigation, forty-six software titles are involved out of a list of well over one hundred affected products, most found in Linux packages or server software titles. It's a good thing that NVIDIA is offering a fix to this vulerability for users who are still running the Kepler GPUs inside the systems.\n\nSuppose readers are concerned that their software product is vulnerable to attack or would like to see the complete list of applications under investigation by the NCSC-NL. In that case, you can find the complete list of OpenSSL software on the group's GitHub page. For those interested in learning more about the 2022 OpenSSL vulnerability, you can check out the GitHub page, explaining the vulnerability and links to additional sites with more information.\nNews Sources: IT Home, Tech News Space, OpenSSL Product List, OpenSSL information page\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Rolls Out GeForce Driver 572.60 To Fix Black Screen Issues Related To RTX 50 Series GPUs\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n93\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n52\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n51\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n40\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n40\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The issue only affects \"certain motherboards,\" and Nvidia says it \"should only be applied if blank screens are occurring on boot.\" (We installed it on an RTX 4080 Founders Edition in an Asus motherboard that was working normally and didn't notice any adverse effects.)\nObviously, you aren't buying a GPU to use it with no drivers installed. But if you're adjusting BIOS settings, performing a fresh Windows install, or booting up for the first time after installing a new GPU, you need your GPU to be able to draw a basic image without having drivers loaded. The problem doesn't affect everyone, but if you notice a blank screen when you first boot your computer after installing an RTX 4090 or 4080, this firmware update may fix your problem.\nIf the bug is preventing you from installing the firmware update in the first place, Nvidia recommends connecting \"using an alternate graphics source\" like an integrated GPU or secondary GPU, or allowing your system to sit with a blank screen until it can install a driver on its own; Windows Update can usually grab a functional driver for most GPUs by itself, though you'll want to download and install the newest version to take advantage of new fixes and optimizations. The update can be applied to Founders Edition cards from Nvidia or any RTX 4090 or 4080 made by Nvidia's partners.\nNvidia is continuing to investigate a separate issue related to the new GPUs' power connector, which can overheat and cause damage if not connected properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            RTX 4090 review: Spend at least $1,599 for Nvidia\u2019s biggest bargain in years\n          \n\n            Our review also dives deeply into DLSS 3\u2014and how it may affect future Nvidia GPUs.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Listing image:\n    Nvidia\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n      Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with a focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of operating systems like Windows and macOS.

Filed in a California court on November 11th, the suit may make for painful reading for Nvidia and includes numerous allegations from fraud to unjust enrichment.The case refers to widely reported instances of the new-style 16-pin power connector used by Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4090 boards overheating and melting under heavy load.Reportedly, the lawsuit claims that Nvidia sold RTX 4090s with, \"defective and dangerous power cable plug and socket(s), which has rendered consumers' cards inoperable and poses a serious electrical and fire hazard for each and every purchaser.\"\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nPut away your pitchforks, the first report of an RTX 50-series graphics card melting a cable was actually down to an ol' RTX 4090 under load\n\n\n\n\nSurely not again: Worrying analysis shows Nvidia's RTX 5090 Founders Edition graphics card may be prone to melting power connectors\n\n\n\nIt's notable that the claimant describes himself as \"experienced in the installation of computer componentry like graphics cards,\" thereby aiming to head off any implication of user error at the pass.Sitting comfortably?(Image credit: Secretlab)Best chair for gaming: the top gaming chairs around\nBest gaming desk: the ultimate PC podiums\nBest PC controller: sit back, relax, and get your game onFor proof of the widespread nature of the failures, the suit refers to a Reddit thread which both records the technical characteristics of the failures in forensic detail and logs (at time of writing) 26 Reddit users who have experienced the problem.Currently, it's unclear what proportion of boards are suffering failure. Recent testing by Igor's Lab in Germany suggests that the problem is likely to be worse on boards shipped with adapters made by supplier Astron, with connectors made by NTK somewhat less likely to come over all melty.The above-referenced Reddit thread quotes a failure rate of between 0.05 percent and 0.1 percent, or somewhere between one failure for every 1,000 or 2,000 boards, according to an unnamed graphics card manufacturer.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Exactly how Nvidia is going to square this one away is unclear for now.

That represents a massive negative shift compared to Take-Two Interactive\u2019s EPS of 9 cents in the same period of the year prior.\nNot helping matters is the company\u2019s revenue of $1.4 billion. That\u2019s nowhere close to the $1.55 billion that analysts had expected for the quarter, even if it is a 62% year-over-year (YOY) increase from $858.2 million last year.\nTTWO Stock: The Outlook Doesn\u2019t Look Good\nIn the report, a guidance update from the company covers its fiscal full-year 2023 outlook. Specifically, the company expects its losses per share to range from $4.22 to $3.95, alongside revenue of between $5.41 billion and $5.51 billion. That revenue would come in below Wall Street\u2019s estimate of $5.89 billion for the year.\n\t\t\n\n\nStrauss Zelnick, Chairman and CEO of Take-Two Interactive, said the following about the guidance:\n\u201cWe now expect to deliver Net Bookings of $5.4 to $5.5 billion in Fiscal 2023. Our reduced forecast reflects shifts in our pipeline, fluctuations in FX rates, and a more cautious view of the current macroeconomic backdrop, particularly in mobile.\u201d\nToday\u2019s news has shares of TTWO stock seeing heavy trading. As of this writing, more than 5 million shares are on the move. For perspective, the company\u2019s daily average trading volume is about 1.9 million shares.\nTTWO stock is down 10.6% as of Tuesday morning and down 40.7% since the start of the year.\nInvestors can find more of the latest stock market news at the following links!\n\t\t\n\n\n\nInvestorPlace is home to all of the hottest stock coverage for Tuesday!

NOAA administrators and researchers have to collect, combine and analyze that information to observe and understand environmental conditions and changes.\nThe new Earth Observations Digital Twin \u2014 developed under contract with Lockheed Martin Space, working with NVIDIA \u2014 will provide NOAA with a high-resolution, accurate and timely depiction of global conditions, using current satellite and ground-based observations.\nFor the project, Lockheed Martin\u2019s OpenRosetta3D\u2122 platform will utilize AI and machine learning (ML) to ingest, format and fuse observations from multiple sources into a gridded data product and detect anomalies. NVIDIA Omniverse Nucleus, the collaboration and database engine of its Omniverse world simulation platform, will convert data into the Universal Scene Description framework, enabling data-sharing across multiple tools and between researchers. Agatha, a Lockheed Martin-developed visualization platform, will ingest this incoming data from Omniverse Nucleus and allow users to interact with it in an Earth-centric 3D environment.\n\u201cAt Lockheed Martin we regularly use digital twins and AI to provide our government customers with the clearest, current situational picture and actionable intelligence for their important missions,\u201d said Matt Ross, senior program manager at Lockheed Martin Space. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased that we can use our technology experience to collaborate with NVIDIA on this project to provide NOAA a timely, global visualization for their own important missions.\u201d\n\u201cDigital twins will help us solve the world\u2019s hardest scientific and environmental challenges,\u201d said Dion Harris, lead product manager of accelerated computing at NVIDIA. \u201cThe combination of Lockheed Martin\u2019s AI technology with NVIDIA Omniverse will give NOAA researchers a powerful system to improve weather predictions at a global scale.\u201d\nLockheed Martin and NVIDIA are already collaborating on an effort to help fight wildfires, which have burned more than 7.2 million U.S. acres this year. By pairing Lockheed Martin\u2019s AI/ML platforms and joint all domain command and control capabilities with NVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse, the two companies are demonstrating how firefighters can use advanced technology to help better detect, predict and suppress wildfires.\n\n\n\n\nAbout Lockheed Martin\r\nHeadquartered in\u00a0Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin Corporation is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 114,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.\nPlease follow\u00a0@LMNews\u00a0and\u00a0@LMSpace\u00a0on Twitter for the latest announcements and news across the corporation.\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

The current Azure instances feature 200Gb/s Quantum InfiniBand and A100 GPUs, but future ones will have 400Gbps Quantum-2 InfiniBand and the newer H100 GPUs.\nThe two companies offered no time frame for this project to become operational, but it appears that this so-called AI supercomputer may actually not exist as such.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading between the lines, it appears that Microsoft is simply adding to Azure a bunch of AI-optimized instances with Nvidia's latest hardware and software, which customers will string together as required for their specific project.\nWe asked Nvidia for clarification, and a spokesperson told us that: \"All new capabilities are in Azure instances, but the setup is such that enterprises will be able to scale those instances all the way up to supercomputing status.\" So that's an AI cloud service, in that case.\nNvidia's spokesperson added: \"Customers can acquire resources as they normally would with a real supercomputer. For both you have a software layer that reserves resources. Just now it is in the cloud and not on a dedicated supercomputer. The most important thing is scalability. The resource on Azure can be scaled up to supercomputer standards with the same AI software, network capability and compute nodes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe partnership will also see Nvidia make use of Azure resources to conduct research into generative AI models, which the company describes as a \"rapidly emerging area\" of AI in which foundational models such as Megatron Turing NLG 530B are the basis for new algorithms capable of synthesizing text, computer code, images, and even video.\n\nNvidia's datacenter growth can't save it from gaming GPU woes\nNvidia turns to optical trickery to boost long-haul InfiniBand performance\nNvidia, Lockheed team up to build digital twin of the Earth for climate researchers\nHow AMD, Intel, Nvidia are keeping their cores from starving\n\nThe model in question was developed by a team from Microsoft and Nvidia, using Nvidia's Megatron-LM transformer model and Microsoft's DeepSpeed deep learning optimization library, the latter of which the pair will also work on optimizing.\nScott Guthrie, Microsoft EVP for its Cloud + AI Group, said that AI will fuel the next wave of automation in enterprises, enabling organizations to do more with less.\n\"Our collaboration with Nvidia unlocks the world's most scalable supercomputer platform, which delivers state-of-the-art AI capabilities for every enterprise on Microsoft Azure.\"\nNvidia's VP of enterprise computing, Manuvir Das, said the partnership aimed to provide researchers and companies with infrastructure and software to exploit AI.\n\"The breakthrough of foundation models has triggered a tidal wave of research, fostered new startups and enabled new enterprise applications,\" he said.\nTo this end, the AI supercomputer/cloud service will support a broad range of applications and services, including Microsoft DeepSpeed and Nvidia's AI Enterprise software suite. The latter is already certified and supported on Azure instances with A100 GPUs, while support for Azure instances with the newer H100 GPUs will be added in a future software release, Nvidia said.

In other words, getting on for quadruple the amount of RTX 4090 graphics cards are being sold compared to its lesser Lovelace sibling.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5090 and 5080 GPU launch was frustrating and chaotic, leaving many PC gamers disappointed \u2013 exactly as the rumors predicted\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's RTX 5000 GPUs continue to face severe supply issues, with RTX 5070 Ti reportedly being even worse for launch stock than the RTX 5080\n\n\n\nTom\u2019s notes that on average just eight RTX 4080 GPUs are being sold per day on eBay US, and that\u2019s a massive way off what was seen with the RTX 4090; when the flagship launched, at peak it was selling 64 cards daily on the auction site.Analysis: Reflecting broader feelings on the disappointing RTX 4080This reflects the broad sentiment out there regarding the RTX 4080 as a badly positioned graphics card \u2013 nearly as pricey as the RTX 4090 in some cases, and yet not offering anything like the same performance levels.While the RTX 4090 was a profit-spinner for scalpers (sadly) \u2013 reselling at 54% over MSRP in its launch week on eBay \u2013 the RTX 4080 is only commanding a 30% premium over MSRP right now (and it\u2019s not really selling much at that level either, as observed above). The RTX 4090 remains at 38% over MSRP currently, still stronger than the newer 4080, and prices of the Lovelace flagship have even risen just a little on eBay following the RTX 4080 launch.This spells out a couple of things pretty clearly \u2013 the disappointing and poorly received RTX 4080 is certainly helping to push RTX 4090 sales, both of new graphics cards off the shelves (as we\u2019ve seen with stats elsewhere, the flagship has sold over four times as many units as the RTX 4080, roughly), and on eBay.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.It\u2019s also a clear lesson for scalpers that just because a shiny new graphics card comes out, it isn\u2019t necessarily going to be a resale goldmine, or even make much of a profit at all. Right now with RTX 4080 models, scalpers are doubtless going to be nervously looking at shifting stock and taking a slight loss, perhaps, rather than a bigger loss down the line.Times appear to be changing, then, in terms of GPU price gouging for new stock now feeling a bit like playing with fire \u2013 at least with the RTX 4080. And with any luck, these warning signals may make scalpers think twice about getting involved in reselling AMD\u2019s incoming RDNA 3 graphics cards, which might be cheaper than Nvidia\u2019s Lovelace models, but will still be expensive beasts. That does rather depend on how initial stock levels work out, mind you, and how much volume AMD and its card making partners can muster \u2013 because if GPUs turn out to be thin on the ground, that\u2019s obviously a ripe recipe for scalping.Let\u2019s hope that some lessons have been learned here, though, and at least some folks who are apparently getting their fingers burnt trying to flip an RTX 4080 for a profit may not want to put themselves through this risk or hassle in the future.Today\u2019s best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $39.99 $34.99ViewDeal ends Tue, Apr 1, 2025 $99.99 $79.99ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

Commenting on concerns about whether TSMC\u2019s investment in the US to make chips on 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies would lead to Taiwan losing technological competitiveness, as Japan did when local tech companies expanded abroad, Wang said that Taiwan is different from Japan.Taiwan does not compete directly with the US, but the countries collaborate with each other, Wang said. Taiwanese companies are good at providing chip manufacturing foundry services, while US companies are specializing in chip design, she added.TSMC builds up US capacity to supply customers with locally manufactured chips, Wang said, adding that the Hsinchu-headquartered company seeks to diversify manufacturing sites to mitigate risks.It is most important that TSMC is committed to investing in the most advanced chips in Taiwan, Wang said. The chipmaker is ramping up 3-nanometer chipmaking technology at its fab in Tainan and is preparing to build a new fab in Hsinchu at which 2-nanometer technology would be used, Wang said. The company might also build a fab in Taoyuan that would introduce its 1-nanometer technology, she said.Taiwan remains the primary chip manufacturing site for TSMC, she added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n1Chinese influencer\u2019s residency revoked\n2Lee wins silver at All England Open\n3SPEAK UP: Kylie Minogue & Kenshi Yonezu to rock

The bottom line also fell short of expectations. \n\nThe Santa Clara-headquartered graphics chipmaker said its adjusted net income declined to $0.58 per share in the October quarter from $1.17 per share a year earlier.

Net income, including special items, was $680 million or $0.27 per share in the latest quarter, compared to $2.46 billion or $0.97 per share in the third quarter of 2022.\nThe earnings drop reflects a 17% year-over-year decline in revenues to $5.93 billion.

It's 3rd of January next year and a GeForce Special Event keynote for the CES tech jamboree in Las Vegas, albeit Nvidia will be conducting the event remotely.Beyond describing the event as detailing \"the latest technologies, products and software from GeForce\", Nvidia isn't getting more specific. However, we're expecting to see two main announcements at the event.\u00a0On the desktop side, very likely we'll finally see what Nvidia has done with the cancelled RTX 4080 12GB model. Odds are it will be rebranded RTX 4070 Ti and be announced on the 3rd at that CES event.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has announced a whole host of gaming laptop GPUs at CES 2025, from the RTX 5070 all the way to the big RTX 5090\n\n\n\n\nHiding in the shadows, this Nvidia teaser video might have given us our first look at a Founders Edition RTX 50-series GPU\n\n\n\nGiven the RTX 4080 12GB boards were already in mass production when Nvidia had a change of heart, we're not expecting much by way of a change in specifications in the transition to RTX 4070 Ti branding.\u00a0So, that's 7,680 shaders, aka CUDA cores in Nvidia parlance, 240 texture units, 80 ROPs and 12GB of memory running over a 196-bit bus. Roughly speaking, those numbers are around 40 to 45 percent of the flagship RTX 4090 GPU. While it's possible Nvidia may tweak some of those specs for the purported RTX 4070 Ti via a video BIOS update, we're not expecting a dramatic deviation.Instead, the big unknown is pricing. The RTX 4080 12GB was priced at $899 and the assumption is that the RTX 4070 Ti will be cheaper. But how much cheaper? Odds are, we'll know on January 3.Top-spec mobile GPUs should match the hardware features of the desktop RTX 4080 (Image credit: Future)The other major announcement at the CES event is expected to be mobile variants of Nvidia's RTX 40-series GPUs, otherwise known as Ada Lovelace. We're expecting to see RTX 4080 and 4070 branded mobile GPUs announced at minimum, with the possible addition of a mobile RTX 4090 and 4060 mobile chips to top and tail the range.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Based on the best currently available information, the mobile lineup would therefore look something like this. At the very top, the RTX 4090 will use the same AD103 GPU as the desktop 4080 card and pack 9,728 shaders, 304 texture units and 112 ROPs, all running over a 256-bit memory bus. Clock speeds would be significantly lower than the desktop 4080 at approximately 1.4GHz.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest gaming motherboard: The right boards\nBest graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the restThe RTX 4080 and 4080 Ti mobile will step down to the AD104 GPU briefly seen in that cancelled 4080 12GB desktop board, with the Ti model offering much the same hardware features as the 4080 12GB desktop but running at lower clock speeds. Subtract roughly 15 percent from the shader, texture and ROP counts to arrive at the non-Ti model. The smaller AD104 chip should clock a little higher in a mobile implementation and might flirt with as much as 2GHz in higher performing installations. However, the usual lower-power Max-Q variants for thin-and-light will inevitably be much slower.As for the RTX 4070 mobile, that's likely to be based on the as-yet unannounced AD106 chip. Specs will likely fall around 4,608 shaders, 144 textures and 48 ROPs, plus a 128-bit memory bus. Finally, the RTX 4060 could use another unannounced chip, AD107, with further cut-down specs, likely to be around 2,560 to 3,072 shaders, 80 to 96 texture units and around 32 ROPs. Mercifully, AD107 is currently expected to stick with a 128-bit memory bus rather than stepping down even further to a 96-bit bus.So, there you have it: what to expect on January 3rd. Let us know below whether that sounds exciting or if it just adds to the frustration at the latest GPU launches.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJeremy LairdSocial Links NavigationHardware writerJeremy has been writing about technology and PCs since the 90nm Netburst era (Google it!) and enjoys nothing more than a serious dissertation on the finer points of monitor input lag and overshoot followed by a forensic examination of advanced lithography.

It is stated that the red team has been increasing the orders of Radeon RX 7900 series graphics cards so that gamers can get them with relative ease at launch.\nRelated Story AMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 CoresThe report also states that the first supply of the AMD Radeon RX 7900 series graphics cards which include both Radeon RX 7900 XTX and Radeon RX 7900 XT models will not be small & is reportedly much better than what the supply of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards at launch. We've come to know over the past few days that NVIDIA has shipped a total of 160,000 Ada GPUs of which 81.25% units are for the RTX 4090 (AD102) GPU & the remaining 18.75% units are for the RTX 4080 (AD103) GPU.\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 was sold out entirely at launch however, the card can be found with some effort in retail outlets. Meanwhile, the RTX 4080 despite shipping in lower quantities, can still be found in abundance in several stores. The card has also been scalped and one can find several listings over at eBay. The RTX 4080 situation is largely due to its pricing which is an absurd $1199.9 US and also the fact that AMD has promised competitive performance per dollar and watt against the RTX 4080. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX has been positioned directly against the RTX 4080 in AMD's marketing slides so users are really keen on knowing the final results of these two products before they make their buying decision.\nIf AMD really does manage to knock off the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 graphics card in the final GPU reviews, then we can see a surge in the already surging demand for the Radeon RX 7900 series and more so of the Radeon RX 7900 XTX graphics card which costs $999 US (at MSRP). The extra volume of graphics cards will really come in handy and with no crypto going on now, we should expect the cards to be available at retail prices this time.\nAMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX vs NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080\n\n\n\nGraphics CardAMD Radeon RX 7900 XTXNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080\n\n\n\n\nGPUNavi 31 XTXAD103-300-A1\n\n\nProcess NodeTSMC 5nm+6nmTSMC 4N\n\n\nDie Size300mm2 (Only GCD)\n522mm2 (with MCDs)379mm2\n\n\nTransistors58 Billion45.9 Billion\n\n\nGPU Cores122889728\n\n\nTMUs/ROPs384 / 192304 / 112\n\n\nBase Clock2.3 GHz2.2 GHz\n\n\nMax Clock2.5 GHz2.5 GHz\n\n\nFP32 TFLOPs61 TFLOPs49 TFLOPs\n\n\nMemory Size24 GB GDDR616 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus384-bit256-bit\n\n\nMemory Clock20 Gbps22.4 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth960 GB/s716.8 GB/s\n\n\nCache96 MB64 MB\n\n\nTBP355W320W\n\n\nPCIe InterfaceTBAPCIe 4.0 x16\n\n\nPrice$999 US$1199 US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich flagship graphics cards are you most interested in?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJP Morgan Believes AMD\u2019s AI GPU Business Would Grow By 60 Percent This Year, Highlights Oracle\u2019s Initial Order Of 30,000 MI355X GPUs\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D & 9900X3D 3D V-Cache CPUs Now Available \u2013 The Best Gaming & Content Creation Package Ever!\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n87\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n29\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n27\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n23\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n20\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

It will be implemented in Microsoft\u2019s Azure public cloud platform.\n\u201cAI technology advances as well as industry adoption are accelerating,\u201d said Manuvir Das, the vice president of enterprise computing at Nvidia. \u201cThe breakthrough of foundation models has triggered a tidal wave of research, fostered new startups and enabled new enterprise applications. Our collaboration with Microsoft will provide researchers and companies with state-of-the-art AI infrastructure and software to capitalize on the transformative power of AI.\u201d\nAs part of the collaboration, Microsoft will equip Azure with tens of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units. GPUs are widely used in supercomputers because of their ability to speed up AI and scientific applications. Microsoft will implement the GPUs alongside several other technologies from Nvidia, including the chipmaker\u2019s Quantum-2 series of network switches.\nAzure already includes a substantial number of GPUs from Nvidia. Azure customers can access multiple compute instances powered by Nvidia\u2019s A100 chip, which was the chipmaker\u2019s flagship data center graphics card when it launched in 2020. Through the partnership announced today, Microsoft will introduce Azure cloud instances powered by Nvidia\u2019s current flagship data center GPU, the H100 chip.\nThe H100 made its debut in March. It features 80 billion transistors that can train AI models up to six times faster than Nvidia\u2019s previous-generation A100 graphics card. The H100 also includes optimizations that allow it more efficiently to run Transformer models, a type of advanced neural network widely used for tasks such as natural language processing.\nThe upcoming H100-powered Azure instances that Microsoft plans to launch will use Nvidia\u2019s Quantum-2 InfiniBand switch series to manage network traffic. The switches can process 400 gigabits of traffic per second per network port, twice as much as Nvidia\u2019s previous-generation hardware.\nSoftware is also a major focus of Nvidia\u2019s partnership with Microsoft. As part of the collaboration, the companies will make their respective AI development tools more easily accessible in Azure.\nMicrosoft provides an open-source toolkit called DeepSpeed that developers use to reduce their neutral networks\u2019 infrastructure requirements. According to Microsoft, the toolkit can reduce the amount of hardware needed to train and run neural networks. Microsoft and Nvidia will optimize DeepSpeed to run on the chipmaker\u2019s H100 graphics card.\nThe optimization effort will focus on helping developers speed up AI models that use the popular Transformer neural network architecture. The speed improvement will be provided with the help of a feature known as the Transformer Engine that is built into Nvidia\u2019s H100 graphics card. According to the chipmaker, the Transformer Engine accelerates neural networks by reducing the amount of data that they must process to complete calculations.\nNvidia provides a software platform called Nvidia AI Enterprise to help companies more easily run AI applications on its chips. The platform reduces the amount of manual work required to build, deploy and manage neural networks. It also includes a set of preconfigured neural networks optimized for tasks such as generating shopping recommendations.\nAs part of an earlier collaboration with Microsoft, Nvidia certified Nvidia Enterprise AI to run on Azure instances powered by its A100 chip. The companies will now team up to provide support for Nvidia Enterprise AI on Microsoft\u2019s upcoming H100-powered Azure instances.\n\u201cOur collaboration with NVIDIA unlocks the world\u2019s most scalable supercomputer platform, which delivers state-of-the-art AI capabilities for every enterprise on Microsoft Azure,\u201d said Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft\u2019s Cloud + AI Group.\nNvidia, in turn, plans to expand its use of Azure as part of the partnership. The chipmaker will use Azure instances to support its research efforts in the field of generative AI. That\u2019s a type of advanced neural network that can perform tasks such as generating text, video and software code.\nNvidia is already making significant investments in this area. Last October, the company debuted MT-NLG, a generative AI system described at the time as the most powerful in its category. MT-NLG features 530 billion parameters, the configuration settings that determine how a neural network processes data.\nImage: Nvidia\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. \u00a0\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\n\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

Yes, NVIDIA has finally released a public update to the ever-popular RTX 4090 connector drama.\nHere\u2019s a link to NVIDIA\u2019s Power Connector Update, and the full text is reproduced below.\nUpdated\u00a011/18/2022 10:00 AMPower Connector Update \u2013 GeForce RTX 4090\nWe are actively investigating the reports. We are aware of about 50 cases globally.\nOur findings to date suggest that a common issue is that connectors are not fully plugged into the graphics card. To help ensure the connector is secure we recommend plugging the power dongle into the graphics card first to ensure it\u2019s firmly and evenly plugged in, before plugging the graphics card into the motherboard.\nWe are investigating additional ways to ensure that the connector is secure before powering on the graphics card.\nNVIDIA and our partners are committed to supporting our customers and ensuring an expedited RMA process, regardless of the cable or card used.\n\nIt sounds like anyone affected by this, regardless of the high likelihood of user error, will be taken care of. It\u2019s the right way to approach an issue that has not helped NVIDIA\u2019s image in the least. Will we finally get past the endless 4090 memes? No, that will take years. It\u2019s the Internet.\nAlso, you may have noticed that NVIDIA states that this issue has affected a total of 50 cards worldwide (out of about 125,000 sold, according to GN). Not that this will change the narrative from fans of the other team\u2026\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousDuckDuckGo\u2019s App Tracking Protection For Android \n\nNextPodcast #700 \u2013 RTX 4080 Review, High GPU Prices Explained, GN Solves 4090 Connector Mystery, 1-click AMD boost, EPYC\u2019ly good sausage + more! \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nSebastian Peak\nEditor-in-Chief at PC Perspective.

Download Omniverse, which is free for NVIDIA RTX and GeForce RTX GPU owners.\u00a0 \nFeaturing a Fun-gi \nJuliestrator\u2019s artistic inspiration comes from the examination of the different worlds that people create. \u201cNo matter if it\u2019s the latest Netflix show or an artwork I see on Twitter, I love when a piece of art leaves space for my own imagination to fill in the gaps and come up with my own stories,\u201d she said. \nMushroom Spirit was conceived as a sketch for last year\u2019s Inktober challenge, which had the prompt of \u201cspirit.\u201d Rather than creating a ghost like many others, Juliestrator took a different approach. Mushroom Spirit was born as a cute nature spirit lurking in a forest, like the Kodama creatures from the Princess Mononoke film from which she drew inspiration. \nJuliestrator gathered reference material using Pinterest. She then used PureRef\u2019s overlay feature to help position reference imagery while modeling in Blender software. Though it\u2019s rare for Juliestrator to sketch in 2D for 3D projects, she said Mushroom Spirit called for a more personal touch, so she generated a quick scribble in Procreate.\n  \n The origins of \u2018Mushroom Spirit.\u2019\nUsing Blender, she then entered the block-out phase \u2014 creating a rough-draft level built using simple 3D shapes, without details or polished art assets. This helped to keep base meshes clean, eliminating the need to create new meshes in the next round, which required only minor edits. \n  \n Getting the basic shapes down by blocking out \u2018Mushroom Spirit\u2019 in Blender.\nAt this point, many artists would typically start to model detailed scene elements, but Julistrator prioritizes coloring. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed how much color influences the compositions and mood of the artwork, so I try to make this important decision as early as possible,\u201d the artist said. \n  \n Color modifications in Adobe Substance 3D Painter. \nShe used Adobe Substance 3D Painter software to apply a myriad of colors and experimental textures to her models. On her NVIDIA Studio laptop, the Razer Blade 15 Studio equipped with an NVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000 GPU, Juliestrator used RTX-accelerated light and ambient occlusion to bake assets in mere seconds.\nShe then refined the existing models in Blender. \u201cThis is where powerful hardware helps a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cThe NVIDIA OptiX AI-accelerated denoiser helps me preview any changes I make in Blender almost instantly, which lets me test more ideas at the same time and as a result get better finished renders.\u201d \n  \n Tinkering and tweaking color palettes in Blender.  \nThough she enjoys the modeling stage, Juliestrator said that the desire to refine an endless number of details can be overwhelming. As such, she deploys an \u201c80/20 rule,\u201d dedicating no more than 20% of the entire project\u2019s timeline to detailed modeling. \u201cThat\u2019s the magic of the 80/20 rule: tackle the correct 20%, and the other 80% often falls into place,\u201d she said.\nJuliestrator finally adjusts the composition in 3D \u2014 manipulating the light objects, rotating the camera and adding animations. She completed all of this quickly with an assist from RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in the Blender viewport, using Blender Cycles for the fastest frame renders. \n  \n Animations in Blender during the final stage.  \nBlender is Juliestrator\u2019s preferred 3D modeling app, she said, due to its ease of use and powerful AI features, as well as its accessibility. \u201cI truly appreciate the efforts of the Blender Foundation and all of its partners in keeping Blender free and available to people from all over the world, to enhance anyone\u2019s creativity,\u201d she said. \n\n \nJuliestrator chose to use an NVIDIA Studio laptop, a \u201cporta-bella\u201d system for efficiency and convenience, she said. \u201cI needed a powerful computer that would let me use both Blender and a game engine like Unity or Unreal Engine 5, while staying mobile and on the go,\u201d the artist added.\n  \n Illustrator Julie Greenberg, aka Juliestrator. \nCheck out Juliestrator\u2019s portfolio and social media links. \n  \nFor more direction and inspiration for building 3D worlds, check out Juliestrator\u2019s five-part tutorial, Modeling 3D New York Diorama,which covers the critical stages in 3D workflows: sketching composition, modeling details and more. The tutorials can be found on the NVIDIA Studio YouTube channel, which posts new videos every week.\nAnd don\u2019t forget to enter the NVIDIA Studio #WinterArtChallenge on \nInstagram\n, \nTwitter\n or \nFacebook\n.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Containing over 285,000 processor cores and 10,000 graphics cards, Microsoft claimed at the time that it was one of the largest supercomputer clusters in the world.\nNow, presumably to support even more ambitious AI workloads, Microsoft says it\u2019s signed a \u201cmulti-year\u201d deal with Nvidia to build a new supercomputer hosted in Azure and powered by Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, networking and AI software for training AI systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAI is fueling the next wave of automation across enterprises and industrial computing, enabling organizations to do more with less as they navigate economic uncertainties,\u201d Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft\u2019s cloud and AI group, said in a statement. \u201cOur collaboration with Nvidia unlocks the world\u2019s most scalable supercomputer platform, which delivers state-of-the-art AI capabilities for every enterprise on Microsoft Azure.\u201d\nDetails were hard to come by at press time. But in a blog post, Microsoft and Nvidia said that the upcoming supercomputer will feature hardware like Nvidia\u2019s Quantum-2 400Gb/s InfiniBand networking technology and recently detailed H100 GPUs. Current Azure instances offer previous-gen Nvidia A100 GPUs paired with Quantum 200Gb/s InfiniBand networking.\nNotably, the H100 \u2014 the flagship of Nvidia\u2019s Hopper architecture \u2014 ships with a special \u201cTransformer Engine\u201d to accelerate machine learning tasks and \u2014 at least according to Nvidia \u2014 delivers between 1.5 and 6 times better performance than the A100. It\u2019s also less power-hungry, offering the same performance as the A100 with up to 3.5 times better energy efficiency.\nOne of the first industrial-scale machines to sport H100 GPUs, the Lenovo-built Henri system operated by the Flatiron Institute in New York City, topped the list of this year\u2019s most efficient supercomputers. But Henri \u2014 a relatively small system by supercomputer standards, with only thousands of CPUs \u2014 ranked 405 on the Top500, a ranking of the 500 most powerful supercomputers in the world, implying the H100 is by no means a holy grail.\nAs part of the Microsoft collaboration, Nvidia says that it\u2019ll use Azure virtual machine instances to research advances in generative AI, or the self-learning algorithms that can create text, code, images, video or audio. (Think along the lines of OpenAI\u2019s text-generating GPT-3 and image-producing DALL-E 2.) Meanwhile, Microsoft will optimize its DeepSpeed library for new Nvidia hardware, aiming to reduce computing power and memory usage during AI training workloads, and work with Nvidia to make the company\u2019s stack of AI workflows and software development kits available to Azure enterprise customers.\n\nWhy Nvidia would opt to use Azure instances over its own in-house supercomputer, Selene, isn\u2019t entirely clear; the company\u2019s already tapped Selene to train generative AI like GauGAN2, a text-to-image generation model that creates art from basic sketches. Evidently, Nvidia anticipates that the scope of the AI systems that it\u2019s working with will eventually surpass Selene\u2019s capabilities and perhaps even those of Eos, a proof-of-concept supercomputer Nvidia is building that\u2019ll feature 4,608 H100 GPUs and reach up to 18.4 exaflops of AI computing performance.\n\u201cAI technology advances as well as industry adoption are accelerating. The breakthrough of foundation models has triggered a tidal wave of research, fostered new startups and enabled new enterprise applications,\u201d Manuvir Das, VP of enterprise computing at Nvidia, said in a statement. \u201cOur collaboration with Microsoft will provide researchers and companies with state-of-the-art AI infrastructure and software to capitalize on the transformative power of AI.\u201d\nThe insatiable demand for powerful AI training infrastructure has led to an arms race of sorts among cloud and hardware vendors. Just this week, Cerabras, which has raised over $720 million in venture capital to date at an over-$4 billion valuation, unveiled a 13.5-million core AI supercomputer called Andromeda it claims can achieve more than 1 exaflop of AI compute. Google and Amazon continue to invest in their own proprietary solutions, offering custom-designed chips \u2014 e.g. TPUs and Trainium \u2014 for accelerating AI training in the cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe push for more powerful hardware will continue for the foreseeable future. A recent study found that the compute requirements for large-scale AI models has been doubling at an average rate of 10.7 months between 2016 and 2022. And OpenAI once estimated that, if GPT-3 were to be trained on a single Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU, it would take around 355 years.\n\n\nTopics\n\nAI, AI, Enterprise, Microsoft, nvidia, supercomputer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tKyle Wiggers\t\n\n\n\nAI Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tKyle Wiggers is TechCrunch\u2019s AI Editor.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Editor\u2019s note: This post is a part of our Meet the Omnivore series, which features individual creators and developers who use NVIDIA Omniverse to accelerate their 3D workflows and create virtual worlds.\nRafi Nizam\n3D artist Rafi Nizam has worn many hats since starting his career as a web designer more than two decades ago, back when \u201cdesigning for the web was still wild,\u201d as he put it.\nHe\u2019s now becoming a leader in the next wave of creation \u2014 using extended reality and virtual production \u2014 with the help of NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for building and connecting custom 3D pipelines.\nThe London-based showrunner, creative consultant and entertainment executive previously worked at advertising agencies and led creative teams at Sony Pictures, BBC and NBCUniversal.\nIn addition to being an award-winning independent animator, director, character designer and storyteller who serves as chief creative officer at Masterpiece Studio, he\u2019s head of story at game developer Opis Group, and showrunner at Lunar-X, a next-gen entertainment company.\nPlus, in recent years, he\u2019s taken on what he considers his most important role of all \u2014 being a father. And his art is now often inspired by family.\n\u201cBeing present in the moment with my children and observing the world without preconceptions often sparks ideas for me,\u201d Nizam said.\nHis animated shorts have so far focused on themes of self care and finding stillness amidst chaos. He\u2019s at work on a new computer-graphics-animated series, ArtSquad, in which fun-loving, vibrant 3D characters form a band, playing instruments made of classroom objects and solving problems through the power of art.\n\n\u201cThe myriad of 3D apps in my animation pipeline can sync and come together in Omniverse using the Universal Scene Description framework,\u201d he said. \u201cThis interoperability allows me to be 10x more productive when visualizing my show concepts \u2014 and I\u2019ve cut my outsourcing costs by 50%, as Omniverse enables me to render, lookdev, lay out scenes and manipulate cameras by myself.\u201d\n\nFrom Concept to Creation\nNizam said he often starts his projects with \u201cgood ol\u2019 pencil and paper on a Post-it note or napkin, whenever inspiration strikes.\u201d\nHe then takes his ideas to a drawing desk, where he creates a simple sketch before honing in on pre-production using digital content-creation apps like Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop and Procreate.\n\nNizam next creates 3D production assets from his 2D sketches, manipulating them in virtual reality using Adobe Substance 3D Modeler software.\n\u201cThings start to move pretty rapidly from here,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause VR is such an intuitive way to make 3D assets. Plus, rigging and texturing in the Masterpiece Studio creative suite and Adobe Substance 3D can be near automatic.\u201d\nThe artist uses the Omniverse Create XR spatial computing app to lay out his scenes in VR. He blocks out character actions, designs sets and finalizes textures using Unreal Engine 5, Autodesk Maya and Blender software.\n\nPerformance capture through Perception Neuron Studio quickly gets Nizam close to final animation. And with the easily extensible USD framework, Nizam brings his 3D assets into the Omniverse Create app for rapid look development. Here he enhances character animation with built-in hyperrealistic physics and renders final shots in real time.\n\u201cOmniverse offers me an easy entry point to USD-based workflows, live collaboration across disciplines, rapid visualization, real-time rendering, an accessible physics engine and the easy modification of preset simulations,\u201d Nizam said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get back in and try out more ideas.\u201d\n\nAt home, Nizam uses an NVIDIA Studio workstation powered by an NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU. To create on the go, the artist turns to his NVIDIA Studio laptop from ASUS, equipped with a GeForce RTX 3060 GPU.\nIn addition, his entire workflow is accelerated by NVIDIA Studio, a platform of NVIDIA RTX and AI-accelerated creator apps, Studio Drivers and a suite of exclusive creative tools.\n\nWhen not creating transmedia projects and franchises for his clients, Nizam can be found mentoring young creators for Sony Talent League, playing make believe with his children or chilling with his two cats, Hamlet and Omelette.\nWatch Nizam\u2019s community spotlight livestream to learn more about his workflow:\n\nJoin In on the Creation\nCreators and developers across the world can download NVIDIA Omniverse for free, and enterprise teams can use the platform for their 3D projects.\nCheck out artwork from other \u201cOmnivores\u201d and submit projects in the gallery.

With regular updates that ensure a constant evolution of gameplay, features and heroes, Dota 2 has taken on a life of its own, and every day over a million people play.\nBy playing on a GeForce graphics card, desktop or laptop, Dota 2 runs at extremely high frame rates, making gameplay fast and responsive. Today, Dota 2\u2019s gameplay gets even more responsive with the addition of NVIDIA Reflex. With a single click, you\u2019ll reduce system latency by up to 23% on GeForce RTX GPUs. Of course, Reflex also delivers latency reduction on GeForce RTX and GeForce GTX 900 Series and newer GPUs.\nWith lower system latency, your clicks translate to on-screen actions even faster, helping everything from last-hitting to aegis-snatching, benefiting players of all skill levels, potentially giving you a competitive edge against players with higher system latencies.\nNVIDIA Reflex is enabled with a single click in Settings --> Video. When activated, NVIDIA Reflex reduced system latency in our pre-release testing by up to 23% on a GeForce RTX 3060 at 2560x1440.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re gaming with high frame rates, and your system latency is now optimized by NVIDIA Reflex, your next step towards top tier competitiveness is upgrading your gaming monitor. NVIDIA G-SYNC esports displays are specifically designed for high frame rate gaming in competitive titles, improving image clarity and reducing motion blur, and eliminating tearing. If you\u2019re a competitive gamer or esports pro, these are the very best monitors for upping your game.\nThis fall, G-SYNC esports displays get even better with the launch of new 27\u201d 1440p, 360Hz models from ASUS. Our research found that 1440p 27\u201d displays can improve aiming by up to 3% over traditional 1080p 24\u201d displays, when aiming at small targets, of which there are many on-screen in Dota 2. For competitive gamers and esports professionals, 3% can mean the difference between victory and defeat.\nIf you\u2019re ready to step up your game, head to our NVIDIA Reflex compatible products page for a list of NVIDIA Reflex-compatible esports gaming monitors and mice, and a list of all released NVIDIA Reflex games. To learn more about NVIDIA Reflex itself, check out our in-depth guide, and learn how to optimize other parts of your system to further reduce system latency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\n#SHOTWITHGEFORCE\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           Malaysia\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nLegal Info\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We were one of the first publications to bring you details about NVIDIA's RTX 30 series mobility lineup and today we received information from the same source about NVIDIA's RTX 40 mobility series graphics cards. To avoid compromising our source through persistent digital watermarks or even the slide layout being traced, we have recreated the slide in good ol' Excel with all relevant information retained.\nNVIDIA RTX 40 Mobility Series GPUs To Be Announced On 3rd January 2023\nBefore we begin, I want to point out that while all of us can channel the black leather jacket, at great personal cost I might add, only Jensen can truly wield it. This means that while the dates I have are pretty much set in stone right now, there is absolutely nothing stopping him from snapping his fingers and moving these around - so keep that in mind as you read. With that boilerplate out of the way, here is the bottom line: NVIDIA's RTX 40 series GPUs are expected to bring a performance improvement of roughly 30% over their older generation counterparts. NVIDIA has also made a point of noting that the RTX 4070 mobility will beat the RTX 3080 Ti by 15% - which is great news for gamers.\n\n\nNVIDIA will be launching the following GPUs at CES: RTX 4080 Ti/4090 Mobility with 16GB vRAM, RTX 4080 Mobility with 12GB vRAM, RTX 4070 Mobility with 8GB vRAM, RTX 4060 Mobility with 8GB vRAM, RTX 4050 Mobility with 6GB vRAM and an RTX 3050 with 6GB vRAM. Keep in mind the exact nomenclature could change but the underlying devices ie the GN21-X9, GN21-X6, GN21-X4, GN21-X2 and the RTX 3050 6GB will remain the same.\nThe flagship GPU in the TimeSpy benchmark slide, ie the RTX 4080 Ti (GN21-X11), is a bit of an odd one because we do not see it listed in a separate announcement slide (but do see an RTX 4090 mobility) and also not in the product roadmaps that the company shared with its partners (we do see a RTX 4090 mobility there as well). I am unsure if this means that the RTX 4090 in the announcement documents and product roadmap is the RTX 4080 Ti from the benchmarks renamed (or vice versa) or a different SKU altogether.\nThe NVIDIA RTX 40 series product announcement is currently scheduled to happen on January 3, 2023, 9 AM Pacific. Press will be seeded with the RTX 4080 mobility and the GN21-X11 (whatever NVIDIA decides to call it) first in early-February (followed by the rest of the mobility SKUs) and the reviews and product launches will happen by mid-February 2023 at the most.\nAccording to the product roadmap, we are seeing a lot of SKUs, getting announced in January, that are coupled with Intel's upcoming Raptor Lake-H CPU series. This means that Intel will also be announcing its Raptor Lake-H mobility CPU series at CES and the NVIDIA RTX 40 / Raptor Lake-H combo laptops will be among the first to market by the end of January/early February.\nNews Source: Actual Source\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n159\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n124\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n79\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n29\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n920\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cyber Monday graphics card deals are here, and there are many great values. They're also almost universally on the AMD side of the party, as Nvidia's RTX 30-series remains overpriced, relative to AMD's RX 6000-series. It feels like Nvidia's prices are still stuck in early 2022 and haven't adjusted to the new reality, and in fact Nvidia retail prices have increased compared to September.\n\nIn terms of bang for the buck, the only place AMD doesn't currently get the win is at the very top of the bang column. We'll have to wait for AMD RDNA 3 GPUs and the Radeon RX 7900-series to launch before we see a direct competitor to the RTX 4080, and maybe even the RTX 4090. But let's take the matchups on a relative performance basis and run through the categories, from highest to lowest performance and price.\n\nWe'll include overall performance results from our GPU benchmarks hierarchy for both the rasterization and ray tracing performance. Nvidia \u2014 and sometimes Intel \u2014 can stake a claim on the DXR (DirectX Raytracing) side of things, and if you feel ray tracing has lived up to the hype that's fine. In general, we still find RT effects drop performance far too much for their image fidelity gains, and upscaling algorithms like DLSS, FSR 2, and XeSS are often required.TLDR: AMD's Best Radeon ValuesWe'll go into greater detail below, covering every segment of the GPU market and showing you exactly how many fps you get for each dollar spent compared to the competition. However, if you want to know the overall best AMD Radeon values, which are also the best graphics card values overall, these are the top three:GeForce RTX 2060: now $179 at Amazon (was $279): One of the few actual deals on an Nvidia GPU, the nearly four years old RTX 2060 has finally dropped below $200. You still get better (relative) DXR performance as well as DLSS support, though the 6GB VRAM can at times prove limiting. It averaged 55.2 fps and 0.31 frames per dollar at 1080p ultra.Radeon RX 6600: now $209 at Amazon (was $279): This card with 8GB of memory and a boost clock of 2,491 MHz delivers the best frame rate per dollar. It averaged 66.7 fps at 1080p ultra settings, which is about 0.32 frames per dollar.Radeon RX 6650 XT: now $249 at Amazon (was $299): A step up from the RX 6600, the 6650 XT has 8GB of GDDR6 RAM and more GPU shaders running at a 2,635 MHz boost clock. On our 1080p ultra settings suite, it averaged 79.8 fps or about .32 frames per dollar.\u00a0Radeon RX 6750 XT: now $369 at Newegg (was $549): A strong choice for 1440p gaming, the 6750 XT features 12GB of GDDR6 RAM and a 2,618 MHz boost clock. It averaged 78.2 fps on our 1440p Ultra settings test for a rate of 0.21 1440p frames per dollar \u2014 or if you want to stick with the 1080p comparisons, it got 105.3 fps and 0.29 frames per dollar.(Image credit: Toms' Hardware)Extreme GPUs: RTX 4090 and RTX 4080AMD hasn't released its latest generation competing RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT yet, so Nvidia gets to win this one by default. Official MSRPs might actually favor the RTX 4090, but street pricing sits at 35% above the $1,599 launch price for the halo card, while the RTX 4080 can now be found starting at $1,269 \u2014 just 6% above the $1,199 MSRP. (Note: That card is now sold out.)\n\nThat's undoubtedly because RTX 4080 costs too much for the penultimate offering, and while the initial wave may have sold out, that's seemingly not happening as quickly with the subsequent waves. The result is that, at current prices, the RTX 4080 now represents the better value. Mind you, it's not a good value, but it's not hard to beat the value proposition offered by graphics cards that cost over two grand.\n\nNote: The \"Retail Price\" column links to the best current prices that we're tracking, while the GPU names link to a more generic Amazon search.Swipe to scroll horizontallyExtreme GPUsRetail Price4K Rast Ult FPS/$1440p Rast Ult FPS/$4K DXR Ult FPS/$1440p DXR Ult FPS/$GeForce RTX 4080$1,3590.06720.09570.02730.0536GeForce RTX 4090$2,3500.04950.06090.02230.0414(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Enthusiast GPUs: RX 6950 XT, RX 6900 XT, RTX 3090 Ti, and RTX 3080 TiStepping down one level from the very top of the pecking order, we get both older and more recent options. There's the RX 6950 XT that launched earlier this year alongside the RTX 3090 Ti, while Nvidia's RTX 3080 Ti from 2021 goes up against the RX 6900 XT from two years back. We can also include the OG RTX 3090 and RTX 3080 12GB, though given prices on most of these are higher than the replacement RTX 4080, obviously they won't win any prizes.\n\nWe'll stick with the 4K and 1440p comparisons, since all of these cards at least average over 60 fps in our rasterization benchmarks. For DXR, even though Nvidia does offer higher ray tracing performance, the much higher prices still end up giving AMD the overall advantage \u2014 the sole exception to that being the RTX 3080 12GB.Swipe to scroll horizontallyEnthusiast GPUsRetail Price4K Rast Ult FPS/$1440p Rast Ult FPS/$4K DXR Ult FPS/$1440p DXR Ult FPS/$Radeon RX 6900 XT$6990.09270.15390.02380.0483Radeon RX 6950 XT$7840.08970.14720.02440.0493GeForce RTX 3080 12GB$7990.08300.13010.02970.0600GeForce RTX 3080 Ti$1,1490.05780.09000.02150.0429GeForce RTX 3090$1,2400.05550.08590.02050.0410GeForce RTX 3090 Ti$1,4990.05240.07720.02050.0397(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)High-End GPUs: RX 6800 XT, RX 6800, RX 6750 XT, RX 6700 XT, RTX 3080, RTX 3070 Ti, and RTX 3070The high-end category spans a pretty wide range of prices yet again. We've got cards that are two years old like the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070, plus the more recent RTX 3070 Ti from last year. On AMD's side, there's the RX 6800 XT and RX 6800, the RX 6700 XT, and the recent RX 6750 XT refresh.\n\nWhile some of these cards can arguably still handle 4K gaming okay, we're going to drop our comparisons down to 1440p and 1080p ultra. That's the sweet spot for getting reasonably high fps out of these GPUs. Again, comparatively high prices mean AMD's GPUs take the top four spots for this category in terms of value.Swipe to scroll horizontallyHigh-End GPUsRetail Price1440p Rast Ult FPS/$1080p Rast Ult FPS/$1440p DXR Ult FPS/$1080p DXR Ult FPS/$Radeon RX 6700 XT$3390.21660.29440.06100.0988Radeon RX 6750 XT$3690.21190.28540.06050.0975Radeon RX 6800 XT$5540.18420.22990.05680.0892Radeon RX 6800$4990.18210.23380.05390.0846GeForce RTX 3070$4990.15530.19990.06290.0993GeForce RTX 3070 Ti$6090.13560.17090.05560.0873GeForce RTX 3080$7390.12930.15730.05910.0897(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Mainstream GPUs: RX 6700 10GB, RX 6650 XT, RX 6600 XT, RX 6600, RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 3060, RTX 3050, Arc A770, Arc A750We could potentially include previous generation cards in the mainstream category, but we'll confine our comparisons to the current generation offerings. Even then, we still have a lot of potential options: The relatively new RX 6700 10GB and RX 6650 XT join AMD's 2021 releases, RX 6600 XT and RX 6600. From Nvidia, we have the RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 3060, and RTX 3050. Finally, Intel joins the party with its Arc A770 and Arc A750. (Note that we don't have performance data from the A770 8GB yet, so we'll skip that one \u2014 and we think it's worth the extra $20 to get 16GB regardless.)\n\nWith these ostensibly mainstream offerings, we'll stick with 1440p and 1080p ultra for rasterization tests, and drop down to 1080p ultra for rasterization and 1080p medium for DXR \u2014 this is really the last category where it even makes any sense at all to mention ray tracing.Swipe to scroll horizontallyMainstream GPUsRetail Price1440p Rast Ult FPS/$1080p Rast Ult FPS/$1080p DXR Ult FPS/$1080p DXR Med FPS/$Radeon RX 6650 XT$2490.22790.32060.10490.1564Radeon RX 6600$2090.22070.31910.09920.1518GeForce RTX 2060$1790.21630.30840.12560.2098Radeon RX 6700 10GB$3190.19910.27490.09450.1399Radeon RX 6600 XT$2890.19000.26990.08660.1308Intel Arc A750$2740.20160.26070.10980.1773GeForce RTX 3060 Ti$3890.17910.23520.11120.1678Intel Arc A770 16GB$3490.17860.23010.10610.1721GeForce RTX 3060$3150.16690.22280.10250.1548GeForce RTX 3050$2640.14250.19480.08640.1317(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Budget GPUs: RX 6500 XT, RX 6400, GTX 1660 Super, GTX 1660, GTX 1650, Arc A380Last and least, as far as prices go, we have the budget category. AMD and Intel GPUs in this price bracket still offer ray tracing hardware... but performance tends to be in the sub-20 fps range so it truly doesn't matter. We've included AMD's RX 6500 XT and RX 6400 Navi 24 GPUs, Nvidia's previous generation GTX 1660 Super, GTX 1660, and GTX 1650, and Intel's Arc A380.\n\nWe'll show fps/$ for 1080p ultra and medium this round \u2014 only 1080p medium for DXR \u2014 and as noted the Nvidia cards won't have DXR results. Some games can reasonably run at higher settings and 60 fps, at least on some of these GPUs, but we need to use the same metric for the comparisons.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Swipe to scroll horizontallyBudget GPUsRetail Price1080p Rast Ult FPS/$1080p Rast Med FPS/$1080p DXR Med FPS/$Radeon RX 6500 XT$1490.20670.44150.0749GeForce GTX 1660$1790.22480.4193\u00a0GeForce GTX 1660 Super$1990.22770.4163\u00a0Radeon RX 6400$1290.18340.40280.0697Intel Arc A380$1390.20370.39380.1142GeForce GTX 1650 GDDR6$1590.18110.3564Row 5 - Cell 4 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nCyber Monday \nrdna\nray tracing\nRadeon\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (34)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

Tom's does write pro AMD articles, they're just more pro Radeon and anti Ryzen.\n\nI do think this article needed writing--well done. Buyers tend to just think \"GeForce is better\" and that's mostly not true. I do have a game from 1999 that has trouble on my Radeon drivers though.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Historical Fidelity\n\n\ndrivinfast247 said:WTAF?I think what Amdlova is talking about is that AMD has a dedicated hardware scheduler on its graphics cards which offloads a lot of CPU overhead meaning older/slower CPU\u2019s aren\u2019t as big of a bottleneck when paired with an AMD graphics card vs nvidia. \n\nOf course, it could just be Amdlova trolling nvidia fans and he was not talking about the hardware scheduler at all\u2026\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshady28\n\n\nI agree with the article, bought a 6700 XT for $330 about a month ago. I haven't used an AMD card since, well, I think it was an ATi 9700XT or some such. \n\nI had always said it was worth an extra $50 or so for more stable drivers, but Nvidia cards are just way overpriced even after the recent price declines and it's by more than $50 - way more now. The 3060 Ti is still north of $400, and the 6700 XT marginally outperforms it. \n\nI've no overt issues at all with drivers, and the AMD control panel is simpler and easier to use. However, I've had a couple of instances in the last month where when my PC goes to sleep the monitor won't come back on. No idea if that's related or a coincidence.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJarredWaltonGPU\n\n\ndalauder said:Okay, I was wrong before.

Buyers tend to just think \"GeForce is better\" and that's mostly not true. I do have a game from 1999 that has trouble on my Radeon drivers though.We're not anti-AMD. Paul has written some good reviews of Ryzen CPUs. The issue with Ryzen right now is that the AM5 parts are relatively overpriced \u2014 not so much the CPU, but the motherboards are expensive. Given Intel's chips often still end up faster (13th Gen stuff), there's a reason AMD is putting the 7000-series on serious discount. And we've written those articles as well. You'll notice Intel CPUs aren't going on sale, other than maybe $10 of 12th gen parts.\n\nI've swapped and tested GPUs from both companies so many times that I've lost count. For the past year or more, I've really had nothing that I would quantify as an overtly negative experience on the AMD or Nvidia side. Sometimes, things can go a bit quirky, but often that's just because I change GPUs so darn often. Run DDU, clear out all the AMD, Intel, and Nvidia GPU drivers, do a clean install: It almost always works fine. And by \"almost always\" I mean I'm sure I've had the occasional hiccup with all brands at some point, but lately it's all gone about as well as could be expected.\n\nNvidia's advantage right now is that it has DLSS support (still not totally sold on DLSS3 though), plus Reflex. Reflex is in more games than Anti-Lag and probably works better overall. And Nvidia does have better DXR hardware. How much extra are those items worth? That's the difficult thing to assess. For all the games that don't have any special Nvidia features (DXR, DLSS, Reflex), you might end up paying 25% to as much as 50% more than equivalently performing AMD hardware. But if you start factoring in DLSS2... well, it's still a bit of a nebulous target.\n\nPersonally, I think spending 10% more for equivalent performance Nvidia could easily be justifiable, maybe even 20%. That's using my base level of performance (meaning no DXR or DLSS). So if you want a high-end card like an RTX 3080, even if we use the $700 price (which requires sketchier hardware brands), you're looking at that or the RX 6800 XT. AMD's card is $515, so Nvidia costs 36% more. That's just too big of a jump in my book.\n\nAnd looking at the upcoming cards, hypothetically the RX 7900 XT might outperform the RTX 4080 while costing $300 less. Like, it wouldn't surprise me to see AMD (in rasterization games) delivering 10% better performance. Which means the 4080 might end up at something like a 45% price premium, for getting DLSS, DLSS3, Reflex, and DXR boosts. It's becoming an awfully wide gap that favors AMD.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 34 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Jensen Huang\u2019s Nvidia GTC 2025 keynote here \u2014 Blackwell 300 AI GPUs expected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU meets PCIe-based hard drives: Seagate and Nvidia demo NVMe HDDs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD's beastly Ryzen AI Max+ 395 comes to a new GMKTec mini-PC, and AMD's Lisa Su appears to approve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel finally releases the XeSS 2.0 SDK for developers \u2014 Technology still gated by closed-source barriers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070-series GPU supply to stabilize after April claims AIB partner Yeston\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew undersea cable tech listens for sabotage \u2014 can be retrofitted to existing fiber optic lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm debuts new Snapdragon G handheld gaming PC chips to compete with Intel and AMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina to spend $55 billion on R&D in 2025 \u2014 Semiconductor, AI and quantum computing fields to benefit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBambu Lab Announces New Printer: H2D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotherboard dies after marathon 100-hour BIOS update process, vigil attended by thousands online\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

While we reported their full GPU market share report a few days ago, today, we will be talking specifically about the discrete GPU numbers which are just as grim as the full PC share report.\nDespite Dwindling GPU Shipments, NVIDIA Gains Discrete GPU Market Share Big Time While AMD Falls Below Single-Digit Figures\nDuring Q3 2022, total PC GPU shipments declined by -25.1% (Y/Y) out of which desktop graphics saw a -15.43% decline and notebook graphics saw a -30% decline. This was termed as 'the biggest drop since the 2009' recision by Jon Peddie himself. More on the overall GPU market share here.\nRelated Story AMD Targets NVIDIA\u2019s Grace & Intel Granite Rapids Xeon CPUs With New 5th Gen EPYC Performance Showcase, Up To 2.75x Power Efficiency\n\nSo coming to the discrete GPU market share numbers, the report tells us that the dGPU shipments decline to 14 million units versus 24 million units in the previous year. That's a drop of -41.6% & is quite massive if you consider that the third quarter is usually the strongest growth quarter for PCs. During this quarter, NVIDIA managed to raise its market hold to 88%, a record number followed by AMD whose market hold declined to single-digit figures of just 8%. Intel managed to more or less retain its share hold of 4%, witnessing a 1% decline from the previous quarter but a solid 4-5% gain versus the previous year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe market saw a large uptick in GPU shipments for a brief two-year period all thanks to the crypto craze but it has been on a decline ever since. Currently, the number has fallen before the 100M unit shipments and doing a breakdown, we can see that all segments are mostly down. The desktop & notebook discrete shipments have taken a landslide fall while the desktop and notebook integrated side remains steady and in line with previous years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nIf you take a look at the individual desktop and notebook GPU share statistics, the desktop side fared slightly better with a slight increase in shipments from 26 million in the previous quarter to 28 million this quarter. The notebook side saw the biggest drop from 58 million last quarter & 48 million shipments this quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nOnce again, the desktop discrete GPU market declined to just 7 million units from 10 million in the previous quarter and 13 million in the previous year. Meanwhile, the integrated GPU shipments on desktops boosted from 15% (Q/Q) and 20% (Y/Y) to 21 million in Q3 2022. As of right now, the total PC iGPUs shipment is around 62 Million units while the total PC dGPU shipments are around 14M units.\nUnit shipments, segments and vendor share (Credits: JPR)\n\n\n\nQ3 2022DesktopNotebookTotal\n\n\n\n\nWorkstation0.721.051.77\n\n\nHigh-end2.424.456.87\n\n\nMidrange2.78NA2.78\n\n\nEntry-level0.961.472.43\n\n\nIntegrated20.7840.8561.63\n\n\nTotal27.6747.8275.49\n\n\n\nGPU Unit Shipments By Segment & Platform in millions (Credits: JPR)\n\n\n\nQ3'22DesktopNotebookTotal\n\n\n\n\nWorkstation\n\n\nAMD0.040.000.04\n\n\nIntel---\n\n\nNvidia0.691.051.74\n\n\nHigh-end\n\n\nAMD0.130.200.33\n\n\nIntel-0.360.36\n\n\nNvidia2.293.936.22\n\n\nMidrange\n\n\nAMD0.34-0.34\n\n\nIntel0.26-0.26\n\n\nNvidia2.18-2.18\n\n\nEntry-level\n\n\nAMD0.180.160.34\n\n\nIntel---\n\n\nNvidia0.781.272.05\n\n\nIntegratedDesktopNotebookTotal\n\n\nAMD2.075.877.94\n\n\nIntel18.7134.9853.69\n\n\nDesktopNotebookTotal\n\n\nAMD2.766.238.98\n\n\nIntel18.9735.3454.31\n\n\nNvidia5.946.2512.19\n\n\nTotal27.6747.8275.49\n\n\n\nBoth AMD and NVIDIA have been trying to clear their last-gen GPU inventories to make room for next-gen GPUs. While NVIDIA has launched two next-gen products, the GeForce RTX 4090 & the RTX 4080, they are positioned in the ultra enthusiast segment with prices above $1200 US. We've come to know that the green team has shipped over 150,000 RTX 40 GPUs to date and that one of the two GPUs hasn't managed to attract the audience well. The company is still trying to get rid of older RTX 30 series inventory by respinning its mainstream 3060 and 3070 series cards with slightly better specs and promos since the 40 series mainstream cards are a few months away from now.\n\nAMD on the other hand has been doing the same however the ASP for NVIDIA cards is simply a lot higher than the Radeon options at the moment. The company is also on the verge of launchings its next-gen Radeon RX 7000 series cards which are expected to offer better value than NVIDIA's high-end offerings but that remains to be seen. Intel on the other hand just launched its Arc high-end lineup for desktops and will be doing the same for laptops soon. Raja Koduri said that they want to get Arc in millions of PCs every year however the first year for Arc hasn't gone that smoothly. Still, having gained a 4-5% share in a single year is a decent step for the newly formed graphics division.\n\n\n\nWhat GPU do you have in your PC right now?\n\n\n AMD Discrete GPU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n AMD Integrated GPU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Intel Discrete GPU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Intel Integrated GPU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA Discrete GPU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich discrete GPU do you have in your PC right now?\n\n\n AMD (Pre RDNA GPU)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n AMD (RDNA 1/2 GPU)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA (Pre RTX GPU)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA (RTX 20/30 GPU)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA (RTX 40 GPU)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Intel (Arc GPU)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJP Morgan Believes AMD\u2019s AI GPU Business Would Grow By 60 Percent This Year, Highlights Oracle\u2019s Initial Order Of 30,000 MI355X GPUs\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n129\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n92\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n59\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Here\u2019s where you can hopefully snag one for yourself.by  Alice Jovan\u00e9eNov 16, 2022, 1:00 PM UTCLinkFacebookThreadsIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.Just like the 30-series, the RTX 4080 is likely to sell out fast. Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeI still get flashbacks of the nightmarish launch of Nvidia\u2019s 30-series graphics cards, with stock selling out faster than you could enter your credit card info. The cards were getting gobbled up by bots and crypto miners, leaving many gamers stuck with the option of buying them secondhand at a ridiculous markup.Hopefully, some retailers have learned from their mistakes and can provide a more streamlined experience because Nvidia\u2019s 40-series graphics cards are here, and while the cost of admission is high, with the Founders Edition of the RTX 4080 going for $1,199.99, that won\u2019t be enough to dissuade PC gamers hungry to be on the bleeding edge of performance.Nvidia\u2019s new card officially goes on sale at 9AM ET today, and while Newegg and Best Buy have set up landing pages for the RTX 4080, other retailers, like Walmart, B&H Photo, and Amazon, don\u2019t have anything we can point to currently.RelatedNvidia RTX 4080 review: performance, for a priceNvidia RTX 4090 review: a 4K beastMicro Center will also have various models of the RTX 4080 available at launch, but only at its brick-and-mortar locations; you can check here to see if there\u2019s a store near you if you feel inclined to try and get one there.There\u2019s also no official word from retailers as to when exactly the cards will go on sale, so our advice is to bookmark the pages for whatever model you\u2019re planning to pick up and refresh them frequently. You\u2019ll also want to create an account with each retailer and log in, as some won\u2019t allow you to check out without one.Below, we\u2019ve linked to the various aftermarket models of the RTX 4080 that will be available alongside the Nvidia Founders Edition Card at launch, where to find them, and how much they cost.NeweggGigabyte GeForce RTX 4080 Eagle ($1,199.99)Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4080 Eagle OC ($1,239.99)Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4080 Gaming OC ($1,269.99)Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4080 Aero OC ($1,299.99)Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4080 Aorus Master ($1,349.99)Asus GeForce RTX 4080 TUF ($1,199.99)Asus GeForce RTX 4080 TUF Gaming OC ($1,399.99)Asus GeForce RTX 4080 Strix ($1,549.99)MSI GeForce RTX 4080 Ventus 3X (Price TBD)MSI GeForce RTX 4080 Ventus 3X OC ($1,249.99)MSI GeForce RTX 4080 Gaming X Trio ($1,309.99)MSI GeForce RTX 4080 Suprim ($1,399.99)PNY GeForce RTX 4080 XLR8 ($1,199.99)PNY GeForce RTX 4080 XLR8 OC (Price TBD)Zotac GeForce RTX 4080 AMP Extreme AIRO ($1,399.99)Zotac GeForce RTX 4080 Trinity ($1,199.99)Zotac GeForce RTX 4080 Trinity OC ($1,299.99)Best BuyNvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition ($1,199.99)Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4080 Eagle ($1,199.99)Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4080 Eagle OC ($1,239.99)Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4080 Gaming OC ($1,269.99)Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4080 Aero OC ($1,299.99)Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4080 Aorus Master ($1,349.99)Asus GeForce RTX 4080 TUF Gaming ($1,399.99)Asus GeForce RTX 4080 Strix ($1,549.99)MSI GeForce RTX 4080 Ventus 3X OC ($1,249.99)MSI GeForce RTX 4080 Gaming X Trio ($1,309.99)PNY GeForce RTX 4080 XLR8 ($1,199.99)Verge DealsSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we\u2019ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

We\u2019re also deep diving on new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\nContent creators can now pick up the GeForce RTX 4080 GPU, available from top add-in card providers including ASUS, Colorful, Gainward, Galaxy, GIGABYTE, INNO3D, MSI, Palit, PNY and ZOTAC, as well as from system integrators and builders worldwide.\nTalented filmmaker Casey Faris and his team at Release the Hounds! Studio step In the NVIDIA Studio this week to share their short, sci-fi-inspired film, Tuesday on Earth.\nIn addition, the November Studio Driver is ready for download to enhance existing creative app features, reduce repetitive tasks and speed up creative ones.\nPlus, the NVIDIA Studio #WinterArtChallenge is underway \u2014 check out some featured artists at the end of this post.\nBeyond Fast \u2014 GeForce RTX 4080 GPU Now Available\nThe new GeForce RTX 4080 GPU brings a massive boost in performance of up to 1.6x compared to the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU, thanks to third-generation RT Cores, fourth-generation Tensor Cores, eighth-generation dual AV1 encoders and 16GB memory \u2014 plenty to edit up to 12K RAW video files or large 3D scenes.\nThe new GeForce RTX 4080 GPU.\n3D artists can now work with accurate and realistic lighting, physics and materials while creating 3D scenes \u2014 all in real time, without proxies. DLSS 3, now available in the NVIDIA Omniverse beta, uses RTX Tensor Cores and the new Optical Flow Accelerator to generate additional frames and dramatically increase frames per second (FPS). This improves smoothness in the viewport. Unity and Unreal Engine 5 will soon release updated versions with DLSS 3.\nVideo and livestreaming creative workflows are also accelerated by the new AV1 encoder, with 40% increased encoding efficiency, unlocking higher resolutions and crisper image quality. AV1 is integrated in OBS Studio, DaVinci Resolve and Adobe Premiere Pro, the latter through the Voukoder plug-in.\nThe new dual encoders capture up to 8K resolution at 60 FPS in real time via GeForce Experience and OBS Studio, and cut video export times nearly in half. Popular video-editing apps have released updates to enable this setting, including Adobe Premiere Pro (via the popular Voukoder plug-in) and Jianying Pro \u2014 China\u2019s top video-editing app. Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve and MAGIX Vegas Pro also added dual-encoder support this week.\nState-of-the-art AI technology \u2014 including AI image generators and new editing tools in DaVinci Resolve and Adobe apps like Photoshop and Premiere Pro \u2014 is taking creators to the next level. It allows them to brainstorm concepts quickly, helps them easily apply advanced effects, and removes their tedious, repetitive tasks. Fourth-gen Tensor Cores found on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs help speed all of these AI tools, delivering up to a 2x increase in performance over the previous generation.\nExpand creative possibilities and pick up the GeForce RTX 4080 GPU today. Check out this product finder for retail availability and visit GeForce.com for further information.\nAnother Tuesday on Earth\nFilmmaker Casey Faris and the team at Release the Hounds! Studio love science fiction. Their short film Tuesday on Earth is an homage to their favorite childhood sci-fi flicks, including E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Men in Black and Critters.\nIt was challenging to \u201ccreate something that felt epic, but wasn\u2019t way too big of a story to fit in a couple of minutes,\u201d Faris said.\n\nPreproduction was mostly done with rough sketches on an iPad using the popular digital-illustration app Procreate. Next, the team filmed all the sequences. \u201cWe spent many hours out in the forest getting eaten by mosquitos, lots of time locked in a tiny bathroom and way too many lunch breaks at the secondhand store buying spaceship parts,\u201d joked Faris.\nAre you seeing what we\u2019re seeing? Motion blur effects applied faster with RTX GPU acceleration.\nAll 4K footage was copied to Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve 18 through the Hedge app that runs checksums, ensuring the video files are properly transferred and quickly generating backup footage.\n\u201cNVIDIA is the obvious choice if you talk to any creative professional. It\u2019s never a question whether we get an NVIDIA GPU \u2014 just which one we get.\u201d \u2014 filmmaker Casey Faris\n\nFaris specializes in DaVinci Resolve because of its versatility. \u201cWe can do just about anything in one app, on one timeline,\u201d he said. \u201cThis makes it really easy to iterate on our comps, re-edits and sound-mixing adjustments \u2014 all of it\u2019s no big deal as it\u2019s all living together.\u201d\nDaVinci Resolve is powerful, professional-grade software that relies heavily on GPU acceleration to get the job done. Faris\u2019 GeForce RTX 3070-powered system was up to the task.\nHis RTX GPU afforded NVIDIA Studio benefits within DaVinci Resolve software. The RTX-accelerated hardware encoder and decoder sped up video transcoding, enabling Faris to edit faster.\nFootage adjustments and movement within the timeline was seamless, with virtually no slowdown, resulting in more efficient video-bay sessions.\nEven color grading was sped up due to his RTX GPU, he said.\nColor grade faster with NVIDIA and GeForce RTX GPUs in DaVinci Resolve.\nAI-powered features accelerated by Faris\u2019 GeForce RTX GPU played a critical role.\n\nThe Detect Scene Cuts feature, optimized by RTX GPUs, quickly detected tag cuts in video files, eliminating painstakingly long scrubbing sessions just to make manual edits, a boon for Faris\u2019 efficiency.\nTo add special effects, Faris worked within the RTX GPU-accelerated Fusion page in DaVinci Resolve, a note-based workflow with hundreds of 2D and 3D tools for creating true Hollywood-caliber effects. Blockbusters like The Hunger Games and Marvel\u2019s The Avengers were made in Fusion.\nFaris used Object Mask Tracking, powered by the DaVinci Neural Engine, to intuitively isolate subjects, all with simple paint strokes. This made it much easier to mask the male hero and apply that vibrant purple hue in the background. With the new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, this feature is 70% faster than with the previous generation.\n\u201cAutomatic Depth Map\u201d powered by AI in DaVinci Resolve.\nIn addition, Faris used the Automatic Depth Map AI feature to instantly generate a 3D depth matte of a scene, quickly grading the foreground from the background. Then, he changed the mood of the home-arrival scene by adding environmental fog effects. Various scenes mimicked the characteristics of different high-quality lenses by adding blur or depth of field to further enhance shots.\n3D animations in Blender.\nEven when moving to Blender Cycles for the computer-generated imagery, RTX-accelerated OptiX ray tracing in the viewport enabled Faris to craft 3D assets with smooth, interactive movement in photorealistic detail.\nFaris is thankful to be able to share these adventures with the world. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to teach people to be creative and make their own awesome stuff,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s what I like the most. We can make something cool, but it\u2019s even better if it inspires others.\u201d\nFilmmaker Casey Faris.\nFaris recently acquired the new GeForce RTX 4080 GPU to further accelerate his video editing workflows.\n\nGet his thoughts in the video above and check out Faris\u2019 YouTube channel.\nJoin the #WinterArtChallenge\nEnter NVIDIA Studio\u2019s #WinterArtChallenge, running through the end of the year, by sharing winter-themed art on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook for a chance to be featured on our social media channels.\n\n\u2744 Winter is coming and so is our next Studio Community Challenge! \u2744\ufe0f\nJoin our Nov-Dec #WinterArtChallenge by sharing winter art that you've made, like this great one from @pra5han for a chance to be featured on our channels. \u26c4\nTag #WinterArtChallenge so we can see your post! pic.twitter.com/8tpoyNBXXJ\n\u2014 NVIDIA Studio (@NVIDIAStudio) November 1, 2022\n\nLike @RippaSats, whose celestial rendering Mystic Arctic invokes the hearts and spirits of many.\nhttps://twitter.com/RippaSats/status/1588357356572004352\nOr @CrocodilePower and her animation Reflection, which delivers more than meets the eye.\n\n#winterartchallengeReflectionhttps://t.co/FURwpCnLYh pic.twitter.com/woQMKT0GdL\n\u2014 CrocodilePower (@CrocodilePower) November 3, 2022\n\nAnd be sure to tag #WinterArtChallenge to join.\nGet creativity-inspiring updates directly to your inbox by subscribing to the NVIDIA Studio newsletter.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | Creators | GeForce | In the NVIDIA Studio | NVIDIA RTX | NVIDIA Studio | NVIDIA Studio Driver | Omniverse | Rendering \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

The RTX 4080 offers some outstanding gaming performance that will make any PC gamer happy, especially if you can take advantage of the new DLSS 3 Frame Generation technology.If you're a creative as well, this could be a compelling card for you to use if the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is a bit too expensive for you budget, as it offers some of the best creative workload performance of any graphics card out there.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5080 review: nearly RTX 4090 performance for a whole lot less\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5090 review: the supercar of graphics cards\n\n\n\nBut that is ultimately the story of the RTX 4080. It lives in the shadow of the RTX 4090 that preceded it to market, and although it's 25% cheaper than the best Nvidia GeForce graphics card going (at least when it comes to performance), it's still too close in price to make a compelling case for itself.Check out our live blog on where to buy the RTX 4080 for help in getting the GPU.If you absolutely cannot afford to pay the extra cash for an RTX 4090 under any circumstances, then the RTX 4080 makes sense as a purchase. What would have made more sense was for Nvidia to \"cancel\" this card and release it six months from now as the RTX 4080 Ti or Super while giving us the RTX 4080 12GB instead at its $899 (around \u00a3800 / AU$1,200) MSRP.At least in that case, all things being the same, we'd be complaining about the $200 increase in price over the RTX 3080, but with the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX coming in at $999 (around \u00a3850 / AU$1,500), Nvidia could make an argument in its favor, one that it might have won. Plus, there'd be enough of a distance between the RTX 4080 and the RTX 4090 that we'd have no business comparing the two.But at such a narrow gap between the price tags between the two cards, you are simply overpaying for the RTX 4080, and you shouldn't buy it if you can help it. If you're going to pay this much for a premium graphics card, just get the RTX 4090.Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080: Price & availability(Image credit: Future)How much is it? MSRP listed at $1,199 (about \u00a31,080, AU$1,740)When is it out? It is available November 16, 2022Where can you get it? Available in the US, UK, and AustraliaThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 is available as of November 16, 2022, with an MSRP of $1,199 (about \u00a31,080, AU$1,740), which is a 71% increase over the MSRP of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 it replaces. In fact, it is the same MSRP as the Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti, which is downright madening.Should this be the RTX 4080 Ti? Initially, before Nvidia pulled the launch, there was an Nvidia RTX 4080 12GB variant that was set to sell for $899. There's been some talk that this card is really the Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti, but it could equally be said to be the true RTX 4080, since at least its pricing would be closer to appropriate in that case.Instead we have a graphics card that is well into premium market pricing, in which case you might as well spend another month or two mowing lawns, shoveling snow, writing freelance articles, or pulling a few overtime shifts and shell out for the RTX 4090. If you're already paying this much money for a graphics card, why the hell should you settle for second best?The pricing on this card in particular makes very little sense and weighs heavily against it, which is a shame. Its performance per dollar is actually quite good, and in a world where the RTX 4090 wasn't so close in price, we'd tell you to buy it.The situation becomes even more gobsmacking when you consider that a lot of third-party cards are just going to increase the price over the RTX 4080 Founders Edition that we reviewed. Some might even sell for roughly the same price as the RTX 4090 Founders Edition, which is still leagues ahead (performance-wise) of any RTX 4080 on the market.In short, if this card were $799, it would be Best-in-Class material. Even at $999, it would have easily gotten four if not four-and-a-half stars. At $1,199, we simply can't. We just can't. Hell, if you're looking for the best bang for your buck, go with the RTX 3080. It's a spectacular card and right now you can probably get it for ridiculously cheap.\u00a0Today's best Nvidia RTX 4080 deals $2,749.99View $9,999ViewLow StockWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesValue: 1.5 / 5Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080: features & chipset(Image credit: Future)68% of the CUDA cores of the RTX 4090DLSS 3 capable16GB VRAM limits 8K performanceNvidia GeForce RTX 4080 key specsGPU: AD103\nCUDA cores: 9,728\nTensor cores: 304\nRay tracing cores: 76\nPower draw (TGP): 320W\nBase clock: 2,210MHz\nBoost clock: 2,510MHz\nVRAM: 16GB GDDR6X\nBandwith: 717 GB/s\nBus interface: PCIe 4.0 x16\nOutputs: 1 x HDMI 2.1, 3 x DisplayPort 1.4a\nPower connector:\u00a01 x 16-pinSo, when it comes to the chipset of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080, you can pretty much take the RTX 4090 and cut it in half and that's pretty much what you're getting here.It has many of the same features of the RTX 4090, so it's built using the same 4nm process as the 4090, features the same ray-tracing cores and tensor cores, and allows you to use DLSS 3 frame generation technology which is a substantial improvement over DLSS 2.0.But, it is still roughly 68% of the die that the RTX 4090 uses, at about 75% of the price. Further, the 16GB GDDR6X VRAM means that you really don't have enough memory for 8K graphics (without DLSS 3 support at least), so this should be seen as strictly a 4K graphics card, while the RTX 4090 can theoretically dive into the 8K gaming space.What you can get with the RTX 4080 is DLSS 3, which is genuinely impressive. In the one game we tested with native, public Frame Generation support that could be independently verified (F1 2022), Frame generation netted about 30 fps higher on quality settings the DLSS 2.0 without frame generation technology and nearly four times that on ultra performance settings with frame generation enabled.This is a substantial improvement that gamers will definitely appreciate, but at the moment, only a few games support it, so the rush to buy this card for Frame Generation alone makes little sense. We'd recommend you wait until the RTX 4070 launches for much cheaper, or see what AMD has in store for the RX 7900 XTX before pulling the proverbial trigger on this one.Features & Chipset:\u00a03.5 / 5Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080: design(Image credit: Future)16-pin connector is an ongoing concernThe same length at the RTX 4090, but a little thinner and lighterSame look as the RTX 3080The Nvidia Gefore RTX 4080 is nearly identical to the RTX 4090, though it is a little bit thinner and about a few ounces lighter, so refer back to our RTX 4090 review for our impressions of the overall design.We have to talk about the burning elephant in the room though, and that is the melting 12VHPWR cables that some have reported as a potential fire hazard.To be clear, we have not experienced any issues with the cards we've tested, and so far everything looks to be in working order.\u00a0That said, there's no getting around the fact that these claims are out there, and they look at least credible enough to be concerning. AMD is launching the RX 7900 XTX with two 8-pin connectors for a total board power of 335W (officially), which is higher than the RTX 4080's 320W power draw.That ostensibly means that Nvidia didn't have to use the new 16-pin connector on the RTX 4080, at least from a power perspective, but chose to do so anyway. We can argue about the 4-pin data connection on top of the 12-pin power connector, but with all eyes on what AMD has in store for the RX 7900 XTX, this decision to forgo the standard ATX power supply connections in favor of a semi-proprietary one looks increasingly risky.\u00a0In its plus column, the RTX 4080 only hit a max TDP of 311W, while the RTX 3080 hit close to 350W, which means that all the performance improvements of the RTX 4080 comes at a lower cost, which we love to see.Design: 3.5 / 5Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080: performance(Image credit: Future)Fantastic performance, gaming and otherwiseSurprisingly energy efficientPutting everything else aside, there's no denying the Nvidia RTX 4080 is an outstanding performer, whether its synthetic benchmarks measuring raw performance, creative performance, or gaming performance.Image 1 of 8(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)The RTX 4080 easily beats the best of the last generation, the Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti, and often it does so handily on synthetic benchmarks, but it is well behind the RTX 4090, which makes sense given that it has about 68% of the physical hardware to compete.Image 1 of 5(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)In term of creative benchmarks, the RTX 4080 is the second best graphics card you can buy behind the RTX 4090, and there isn't much to compete against it unless you're looking for something for video editing or photo editing.In the latter two cases, processors are much more important than graphics cards, but when it comes to 3D rendering, the RTX 4090 takes the title in a walk-off win. The RTX 4080 is second best, but a fairly distant second.Image 1 of 11(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)It's a very similar situation when it comes to gaming. The RTX 4090 easily gets dozens of additional fps in many of the best PC games, which makes the RTX 4090 a far, far more compelling option for gaming than the RTX 4080, especially if you've waited and saved afor the past two years for a new GPU.If that's the case, wait a bit longer and get the RTX 4090, you'll be glad you did.Performance: 4.5 / 5Should you buy an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080?(Image credit: Future)Buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 if\u2026You can't afford the RTX 4090\nThe RTX 4090 is an expensive proposition, so the RTX 4080 is a viable alternative for a premium GPU for less.You want an energy efficient card\nThe Nvidia RTX 4080 can hit peak performance at just under 320W, which is fantastic.Don\u2019t buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 if\u2026You have any room in you budget\nIf you can save up an extra couple hundred dollars or pounds, you can get a much better RTX 4090, and you should do so.You're looking to do 8K gaming\nIf you want to dabble in 8K gaming, the 16GB VRAM in the RTX 4080 really isn't enough to really allow for 8K gaming at anything like a playable frame rate.Also considerNvidia GeForce RTX 4090\nIf you have any room in your budget, this is the graphics card you should buy, hands down.\nRead the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 reviewNvidia GeForce RTX 3080\nIf you're looking for the best performance to price contender, the RTX 3080 is the card for you.\nRead the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 reviewAMD Radeon RX 6950 XT\nIf you are just looking for an outstanding gaming graphics card, the RX 6950 XT is the best AMD graphics card on the market and is definitely a competitive option while keeping things relatively more affordable.\nRead the full AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT reviewNvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Report CardSwipe to scroll horizontallyValueThis card is a compelling value proposition, so long as you don't consider the RTX 4090 is, like, right there.1.5 / 5Features & chipsetThe RTX 4080 is about 68% of the RTX 4090 when it comes to transistor count, ray tracing cores, and more, but you do get DLSS 3 which is pretty game-changing.3.5 / 5DesignThe RTX 4080 Founders Edition is an attractive card, but the ongoing 12VHPWR connector issues are a concern, and the necessity of this power connector is questionable.3.5 / 5PerformanceThere's no doubt that the RTX 4080 is a powerful GPU, but it is still the second best GPU on the market right now, and the RX 7900 XTX could be a much more powerful offering.4.5 / 5TotalThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 is a powerful graphics card that is great for everyone who absolutely cannot get an RTX 4090, but everyone else should buy the RTX 4090, and it shouldn't even be a debate. 3.25 / 5First reviewed in November 2022\n\n\nJohn LoefflerSocial Links NavigationComponents EditorJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.

We are aware of about 50 cases globally,\u201d a company spokesperson told Gamers Nexus editor-in-chief Stephen Burke, according to a video Gamers Nexus posted to its YouTube channel Friday morning.\n\u201cOur findings to date suggest that a common issue is that connectors are not fully plugged into the graphics card,\u201d Nvidia told Burke. \u201cTo help ensure the connector is secure, we recommend plugging the power dongle into the graphics card first to ensure it\u2019s firmly and evenly plugged in, before plugging the graphics card into the motherboard.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia officials also told Burke that returned cable adapters all appeared to show wear damage indicating they weren\u2019t fully seated. The company also posted its statement on its customer help page where it shows what a properly inserted cable looks like. \nNvidia\u2019s statement largely seems to back up what Burke and his team discovered yesterday: An excessively loose 12VHPWR connector in the GPU can lead to high temperatures which melts the connector. \n\nIn the Gamers Nexus investigation, the failed connectors Burke obtained often had physical damage, indicating the plug had largely backed out of the GPU. Gamers Nexus also largely concluded that debris from manufacturing, as well as debris caused by consumers possibly inserting and removing the connector, could possibly cause the RTX 4090 cables to melt but the most likely cause was a loose connector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$3,499.95 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\nOthers, including Techlab.net.br\u2019s Ronaldo Buassali and Jon Gerow, Director of Research at Corsair, had done their own testing previously and concluded the connector is well able to handle the current being pushed through it\u2014so long as it is fully connected.\n\n\nOf course, the lingering question is whether the improper insertions stem from an underlying connector design issue or not. With evidence now clear that the cable is capable supporting the power behind it, many are wondering if the latch could be improved or not.\nNvidia officials did tell Burke that \u201cWe are investigating additional ways to ensure that the connector is secure before powering on the graphics card.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nOther ideas have been floated, such as having the cards refuse to post if the sense pins on the plugs are not fully seated. The PCI-SIG group, in fact, has been said to be considering design changes to the new plug.\nNvidia also responded to concerns by consumers that it would not honor warranties if a consumer uses a \u201cthird-party adapter\u201d 12VHPWR connector, such as the custom and modded right-angle cables people are buying in hopes of avoiding a melted connector. That raised concerns Nvidia and board partners would then not honor a warranty if the native 12VHPWR connector on a new PSU was used.\n\n\nIn a statement released to PCWorld a company spokesman said the concern was unwarranted. \u201cNVIDIA and our partners are committed to supporting our customers, regardless of the cable or power supply used,\u201d an Nvidia spokesman said.\nPerhaps more importantly, Nvidia also told Gamers Nexus that it and partners would honor RMAs from cards damaged by improper insertion. \u201cAnybody who has an issue [relating to this] will be taken care of,\u201d the company told Burke. \u201cWe\u2019ll expedite an RMA.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nSo how many GeForce RTX 4090 cards suffered from melting connectors? Gamers Nexus reports that board partners have told it 125,000 GeForce RTX 4090 cards have been sold, which would put the known failure rate at 0.04 percent, Burke said.\nThe statement comes a day after a GeForce RTX 4090 owner apparently filed a class-action suit against Nvidia over the melting connectors, according to a report in Tom\u2019s Hardware.\u00a0\n\n\nLucas Genova filed his suit on Nov. 11 and alleges that Nvidia \u201cmarketed and sold the RTX 4090 with a defective and dangerous power cable plug and socket, which has rendered consumers\u2019 cards inoperable and poses a serious electrical and fire hazard for each and every purchaser.\u201d\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Gordon Mah Ung, Executive Editor, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nGordon is an Executive Editor at PCWorld and an award-winning journalist with more than 30-years covering technology, news and reviewing hardware.

This quantum leap in performance comes courtesy of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture\u2019s many innovations, and NVIDIA DLSS 3, which accelerates performance by up to 4X in next-gen games with full ray tracing. With a GeForce RTX 4090 or GeForce RTX 4080 in your system, games will run at unbelievable frame rates, and you\u2019ll have the power to experience richer, more immersive gaming.\nIt\u2019s only been a month since the launch of DLSS 3, and already 10 games support the groundbreaking technology, including fan favorites such as A Plague Tale: Requiem, F1\u24c7 22, F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch, Justice, Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man Remastered, Microsoft Flight Simulator and SUPER PEOPLE. In the next 15 days, DLSS 3 comes to 4 more games, including Need for Speed Unbound, Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, WRC Generations \u2013 The FIA WRC Official Game, and Warhammer 40,000: Darktide.\nIn each, GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers will enjoy unparalleled performance thanks to DLSS 3, while previous-generation GeForce RTX gamers can enhance these blockbuster titles with DLSS 2.\nAltogether, over 240 released games and apps use the power of AI to accelerate performance with NVIDIA DLSS, giving millions of GeForce RTX gamers the fastest frame rates and beautiful, sharp graphics. Developers love the performance boosts that DLSS gives to their players, and with DLSS 3 the benefits get even better. Check out the video below to see CD PROJEKT RED, Fatshark and Nixxes talk about how RTX and DLSS help them enhance their fan-favorite games:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead on to discover which games are giving GeForce gamers an even-better experience this month, and check back soon for even more DLSS announcements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 3 Multiplies Frame Rates\nNVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is a groundbreaking revolution in AI-powered graphics, increasing performance on GeForce RTX GPUs using dedicated Tensor Cores.\nPowered by new hardware capabilities of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, DLSS 3 generates entirely new high quality frames, rather than just pixels.\nThrough a process detailed in full in our NVIDIA DLSS 3 article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution technology and DLSS Frame Generation to reconstruct 7/8ths of the displayed pixels, accelerating performance to previously unimaginable degrees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn GPU-limited games, DLSS 2 Super Resolution technology can increase your frame rates by up to 2X. With DLSS 3, we can boost them by up to 4X (compared to brute-force rendering) in fully ray-traced worlds, like those seen in the incredible Portal with RTX.\nCertain games make extensive use of the CPU which can limit performance. DLSS 3 operates on the GPU, bypassing CPU bottlenecks and boosting frame rates. In Microsoft Flight Simulator, for example, DLSS 3 boosts frame rates by up to 2X.\nDLSS 3 games are backwards compatible with DLSS 2 technology - developers simply integrate DLSS 3, and DLSS 2, also known as DLSS Super Resolution, is supported by default. Additionally, integrations of DLSS 3 also include NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency for all GeForce RTX users, making games more responsive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator NVIDIA DLSS 3 Update Available Now\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator is a stunning, critically-acclaimed flight simulator that marries realistic recreations of popular planes with an accurate map of our planet, and regular free updates add immersive hand-crafted detail to the world\u2019s most visited cities, airports and regions.\nThe 1:1 real-world recreation of our planet in Microsoft Flight Simulator challenges even the most powerful PCs. To help, Asobo Studio and Microsoft have brought NVIDIA DLSS 3 to the game as part of Update 11, released alongside exciting Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCreating a lifelike digital twin of our entire planet is incredibly CPU intensive. DLSS 3 is a GPU technology that tackles the performance limitations of the CPU, making it the perfect way to experience Microsoft Flight Simulator.\u201d - Jorg Neumann, Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator, Xbox Game Studios\nDLSS Super Resolution is effective in boosting performance in GPU bound cases by rendering fewer pixels. However, Microsoft Flight Simulator can be CPU bound even on the highest-end CPUs. In this case, DLSS 3\u2019s Optical Multi Frame Generation is able to alleviate CPU bottlenecks and boost FPS by up to 2X by creating entirely new frames that never touch the CPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice: DLSS 3 Now Available Game-Wide\nJustice, NetEase\u2019s martial arts MMO, leads the way in its native China, with engrossing gameplay set in ancient China during the time of the Northern Song Dynasty, a 36 million-strong player base, and a continually-upgraded, internally-developed engine called Night Blaze that\u2019s at the forefront of tech. In October, Justice added the stunning \u2018Fuyun Court\u2019 path tracing showcase, which was accelerated by NVIDIA DLSS 3.\nNow, DLSS 3 is available to use across the entirety of Justice\u2019s massive game world, doubling performance, giving GeForce RTX 40 Series users 120 FPS gameplay at 4K, with all settings maxed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDestroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed NVIDIA DLSS 3 Update Available Now\nFollowing the success of 2020\u2019s Destroy All Humans!, which remade the 2005 cult-classic action game, the remake of the 2006 sequel landed on Earth recently. In Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed, head to the swinging \u201860s to take revenge on the KGB for destroying your mothership, fight massive bosses, and even befriend a few pathetic humans to help you achieve victory.\nDLSS 2 launched from the mothership in October, and today Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed has upgraded to DLSS 3, increasing frame rates by up to 2X:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the DLSS 2 Super Resolution-enhanced demo on Steam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWRC Generations \u2013 The FIA WRC Official Game DLSS 3 Update Out November 16th\nWRC Generations from KT Racing and Nacon is the FIA\u2019s official World Rally Championship game, and this new iteration of the venerable franchise introduces the WRC\u2019s first hybrid cars, shaking up the sport significantly.

For average gaming (across 22 games at 1080p, 1440p, and 4K), the GeForce RTX 4080 uses only 251W on average, and on other day-to-day tasks like video playback, it uses as little as 14W. Learn more about the RTX 4080\u2019s power consumption in our other article here. \u00a0\nThe GeForce RTX 4080 includes all the same advancements, enhancements, and innovations as the GeForce RTX 4090, meaning you can multiply frame rates with NVIDIA DLSS 3, encode video up to 2X faster with dual 8th gen NVIDIA Encoders, stream with 40% better efficiency using AV1, and chew through creative workloads in half the time, helping you get more done, faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the complete lowdown on the capabilities of new GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards in our deep dive article. And don\u2019t forget, every existing GeForce innovation and enhancement is available for buyers of GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, including G-SYNC, GeForce Experience one-click overclocking and game optimization, Shadowplay recording and streaming, and so much more. See the full list here.\nTo get started with a newly-installed GeForce RTX 4080, download and install our new Game Ready Driver, and you\u2019ll be ready to enhance your games and accelerate your workloads with all of this tech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 4080 Reviews\nYouTubers and the press have put the new GeForce RTX 4080 through their rigorous tests, and here\u2019s a sampling of what they had to say:\n\n\u201c...the RTX 4080 Founders Edition shows how ridiculously capable the Ada Lovelace architecture is at providing spectacular eye-candy at sky-high frame rates.\u201d - OC3D\n\u201cFrom a hardware and performance point of view, the GeForce RTX 4080 is downright fantastic.\u201d - Guru3D\n\u201c... I\u2019m deeply in love with DLSS with Frame Generation.\u201d - PCGamer\n\u201cIndeed, the RTX 4080 solidifies itself as a true 4K gaming GPU, with almost every title we tested averaging above 60fps solidly with maximum settings.\u201d - MMORPG.com\n\u201cAll in all, the RTX 4080 is exactly what I'd want from an RTX 3080 Ti successor. It's faster and has plenty of new features to make it a demonstrable leap from the previous cards.\u201d - Engadget\n\u201cNVIDIA's second outing of Ada Lovelace in the form of the GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition is another tour de force of GPU technology. Beats the RTX 3090 + RTX 3090 Ti, with less power and runs cooler... FTW. - TweakTown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 4080 Available Now\nIf you want to add the GeForce RTX 4080 to your system, or want a pre-built with the beyond fast graphics card, head over to our Product Finder to see what\u2019s available in your region.\nTo put your upgraded system through its paces, try one of the new NVIDIA DLSS 3 games available this month and play competitive online games with the lowest possible system latency thanks to NVIDIA Reflex. For creators, unlock higher resolutions and crisper image quality with AV1 support integrated in NVIDIA Studio-partnered apps, and cut video export times nearly in half thanks to dual encoders, with support recently added to top video editing apps.\nAnd to learn more about all the future games and apps adding support for RTX technologies, bookmark GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Analyst-in-residence, Quantum Computingfor\u00a0Moor Insights and StrategyFollow AuthorNov 21, 2022, 11:38am ESTShareSaveCommentThis article is more than 2 years old.NVIDIANVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2019s Hopper H100 Tensor Core GPU made its first benchmarking appearance earlier this year in MLPerf Inference 2.1. No one was surprised that the H100 and its predecessor, the A100, dominated every inference workload. The H100 set world records in all of them and NVIDIA is the only company to have submitted to every workload for every MLPerf round.\n\n\nA few weeks ago, a new set of MLCommons training results were released, this time for MLPerf 2.1 Training, which the NVIDIA H100 and A100 also dominated.\n\nUnfortunately, NVIDIA\u2019s dominance of MLPerf benchmarking suites for inference and training has deflected submissions and reports by many important AI companies.\n\nThe industry would benefit from the participation of more organizations as we have seen in other sectors like CPUs, it drives competition and innovation. Broad involvement in benchmarking suites is significant because machine learning is growing exponentially. Almost every industry segment uses machine learning for a wide range of applications. As usage increases, so does model size. Since 2018, MLCommons has held testing rounds that alternate between MLPerf Training and MLPerf Inference testing rounds.\n\n\nIn the four years between the first MLPerf test in 2018 and this year\u2019s results, machine learning model size has increased by five orders of magnitude. With the increased model size and larger data sets, standardized tools like MLPerf Training and MLPerf Inference are more crucial than ever. Machine learning model performance must be measured before it can be improved.\nMLPerf 2.1 Training benchmarksSummary of benchmarks used in MLPerf Training v2.1 ... [+] MLCommons.com\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nMLPerf Training and MLPerf Inference use the same eight workloads shown in the above graphic. Mini Go is an exception because it is only used to evaluate reinforcement learning. Each benchmark test is defined by its own specific dataset and quality target. The Key is how much time it takes to train the model using the specified dataset with the specified quality target.\n\nMLPerf is vital to AI and machine learning because it is an industry-standard benchmark with peer review results that provides valid comparisons for model training and inference. It is supported by Amazon, Arm, Baidu, Google, Harvard University, Intel, Meta, Microsoft, Stanford University, and the University of Toronto.\n\n\nMultiple single models form high performance, multiple modelsReal-world AI applications use multiple models                                                 NVIDIA\nIt is common for multiple AI models to be chained together to satisfy a single input. An example of multimodal networks is the verbal request in the above graphic. The question requires ten machine learning models to produce an answer. Not only must multiple models operate sequentially, but it must also deliver real-time solutions.\nSome cloud services also use multiple networks to deliver services accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs. All of NVIDIA's networks and application frameworks are available on its MLPerf repo, on NGC (NVIDIA\u2019s online container repository), and its GitHub repo.\nA100 and H100 benchmark training performanceMLPerf Training v2.1 PerformanceNVIDIA\nAs shown in the MLPerf Training 2.1 performance chart, H100 provided up to 6.7 x more performance for the BERT benchmark compared to how the A100 performed on its first MLPerf submission in 2019.\nA100 is still producing record results and high performance with improved performance of up to 2.5X. This gain is the result of software optimization. It will likely be an NVIDIA offering for quite some time.\nH100 superior performance on the BERT NLP model is attributed to its Transformer Engine. The A100 does not have a training engine. The new engine, combined with NVIDIA Hopper FP8 Tensor Cores, delivers up to 9x faster AI training and 30x faster AI inference speedups on large language models than the A100. The H100 is based on Hopper architecture and uses fourth-gen tensor cores.\nTraining speed is crucial and necessary because of AI model size. NVIDIA\u2019s transformer engine achieves additional speed using 16-bit floating-point precision and a new 8-bit floating-point data format. This combination increases Tensor Core throughput by 2x and reduces memory requirements by 2x compared to 16-bit floating-point.\nThose improvements, plus advanced Hopper software algorithms, speed up AI performance and capabilities allowing the H100 to train models within days or hours instead of months. The faster a model can move into operation, the earlier its ROI can begin contributing to the bottom line.\nThe Hopper architecture can dynamically determine if FP8 or 16-bit calculations are needed for accuracy. As the transformer engine trains layer by layer, it analyzes the data to determine if reduced precision should be used. Depending on the degree of usage, reduced precision can cause rounding errors which affect model accuracy.\nMLPerf training tests measure the time to solution, so a model not only has to run fast, but it also has to converge. Therefore, it is essential to remember that many errors can prevent a model from converging.\nNVIDIA\u2019s transformer engine technology was designed for large transformer-based networks like BERT. However, it is not restricted to NLP. It can be applied to other areas, such as stable diffusion.\nStable Diffusion is a deep learning, compute-intensive text-to-image model released this year. It can generate detailed images or videos conditioned on text descriptions. It can also be applied to tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, and generating image-to-image translations using a text prompt.\nTime to train at scaleTime to train at scale ... [+] NVIDIA\nNVIDIA A100 was the only platform to run all workloads in the time to train at scale. NVIDIA was able to train every workload at scale in under 5 minutes except for Mini Go, which took about 17 minutes.\nMini Go uses reinforcement learning which is very compute-intensive. It takes longer to train the network because it requires playing Mini Go turn-by-turn, then rolling it back through the network after each turn.\nTraining at scale demonstrates that A100 remains a solid platform for training. H100 is a solution for the most advanced models, such as language models with massive datasets and billions of hyperparameters.\nWhile Intel and Habana didn't turn in record-setting performances, its participation was nevertheless important for the ecosystem and the future of MLPerf.\n H100 Sets News Per-Accelerator Records for AI TrainingNVIDIA\nThis graphic shows relative per accelerator speedup normalized to A100. The H100 (in preview) was submitted for every benchmark and scored superior performance for each. It was 2.6X faster than the A100, which has made significant software gains.\nHabana Gaudi2 submitted for Resnet-50 and BERT, and Intel's Sapphire Rapids submitted for DLRM, ResNet-50, and BERT.\nHabana Gaudi2 performed marginally better than A100 on BERT and about 0.75 better than A100 for ResNet-50. Intel acquired Habana in late 2019 for $2 billion. Gaudi2 is Habana\u2019s second-generation deep learning processor. It has 24 tensor cores and 96 GB of memory.\nDave Salvator, Director of AI, Benchmarking and Cloud for NVIDIA, is expecting higher performance from the H100 in the future.\n\u201cThe H100 turned in a very compelling performance,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the future, we will make software gains with the H100 as we did with the A100. This is the first round we\u2019re submitting H100 for training, and it won\u2019t be the last.\u201d\nHPC MLPerf 2.0 Supercomputing benchmarkingBenchmarking information for MLPerf HPC 2.0 ... [+] MLCommons.com\nMLPerf HPC 2.0 measures the time to train supercomputer models for scientific applications. Additionally, there is an optional throughput measurement for multi-user supercomputing systems. This round was the third iteration of MLPerf HPC. Like MLPerf for training and inference, MLPerf HPC is considered an industry-standard system performance measure for workloads performed on supercomputers.\nFor this round, five of the world's largest supercomputers submitted 20 results: Dell (first time for submission), Fujitsu/RIKEN, Helmholz AI, NVIDIA, and Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC).MLPerf HPC v2.0 BenchmarksNVIDIA\nThis is version 2.0 of the benchmarks, however, there have been no major changes since these same three workloads were run in 1.0. MLPerf HPC benchmarks measure training time and throughput for three high-performance simulations that have adopted machine learning techniques \u2013 Cosmoflow, DeepCAM, and OpenCatalyst.\nBecause of climate change, a great deal of concentrated work is being done on weather and climate modeling. NVIDIA is also working on a digital twin of the planet called Earth Two. This giant climate model simulates the entire world.\nNVIDIA HPC Platform Performance Leadership NVIDIANVIDIA\nMLPerf HPC 2.0 has two performance metrics:\n\n\nStrong Scaling measures time and quality for training the dataset. NVIDIA Selene had the lowest training time of all submissions for all three benchmarks.\nWeak Scaling measures throughput and quality for simultaneously training multiple models on the dataset. Again, NVIDIA trained more models per minute than any submission.\nFor CosmoFlow, NVIDIA has made a 9X improvement in time to train over two years.\n\n\nAlthough the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU and the NVIDIA DGX-A100 SuperPOD are almost three years old, MLPerf 2.0 performance shows that A100 is still the highest performing system for training HPC use cases.\nHPC results are for NVIDIA Selene, an implementation of the DGX SuperPOD and demonstrate the A100\u2019s potential. Other supercomputing sites using NVIDIA technology are also delivering good performance.\nWrapping up \nIt is important to mention that NVIDIA was the only organization to run all AI training workloads for this and all previous MLPerf Training and inference rounds. It has delivered consistent leadership results from the first MLPerf Training 0.5 in December 2018 to the latest MLPerf Training 2.1 that was released a few weeks ago.\nFor training, inference, and HPC, MLPerf has proven NVIDIA has the broadest ecosystem support for all the deep learning frameworks. It is advantageous for customers that NVIDIA GPUs are available from all major cloud providers and all major systems for on-prem solutions. Those application frameworks allow customers to deploy solutions rapidly.\nNVIDIA has an end-to-end open platform with software that helps expand the full potential of its hardware. NVIDIA\u2019s full-stack solution includes application frameworks such as Merlin and Nemo. With Nemo Megatron service, it is possible to leverage huge language models using custom datasets.\nANALYST NOTES \n\n\nThere are many reasons why model speed is so vital for inference and training. One overlooked reason relates to the necessity of multiple training runs. Building a model is an experimental process that involves trial and error to get the model properly tuned. The model must be rerun each time something is tweaked to see the results. The ability to run the model faster means more trials can be run in a given time. That allows a solution to be found and deployed more quickly. The faster a model can be deployed, the earlier its benefits can contribute to improved operations and its ROI can be generated.\nMLPerf provides peer-reviewed apples-to-apples comparisons for training and inference. It eliminates the need to rely on a company\u2019s cherry-picked stats from its performance testing that may or may not be valid.\nNVIDIA works with many of the top AI researchers. I spend much time reviewing research papers on AI and quantum. A lot of AI research work uses NVIDIA platforms. So far this year, over 400 preprint research papers have been published on deep learning using NVIDIA technology. It will be interesting to see future research results using the H100 as its availability increases.\nPower consumption is a significant issue in the AI ecosystem. Although measurement of power consumption isn\u2019t currently part of MLPerf Training, it is under consideration. However, power is a measurement in MLPerf Inference. For MLPerf Inference 2.1 in September, 2,400 power measurement results were submitted. For reference, A100 requires 400 watts, and H100 requires 700 watts. When juggling these two figures, consideration needs to be given to performance and speed. BERT is an excellent example because the H100 enjoys a 6X advantage in speed.\nLike the A100, the H100 can be partitioned into seven smaller accelerators that can independently run different networks. That is a way to get optimal utilization out of the part on the inference side and reduce the number of total GPUs needed to deploy multiple networks. Ideally, the feature is more useful for training advanced models, but it also has applications on the inference side.\n\n\nMoor Insights & Strategy, like all research and tech industry analyst firms, provides or has provided paid services to technology companies.

These solutions can speed return on investment for AI and MLOps.\nNVIDIA, a sponsor of NetApp INSIGHT 2022, will share how enterprises can learn to spend more time focusing on their core missions rather than wrestling with infrastructure.\nEasy Infrastructure Design and Deployment\nEarlier this year, NVIDIA launched DGX BasePOD, an evolution of the DGX POD program and reference architecture. It delivers a new generation of infrastructure solutions for enterprises built on NVIDIA DGX systems with AMD EPYC CPUs, NVIDIA networking and its ecosystem of storage partners like NetApp.\nThe reference architecture gives businesses a valuable complement to the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD data-center infrastructure platform for AI workflows. As its name suggests, DGX BasePOD is the base on which value-added solutions, including the NetApp ONTAP AI infrastructure stack, are built.\nNVIDIA and NetApp have a growing ecosystem of MLOps partners whose technologies layer on top of ONTAP AI to create complete solution stacks. Incorporating MLOps workflow management, these offerings serve as a platform on which IT teams can scale model pipelines and shorten the time to bring AI into production.\nOrganizations now have two choices for infrastructure design with NetApp and NVIDIA:\n\nThe turnkey DGX SuperPOD is a physical replica of NVIDIA infrastructure, backed by performance guarantees on specific workloads.\nNetApp ONTAP AI, based on the DGX BasePOD reference architecture, provides flexibility in key component choices and network architecture by enabling teams to alternatively deploy and work with NVIDIA DGX-certified solution providers to customize environments that suit their needs and scale to their objectives.\n\nLet Experts Run the AI Infrastructure\nNVIDIA DGX-Ready Managed Services can help users take the infrastructure pain out of clients\u2019 hands. With this approach, enterprises can realize benefits such as:\n\nFilling critical IT skills gaps that the business previously couldn\u2019t afford to invest in, as they distracted from the core mission.\nDirect access to AI expertise. Many businesses don\u2019t have AI experts who understand the latest innovations in model development and deployment at scale. These are offered from NVIDIA and NetApp teams through DGX-Ready Managed Services.\nGaining an experience akin to having an AI Center of Excellence or an AI private cloud \u2014 enabled with an economical outsource model for scaling AI development and without the need to wrestle with infrastructure.\n\nIn addition, check out the following at NetApp INSIGHT:\n\nSession: Making IT the Hero of AI in 2023: What Leaders Need to Know\nSession: NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD with NetApp\nHands-on-lab: Building an AI Data Pipeline with NetApp and NVIDIA\n\nJoin NVIDIA at NetApp INSIGHT to learn more about these infrastructure solutions and how to make scaling AI applications faster, easier and more cost effective.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | Events \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

The problem is that most of its assembly equipment is optimized for producing traditional gas-powered cars. It needed to drive toward the future without reengineering all of its existing infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\n\n\nExplore the Trend Lines collection \n              \n            \n\n\nLearn about Deloitte's services\n              \n            \n\n\nGo straight to smart.

This is where NVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse platform comes in. It relies on an open-source file format that allows users to create scenes composed of many different file types. It also supports different client applications and microservices, another key component in enabling multiple software systems to work in conjunction. In practice, this means that legacy ERP systems, computer-aided design software, and purchasing tools (to name just a few) can all sync up.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve spent 15 years putting data into a software system,\u201d Geyer says. \u201cYou can keep using it. Now you can just do more with it.\u201d\nGeyer says that the market is moving toward open systems where disparate tools can all communicate with each other. For years, vendors have used strategies that kept users tied to their ecosystem: As long as vendors had a lock on businesses\u2019 data, they had a lock on businesses themselves. But developers today don\u2019t want tools as much as they want functionality. Whatever tools are best for the job at hand are the ones users want. An open ecosystem supports this approach. So companies are repatriating their data by leveraging their core systems and all the data in them for broadening use cases.\n\u201cBusinesses are demanding that open ecosystem,\u201d Geyer says. \u201cThey want to control the destiny of their systems.\u201d\nAnother benefit of the Omniverse platform is supporting advanced artificial intelligence (AI) applications through its ability to create synthetic data based on parameters set by the user. This lets AI systems train on many more scenarios than if they were training only on data from real-world events. They can run thousands of simulations based on synthetic data to find optimal processes based on almost any scenario. In industrial applications, for example, the AI model can find the best route for a robot to take given the likely placement of things such as forklifts, pallets, and workers.\n\u201cNo human wants to think through all those variables,\u201d Geyer says. \u201cThe AI does the grunt work.\u201d\nThis gives the human workforce better problems to solve. Now that they don\u2019t have to spend their time on low-level, highly detailed work, employees can spend time on higher-level problems. Rather than programming neural networks, people are now interrogating them. It takes the sophistication of a human to define the problem. The AI system finds the best answer.\nThe possible result? At BMW, executives are forecasting 30% efficiency gains over last year. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s make this work.\nChange your Analytics and performance cookie settings  to access this feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndnotes\n\n\n\n\n\nMike Geyer (industry product manager, NVIDIA), interview, August 30, 2022.\nView in Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n\n\n\nCover image by: Natalie Pfaff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics in this article\n\n\n\nHidden Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology \n\n\nToday, business and technology are inextricably linked.

NOAA administrators and researchers have to collect, combine and analyze that information to observe and understand environmental conditions and changes.The new Earth Observations Digital Twin \u2013 developed under contract with Lockheed Martin Space \u2013 working with NVIDIA \u2013 will provide NOAA with a high-resolution, accurate and timely depiction of global conditions, using current satellite and ground-based observations.For the project, Lockheed Martin\u2019s OpenRosetta3D\u2122 platform will utilize AI and Machine Learning (ML) to ingest, format and fuse observations from multiple sources into a gridded data product and detect anomalies. NVIDIA Omniverse Nucleus, the collaboration and database engine of its Omniverse world simulation platform, will convert data into the Universal Scene Description framework, enabling data-sharing across multiple tools and between researchers. Agatha, a Lockheed Martin-developed visualization platform, will ingest this incoming data from Omniverse Nucleus and allow users to interact with it in an Earth-centric 3D environment.\u201cAt Lockheed Martin we regularly use digital twins and AI to provide our government customers with the clearest, current situational picture and actionable intelligence for their important missions,\u201d said Matt Ross, senior program manager at Lockheed Martin Space. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased that we can use our technology experience to collaborate with NVIDIA on this project to provide NOAA a timely, global visualization for their own important missions.\u201d\u201cDigital twins will help us solve the world\u2019s hardest scientific and environmental challenges,\u201d said Dion Harris, lead product manager of accelerated computing at NVIDIA. \u201cThe combination of Lockheed Martin\u2019s AI technology with NVIDIA Omniverse will give NOAA researchers a powerful system to improve weather predictions at a global scale.\u201dLockheed Martin and NVIDIA are already collaborating on an effort to help fight wildfires, which have burned more than 7.2 million U.S. acres this year. By pairing Lockheed Martin\u2019s AI/ML platforms and joint all domain command and control capabilities with NVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse, the two companies are demonstrating how firefighters can use advanced technology to help better detect, predict and suppress wildfires.About Lockheed MartinHeadquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin Corporation is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 114,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.Please follow @LMNews and @LMSpace on Twitter for the latest announcements and news across the corporation.About NVIDIASince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

According to news posted on geforce.com on Wednesday (11/16/2022), NVIDIA will continue testing this program, \u201cwith a few new additions\u201d.\nQuoting NVIDIA:\n\nFirstly, Verified Priority Access will give a limited number of opportunities to purchase\u00a0GeForce RTX 4080 graphics cards\u00a0shortly after the worldwide release on November 16th. At the same time, a limited quantity of GeForce RTX 4090 graphics cards will also be made available. Invited users will receive a unique link to purchase a single graphics card on a first-come, first-served basis, while supplies last.\nSecondly, we are working with our participating etail partners and add-in-card partners to include more GeForce RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 models in the Verified Priority Access trial, in addition to NVIDIA\u2019s limited Founders Edition design. Availability of these additional models will vary by etailer.\nLastly, we\u2019re opening\u00a0sign-ups\u00a0to be considered for a Verified Priority Access invitation. There may be many more sign-ups than cards available in this trial, so enrolling does not guarantee getting selected for an invitation. At this time, sign-ups are open for NVIDIA Accounts that were created on or before November 15th, 2022.\n\nSigning up for the program requires, as mentioned above, an NVIDIA account created before the RTX 4080 launch. If you already used GeForce Experience prior to this launch, and you want one of these Founders Edition cards (without the markup), then sign up here.\n \n\n\nOnce you sign up, you\u2019ll get a confirmation email like the one I got, pictured above. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to use this to get one, so you won\u2019t have to compete with me.\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousPodcast #700 \u2013 RTX 4080 Review, High GPU Prices Explained, GN Solves 4090 Connector Mystery, 1-click AMD boost, EPYC\u2019ly good sausage + more! \n\nNextWhere There\u2019s One ARM There Is Usually A Second \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nSebastian Peak\nEditor-in-Chief at PC Perspective.

This more or less confirms that the card will be on NVIDIA's agenda during their CES 23 keynote. As for other products, we can expect NVIDIA to give an update on the RTX 40 GPUs for laptops which are expected to couple nicely with Intel's 13th Gen Raptor Lake-HX CPUs & AMD's Ryzen 7000 'Dragon Range' chips. Both CPUs are also expected to have products based on them be showcased at CES 2023.\n\nOther than that, the company will also be talking about the software side of GeForce innovations and even more titles supporting their brand-new DLSS 3 technology.

Sign-up for our newsletters and have our best offers delivered to your inbox daily.\nAmazon is now discounting both of NVIDIA\u2019s streaming media players, with the flagship Shield Android TV Pro leading the way at $174.99 shipped. Marking one of the very first times this year to save, we haven\u2019t seen a discount go live since back in August where it sold for $5 less. This is down from $200 and amounts to the second-best price of the year at $25 off. NVIDIA Shield Android TV Pro arrives as one of the more high-end streaming media players on the market with plenty of notable features. First and foremost is onboard Plex support with hardware transcoding, allowing you to create a server just by plugging in a USB hard drive or connecting to a NAS. Of course, there\u2019s access to all of the usual streaming services on top of 4K HDR playback, Alexa support, and more. A\u00a0recent update also rolled out\u00a0that brings low-latency playback, night listening, and more to the Android 11 experience.\n\nAlso on sale today, Amazon is currently offering the\u00a0NVIDIA Shield TV Stick for\u00a0$124.99 shipped. Normally fetching $150, you\u2019re looking at yet another rare chance to save as the lead deal, with today\u2019s offer matching our previous August mention for the 2022 low. This is also only the third price cut of the year, much like the flagship offering. While not as capable as the Pro model above, the Stick version of\u00a0NVIDIA Shield\u00a0packs much of the same Android TV features with 4K HDR playback, too.\u00a0\nAs far as other notable home theater upgrades go, Amazon\u2019s roster of streaming media players are currently leading the way on all of the pre-Black Friday savings. Marked down as we head into Thanksgiving Week, Amazon\u2019s Fire TV Stick 4K Max\u00a0has returned to the all-time low alongside the company\u2019s stable of other Fire TV streamers starting at $20.\nNVIDIA Shield Android TV Pro features:\n\nNVIDIA Shield TV Pro is the ultimate streaming media player for the modern living room\u2014packed with features to make even the most demanding users proud. Level up to SHIELD TV Pro for more storage space, two USB 3.0 ports for expandability, Plex Media Server, SmartThings hub-ready, AAA Android gaming, Twitch broadcasting, and 3 GB RAM. SHIELD\u2019s versatility and speed set it apart. It\u2019s a streamer, game console, DVR, media server, and smart home hub with voice assistants.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd 9to5Toys to your Google News feed.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\nGoogle News\n\n\n\n\nFTC: 9to5Toys is reader supported, we may earn income on affiliate links\n Subscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more! \n\n\n \n\n\nGuides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAmazon\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nAmazon is the world's largest online retailer, offering daily savings across nearly every category imaginable.

The GeForce RTX 4090 is easily the fastest graphics card that money can currently buy, and now the new GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition holds rank as the second-fastest graphics card available. It has a little problem, though, that keeps it from true rockstar status: Though it's exceedingly powerful and more affordable than the GeForce RTX 4090, it isn\u2019t easy to recommend at its launch pricing. This card exists at a crossroads where it's too expensive to attract most gamers, and the gamers who are willing to pay this much will likely want to opt for the goliath-grade, Editors' Choice-award-holding RTX 4090 instead. \u00a0Now, despite what may sound like a slight downer in our tone to this point, we opted to give the RTX 4080 a 4-star rating, regardless, because it is a technical triumph of a video card. Its blistering-fast performance is far ahead of all last-gen graphics cards, which may be reason enough for you to buy one even if most gamers will want to wait for something more affordable from AMD or Nvidia's own stable, which are inevitably coming\u2014some very soon.What's the AD103? A Near Half-Size AD102Creating computer chips is an imperfect process that often leads to the creation of semi-defective chips. These semi-defective chips may be fully functional, but unable to operate at the targeted operating speed. Alternately, these chips could have small portions that simply do not function even if the rest works perfectly.Traditionally, these chips are sorted by quality and used to create multiple products. By doing so, a single large chip, like the AD102, can be used inside of a powerful GPU like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 and other less powerful cards. This technique has been used for decades now by AMD, Intel, and Nvidia, and it\u2019s expected practice at this point.\u00a0To our surprise, however, Nvidia opted not to reuse the GeForce RTX 4090\u2019s AD102 GPU inside of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080. Instead the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 utilizes an entirely different GPU die known as AD103. This new AD103 GPU die is significantly smaller than the AD102, measuring just 379mm2 to AD102\u2019s relatively enormous 609mm2. In terms of CUDA core counts, this leaves the AD103 with 10,240 to AD102\u2019s max possible 18,432.Neither the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 nor the GeForce RTX 4090 utilizes fully intact GPU dies, which leaves them with core counts of 9,728 and 16,384, respectively. This was likely done due to the aforementioned imperfect nature of creating chips, as having some cores that can be defective and still result in a viable chip leads to better yields and less overall production waste.Nonetheless, Nvidia\u2019s decision not to use the AD102 inside of the RTX 4080 remains somewhat counterintuitive. Larger chips are more likely to have defects, and it seems likely that Nvidia will have at least some AD102 dies that aren\u2019t good enough to be an RTX 4090 but still have plenty of functional hardware for a lesser GPU.When we stop to consider the vastly different size of these two cores, however, this decision starts to make sense. Nvidia likely doesn\u2019t expect to sell enormous numbers of RTX 4090 graphics cards, as not many folks will be willing or able to shell out $1,599 for a GPU. Not many can spring $1,199 for a GeForce RTX 4080, either, but the company might expect more orders of the RTX 4080 than the RTX 4090 simply due to its lower price point.With that in mind, it doesn\u2019t make much sense for Nvidia to produce large numbers of AD102 dies just to disable part of them to make enough Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 cards to meet demand. Disabling parts of defective chips to make lesser GPUs only makes logical sense when you are creating a lot of those larger GPU dies, anyway, and as we say, that\u2019s not likely for the RTX 4090\u2019s AD102. Far more sensible to make a smaller GPU, in this case AD103, and use it in this manner instead to produce lower-end cards.That the AD103 chip isn\u2019t used in its entirety inside of the GeForce RTX 4080, and that there currently aren't any other GPUs using the AD102 die, leaves the door open to a possible future GeForce RTX 4080 Ti. I think this is highly likely long term, due to the performance gap between the two existing GeForce RTX 40-series entries, as you will soon see.Other than differences in resource count, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 shares feature parity with the more powerful Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, and you should check out our linked review article for more details about the Ada Lovelace architecture. This means that the RTX 4080 can take advantage of DLSS 3 in games that support it to boost performance higher than DLSS 2 is capable of. The highlights of what\u2019s new in the RTX 40 series are more powerful decoding and encoding hardware that includes support for AV1, more powerful ray-tracing hardware, and substantially larger caches, among other things. Out of the 80 total streaming multiprocessors available in the AD103 core, the RTX 4080 has 76 of these active. As mentioned above, this gives it a core count of 9,728 CUDA cores, and these operate at a peak speed of 2,505MHz. The RTX 4080\u2019s direct predecessor, the RTX 3080, had just 8,704 that topped out at 1,710MHz.In addition to the larger core count, the RTX 4080 also has an enormous 64MB pool of L2 cache that dwarfs the RTX 3080\u2019s 5MB L2 cache pool. It\u2019s likely due in large part to the last bit, the larger caches, that the new RTX 40-series cards are able to perform significantly better than their predecessors, as core count itself hasn\u2019t changed nearly as much as performance has increased. The combination of larger core counts, faster clock speeds, and the larger cache pool enable the RTX 4080 to run circles around the RTX 3080 in most scenarios.To keep the powerful AD103 core fed with data and avoid bottlenecks, Nvidia attached 16GB of GDDR6X RAM to the core over a 256-bit memory interface. The RAM is clocked at 11,200MHz and provides an aggregate total of 716.8GBps of bandwidth to the RTX 4080\u2019s GPU core. Just like AD102, the AD103 core is built on a custom TSMC 4nm fabrication process and Nvidia rated the GPU with a peak power target of 320 watts (W).Nvidia is continuing to use the new 12VHPWR power connector to deliver power to its graphics cards, and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition ships with a 12VHPWR adapter that can connect to three eight-pin PCI Express power supply connectors. For display connections, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 has one HDMI port and three DisplayPort connections, from which it can support a total of four monitors.Recommended by Our EditorsRate Your Favorite PC Hardware, Peripherals, and Components to WinNVIDIA Expands RTX AI Innovations With Neural Shading, DLSS 4, and RTX RemixPC Desktop Vendor Laments 'Insane' RTX 5090 Prices: 'We're Getting Scalped'GeForce RTX 4080 Spec Comparison and Test System SetupI tested the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 on our 2022 GPU test bed that utilizes an Intel Core i9-12900K processor on an Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Hero motherboard. The CPU has not been overclocked and operates at stock clock speeds with a Corsair Hydro Series H100X water cooler.The system also runs 32GB of Corsair Vengeance RAM clocked at 5,600MHz, a 1TB Corsair MP600 Pro NVMe 4.0 SSD and a Corsair HX1500i 1,500W 80 Plus Platinum power supply. All tests are performed inside of Windows 11 Pro with the latest updates installed.Ordinarily, we would look over what cards are likely to stand a strong chance against the RTX 4080 in the upcoming benchmarks, but the truth of the matter is that few have a prayer. If you are looking for a budget-friendlier option, there might be a better one than this. And, if you want something even more powerful, there is the RTX 4090\u2014but until AMD launches its new Radeon RX 7900 graphics cards, there\u2019s not much competition for the RTX 4080 at present.Testing the GeForce RTX 4080: Synthetic BenchmarksThe test scores achieved by the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 and the faster RTX 4090 far outstrip everything else. Though it is possible that these tests aren\u2019t running correctly on these new cards, as has been known to happen before with early launch hardware, if they are accurate they show how much more powerful Nvidia's newest products are than last-generation RTX 3000 cards. It's not close.The RTX 4080 itself is roughly just two-thirds as fast as the RTX 4090 in most synthetic tests. They perform closer together than that in Furmark, but it\u2019s possible some sort of bottleneck is occurring there to push the two closer together.Testing the GeForce RTX 4080: Gaming PerformanceIn general, the RTX 4080 performs about as well in games compared to the RTX 4090 as it does in synthetic benchmarks. That\u2019s to say it achieves somewhere between 60% and 70% the frames per second (fps) produced by the RTX 4090 in most tests, but there are exceptions. In some tests, either the CPU or the game engine for that game test is causing a bottleneck that drives the two RTX 40-series cards closer together in results.For games that support Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), this is evident, especially in Guardians of the Galaxy. Both the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 are hitting some sort of bottleneck at 1080p, likely due to the CPU. Both cards hit this same bottleneck\u2014right around 170fps\u2014when DLSS is enabled at 2K. In this case, there\u2019s no reason to use DLSS at 2K with the RTX 4090 as you scarcely get any better results, whereas the RTX 4080 is able to match the RTX 4090 in this case while still costing significantly less and using less power.We again see clear signs of a bottleneck in Far Cry 5, where the 1080p and 2K test scores for the RTX 4080 are nearly identical. A few other cards, like the RTX 4090 and the RTX 3090, were able to perform better at 1080p in this test, but only by a small margin, and this could be due to driver issues or the slight variance that can occur when testing any product with benchmarks. In the remainder of our modern game tests, the RTX 4080 outperforms the rest of the pack, save the RTX 4090, by a considerable amount.Legacy game tests tend to be more about driver support than raw graphics card performance. We mostly continue to test these to see where issues with older games are starting to occur and to see if you can still run these games well with newer hardware. While you certainly can play the games we tested with the RTX 4080, performance results are somewhat all over the place, with the card's inherent gaming prowess not shining through. Several last-gen cards, including the RTX 3080, do better in these tests than the RTX 4080.Testing the GeForce RTX 4080: System Power and ThermalsWe measure the entire power consumption of our graphics testbed system with the card installed using a Kill-A-Watt meter. The only part that is changed in the system between these tests is the graphics card, which enables us to gain a rough idea of each card\u2019s power consumption. With the overall system consumption peaking at 447W during our Guardians of the Galaxy test, the GeForce RTX 4080 doesn\u2019t stand out as particularly power-hungry.Though most of AMD\u2019s graphics cards consumed significantly less power during our tests, most Nvidia cards consumed more. When we take performance into consideration, there\u2019s no question that the RTX 4080\u2019s results here look even more impressive, as it's the second fastest card in our list. This means its efficiency in regards to frames/watt is going to be significantly higher than any other card in the list except for, possibly, the faster RTX 4090.The GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition also remains quite cool during these tests. During the Furmark test, the temp topped out at 62 degrees C. This was a lot lower than expected, so we did a followup test using Hardware Monitor and re-ran the Guardians of the Galaxy test, which showed the temp topping out at 63 degrees C. Without any indication of the card running hotter than this, it would appear the large Founders Edition cooler is simply doing its job and keeping the card well cooled.Verdict: An Excellent Performer That's a Difficult SellThere\u2019s no question that the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition provides exceptional gaming performance at a lower price, but that alone doesn\u2019t make it easy to recommend. The fact of the matter is that many gamers aren\u2019t willing to spend over $1,000 for a graphics card, and that means that the RTX 4080 with its gulp-inducing $1,199 price will attract only a small sliver of the buying public in the first place. Further, those gamers who are willing to spend that much dosh on a graphics card are also likely to be ready to pay for the best gaming experience money can buy. And that means they should just get an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 instead, even if it costs $1,599. [As the expression goes, in for a penny, in for a...well, sixteen-hundred bucks? \u2014Ed.]You could argue, with our Core i9-12900K bottlenecking the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 at times, that there\u2019s limited reason to buy the more powerful card. You could even strengthen that argument by pointing out these bottlenecks typically don\u2019t happen until well past 100fps. But, if you\u2019re a gamer willing to drop this kind of dough on a graphics card, then you\u2019ll likely own or can buy a bleeding-edge high-res, high-refresh gaming monitor, and be ready to upgrade to the fastest processor available, to optimize your gaming experience.For these reasons, though we can\u2019t argue against the GeForce RTX 4080\u2019s exceptional performance, we find this card difficult to recommend for mainstream gamers at this price, and more fiscally fortunate gamers will be better served by the equally giant RTX 4090. If you fall into the small niche of gamers willing to go $1,199\u2014but no higher\u2014for a top-tier graphics card, you\u2019re going to have a good time with the RTX 4080. Otherwise, you\u2019ll probably want to wait for the more mainstream graphics cards that land below $1,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to PCMag Middle East newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Michael Justin Allen Sexton\n\n\n\n\n            For as long as I can remember, I've had love of all things tech, spurred on, in part, by a love of gaming.

Professionals are using powerful NVIDIA RTX GPUs to tackle these workflows \u2014 and with NVIDIA RTX Enterprise drivers, regular updates optimize and increase the performance of these GPUs.\nAvailable now, NVIDIA RTX Enterprise Release 525 (R525) provides support for the RTX 6000 Ada Generation GPU, NVIDIA\u2019s most powerful workstation GPU yet.\nWorkstation professionals can also take advantage of new features in NVIDIA MOSAIC technology to enhance multi-display deployments, and further customize their workspaces with new capabilities in NVIDIA RTX Desktop Manager.\nLatest Features and Enhancements\nThe R525 driver provides support for NVIDIA RTX 6000, enabling professionals to accomplish the most challenging and demanding projects as rapidly as possible. Based on the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPU architecture, the card features third-generation RT Cores, fourth-generation Tensor Cores and next-gen CUDA cores with 48GB of graphics memory for powerful rendering, AI, graphics and compute performance.\nWith support for RTX 6000, the R525 driver provides performance increases over the previous R515 driver, including up to 9% gains in applications such as Adobe Media Encoder, Keyshot Viewer and SOLIDWORKS Visualize.\u00a01\nR525 expands features of NVIDIA MOSAIC, the advanced multi-display technology for spanning desktops across screens. The driver enhances support for mixed displays that are running on custom compositors \u2014 such as specialized displays \u2014 as well as the standard Windows system compositor.\nWith this new capability, workstation professionals can use either a single GPU or multiple ones to scale out displays over a single desktop, which helps simplify application deployment and delivers a more aesthetic viewing experience.\nAdditionally, developers can take advantage of new Vulkan extensions, including access to new capabilities made possible by the Ada Lovelace architecture, such as deep learning frame generation with the Optical Flow Accelerator.\nThe NVIDIA RTX Desktop Manager, included with the R525 driver for Windows, allows users to manage single or multi-display workspaces with ease, providing maximum flexibility and control over display real estate and desktops.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GIF_RTX-Desktop-Mgr_Resizing.mp4\n\u00a0\nRTX Desktop Manager delivers new features in its latest update, including:\n\nA quick-access button that lets professionals easily access the features they often use, such as sending a window to different displays or resizing a window to a grid.\nA toggle feature that allows users to switch between viewing grid sizes.\n\nLearn more about the newest release of the NVIDIA Enterprise Driver.\n1. Results were obtained from SOLIDWORKS Visualize, Keyshot, and Adobe AME benchmark applications performed on a test system comprised of a 12th Gen Intel Core i9-12900K processor with 32GB (2x16GB) RAM running Microsoft Windows 11 Enterprise.\u00a0 Testing was conducted with NVIDIA RTX A4000, A5500, and A6000 GPUs using the NVIDIA RTX Enterprise Driver, versions 526.67 and 516.59.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | Graphics | NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

Set in the 41st millennium, players dive deep into the dilapidated bowels of Tertium, an industrial city that\u2019s fallen under the influence of Chaos. Go full melee against the enemy, using Vermintide\u2019s lauded combat system, or pick up a visceral Warhammer 40,000 weapon to dispatch all manner of demons at a distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo deliver the definitive PC experience, NVIDIA and Fatshark have worked closely to pack Warhammer 40,000: Darktide with cutting-edge technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 3 Accelerates Darktide Performance\nNVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is a groundbreaking revolution in AI-powered graphics, increasing performance on GeForce RTX GPUs using dedicated Tensor Cores. And our newest iteration, DLSS 3,\u00a0 generates entirely new high quality frames, rather than just pixels.\nPowered by new hardware capabilities of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution technology and DLSS Frame Generation to reconstruct 7/8ths of the displayed pixels, accelerating performance to previously unimaginable degrees.

These four technologies are setting new standards in the XR ecosystem: cloud streaming, collaboration tools, photorealistic rendering and AI.\nStreaming XR From the Cloud\n\nAll-in-one headsets are becoming increasingly popular because they enable an untethered virtual reality experience. But they typically can\u2019t provide the power that\u2019s needed for enterprise workflows, which often include complex simulations and detailed visualizations that contain millions of polygons.\nCloud streaming addresses this challenge by enabling professionals to run high-quality XR workflows from powerful computational resources at the edge, and stream these experiences to any location.\nWith cloud streaming, handheld devices or low-powered headsets can securely tap into heavy, complex workloads. This means users can develop software in the cloud or use all-in-one headsets to access large enterprise content \u2014 all remotely.\n\nNVIDIA CloudXR and Lenovo ThinkReality VRX are two solutions making cloud streaming more attainable.\nCloudXR provides professionals with enhanced flexibility and portability, as it allows teams to stream the most powerful VR and AR applications from the cloud or data center to virtually any device. This means professionals can explore graphics-intensive, immersive environments on a headset, tablet or smartphone.\nThe Lenovo ThinkReality VRX was built with enterprise use cases in mind, using CloudXR to deliver high-quality, immersive, GPU-powered XR experiences.\n\nUsing Advanced Collaboration Tools\n\nReal-time collaboration is an important part of design and development workflows. As more teams work from different locations, XR gives users the opportunity to collaborate virtually with their coworkers, minimizing turnaround times and making review cycles faster.\nAdvanced tools like integrated bidirectional audio can bring real-time collaboration to teams, allowing users to communicate throughout their immersive experiences. Being able to conduct real-time design reviews together opens endless possibilities for collaboration across different XR workflows.\nProject teams can also work together on the same virtual models through CloudXR and Autodesk VRED on Amazon Web Services. This lets anyone deploy CloudXR and Autodesk VRED to enter a photorealistic, immersive environment and seamlessly interact with large 3D models and scenes.\n\nCreating Immersive Graphics With Photorealistic Rendering\n\nEnterprise workflows often require ultra-high-fidelity graphics. This is why photorealism is critical for industries like architecture, manufacturing and automotive design \u2014 rendered graphics require immense accuracy and must be as close to reality as possible.\nAnd with the growth of virtual worlds, digital twins and the metaverse, photorealism plays an important role in creating graphics to bring these simulated worlds to life. To experience the metaverse at full potential, users need to have the best graphics and the most powerful workstations.\nNVIDIA RTX technology helps professionals develop and deliver the highest-fidelity visualizations for these immersive and virtual experiences. The latest NVIDIA RTX professional GPUs offer a combination of speed, performance and massive memory that allows teams to easily handle large, complex models in photorealistic environments.\n\nTeams across the world can easily work together within real-time, photorealistic, 3D simulated worlds using NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for building and connecting custom 3D pipelines. Within the platform, NVIDIA Omniverse Create XR is available for users to navigate and interact with their scenes through their immersive VR and AR devices.\nElevating XR Interactions With Powerful AI\u00a0\nWith AI, the future of XR will be accelerated even further. The integration of AI and XR will help solutions scale past current limits and allow users to interact in immersive environments just as they would in the real world. Accurately representing immersive environments and making interactions as natural as possible will improve users\u2019 comfort level and productivity.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s Project Aurora is an example of a purpose-built platform where AI-driven virtual assistance will be integrated in XR environments. Project Aurora is a hardware and software platform that simplifies the deployment of enterprise XR solutions onto on-premises networks.\nAnother example of AI enhancing XR is NVIDIA\u2019s Project Mellon, where conversational speech can dictate commands in an immersive experience.\nAdditionally, AI avatars will pave the way for creating engaging, interactive XR experiences. AI will enable 3D characters to see, hear, understand and communicate with people.\nCreators and developers can bring these intelligent avatars to life with NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE), a suite of cloud-native AI microservices that make it easier to build and deploy virtual assistants and digital humans. Omniverse ACE delivers all the AI building blocks necessary to create, customize and deploy interactive avatars.\nWith the power of AI integrated in XR, professionals and developers can create immersive experiences that are more realistic and intelligent than ever.\nLearn more about NVIDIA XR technologies, and catch up on the latest GTC session to learn more about Project Aurora.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: CloudXR | Omniverse | Virtual Reality \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

His eyesight was impaired for over a decade before he regained it thanks to a Sri Lankan cornea donor.\nThis singular event proved inspirational, cementing virtual reality as his primary creative field, as it allows him to share with others the world as he uniquely sees it.\nWhen he was getting his driver\u2019s license, Huang registered himself as an organ donor, imagining that the cornea in his right eye will continue its journey to others who may receive it after his death.\nDeep in the journey of \u2018Samsara.\u2019\nIn Samsara, one\u2019s consciousness can travel within different individuals and animals.\nColor, materials, sound and music are critical story elements that drive the narratives of his artwork, Huang said.\nHow did we get here?\n\u201cDiscussing with musicians about adding sound to works always brings me new ideas to revise stories,\u201d he said. \u201cElements may influence one another, and the process is like an upward spiral where each element develops and fosters each other simultaneously, slowly shaping the story.\u201d\nCool, But How?\nWorking in VR can often be a nonlinear experience. Huang spends considerable time prototyping and iterating ideas to ensure that they\u2019re feasible and can be shared.\nHe and his team will program and create multiple 3D animations and interactions. This helps them to examine if their works can convey the exact concept, invoking the body of emotions they hoped for.\nParametric modeling allows for faster, wide-scale edits.\nThe team makes use of various parametric modeling tools in Autodesk Maya, Houdini, iClone and Unity. The key in setting up 3D geometric objects is that shapes can be changed once parameters such as dimensions or curvatures are modified \u2014 removing the need to reshape the model from scratch.\nThis saves artists lots of time \u2014 especially in the conceptual stage \u2014 and is critical to the team\u2019s workflow, Huang said.\n\u201cWe use Unity for integration and interaction, and Xsens and Vicon for motion capture,\u201d he said. Unity\u2019s light baking and Autodesk Maya\u2019s Arnold renderer both require powerful GPUs, and his GeForce RTX 3070 GPU was equal to the task.\nThe team\u2019s photogrammetry software in RealityCapture also benefits greatly from NVIDIA CUDA acceleration.\nTextures applied in Unity.\n\u201cNowadays, a powerful GeForce RTX GPU is an indispensable tool for digital artists.\u201d \u2014 Hsin-Chien Huang\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlthough the resolutions of these scanned models are low, it has the aesthetic of pixel art,\u201d Huang said. He processed these models in Unity to give them a unique digital style. NVIDIA DLSS technology powered by his GeForce RTX GPU increases the interactivity of the viewport by using AI to upscale frames rendered at lower resolution while still retaining high-fidelity detail.\nWhen it comes to creating textures, Huang recommends Adobe Substance 3D Painter, which can rapidly create quality, realistic textures for prototyping. RTX-accelerated light and ambient occlusion baking optimize his assets in mere seconds.\nPhotorealistic details made even more realistic with Topaz Labs Gigapixel AI.\nHuang also uses Topaz Labs Gigapixel AI, which uses deep learning to offer better photo quality. Yet again his RTX GPU acccelerates AI for the sharpening of images while retaining high-fidelity details.\nHuang is grateful for advancements in technology and their impact on creative possibilities.\n\u201cNowadays, a powerful GeForce RTX GPU is an indispensable tool for digital artists,\u201d he said.\nHuang\u2019s increasing popularity and extraordinary talent led him to Hollywood. In 2018, Huang performed a VR demo on hit TV show America\u2019s Got Talent, which left an enormous impression on the judges and audience.\nIt was the first real-time motion capture and VR experience to be presented on a live stage. Huang said the pressure was intense during his performance as it was a live show and no mistakes could be tolerated.\n\u201cI could still sense the thrill and excitement on stage,\u201d he recalled.\nVR expert, storyteller and educator Hsin-Chien Huang.\nCheck out more of Huang\u2019s artwork on his website.\nCarry on, Carry on #WinterArtChallenge\nEnter NVIDIA Studio\u2019s #WinterArtChallenge, running through the end of the year, by sharing winter-themed art on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook for a chance to be featured on our social media channels.\nLike @RippaSats and his fun celebration of penguins.\nhttps://twitter.com/RippaSats/status/1588357669647024128\nBe sure to tag #WinterArtChallenge to join.\nGet creativity-inspiring updates directly to your inbox by subscribing to the NVIDIA Studio newsletter.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | Art | Creators | GeForce | In the NVIDIA Studio | NVIDIA RTX | NVIDIA Studio | Rendering \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

And companies are already making headway with hybrid approaches \u2014 those that combine classical and quantum computing \u2014 to tackle challenges like drug discovery for incurable diseases.\nBy accelerating drug molecule simulation and modeling with hybrid quantum computing, startup Qubit Pharmaceuticals is significantly reducing the time and investment needed to identify promising treatments in oncology, inflammatory diseases and antivirals.\nQubit is building a drug discovery platform using the NVIDIA QODA programming model for hybrid quantum-classical computers and the startup\u2019s Atlas software suite. Atlas creates detailed simulations of physical molecules, accelerating calculations by a factor of 100,000 compared to traditional research methods.\nFounded in 2020, the Paris and Boston-based company is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program that offers go-to-market support, expertise and technology for cutting-edge startups.\nQubit has one of France\u2019s largest GPU supercomputers for drug discovery, powered by NVIDIA DGX systems. The startup aims for pharmaceutical companies to begin testing their first drug candidates discovered through its GPU-accelerated research next year.\n\u201cBy combining NVIDIA\u2019s computational power and leading-edge software with Qubit\u2019s simulation and molecular modeling capabilities, we are confident in our ability to dramatically reduce drug discovery time and cut its cost by a factor of 10,\u201d said Robert Marino, president of Qubit Pharmaceuticals. \u201cThis unique collaboration should enable us to develop the first quantum physics algorithms applied to drug discovery.\u201d\nTapping Unprecedented Computational Capabilities\u00a0\nComputational drug discovery involves generating high-resolution simulations of potential drug molecules and predicting how well those molecules might bind to a target protein in the body.\nFor accurate results, researchers need to perform massive sampling, simulating hundreds of different conformations \u2014 possible spatial arrangements of a molecule\u2019s atoms. They must also correctly model molecules\u2019 force fields, the electric charges that predict affinity, or how a molecule will bind to another.\nThis simulation and modeling requires high performance computing, so Qubit selected an in-house supercomputer built with NVIDIA DGX systems and other NVIDIA-accelerated servers, totaling 200 NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs. The supercomputer runs Qubit\u2019s Atlas software, performing in just a few hours calculations that would take several years with conventional methods.\nAtlas models quantum physics at the microscopic level to achieve maximum accuracy. The Qubit team is adopting NVIDIA QODA to explore the hybrid use of GPU-accelerated supercomputers and quantum computers, where QPUs, or quantum processing units, could one day speed up key software kernels for molecular modeling.\nUsing the NVIDIA cuQuantum SDK, Qubit\u2019s developers can simulate quantum circuits, allowing the team to design algorithms ready to run on future quantum computers.\nAI for Every Stage of Drug Discovery\nQubit estimates that while conventional research methods require pharmaceutical developers to start by synthesizing an average of 5,000 drug compounds before preclinical testing to bring a single drug to market, a simulation-based drug discovery approach could reduce the figure to about 200 \u2014 saving hundreds of millions of dollars and years of development time.\nThe company\u2019s Atlas software includes AI algorithms for every stage of the drug discovery cycle. To support target characterization, where researchers analyze a protein that plays a role in disease, Atlas supports molecular dynamics simulations at microsecond timescales \u2014 helping scientists identify new pockets for drug molecules to bind with the protein.\nDuring drug candidate screening and validation, researchers can use AI models that help narrow the field of potential molecules and generate novel compounds. Qubit is also developing additional filters that predict a candidate molecule\u2019s druggability, safety and cross-reactivity.\nLearn more about Qubit\u2019s HPC and quantum-accelerated molecular dynamics software from company co-founders Jean-Philip Piquemal and Louis Lagard\u00e8re through NVIDIA On-Demand.\nMain image courtesy of Qubit Pharmaceuticals.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | NVIDIA in Europe | Quantum Computing | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

When a developer packages an app using the MONAI Deploy Application software development kit, hospitals can easily run it on premises or in the cloud. The MAPs specification also integrates with healthcare IT standards such as DICOM for medical imaging interoperability.\n\u201cUntil now, most AI models would remain in an R&D loop, rarely reaching patient care,\u201d said Jorge Cardoso, chief technology officer at the London Medical Imaging & AI Centre for Value-Based Healthcare. \u201cMONAI Deploy will help break that loop, making impactful clinical AI a more frequent reality.\u201d\nMONAI Deploy Adopted by Hospitals, Healthcare Startups\nHealthcare institutions, academic medical centers and AI software developers around the world worldwide are adopting MONAI Deploy, including:\n\nCincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital: The academic medical center is creating a MAP for an AI model that automates total cardiac volume segmentation from CT images, aiding pediatric heart transplant patients in a project funded by the National Institutes of Health.\nNational Health Service in England: The NHS Trusts have deployed its MONAI-based AI Deployment Engine platform, known as AIDE, across four hospitals to provide AI-enabled disease-detection tools to healthcare professionals serving 5 million patients a year.\nQure.ai: A member of the NVIDIA Inception program for startups, Qure.ai develops medical imaging AI models for use cases including lung cancer, traumatic brain injuries and tuberculosis. The company is using MAPs to package its solutions for deployment, accelerating its time to clinical impact.\nSimBioSys: The Chicago-based Inception startup builds 3D virtual representations of patients\u2019 tumors and is using MAPs for precision medicine AI applications that can help predict how a patient will respond to a specific treatment.\nUniversity of California, San Francisco: UCSF is developing MAPs for several AI models, with applications including hip fracture detection, liver and brain tumor segmentation, and knee and breast cancer classification.\n\nPutting Medical Imaging AI on the MAP\nThe MAP specification was developed by the MONAI Deploy working group, a team of experts from more than a dozen medical imaging institutions, to benefit AI app developers as well as the clinical and infrastructure platforms that run AI apps.\nFor developers, MAPs can help accelerate AI model evolution by helping researchers easily package and test their models in a clinical environment. This allows them to collect real-world feedback that helps improve the AI.\nFor cloud service providers, supporting MAPs \u2014 which were designed using cloud-native technologies \u2014 enables researchers and companies using MONAI Deploy to run AI applications on their platform, either by using containers or with native app integration. Cloud platforms integrating MONAI Deploy and MAPs include:\n\nAmazon HealthLake Imaging: The MAP connector has been integrated with the HealthLake Imaging service, allowing clinicians to view, process and segment medical images in real time.\nGoogle Cloud: Google Cloud\u2019s Medical Imaging Suite, designed to make healthcare imaging data more accessible, interoperable and useful, has integrated MONAI into its platform to enable clinicians to deploy AI-assisted annotation tools that help automate the highly manual and repetitive task of labeling medical images.\nNuance Precision Imaging Network, powered by Microsoft Azure: Nuance and NVIDIA recently announced a partnership bringing together MONAI and the Nuance Precision Imaging Network, a cloud platform that provides more than 12,000 healthcare facilities with access to AI-powered tools and insights.\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure: Oracle and NVIDIA recently announced a collaboration to bring accelerated compute solutions for healthcare, including MONAI Deploy, to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Developers can start building MAPs with MONAI Deploy today using NVIDIA containers on the Oracle Cloud Marketplace.\n\nGet started with MONAI and discover how NVIDIA is helping build AI-powered medical imaging ecosystems at this week\u2019s RSNA conference.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Open Source | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In most cases, such data may not cover all the types of defects or their locations.Using NVIDIA Replicator and Siemens SynthAI technology, we can procedurally generate sets of photorealistic images using the digital models of our products and production resources and an integrated training pipeline to train ready-to-use models. This speeds up our set-up time for AI inspection models by a factor of five. \u2014 Maximilian Metzner, of GWE.\n\nAs a result, Siemens has begun tapping into NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator running on Amazon G5 instances for synthetic data generation, accelerating its AI model development times from taking \u201cmonths\u201d to \u201cdays,\u201d according to the company.\nSynthetic data is turbocharging model development. It\u2019s boosting datasets for everything from German company Festo\u2019s robotic arm work, to efforts at Amazon Robotics using synthetic data to train robots to identify packages.\nAt Siemens, synthetic data generation is being used beyond defect detection to assist in areas including, but not limited to, robotic bin picking, safety monitoring, welding and wiring inspections, and checking kits of parts.\n\u201cThe better the synthetic data you have, the less real data you need \u2014 obtaining real data is a hassle, so you want to reduce that as much as possible without sacrificing accuracy,\u201d said Alex Greenberg, director of advanced robotics simulation at Siemens Digital Industries Software.\n\nRegister for NVIDIA GTC, which takes place March 17-21, to hear how leading companies like Siemens are using the latest innovations in AI and graphics.\u00a0And join us for OpenUSD Day to learn how to build generative AI-enabled 3D pipelines and tools using Universal Scene Description.\n\nInspecting Motion Control Devices\nThe Siemens Motion Control Business Unit produces inverters, drive controllers and motors for more than 30,000 customers worldwide. The lead electronics plant, GWE, based in Erlangen, Germany, has been working on AI-enabled computer vision for defect detection using custom methods and different modes of synthetic data generation.\nCommon synthetic data generation methods, however, weren\u2019t sufficient for production-ready robustness in some use cases, leading to a need for real data acquisition and labeling, which could take months.\nGWE worked with the Siemens\u2019 Digital Industries Software division to find a better way to produce datasets.\n\u201cFor many industrial use cases, products are changing rapidly. Materials are changing rapidly. It needs to be automated in a fast way and without a lot of know-how from the endpoint engineer,\u201d said Zac Mann, advanced robotics simulation lead at Siemens Digital Industries Software.\nCatching Printed Circuit Board Defects\nThe challenge at GWE is to catch defects early in the ramp-up of new products and production lines. Waiting for real errors to happen just to enhance the training datasets is not an option.\nOne area of focus for defects in a printed circuit board (PCB) is examining the thermal paste that\u2019s applied to some components on the PCB in order to help transfer heat quickly to the attached heatsink, away from the components.\nTo catch PCB defects, the Siemens Digital Industries Software team took another approach by relying on synthetic data driven by Omniverse Replicator.\nWith Omniverse, a platform for building custom 3D pipelines and simulating virtual worlds, Siemens can generate scenarios and much more realistic images easily, aided with RTX technology-enabled physics-based rendering and materials.\nThis enables Siemens to move more quickly and smoothly at developing to close the gap from simulation to reality, said Mann.\n\u201cUsing Omniverse Replicator and Siemens SynthAI technology, we can procedurally generate sets of photorealistic images using the digital models of our products and production resources and an integrated training pipeline to train ready-to-use models. This speeds up our set-up time for AI inspection models by a factor of five and increases their robustness massively,\u201d said Maximilian Metzner, global lead for autonomous manufacturing systems for electronics at GWE.\nTapping Into Randomization With SynthAI\nGWE engineers can now take a 3D CAD model of the PCB and import that into Siemens\u2019 SynthAI tool. SynthAI is designed to build datasets for training AI models.\nTapping into Replicator, SynthAI can access its powerful randomization features to vary the sizes and locations of defects, change lighting, color, texture and more to develop a robust dataset.\nOnce data is generated with Replicator, it can be run through a defect detection model for initial training. This enables GWE engineers to quickly test and iterate on models, requiring only a small set of data to begin.\n\u201cThis gives you visibility earlier into the design phase, and it can shorten time to market, which is very important,\u201d\u00a0 said Greenberg.\n\nGet started using NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator. \n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Omniverse | Synthetic Data Generation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Scientist Sharpens Forecasts With AI\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMachine learning is the latest tool in the pioneering career of meteorologist Dale Durran.\t\t\t\n\n\nNovember 1, 2022 by Rick Merritt \n\n\n\n\n\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Editor\u2019s note: This is the first in\u00a0a series profiling researchers advancing science in the expanding universe of high performance computing. \nA perpetual shower of random raindrops falls inside a three-foot metal ring Dale Durran erected outside his front door (shown above). It\u2019s a symbol of his passion for finding order in the seeming chaos of the planet\u2019s weather.\nA part-time sculptor and full-time professor of atmospheric science at the University of Washington, Durran has co-authored dozens of papers describing patterns in Earth\u2019s ever-changing skies. It\u2019s a field for those who crave a confounding challenge trying to express with math the endless dance of air and water.\nDale Durran\nIn 2019, Durran acquired a new tool, AI. He teamed up with a grad student and a Microsoft researcher to build the first model to demonstrate deep learning\u2019s potential to predict the weather.\nThough crude, the model outperformed the complex equations used for the first computer-based forecasts. The descendants of those equations now run on the world\u2019s biggest supercomputers. In contrast, AI slashes the traditional load of required calculations and works faster on much smaller systems.\n\u201cIt was a dramatic revelation that said we better jump into this with both feet,\u201d Durran recalled.\nSunny Outlook for AI\nLast year, the team took their work to the next level. Their latest neural network can process 320 six-week forecasts in less than a minute on the four NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs in an NVIDIA DGX Station. That\u2019s more than 6x the 51 forecasts today\u2019s supercomputers synthesize to make weather predictions.\nIn a show of how rapidly the technology is evolving, the model was able to forecast, almost as well as traditional methods, what became the path of Hurricane Irma through the Caribbean in 2017. The same model also could crank out a week\u2019s forecast in a tenth of a second on a single NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPU.\nDurran\u2019s latest work used AI to forecast Hurricane Irma\u2019s path in Florida more efficiently and nearly as accurately as traditional methods.\nDurran foresees AI crunching thousands of forecasts simultaneously to deliver a clearer statistical picture with radically fewer resources than conventional equations. Some suggest the performance advances will be measured in as many as five orders of magnitude and use a fraction of the power.\nAI Ingests Satellite Data\nThe next big step could radically widen the lens for weather watchers.\nThe complex equations today\u2019s predictions use can\u2019t readily handle the growing wealth of satellite data on details like cloud patterns, soil moisture and drought stress in plants. Durran believes AI models can.\nOne of his graduate students hopes to demonstrate this winter an AI model that directly incorporates satellite data on global cloud cover. If successful, it could point the way for AI to improve forecasts using the deluge of data types now being collected from space.\nIn a separate effort, researchers at the University of Washington are using deep learning to apply a grid astronomers use to track stars to their work understanding the atmosphere. The novel mesh could help map out a whole new style of weather forecasting, Durran said.\nHarvest of a Good Season\nIn nearly 40 years as an educator, Durran has mentored dozens of students and wrote two highly rated textbooks on fluid dynamics, the math used to understand the weather and climate.\nOne of his students, Gretchen Mullendore, now heads a lab at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research, working with top researchers to improve weather forecasting models.\n\u201cI was lucky to work with Dale in the late 1990s and early 2000s on adapting numerical weather prediction to the latest hardware at the time,\u201d said Mullendore. \u201cI am so thankful to have had an advisor that showed me it\u2019s cool to be excited by science and computers.\u201d\nCarrying on a Legacy\nDurran is slated to receive in January the American Meteorological Society\u2019s most prestigious honor, the Jule G. Charney Medal. It\u2019s named after the scientist who worked with John von Neumann to develop in the 1950s the algorithms weather forecasters still use today.\nCharney was also author in 1979 of one of the earliest scientific papers on global warming. Following in his footsteps, Durran wrote two editorials last year for The Washington Post to help a broad audience understand the impacts of climate change and rising CO2 emissions.\nThe editorials articulate a passion he discovered at his first job in 1976, creating computer models of air pollution trends. \u201cI decided I\u2019d rather work on the front end of that problem,\u201d he said of his career shift to meteorology.\nIt\u2019s a field notoriously bedeviled by effects as subtle as a butterfly\u2019s wings that motivates his passion to advance science.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Customer Stories | Education | GPU Computing | Hardware | High-Performance Computing | HPC Stories | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | Science | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This creates an opportunity for them to apply such technologies as data analytics and AI for improved insights.\nData that was once stored as a paper file with a patient\u2019s medical history, lab results and immunization information is now stored as electronic health records, or EHRs. Digital CT and MRI scanners, as well as software including the PACS medical imaging storage system, are replacing analog radiology tools. And connected sensors in hospital rooms and operating theaters can record multiple continuous streams of data for real-time and retrospective analysis.\nAs hospitals transition to these digital tools, they\u2019re poised to make the shift from a regular hospital to a smart hospital \u2014 one that not only collects data, but also analyzes it to provide valuable, timely insights.\nNatural language processing models can rapidly pull insights from complex pathology reports to support cancer care. Data science can monitor emergency room wait times to resolve bottlenecks. AI-enabled robotics can assist surgeons in the operating room. And video analytics can detect when hand sanitizer supplies are running low or a patient needs attention \u2014 such as detecting the risk of falls in the hospital or at home.\nWhat Are Some Benefits of a Smart Hospital?\nSmart hospital technology benefits healthcare systems, medical professionals and patients in the following ways:\u00a0\n\nHealthcare providers: Smart hospital data can be used to help healthcare facilities optimize their limited resources, increasing operational efficiency for a better patient-centric approach. Sensors can monitor patients when they\u2019re alone in the room. AI algorithms can help inform which patients should be prioritized based on the severity of their case. And telehealth solutions can help deliver care to patients outside of hospital visits.\nClinicians: Smart hospital tools can enable doctors, nurses, medical imaging technicians and other healthcare experts to spend more time focusing on patient care by taking care of routine or laborious tasks, such as writing notes about each patient interaction, segmenting anatomical structures in an MRI or converting doctor\u2019s notes into medical codes for insurance billing. They can also aid clinical decision-making with AI algorithms that provide a second opinion or triage recommendation for individual patients based on historical data.\nPatients: Smart hospital technology can bring health services closer to the goal of consistent, high-quality patient care \u2014 anywhere in the world, from any doctor. Clinicians vary in skill level, areas of expertise, access to resources and time available per patient. By deploying AI and robotics to monitor patterns and automate time-consuming tasks, smart hospitals can allow clinicians to focus on interacting with their patients for a better experience.\n\nHow Can I Make My Hospital Smart?\u00a0\nRunning a smart hospital requires an entire ecosystem of hardware and software solutions working in harmony with clinician workflows. To accelerate and improve patient care, every application, device, sensor and AI model in the system must share data and insights across the institution.\nThink of the smart hospital as an octopus. Its head is the organization\u2019s secure server that stores and processes the entire facility\u2019s data. Each of its tentacles is a different department \u2014 emergency room, ICU, operating room, radiology lab \u2014 covered in sensors (octopus suckers) that take in data from their surroundings.\nIf each tentacle operated in a silo, it would be impossible for the octopus to take rapid action across its entire body based on the information sensed by a single arm. Every tentacle sends data back to the octopus\u2019 central brain, enabling the creature to flexibly respond to its changing environment.\nIn the same way, the smart hospital is a hub-and-spoke model, with sensors distributed across a facility that can send critical insights back to a central brain, helping inform facility-wide decisions. For instance, if camera feeds in an operating room show that a surgical procedure is almost complete, AI would alert staff in the recovery room to be ready for the patient\u2019s arrival.\nTo power smart hospital solutions, medical device companies, academic medical centers and startups are turning to NVIDIA Clara, an end-to-end AI platform that integrates with the entire hospital network \u2014 from medical devices running real-time applications to secure servers that store and process data in the long term. It supports edge, data center and cloud infrastructure, numerous software libraries, and a global partner ecosystem to power the coming generation of smart hospitals.\nSmart Hospital Operations and Patient Monitoring\nA bustling hospital has innumerable moving parts \u2014 patients, staff, medicine and equipment \u2014 presenting an opportunity for AI automation to optimize operations around the facility.\nWhile a doctor or nurse can\u2019t be at a patient\u2019s side at every moment of their hospital stay, a combination of intelligent video analytics and other smart sensors can closely monitor patients, alerting healthcare providers when the person is in distress and needs attention.\nIn an ICU, for instance, patients are connected to monitoring devices that continuously collect vital signs. Many of these continuously beep with various alerts, which can lead healthcare practitioners to sometimes overlook the alarm of a single sensor.\nBy instead aggregating the streaming data from multiple devices into a single feed, AI algorithms can analyze the data in real time, helping more quickly detect if a patient\u2019s condition takes a sudden turn for the better or worse.\nThe Houston Methodist Institute for Academic Medicine is working with Mark III Systems, an Elite member of the NVIDIA Partner Network, to deploy an AI-based tool called DeepStroke that can detect stroke symptoms in triage more accurately and earlier based on a patient\u2019s speech and facial movements. By integrating these AI models into the emergency room workflow, the hospital can more quickly identify the proper treatment for stroke patients, helping ensure clinicians don\u2019t miss patients who would potentially benefit from life-saving treatments.\nUsing enterprise-grade solutions from Dell and NVIDIA \u2014 including GPU-accelerated Dell PowerEdge servers, the NVIDIA Fleet Command hybrid cloud system and the DeepStream software development kit for AI streaming analytics \u2014 Inception startup Artisight manages a smart hospital network including over 2,000 cameras and microphones at Northwestern Medicine.\nOne of Artisight\u2019s models alerts nurses and physicians to patients at risk of harm. Another system, based on in-door positioning system data, automates clinic workflows to maximize staff productivity and improve patient satisfaction. A third detects preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative events to coordinate surgical throughput.\nThese systems make it easy to add functionality regardless of location: an AI-backed sensor network that monitors hospital rooms to prevent a patient from falling can also detect when hospital supplies are running low, or when an operating room needs to be cleaned.The systems even extend beyond the hospital walls via Artisight\u2019s integrated teleconsult tools to monitor at-risk patients at home.\nThe last key element of healthcare operations is medical coding, the process of turning a clinician\u2019s notes into a set of alphanumeric codes representing every diagnosis and procedure. These codes are of particular significance in the U.S., where they form the basis for the bills that doctors, clinics and hospitals submit to stakeholders including insurance providers and patients.\nInception startup Fathom has developed AI models to automate the painstaking process of medical coding, reducing costs while increasing speed and precision. Founded in 2016, the company works with the nation\u2019s largest health systems, billing companies and physician groups, coding over 20 million patient encounters annually.\nMedical Imaging in Smart Hospitals\nDeep learning first gained its popularity as a tool for identifying objects in images. This is one of the earliest healthcare industry uses for the technology, too. There are dozens of AI models with regulatory approval in the medical imaging space, helping radiology departments in smart hospitals accelerate the analysis of CT, MRI and X-ray data.\nAI can pre-screen scans, flagging areas that require a radiologist\u2019s attention to save time \u2014 giving them more bandwidth to look at additional scans or explain results to patients. It can move critical cases like brain bleeds to the top of a radiologist\u2019s worklist, shortening the time to diagnose and treat life-threatening cases. And it can enhance the resolution of radiology images, allowing clinicians to reduce the necessary dosage per patient.\nLeading medical imaging companies and researchers are using NVIDIA technology to power next-generation applications that can be used in smart hospital environments.\nSiemens Healthineers developed deep learning-based autocontouring solutions, enabling precise contouring of organs at risk in radiation therapy.\nAnd Fujifilm Healthcare uses NVIDIA GPUs to power its Cardio StillShot software, which conducts precise cardiac imaging during a CT scan. To accelerate its work, the team used software including the NVIDIA Optical Flow SDK to estimate pixel-level motion and NVIDIA Nsight Compute to optimize performance.\nStartups in NVIDIA Inception, too, are advancing medical imaging workflows with AI, such as Shanghai-based United Imaging Intelligence. The company\u2019s uAI platform empowers devices, doctors and researchers with full-stack, full-spectrum AI applications, covering imaging, screening, follow-up, diagnosis, treatment and evaluation. Its uVision intelligent scanning system runs on the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform.\nLearn more about startups using NVIDIA AI for medical imaging applications.\nDigital and Robotic Surgery in Smart Hospitals\nIn a smart hospital\u2019s operating room, intelligent video analytics and robotics are embedded to take in data and provide AI-powered alerts and guidance to surgeons.\nMedical device developers and startups are working on tools to advance surgical training, help surgeons plan procedures ahead of time, provide real-time support and monitoring during an operation, and aid in post-surgery recordkeeping and retrospective analysis.\nParis-based robotic surgery company Moon Surgical is designing Maestro, an accessible, adaptive surgical-assistant robotics system that works with the equipment and workflows that operating rooms already have in place. The startup has adopted NVIDIA Clara Holoscan to save time and resources, helping compress its development timeline.\nActiv Surgical has selected Holoscan to accelerate development of its AI and augmented-reality solution for real-time surgical guidance. The Boston-based company\u2019s ActivSight technology allows surgeons to view critical physiological structures and functions, like blood flow, that cannot be seen with the naked eye.\nAnd London-based Proximie will use Holoscan to enable telepresence in the operating room, bringing expert surgeons and AI solutions into each procedure. By integrating this information into surgical imaging systems, the company aims to reduce surgical complication rates, improving patient safety and care.\nTelemedicine \u2014 Smart Hospital Technology at Home\nAnother part of smart hospital technology is ensuring patients who don\u2019t need to be admitted to the hospital can receive care from home through wearables, smartphone apps, video appointments, phone calls and text-based messaging tools. Tools like these reduce the burden on healthcare facilities \u2014 particularly with the use of AI chatbots that can communicate effectively with patients.\nNatural language processing AI is powering intelligent voice assistants and chatbots for telemedicine at companies like Curai, a member of the NVIDIA Inception global network of startups.\nCurai is applying GPU-powered AI to connect patients, providers and care teams via a chat-based application. Patients can input information about their conditions, access their medical profiles and chat with providers 24/7. The app also supports providers by offering diagnostic and treatment suggestions based on Curai\u2019s deep learning algorithms.\nCurai\u2019s main areas of AI focus have been natural language processing (for extracting data from medical conversations), medical reasoning (for providing diagnosis and treatment recommendations), and image processing and classification (largely for images uploaded by patients).\nVirtual care tools like Curai\u2019s can be used for preventative or convenient care at any time, or after a patient\u2019s doctor visit to ensure they\u2019re responding well to treatment.\nMedical Research Using Smart Hospital Data\u00a0\nThe usefulness of smart hospital data doesn\u2019t end when a patient is discharged \u2014 it can inform years of research, becoming part of an institution\u2019s database that helps improve operational efficiency, preventative care, drug discovery and more. With collaborative tools like federated learning, the benefits can go beyond a single medical institution and improve research across the healthcare field globally.\nNeurosurgical Atlas, the largest association of neurosurgeons in the world, aims to advance the care of patients suffering from neurosurgical disorders through new, efficient surgical techniques. The Atlas includes a library of surgery recordings and simulations that give neurosurgeons unprecedented understanding of potential pitfalls before conducting an operation, creating a new standard for technical excellence. In the future, Neurosurgical Atlas plans to enable digital twin representations specific to individual patients.\nThe University of Florida\u2019s academic health center, UF Health, has used digital health records representing more than 50 million interactions with 2 million patients to train GatorTron, a model that can help identify patients for lifesaving clinical trials, predict and alert health teams about life-threatening conditions, and provide clinical decision support to doctors.\nThe electronic medical records were also used to develop SynGatorTron, a language model that can generate synthetic health records to help augment small datasets \u2014 or enable AI model sharing while preserving the privacy of real patient data.\nIn Texas, MD Anderson is harnessing hospital records for population data analysis. Using the NVIDIA NeMo toolkit for natural language processing, the researchers developed a conversational AI platform that performs genomic analysis with cancer omics data \u2014 including survival analysis, mutation analysis and sequencing data processing.\nLearn more about smart hospital technology and subscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Explainer | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Embedded Computing | Healthcare and Life Sciences | NVIDIA Clara | NVIDIA NeMo | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

It\u2019s backed by a broad group that includes Amazon, Arm, Baidu, Google, Harvard University, Intel, Meta, Microsoft, Stanford University and the University of Toronto.\nIn a related MLPerf benchmark also released today, NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs raised the bar they set last year in high performance computing (HPC).\nNVIDIA H100 GPUs were up to 6.7x faster than A100 GPUs when they were first submitted for MLPerf Training.\nH100 GPUs (aka Hopper) raised the bar in per-accelerator performance in MLPerf Training. They delivered up to 6.7x more performance than previous-generation GPUs when they were first submitted on MLPerf training. By the same comparison, today\u2019s A100 GPUs pack 2.5x more muscle, thanks to advances in software.\nDue in part to its Transformer Engine, Hopper excelled in training the popular BERT model for natural language processing. It\u2019s among the largest and most performance-hungry of the MLPerf AI models.\nMLPerf gives users the confidence to make informed buying decisions because the benchmarks cover today\u2019s most popular AI workloads \u2014 computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems, reinforcement learning and more. The tests are peer reviewed, so users can rely on their results.\nA100 GPUs Hit New Peak in HPC\nIn the separate suite of MLPerf HPC benchmarks, A100 GPUs swept all tests of training AI models in demanding scientific workloads run on supercomputers. The results show the NVIDIA AI platform\u2019s ability to scale to the world\u2019s toughest technical challenges.\nFor example, A100 GPUs trained AI models in the CosmoFlow test for astrophysics 9x faster than the best results two years ago in the first round of MLPerf HPC. In that same workload, the A100 also delivered up to a whopping 66x more throughput per chip than an alternative offering.\nThe HPC benchmarks train models for work in astrophysics, weather forecasting and molecular dynamics. They are among many technical fields, like drug discovery, adopting AI to advance science.\nIn tests around the globe, A100 GPUs led in both speed and throughput of training.\nSupercomputer centers in Asia, Europe and the U.S. participated in the latest round of the MLPerf HPC tests. In its debut on the DeepCAM benchmarks, Dell Technologies showed strong results using NVIDIA A100 GPUs.\nAn Unparalleled Ecosystem\nIn the enterprise AI training benchmarks, a total of 11 companies, including the Microsoft Azure cloud service, made submissions using NVIDIA A100, A30 and A40 GPUs. System makers including ASUS, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro used a total of nine NVIDIA-Certified Systems for their submissions.\nIn the latest round, at least three companies joined NVIDIA in submitting results on all eight MLPerf training workloads. That versatility is important because real-world applications often require a suite of diverse AI models.\nNVIDIA partners participate in MLPerf because they know it\u2019s a valuable tool for customers evaluating AI platforms and vendors.\nUnder the Hood\nThe NVIDIA AI platform provides a full stack from chips to systems, software and services. That enables continuous performance improvements over time.\nFor example, submissions in the latest HPC tests applied a suite of software optimizations and techniques described in a technical article. Together they slashed runtime on one benchmark by 5x, to just 22 minutes from 101 minutes.\nA second article describes how NVIDIA optimized its platform for the enterprise AI benchmarks. For example, we used NVIDIA DALI\u00a0 to efficiently load and pre-process data for a computer vision benchmark.\nAll the software used in the tests is available from the MLPerf repository, so anyone can get these world-class results. NVIDIA continuously folds these optimizations into containers available on NGC, a software hub for GPU applications.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | Recommender Systems | Science | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The automaker also launched additional versions of the hit Lucid Air sedan \u2014 Air Pure and Air Touring.\nBoth models offer the future-ready DreamDrive Pro driver-assistance system, powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE platform.\nLucid launched the Air late last year to widespread acclaim. The luxury sedan won MotorTrend\u2019s Car of the Year for 2022, with a chart-topping battery range of up to 516 miles and fast charging.\nThe newly introduced variants provide updated features for a wider audience. Air Pure is designed for agility, with a lightweight, compact battery and industry-leading aerodynamics.\nAir Touring is the heart of the lineup, featuring more horsepower and battery range than the Pure and greater flexibility in customer options.\nLucid Air Pure\nGravity builds on this stellar reputation with an aerodynamic, spacious and intelligent design, all backed by the high-performance, centralized compute of NVIDIA DRIVE.\n\u201cJust as Lucid Air redefined the sedan category, so too will Gravity impact the world of luxury SUVs, setting new benchmarks across the board,\u201d said Lucid Group CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson.\nCapable and Enjoyable\nDreamDrive Pro is software defined, continuously improving via over-the-air software updates.\nIt uses a rich suite of 14 cameras, one lidar, five radars and 12 ultrasonics running on NVIDIA DRIVE for robust automated driving and intelligent cockpit features, including surround-view monitoring, blind-spot display and highway assist.\nIn addition to a diversity of sensors, Lucid\u2019s dual-rail power system and proprietary Ethernet Ring offer a high degree of redundancy for key systems, such as braking and steering.\nThe DreamDrive Pro system uses an array of sensors and NVIDIA DRIVE high-performance compute for intelligent driving features.\n\u201cThe Lucid Air is at its core a software-defined vehicle, meaning a large part of the experience is delivered by the software,\u201d Rawlinson said. \u201cThis makes the Lucid Air more capable and enjoyable with every passing update.\u201d\nPrepare to Launch\nThese new Lucid vehicles are nearly ready for liftoff.\nThe Lucid Air Touring has already begun production, and Air Pure will start in December, with customer deliveries soon to follow.\nThe automaker will open reservations for the Lucid Gravity in the spring, slating deliveries to begin in 2024.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

A touch screen displays a dashboard with the status of all of its nodes.\n\u201cWe started this project to demonstrate the nuts and bolts of what goes into a computer cluster,\u201d said Eric Godat, team lead for research and data science in the internal IT organization at SMU.\nNext week, the baby supercomputer will be on display at SC22, a supercomputing conference taking place in Dallas, just down the highway from SMU.\nThe SMU team will host a booth to talk to researchers, vendors and students about the university\u2019s high-performance computing programs and the recent deployment of its NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD for AI-accelerated research.\nPlus, in collaboration with Mark III Systems \u2014 a member of the NVIDIA Partner Network \u2014 the SMU Office of Information Technology will provide conference attendees with a tour of the campus data center to showcase the DGX SuperPOD in action. Learn details at SMU\u2019s booth #3834.\n\u201cWe\u2019re bringing the baby supercomputer to the conference to get people to stop by and ask, \u2018Oh, what\u2019s that?\u2019\u201d said Godat, who served as a mentor for Conner Ozenne, a senior computer science major at SMU and one of the brains behind the cluster.\n\n\u201cI started studying computer science in high school because programming fulfilled the foreign language requirement,\u201d said Ozenne, who now aims to integrate AI and machine learning with web design for his career. \u201cDoing those first projects as a high school freshman, I immediately knew this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\u201d\nOzenne is a STAR at SMU \u2014 a Student Technology Associate in Residence. He first pitched the design and budget for the baby supercomputer to Godat\u2019s team two summers ago. With a grant of a couple thousand dollars and a whole lot of enthusiasm, he got to work.\nBirth of a Baby Supercomputer\nOzenne, in collaboration with another student, built the baby supercomputer from scratch.\n\u201cThey had to learn how to strip wires and not shock themselves \u2014 they put together everything from the power supplies to the networking all by themselves,\u201d Godat said. With a smile, he added, \u201cWe only started one small fire.\u201d\n\nThe first iteration was a mess of wires on a table connecting the NVIDIA Jetson Nano developer kits, with cardboard boxes as heatsinks, Ozenne said.\n\u201cWe chose to use NVIDIA Jetson modules because no other small compute devices have onboard GPUs, which would let us tackle more AI and machine learning problems,\u201d he added.\nSoon Ozenne gave the baby supercomputer case upgrades: from cardboard to foam to acrylic plates, which he laser cut from 3D vector files in SMU\u2019s innovation gym, a makerspace for students.\n\n\u201cIt was my first time doing all of this, and it was a great learning experience, with lots of fun nights in the lab,\u201d Ozenne said.\nA Work in Progress\nIn just four months, the project went from nothing to something that resembled a supercomputer, according to Ozenne. But the project is ongoing.\nThe team is now developing the mini cluster\u2019s software stack, with the help of the NVIDIA JetPack software development kit, and prepping it to accomplish some small-scale machine learning tasks. Plus, the baby supercomputer could level up with the recently announced NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano modules.\n\u201cOur NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD just opened up on campus, so we don\u2019t really need this baby supercomputer to be an actual compute environment,\u201d Godat said. \u201cBut the mini cluster is an effective teaching tool for how all this stuff really works \u2014 it lets students experiment with stripping the wires, managing a parallel file system, reimaging cards and deploying cluster software.\u201d\nSMU\u2019s NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, which includes 160 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, is in an alpha-rollout phase for faculty, who are using it to train AI models for molecular dynamics, computational chemistry, astrophysics, quantum mechanics and a slew of other research topics.\nGodat collaborates with the NVIDIA DGX team to flexibly configure the DGX SuperPOD to support tens of different AI, machine learning, data processing and HPC projects.\n\u201cI love it, because every day is different \u2014 I could be working on an AI-related project in the school of the arts, and the next day I\u2019m in the law school, and the next I\u2019m in the particle physics department,\u201d said Godat, who himself has a Ph.D. in theoretical particle physics from SMU.\n\u201cThere are applications for AI everywhere,\u201d Ozenne agreed.\nLearn more from Godat and other experts on designing an AI Center of Excellence in this NVIDIA GTC session available on demand.\nJoin NVIDIA at SC22 to explore partner booths on the show floor and engage with virtual content all week \u2014 including a special address, demos and other sessions.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | RoboticsTags: Data Science | Education | GPU | Jetson | NVIDIA DGX | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

The system will take advantage of GPU computing instances from Amazon Web Services and NVIDIA DGX and OVX servers on premises.\nThe fast, flexible system will provide a prototype to visualize geophysical variables from NOAA satellite and ground data sources from a broad range of sources.\nThese include temperature and moisture profiles, sea surface temperatures, sea ice concentrations and solar wind data, among other sources.\nThat data will be collected by Lockheed Martin\u2019s OpenRosetta3D software, which is widely used for sophisticated large-scale image analysis, workflow orchestration and sensor fusion by government agencies, such as NASA, and private industry.\nNVIDIA will support the development of one-way connectors to import \u201csnapshots\u201d of processed geospatial datasets from Lockheed\u2019s OpenRosetta3D technology into NVIDIA Omniverse Nucleus as Universal Scene Description inputs.\nUSD is an open source and extensible ecosystem for describing, composing, simulating and collaborating within 3D worlds, initially invented by Pixar Animation Studios.\nOmniverse Nucleus will be vital to making the data available fast, in part because of Nucleus\u2019s ability to relay just what\u2019s changed in a dataset, Montgomery explained.\nNucleus will, in turn, deliver those USD datasets to Lockheed\u2019s Agatha 3D viewer, based on Unity, allowing users to quickly see data from multiple sensors on an interactive 3D earth and space platform.\nThe result is a system that will help researchers at NOAA, and, eventually, elsewhere, make decisions faster based on the latest available data.\n\n\nCategories: Accelerated AnalyticsTags: Climate | NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo | Omniverse | Social Impact | Universal Scene Description \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The latest have allowed IT organizations to reduce costs even while dealing with exponential data growth.\nSimulation and digital twins can help data center designers, builders and operators create highly efficient and performant facilities. But building a digital twin that can accurately represent all components of an AI supercomputing facility is a massive, complex undertaking.\nThe NVIDIA Omniverse simulation platform helps address this challenge by streamlining the process for collaborative virtual design. An Omniverse demo at SC22\u00a0showcased how the people behind data centers can use this open development platform to enhance the design and development of complex supercomputing facilities.\nOmniverse, for the first time, lets data center operators aggregate real-time data inputs from their core third-party computer-aided design, simulation and monitoring applications so they can see and work with their complete datasets in real time.\nThe demo shows how Omniverse allows users to tap into the power of accelerated computing, simulation and operational digital twins connected to real-time monitoring and AI. This enables teams to streamline facility design, accelerate construction and deployment, and optimize ongoing operations.\nThe demo also highlighted NVIDIA Air, a data center simulation platform designed to work in conjunction with Omniverse to simulate the network \u2014 the central nervous system of the data center. With NVIDIA Air, teams can model the entire network stack, allowing them to automate and validate network hardware and software prior to bring-up.\n\nCreating Digital Twins to Elevate Design and Simulation\nIn planning and constructing one of NVIDIA\u2019s latest AI supercomputers, multiple engineering CAD datasets were collected from third-party industry tools such as Autodesk Revit, PTC Creo and Trimble SketchUp. This allowed designers and engineers to view the Universal Scene Description-based model in full fidelity, and they could collaboratively iterate on the design in real time.\nPATCH MANAGER is an enterprise software application for planning cabling, assets and physical layer point-to-point connectivity in network domains. With PATCH MANAGER connected to Omniverse, the complex topology of port-to-port connections, rack and node layouts, and cabling can be integrated directly into the live model. This enables data center engineers to see the full view of the model and its dependencies.\n\nTo predict airflow and heat transfers, engineers used Cadence 6SigmaDCX, a software for computational fluid dynamics. Engineers can also use AI surrogates trained with NVIDIA Modulus for \u201cwhat-if\u201d analysis in near-real time. This lets teams simulate changes in complex thermals and cooling, and they can see the results instantly.\nAnd with NVIDIA Air, the exact network topology \u2014 including protocols, monitoring and automation \u2014 can be simulated and prevalidated.\n\nOnce construction of a data center is complete, its sensors, control system and telemetry can be connected to the digital twin inside Omniverse, enabling real-time monitoring of operations.\nWith a perfectly synchronized digital twin, engineers can simulate common dangers such as power peaking or cooling system failures. Operators can benefit from AI-recommended changes that optimize for key priorities like boosting energy efficiency and reducing carbon footprint. The digital twin also allows them to test and validate software and component upgrades before deploying to the physical data center.\nCatch up on the latest announcements by watching NVIDIA\u2019s SC22 special address, and learn more about NVIDIA Omniverse.\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | Digital Twin | Omniverse | Simulation and Design | Universal Scene Description \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

Healthcare. Factory automation. Telecommunications. Advertising and marketing. Financial services. Climate science. One thing these industries all have in common is that they use artificial intelligence. Today, we\u2019re making it easier than ever for STEM students to learn the in-demand AI skills that they will need to be successful in industry.\nAs AI continues to develop as one of the world\u2019s most important technologies, impacting nearly every part of the global economy, students should pay attention. The demand for graduates with expertise in artificial intelligence is exploding. Indeed has identified AI as one of the most in demand tech skills in 2022, and Forbes has projected that nearly 100 million jobs involving AI will be created in the next four years. As such, colleges and universities are creating new courses and educational programs focusing on these skills.\nIn order to prepare for careers, students studying popular STEM disciplines like computer science, data science, information sciences, economics, and related fields need access to the same technology that is used by research and industry. NVIDIA\u2019s GPU-accelerated artificial intelligence platform is the de facto standard for AI development, and has been adopted by universities worldwide.\nToday, in conjunction with the release of the latest Game Ready Driver, which includes support for CUDA 12,\u00a0 NVIDIA is announcing support for the RAPIDS suite of software for machine learning, data analytics, and other AI/ML-related techniques, available now on Windows 11 PCs, powered by\u00a0NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs. And, we\u2019ve made available new Windows 11-based training resources including Learning Deep Learning for students and other AI learners. Now students can design, develop, and evaluate models and applications for deep learning, machine learning, data analytics, and graph analytics, accelerated by powerful GPUs, from the comfort of Windows 11.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow GPUs Help Students\nGPUs are tremendous parallel processors, which simply mean they can do a lot of mathematical operations at once. The same technology that makes them great for rendering video games also allows them to crank through the calculations that are needed for artificial intelligence. In fact, GPUs from NVIDIA are credited as one of the three key innovations that led to modern AI. \nStudents who own laptops powered by GeForce RTX GPUs can now run these workloads on their own computers, which can help them finish coursework faster, not have to rely on school-provided computer labs or cloud credits, and be able to use the same trusted technology stack that is used in research and in industry. And of course, RTX GPUs power student hobbies, supercharging the latest games and energizing creative apps. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about GeForce RTX for STEM students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing New Technology and Learning Tools\nToday access to NVIDIA\u2019s AI platform gets easier than ever. We\u2019re announcing support for a core software package and a key learning resource. These were previously only available on Linux, but now come to Windows 11 running on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):\n\nNVIDIA RAPIDS - NVIDIA\u2019s open-source software libraries and APIs for GPU accelerated data science, including data analytics, graph analytics, geospatial analytics, signal analytics and traditional machine learning. RAPIDS is based on the popular PyData stack. \nLearning Deep Learning - Published as part of the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI), this book contains fundamental training content that students and learners can use to augment or direct their learning of these powerful techniques.\n\nBringing this technology to Windows 11 significantly lowers the bar for students to take advantage of it, and gives students more options for how and where to study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShown: HP OMEN 16 with GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU, one of the top choices for STEM students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Students Can Get Started with NVIDIA\u2019s AI Platform on GeForce RTX PCs\nWhether you are a new student curious about artificial intelligence, or already far along in a degree program, here are some great resources for setting up your own PC to learn and develop for AI.\n\nSetting up - These instructions help you quickly get your RTX-powered Windows 11 desktop or laptop set up to use the AI and data science training resources that follow. \nLearning Deep Learning - Part of the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI), Magnus Ekman\u2019s foundational book takes you from basic techniques to applications of deep learning, one of the most exciting techniques in modern AI,. The book is available in hard copy or electronic format. \nLearning RAPIDS - This page provides additional information on using RAPIDS in WSL, and links to additional resources and tools.\n\nLearn more about how GeForce RTX benefits STEM students here.

It\u2019s built on MONAI, an open-source medical imaging AI framework co-developed by NVIDIA and the AI Centre, which allows AI applications to interface with hospital systems.\nTogether, MONAI and AIDE enable safe and effective validation, deployment and evaluation of medical imaging AI models, which the NHS will apply in diagnosing and treating cancers, stroke, dementia and other conditions. The platform is being deployed at the following facilities: Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019s, King\u2019s College Hospital, East Kent Hospital University and University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trusts.\n\u201cDeployment of this infrastructure for clinical AI tools is a hugely exciting step in integrating AI into healthcare services,\u201d said James Teo, professor of neurology and data science at King\u2019s College Hospital NHS. \u201cThese platforms will provide a scalable way for clinicians to deploy healthcare AI tools to support decision-making to improve the speed and precision of patient care. This is the start of a digital transformation journey with strong, safe and open foundations.\u201d\nMONAI Making Hospital Integration Easier\nIntroduced in 2019, MONAI is reducing the complexity of medical workflows from R&D to the clinic. It allows developers to easily build and deploy AI applications, resulting in a model ready for clinical integration, and making it easier to interpret medical exams and unlock new levels of knowledge about patients.\nMONAI provides deep learning infrastructure and workflows optimized for medical imaging. MONAI, with more than 650,000 downloads, is used by leading healthcare institutions Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Hospital and King\u2019s College Hospital in the U.K., for its ability to harness the power and potential of medical imaging data to simplify and streamline the process for building AI models.\n\u201cAcross the healthcare ecosystem, researchers, hospitals and startups are realizing the power of incorporating a streamlined AI pipeline into their work,\u201d said Haris Shuaib, AI transformation lead at the AI Centre. \u201cThe open-source MONAI ecosystem is standardizing hundreds of AI algorithms for maximum interoperability and impact, enabling their deployment in just a few weeks instead of three-to-six months.\u201d\nBuilt in collaboration with the AI Centre for Value Based Healthcare \u2014 a consortium of universities, hospitals and industry partners led by King\u2019s College London and Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust \u2014 AIDE brings the capabilities of AI to clinicians. This solution equips clinicians with improved information about patients, making healthcare data more accessible and interoperable, in order to improve patient care.\nThe AI Centre has already developed algorithms to improve diagnosis of COVID-19, breast cancer, brain tumor, stroke detection and dementia risk. AIDE connects approved AI algorithms to a patient\u2019s medical record seamlessly and securely, with the data never leaving the hospital trust.\nOnce the clinical data has been analyzed, the results are sent back to the electronic healthcare record to support clinical decision-making. This provides another valuable data point for clinical multidisciplinary teams when reviewing patients\u2019 cases. It\u2019s hoped that AIDE can support speeding up this process to benefit patients.\n\u201cThe AI Centre has done invaluable work towards integrating AI into national healthcare. Deploying MONAI is a critical milestone in our journey to enable the use of safe and robot AI innovations within the clinic,\u201d said Professor Sebastien Ourselin, deputy director of the AI Centre. \u201cThis could only be achieved through our strong partnerships between academic and industry leaders like NVIDIA.\u201d\nAIDE was displayed in Chicago as part of the RSNA Imaging AI in Practice demonstration. The open-source code for AIDE is now published on GitHub.\nGet started with MONAI and watch the NVIDIA RSNA special address. \n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | NVIDIA in Europe | Open Source | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

Following this initial trial launch, we are continuing to test the program, with a few new additions.\nFirstly, Verified Priority Access will give a limited number of opportunities to purchase GeForce RTX 4080 graphics cards shortly after the worldwide release on November 16th. At the same time, a limited quantity of GeForce RTX 4090 graphics cards will also be made available. Invited users will receive a unique link to purchase a single graphics card on a first-come, first-served basis, while supplies last. \nSecondly, we are working with our participating etail partners and add-in-card partners to include more GeForce RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 models in the Verified Priority Access trial, in addition to NVIDIA\u2019s limited Founders Edition design. Availability of these additional models will vary by etailer.\nLastly, we\u2019re opening sign-ups to be considered for a Verified Priority Access invitation. There may be many more sign-ups than cards available in this trial, so enrolling does not guarantee getting selected for an invitation. At this time, sign-ups are open for NVIDIA Accounts that were created on or before November 15th, 2022.\nSign-up, using the same account you use for GeForce Experience, here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

NVIDIA customers such as Argonne National Laboratory, Lockheed Martin and Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory are already seeing benefits of Omniverse for HPC workloads.\nGlobal Scientific Leaders Support Omniverse \r\nArgonne National Laboratory is using NVIDIA Omniverse on its A100-powered Polaris supercomputer to connect its legacy visualization tools as a first step to developing the foundations for future digital twins.\n\u201cVisualization workflows at Argonne National Laboratory are getting increasingly complex \u2014 ranging from handling terabytes of cosmology data to photorealistic renderings of engineered devices \u2014 and these collaborative projects involve teams of scientists, engineers and artists all using highly specialized tools,\u201d said Michael Papka, deputy associate laboratory director and director at Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. \u201cOmniverse homogenizes such complex workflows, retains the expertise of established tools and opens the opportunity for entirely new workflows, including building digital twins.\u201d\nPrinceton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), the U.S. Department of Energy national laboratory for plasma physics and fusion science, is using Omniverse to connect and accelerate state-of-the-art, synthetic, real-time HPC simulators to model fusion devices and control systems, and ultimately improve the operation of the experiment toward a new commercially viable clean-energy source.\n\u201cSecuring clean energy is a crucial goal for research scientists and engineers \u2014 as well as a major target for government organizations,\u201d said William Tang, principal research physicist at PPPL and affiliated faculty at Princeton University\u2019s Center for Statistics and Machine Learning. \u201cA fully live, truly interactive scientific digital twin of a fusion device that enables real-time simulation workflows built on Omniverse will open doors to new abilities for generating clean power for a better future.\u201d\nAligning with NVIDIA\u2019s Earth-2 initiative to accelerate climate research, aerospace leader Lockheed Martin recently began using NVIDIA Omniverse to provide the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) with better global environmental situational awareness and to develop an interactive climate research pipeline.\n\u201cAt Lockheed Martin, we regularly use digital twins and artificial intelligence to provide our government customers with the clearest, current situational picture and actionable intelligence for their important missions,\u201d said Matt Ross, senior program manager at Lockheed Martin Space. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased that we can use our technology experience to collaborate with NVIDIA on this Earth Observation Digital Twin project, where we will fuse together a tremendous amount of satellite and ground-based sensor data to provide NOAA a global visualization of their own important mission space.\u201d\nAvailability\r\nThese new features are now supported in NVIDIA Omniverse, available for developers and enterprises.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Skycatch, a San Francisco-based startup, has been helping companies mine both data and minerals for nearly a decade.\nThe software-maker is now digging into the creation of digital twins, with an initial focus on the mining and construction industry, using the NVIDIA Omniverse platform for connecting and building custom 3D pipelines.\nSkyVerse, which is a part of Skycatch\u2019s vision AI platform, is a combination of computer vision software and custom Omniverse extensions that enables users to enrich and animate virtual worlds of mines and other sites with near-real-time geospatial data.\n\u201cWith Omniverse, we can turn massive amounts of non-visual data into dynamic visual information that\u2019s easy to contextualize and consume,\u201d said Christian Sanz, founder and CEO of Skycatch. \u201cWe can truly recreate the physical world.\u201d\nSkyVerse can help industrial sites simulate variables such as weather, broken machines and more up to five years into the future \u2014 while learning from happenings up to five years in the past, Sanz said.\nThe platform automates the entire visualization pipeline for mining and construction environments.\nFirst, it processes data from drones, lidar and other sensors across the environment, whether at the edge using the NVIDIA Jetson platform or in the cloud.\nIt then creates 3D meshes from 2D images, using neural networks built from NVIDIA\u2019s pretrained models to remove unneeded objects like dump trucks and other equipment from the visualizations.\nNext, SkyVerse stitches this into a single 3D model that\u2019s converted to the Universal Scene Description (USD) framework. The master model is then brought into Omniverse Enterprise for the creation of a digital twin that\u2019s live-synced with real-world telemetry data.\n\u201cThe simulation of machines in the environment, different weather conditions, traffic jams \u2014 no other platform has enabled this, but all of it is possible in Omniverse with hyperreal physics and object mass, which is really groundbreaking,\u201d Sanz said.\nSkycatch is a Premier partner in NVIDIA Inception, a free, global program that nurtures startups revolutionizing industries with cutting-edge technologies. Premier partners receive additional go-to-market support, exposure to venture capital firms and technical expertise to help them scale faster.\nProcessing and Visualizing Data\nCompanies have deployed Skycatch\u2019s fully automated technologies to gather insights from aerial data across tens of thousands of sites at several top mining companies.\nThe Skycatch team first determines optimal positioning of the data-collection sensors across mine vehicles using the NVIDIA Isaac Sim platform, a robotics simulation and synthetic data generation (SDG) tool for developing, testing and training AI-based robots.\n\u201cIsaac Sim has saved us a year\u2019s worth of testing time \u2014 going into the field, placing a sensor, testing how it functions and repeating the process,\u201d Sanz said.\nThe team also plans to integrate the Omniverse Replicator software development kit into SkyVerse to generate physically accurate 3D synthetic data and build SDG tools to accelerate the training of perception networks beyond the robotics domain.\nOnce data from a site is collected, SkyVerse uses edge devices powered by the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and Jetson AGX Xavier modules to automatically process up to terabytes of it per day and turn it into kilobyte-size analytics that can be easily transferred to frontline users.\nThis data processing was sped up 3x by the NVIDIA CUDA parallel computing platform, according to Sanz. The team is also looking to deploy the new Jetson Orin modules for next-level performance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not humanly possible to go through tens of thousands of images a day and extract critical analytics from them,\u201d Sanz said. \u201cSo we\u2019re helping to expand human eyesight with neural networks.\u201d\nUsing pretrained models from the NVIDIA TAO Toolkit, Skycatch also built neural networks that can remove extraneous objects and vehicles from the visualizations, and texturize over these spots in the 3D mesh.\nThe digital terrain model, which has sub-five-centimeter precision, can then be brought into Omniverse for the creation of a digital twin using the easily extensible USD framework, custom SkyVerse Omniverse extensions and NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\n\u201cIt took just around three months to build the Omniverse extensions, despite the complexity of our extensions\u2019 capabilities, thanks to access to technical experts through NVIDIA Inception,\u201d Sanz said.\nSkycatch is working with one of Canada\u2019s leading mining companies, Teck Resources, to implement the use of Omniverse-based digital twins for its project sites.\n\u201cTeck Resources has been using Skycatch\u2019s compute engine across all of our mine sites globally and is now expanding visualization and simulation capabilities with SkyVerse and our own digital twin strategy,\u201d said Preston Miller, lead of technology and innovation at Teck Resources. \u201cDelivering near-real-time visual data will allow Teck teams to quickly contextualize mine sites and make faster operational decisions on mission-critical, time-sensitive projects.\u201d\nThe Omniverse extensions built by Skycatch will be available soon \u2014 learn more.\nSafety and Sustainability\nAI-powered data analysis and digital twins can make operational processes for mining and construction companies safer, more sustainable and more efficient.\nFor example, according to Sanz, mining companies need the ability to quickly locate the toe and crest (or bottom and top) of \u201cbenches,\u201d narrow strips of land beside an open-pit mine. When a machine is automated to go in and out of a mine, it must be programmed to stay 10 meters away from the crest at all times to avoid the risk of sliding, Sanz said.\nPreviously, surveying and analyzing landforms to determine precise toes and crests typically took up to five days. With the help of NVIDIA AI, SkyVerse can now generate this information within minutes, Sanz said.\nIn addition, SkyVerse eliminates 10,000 open-pit interactions for customers per year, per site, Sanz said. These are situations in which humans and vehicles can intersect within a mine, posing a safety threat.\n\u201cAt its core, Skycatch\u2019s goal is to provide context and full awareness for what\u2019s going on at a mining or construction site in near-real time \u2014 and better environmental context leads to enhanced safety for workers,\u201d Sanz said.\nSkycatch aims to boost sustainability efforts for the mining industry, too.\n\u201cIn addition to mining companies, governmental organizations want visibility into how mines are operating \u2014 whether their surrounding environments are properly taken care of \u2014 and our platform offers these insights,\u201d Sanz said.\nPlus, minerals like cobalt, nickel and lithium are required for electrification and the energy transition. These all come from mine sites, Sanz said, which can become safer and more efficient with the help of SkyVerse\u2019s digital twins and vision AI.\nDive deeper into technology for a sustainable future with Skycatch and other Inception partners in the on-demand webinar, Powering Energy Startup Success With NVIDIA Inception.\nCreators and developers across the world can download NVIDIA Omniverse for free, and enterprise teams can use the platform for their 3D projects.\nLearn more about and apply to join NVIDIA Inception.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | AEC | Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Computer Vision | CUDA | Customer Stories | Data Science | Digital Twin | Energy | Inception | Jetson | NVIDIA RTX | Omniverse | Omniverse Enterprise | Simulation and Design | Social Impact | Synthetic Data Generation | Universal Scene Description \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

While most LLMs applied to biology to date have been trained on datasets of small molecules or proteins, this project is one of the first models trained on raw nucleotide sequences \u2014 the smallest units of DNA and RNA.\n\u201cWe hypothesized that moving from protein-level to gene-level data might help us build better models to understand COVID variants,\u201d said Arvind Ramanathan, computational biologist at Argonne, who led the project. \u201cBy training our model to track the entire genome and all the changes that appear in its evolution, we can make better predictions about not just COVID, but any disease with enough genomic data.\u201d\nThe Gordon Bell awards, regarded as the Nobel Prize of high performance computing, were presented at the\u00a0SC22 conference by the Association for Computing Machinery, which represents around 100,000 computing experts worldwide. Since 2020, the group has awarded a special prize for outstanding research that advances the understanding of COVID with HPC.\nTraining LLMs on a Four-Letter Language\nLLMs have long been trained on human languages, which usually comprise a couple dozen letters that can be arranged into tens of thousands of words, and joined together into longer sentences and paragraphs. The language of biology, on the other hand, has only four letters representing nucleotides \u2014 A, T, G and C in DNA, or A, U, G and C in RNA \u2014 arranged into different sequences as genes.\nWhile fewer letters may seem like a simpler challenge for AI, language models for biology are actually far more complicated. That\u2019s because the genome \u2014 made up of over 3 billion nucleotides in humans, and about 30,000 nucleotides in coronaviruses \u2014 is difficult to break down into distinct, meaningful units.\n\u201cWhen it comes to understanding the code of life, a major challenge is that the sequencing information in the genome is quite vast,\u201d Ramanathan said. \u201cThe meaning of a nucleotide sequence can be affected by another sequence that\u2019s much further away than the next sentence or paragraph would be in human text. It could reach over the equivalent of chapters in a book.\u201d\nNVIDIA collaborators on the project designed a hierarchical diffusion method that enabled the LLM to treat long strings of around 1,500 nucleotides as if they were sentences.\n\u201cStandard language models have trouble generating coherent long sequences and learning the underlying distribution of different variants,\u201d said paper co-author Anima Anandkumar, senior director of AI research at NVIDIA and Bren professor in the computing + mathematical sciences department at Caltech. \u201cWe developed a diffusion model that operates at a higher level of detail that allows us to generate realistic variants and capture better statistics.\u201d\nPredicting COVID Variants of Concern\nUsing open-source data from the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center, the team first pretrained its LLM on more than 110 million gene sequences from prokaryotes, which are single-celled organisms like bacteria. It then fine-tuned the model using 1.5 million high-quality genome sequences for the COVID virus.\nBy pretraining on a broader dataset, the researchers also ensured their model could generalize to other prediction tasks in future projects \u2014 making it one of the first whole-genome-scale models with this capability.\nOnce fine-tuned on COVID data, the LLM was able to distinguish between genome sequences of the virus\u2019 variants. It was also able to generate its own nucleotide sequences, predicting potential mutations of the COVID genome that could help scientists anticipate future variants of concern.\nTrained on a year\u2019s worth of SARS-CoV-2 genome data, the model can infer the distinction between various viral strains. Each dot on the left corresponds to a sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viral strain, color-coded by variant. The figure on the right zooms into one particular strain of the virus, which captures evolutionary couplings across the viral proteins specific to this strain.

Papka.\u00a0\n\u201cMost researchers have been tracking mutations in the spike protein of the COVID virus, specifically the domain that binds with human cells,\u201d Ramanathan said. \u201cBut there are other proteins in the viral genome that go through frequent mutations and are important to understand.\u201d\nThe model could also integrate with popular protein-structure-prediction models like AlphaFold and OpenFold, the paper stated, helping researchers simulate viral structure and study how genetic mutations impact a virus\u2019 ability to infect its host. OpenFold is one of the pretrained language models included in the NVIDIA BioNeMo LLM service for developers applying LLMs to digital biology and chemistry applications.\nSupercharging AI Training With GPU-Accelerated Supercomputers\nThe team developed its AI models on supercomputers powered by NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs \u2014 including Argonne\u2019s Polaris, the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Perlmutter, and NVIDIA\u2019s in-house Selene system. By scaling up to these powerful systems, they achieved performance of more than 1,500 exaflops in training runs, creating the largest biological language models to date.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with models today that have up to 25 billion parameters, and we expect this to significantly increase in the future,\u201d said Ramanathan. \u201cThe model size, the genetic sequence lengths and the amount of training data needed means we really need the computational complexity provided by supercomputers with thousands of GPUs.\u201d\nThe researchers estimate that training a version of their model with 2.5 billion parameters took over a month on around 4,000 GPUs. The team, which was already investigating LLMs for biology, spent about four months on the project before publicly releasing the paper and code. The GitHub page includes instructions for other researchers to run the model on Polaris and Perlmutter.\nThe NVIDIA BioNeMo framework, available in early access on the NVIDIA NGC hub for GPU-optimized software, supports researchers scaling large biomolecular language models across multiple GPUs. Part of the NVIDIA Clara Discovery collection of drug discovery tools, the framework will support chemistry, protein, DNA and RNA data formats.\nFind NVIDIA at SC22\u00a0and watch a replay of the special address below:\n\nImage at top represents COVID strains sequenced by the researchers\u2019 LLM.

Wishlist on Steam now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree for all Portal owners, Portal with RTX reimagines Valve\u2019s 2007 classic using today\u2019s cutting edge technology. Full ray tracing illuminates, shades and shadows each test chamber with unparalleled quality. Remade hi-res textures and models react realistically to ray tracing. DLSS 2 enables GeForce RTX 30 series owners to play Portal with RTX in full ray tracing. And NVIDIA DLSS 3 delivers a 2.8x increase to frame rates, giving GeForce RTX 40 series gamers the performance to play Portal with RTX at 4K.\nHere\u2019s a quick new look at DLSS 3 performance in Portal with RTX:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a complete rundown of the incredible tech bringing Portal with RTX to life, head to our Portal with RTX announcement article. It talks you through the new RTX features and GeForce RTX 40 Series technologies that are leveraged, explains how our developers built Portal with RTX using RTX Remix, and much more.\nNVIDIA will continue work to support the Portal with RTX DLC on GeForce NOW, look for a GFN Thursday update in the weeks ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortal with RTX Is Accelerated By NVIDIA DLSS 3 \nPortal with RTX\u2019s full ray tracing is beautiful, and incredibly demanding. To experience Portal with RTX at Ultra settings, NVIDIA DLSS and a powerful GeForce RTX GPU are recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Portal with RTX, DLSS 3 enables GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics card owners to experience full ray tracing at 4K at over 60 FPS, a previously unimaginable feat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwners of previous-generation high-performance GeForce RTX 30 graphics cards can leverage the critically-acclaimed DLSS 2 to play at over 60 FPS at 1440p, with Ultra Settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd a wide array of configurations can play Portal with RTX at 1920x1080, Ultra Settings, with the power of DLSS. For increased performance, settings can be reduced from Ultra to High.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore playing Portal with RTX, please ensure your system matches or exceeds the requirements for CPU and RAM, for the best possible experience:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor GPUs outside the minimum spec (i.e. GeForce RTX 20 Series), and between minimum and recommended (i.e. some GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs), the easiest path to better performance is to use GeForce Experience. Simply download the latest game ready driver (527.56 WHQL), find Portal with RTX, and click \u201cOptimize\u201d to automatically configure the best combination of image quality and performance settings for your GeForce RTX 20 or 30 Series GPU.\u00a0\nAlternatively we have prepared some recommended graphic settings charts to help guide you to higher frames in your play experience. To adjust your graphics settings in-game, press Alt-X to open the Remix graphics window:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese settings target to improve frame rates and your experience will vary depending on your system configuration. These settings may also reduce visual quality.\u00a0\nPlease do not alter the Portal \u201cvideo-advanced\u201d settings, as attempting to adjust these settings may lead to instability; press Alt-X to use the Remix graphics settings window instead. If you have already altered Portal advanced video settings, we recommend you reset them to default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortal with RTX Launch Party: Everyone\u2019s Invited!\nTo celebrate Portal with RTX\u2019s December 8th launch, the entire community is invited to our launch party.

Other topics include reinforcement learning, data collection and augmentation, weather models and federated learning.\n\u201cAI is an incredibly important technology, and NVIDIA is making fast progress across the gamut \u2014 from generative AI to autonomous AI agents,\u201d said Jan Kautz, vice president of learning and perception research at NVIDIA. \u201cIn generative AI, we are not only advancing our theoretical understanding of the underlying models, but are also making practical contributions that will reduce the effort of creating realistic virtual worlds and simulations.\u201d\nReimagining the Design of Diffusion-Based Generative Models\u00a0\nDiffusion-based models have emerged as a groundbreaking technique for generative AI. NVIDIA researchers won an Outstanding Main Track Paper award for work that analyzes the design of diffusion models, proposing improvements that can dramatically improve the efficiency and quality of these models.\nThe paper breaks down the components of a diffusion model into a modular design, helping developers identify processes that can be adjusted to improve the performance of the entire model. The researchers show that their modifications enable record scores on a metric that assesses the quality of AI-generated images.\nTraining Generalist AI Agents in a Minecraft-Based Simulation Suite\nWhile researchers have long trained autonomous AI agents in video-game environments such as Starcraft, Dota and Go, these agents are usually specialists in only a few tasks. So NVIDIA researchers turned to Minecraft, the world\u2019s most popular game, to develop a scalable training framework for a generalist agent \u2014 one that can successfully execute a wide variety of open-ended tasks.\nDubbed MineDojo, the framework enables an AI agent to learn Minecraft\u2019s flexible gameplay using a massive online database of more than 7,000 wiki pages, millions of Reddit threads and 300,000 hours of recorded gameplay (shown in image at top). The project won an Outstanding Datasets and Benchmarks Paper Award from the NeurIPS committee.\nAs a proof of concept, the researchers behind MineDojo created a large-scale foundation model, called MineCLIP, that learned to associate YouTube footage of Minecraft gameplay with the video\u2019s transcript, in which the player typically narrates the onscreen action. Using MineCLIP, the team was able to train a reinforcement learning agent capable of performing several tasks in Minecraft without human intervention.\nCreating Complex 3D Shapes to Populate Virtual Worlds\nAlso at NeurIPS is GET3D, a generative AI model that instantly synthesizes 3D shapes based on the category of 2D images it\u2019s trained on, such as buildings, cars or animals. The AI-generated objects have high-fidelity textures and complex geometric details \u2014 and are created in a triangle mesh format used in popular graphics software applications. This makes it easy for users to import the shapes into 3D renderers and game engines for further editing.\n\nNamed for its ability to Generate Explicit Textured 3D meshes, GET3D was trained on NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs using around 1 million 2D images of 3D shapes captured from different camera angles. The model can generate around 20 objects a second when running inference on a single NVIDIA GPU.\nThe AI-generated objects could be used to populate 3D representations of buildings, outdoor spaces or entire cities \u2014 digital spaces designed for industries such as gaming, robotics, architecture and social media.\nImproving Inverse Rendering Pipelines With Control Over Materials, Lighting\nAt the most recent CVPR conference, held in New Orleans in June, NVIDIA Research introduced 3D MoMa, an inverse rendering method that enables developers to create 3D objects composed of three distinct parts: a 3D mesh model, materials overlaid on the model, and lighting.\nThe team has since achieved significant advancements in untangling materials and lighting from the 3D objects \u2014 which in turn improves creators\u2019 abilities to edit the AI-generated shapes by swapping materials or adjusting lighting as the object moves around a scene.\n\nThe work, which relies on a more realistic shading model that leverages NVIDIA RTX GPU-accelerated ray tracing, is being presented as a poster at NeurIPS.\nEnhancing Factual Accuracy of Language Models\u2019 Generated Text\u00a0\nAnother accepted paper at NeurIPS examines a key challenge with pretrained language models: the factual accuracy of AI-generated text.\nLanguage models trained for open-ended text generation often come up with text that includes nonfactual information, since the AI is simply making correlations between words to predict what comes next in a sentence. In the paper, NVIDIA researchers propose techniques to address this limitation, which is necessary before such models can be deployed for real-world applications.\nThe researchers built the first automatic benchmark to measure the factual accuracy of language models for open-ended text generation, and found that bigger language models with billions of parameters were more factual than smaller ones. The team proposed a new technique, factuality-enhanced training, along with a novel sampling algorithm that together help train language models to generate accurate text \u2014 and demonstrated a reduction in the rate of factual errors from 33% to around 15%.\nThere are more than 300 NVIDIA researchers around the globe, with teams focused on topics including AI, computer graphics, computer vision, self-driving cars and robotics.

Because of that, gaming makes up a solid portion of the company\u2019s quarterly revenue. In regards to the latest quarter, gaming made up a larger-than-expected chunk of NVIDIA\u2019s total revenue. In the company\u2019s Q3 2023 earnings report, it\u2019s revealed that NVIDIA\u2019s gaming revenue hit $1.57 billion.\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NVDA) Q3 2023 earnings report was published earlier today. Under the gaming section, the company shares that its gaming business brought in $1.57 billion in revenue during the period. This marks a 51% decrease from last year, but a 23% jump from the previous quarter. It also surpasses expectations coming into Q3. A large chunk of this can be attributed to the RTX 4090 GPU, which launched back in October with some solid success. The company also expanded its GeForce now service to include even more games available to stream.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA consistently releases new drivers for the biggest PC releases, further solidifying it as a desired place to play games. It\u2019s a point that company leadership also mentioned during the subsequent earnings call, invoking the recently released Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and comparing its sales figures to box office hits like Top Gun: Maverick and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.\nThe $1.57 billion that NVIDIA (NVDA) made on its gaming business in Q3 contributed to what was an impressive quarter for the tech company. NVIDIA brought in a total of $5.93 billion in revenue, which also beat analyst expectations.

Analysts from UOB Kay Hian Research and CGS-CIMB Research have maintained their \u201cbuy\u201d and \u201cadd\u201d ratings for Sembcorp Marine with unchanged target prices (TPs) of 15.6 and 19 cents respectively, following a visit to the company\u2019s Tuas Boulevard Yard.  In his report dated Nov 24, UOB Kay Hian\u2019s Adrian Loh says the yard visit \u201creinforced\u201d his positive view on Sembcorp Marine for 2023. \u201cIt was evident from a bird\u2019s eye tour of Sembcorp Marine\u2019s yard that its integrated design allows the company to carry out projects more efficiently and thus save on time and cost. This was also helped by the implementation of solar and robotic initiatives,\u201d says Loh. \u201cWe continue to like Sembcorp Marine given its strong potential for new order wins in 2023, especially for production assets. In the longer term, PSA\u2019s move to Tuas will have positive spillover effects on Sembcorp Marine\u2019s repairs and upgrades segment,\u201d he adds. Meanwhile, the company has also completed Phase 2 of its rooftop solar panel installation in 2022. This will be able to cater to an estimated 65% of the energy needs of its steel fabrication works, which is one of the most energy intensive parts of rig building. Hence, this should lead to slightly higher margins due to the cost savings, says Loh.  He notes that Sembcorp Marine has Phase 3 planned and this is likely to be carried out over the next two to three years as business volumes increase. Sembcorp Marine has highlighted that its steel fabrication works are almost entirely carried out by roof-mounted robots, which has led to a 30% savings in time. Lim Siew Khee and Izabella Tan of CGS-CIMB note that Sembcorp Marine\u2019s seven drydocks include a floating dock that can be transported for offshore structures and are capable of docking a fully constructed Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC). \u201cThe sheer number of dry docks gives Sembcorp Marine greater flexibility in vessel reshuffling compared to its peers, such as Daewoo Shipbuilding which has 2 dry docks and 3 floating docks in its Okpo Yard,\u201d say the analysts. With the Sembcorp Marine and Keppel Offshore and Marine (KOM) merger terms largely in place and much of the uncertainty out of the way, Loh believes the focus on Sembcorp Marine will be the date of its extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to approve the merger with KOM, which is expected to be in January next year, and its ability to garner new orders over the next 12 months and add to its orderbook instead of its earnings in 2022.   Story continues \u201cWe understand that Sembcorp Marine may be in the running for three floating production units (FPU) in the near to medium term. Note that Sembcorp Marine delivered one semi-sub FPU to Shell for its Vito field in the Gulf of Mexico in January and is currently constructing a similar FPU for Shell\u2019s Whale field that is also in the Gulf of Mexico,\u201d says LohGiven its near-term experience, he believes that Sembcorp Marine has a high chance of securing at least one of these FPUs, which he estimates to be around $350 million to $500 million in size.\u201cThat said, Sembcorp will need to start delivering profits in 1H2023 in order to prove that it is able to reliably and profitably construct its projects. Our target book value multiple for Sembcorp Marine of 1.2x reflects our confidence that it will garner such orders, thus leading to positive share price performance,\u201d says the analyst.Lim and Tan estimate that Sembcorp Marine\u2019s yard capacity currently stands at around 40% to 50%, which could be raised to 70% in FY2023, although the company explained that it is limited by supply chain bottlenecks for rare metals, copper, as well as motherboards and chips.\u201cOrder wins secured in FY2022 are also undergoing the design and engineering stage, which typically range three to six months, according to management. Hence, we expect revenue for these projects to only be reflected by 1Q2023 or 2Q2023,\u201d they say.Lim and Tan\u2019s TP of 19 cents is based on 1.6x FY2023 price-to-book value P/BV, with Sembcorp Marine trading at 1.1x 22F P/BV. Their reiterated \u201cadd\u201d call also comes off the back of better earnings prospects in light of the upcoming acquisition of KOM.Their potential rerating catalysts include successful integration with KOM, stronger order momentum and consistent earnings improvement, while key risks include impairments, severe cost overruns and project cancellations derailing profitability.According to UOB Kay Hian\u2019s Loh, the offshore construction cycle for both conventional oil and gas and renewables has room for growth in the next few years, especially given the lack of spending by the global oil and gas industry, thus constraining energy supply.As at 2.21pm, shares in Sembcorp Marine were trading 0.2 cents or 1.5% up at 13.5 cents.See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore CGS-CIMB trims target price on Kimly as weaker margins bite CGS-CIMB ups Boustead Projects' TP on strong order book and stronger-than-expected 1HFY2023 earnings With Transcore contract win, it's ST Engineering\u2019s way, on the highway  Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

Applications close on 1 December 2022, 11.59pm. There have been many BTO launches in Tengah recently, the last in February 2022. In this HDB BTO November 2022 launch, a new batch of flats will be launched in this upcoming non-mature estate, which is currently undergoing development from the ground up. 2,077 2-room Flexi, 3-room, 4-room and 5-room flats will be made available. Due to the large supply of flats and the high frequency of past launches in Tengah, this launch could end up being relatively easy to successfully ballot for.

Hong Kah MRT station will be located right next door, while Tengah Plantation MRT station will be within walking distance. These MRT stations are expected to open in 2027 and 2028 respectively.  The Garden Waterfront I & II @ Tengah flats will be located by the proposed Tengah Pond and a proposed park, so some residents will enjoy scenic waterfront views. It will also be very near the PIE, making it easy for those travelling by car to get to other parts of Singapore. Tengah is currently undergoing development into a residential estate, so there are currently no amenities to speak of, and residents will have to put up with construction for quite a number of years after they move in. As with other new residential estates like Punggol, a large fraction of its first residents will be young families, thus it is likely that many child-related amenities will be established. Garden Waterfront I & II @ Tengah BTO Price (HDB BTO November 2022 Launch)  Unit typeGarden Waterfront I & II @ Tengah BTO Price (HDB BTO November 2022)Previous Tengah BTO Price (HDB BTO February 2022)Previous Tengah BTO Price (HDB BTO November 2021)Median resale flat prices in the area 2-room FlexiFrom $111,000$132,000 to $182,000$119,000 to $190,000\u2013 3-roomFrom $214,000$231,000 to $273,000$194,000 to $257,000\u2013 4-roomFrom $307,000$309,000 to $403,000$312,000 to $390,000\u2013 5-roomFrom $428,000$420,000 to $525,000$428,000 to $519,000\u2013  With 2,077 units up for grabs, it should not be too difficult to successfully ballot for a Tengah BTO 2022 flat, especially as there was already a previous launch in the area earlier this year.   Story continues As Tengah is a brand new non-mature estate, there are no resale flat statistics. However, due to the affordable price of BTO flats in the area, it is likely that resale flats will eventually be able to turn a decent profit after their Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) expires and the estate grows and develops.Budgeting for Your Tengah BTO Nov 2022 Home LoanAlthough the Garden Waterfront I & II @ Tengah BTO flats are likely to be affordable, it is still important to plan your finances and work out how much you can afford before balloting for a unit.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

This comes less than six months after they were given a no-sale licence on May 12.  Read also:\u00a0MCC Land to develop Tanah Merah mixed-use project with The Place Holdings and Ekovest Sceneca Residence is a 268-unit\u00a0 condominium development with a ground-floor commercial podium containing 19 strata-titled commercial units. The development will have a direct link to the Tanah Merah MRT Station when completed. (Find Singapore commercial properties with our commercial directory) The remaining hurdle is for the developer to arrange for a site inspection of the sales gallery and the showflats by the Controller of Housing (COH). That process could take two to four weeks, estimates Ismail Gafoor, CEO of PropNex. MCC Land has two windows of opportunity to launch the project: Either the first two weeks of December before the festive season or the first two weeks of January before the Lunar New Year on Jan 22, 2023, says Gafoor. The first window of opportunity in the first two weeks of December will depend on how soon inspection by COH could be arranged, and a licence obtained. \u201cLate December is not a good time to launch as a lot of potential buyers are likely to be out of town,\u201d says Gafoor. \u201cThere is a pent-up demand for travel this year-end holidays\u00a0since Covid.\u201d The next window of opportunity to launch Sceneca Residence is in the first two weeks of January. \u201cMost people will be back from their year-end holidays,\u201d adds Gafoor. \u201cAnd it will be a good time to launch before the start of the Chinese New Year celebrations.\u201d    Sceneca Residence will have 268 residential units and a podium with 19 strata-titled commercial units (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) However, it\u2019s difficult to project when the project is likely to be launched as the developer has not made a decision just yet, notes Gafoor. MCC Land declined to comment for this story. Sceneca Residence will be developed jointly with Ekovest Developments and The Place Holdings.\u00a0Given that Sceneca Residence is a mixed-use development integrated with an MRT station, the project is likely to be priced in line with recent launches in the Outside Central Region, or even slightly lower, reckons Gafoor. This is because MCC Land purchased the 95,587 sq ft, 99-year leasehold site at Tanah Merah Kechil Link in a government land sale (GLS) tender two years\u00a0ago.   Story continues MCC Land emerged at the top of 15 bids for the Tanah Merah Kechil Link site and paid $248.99 million for it in Nov 2020.\u00a0Based on the maximum gross floor area of 267,644 sq ft, the bid price translates to $930.34 psf per lot ratio (psf ppr).This is lower than the $784.1 million ($1,204 psf ppr) that GuocoLand paid for the 186,001 sq ft Lentor Modern site in a GLS tender in July 2021.The 605-unit Lentor Modern located at Lentor Central is the only integrated mixed-use development at Lentor Hills estate. The development comes with a 96,000 sq ft commercial podium that includes a 10,000 sq ft childcare centre and 12,000 sq ft supermarket. It is directly linked to the Lentor MRT Station on the Thomson-East Coast Line.Since Lentor Modern was launched on Sept 16, about 510 units (84.3%) have been sold at an average price of $2,103 psf, based on caveats lodged with URA Realis as of Nov 2. In fact, the project saw 508 units (84%) taken up on its launch day.Just one MRT stop away from Tanah Merah is Sky Eden@Bedok, the 158-unit condominium block at Bedok Central. The residential project is a redevelopment of the former Bedok Point mall by Frasers Property. Sky Eden@Bedok is also a mixed-use development, with 12 strata-titled shops on the ground floor. The project is located within a five-minute walk to Bedok MRT Station.Launched on Sept 7, Sky Eden@Bedok was 75% sold on the first day of launch. To date, 122 units (77.2%) have been sold at an average price of $2,103 psf, according to caveats lodged as of Nov 2.Whether Sceneca Residence will be the project launch that will bookend the year or start the new year in 2023 remains to be seen.Check out the latest listings near Sceneca Residence, Sky Eden@Bedok, Tanah Merah MRT Station, Bedok MRT StationSee Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) One Bernam caters to work-from-home, families living in the heart of the CBD Sold-out Provence Residence EC underscores strength of demand from first-timers, upgraders The Place Holdings aims to \u2018unlock value\u2019 by putting Realty Centre up for sale from $185 mil En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

We jumpped on a NVIDIA H100 80GB PCIe GPU. This was still in an Ice Lake Intel Xeon server, but we had a few minutes, and just wanted to poke around. While this was happening, Moritz Lehmann who has an OpenCL CFD application expressed interest, and we ran his CFD codes to see how they compared to the previous version.\nNVIDIA H100 80GB PCIe Hands on CFD Simulation\nFirst off, we have the test system. Here is the system with the OpenCL devices with 114 compute units and 80GB of memory on NUMA Node L1:\nNVIDIA H100 80GB PCIe Lstopo\nHere is the nvidia-smi output of the card:\nNVIDIA H100 80GB PCIe Nvidia Smi\nAs for power consumption, we saw 68-70W as fairly normal. The 310W maximum power consumption seemed a bit high, but we did manage to hit that figure on some AI workloads.\nStill, we wanted to highlight Moritz\u2019s work. Here are the NVIDIA H100 80GB results among his other benchmark results:\nNVIDIA H100 80GB PCIe FluidX3D FP32 FP32\nYou may need to get to a larger version of the chart above, but the H100 80GB PCIe is now top on this chart. It is followed by the A100 SXM 80GB, then the PCIe A100, then the 40GB SXM A100. In any case, this is a significant improvement.\nHere is the description of what you are seeing above from Mortiz:\nThe 3 numbers all are Mega Lattice UPdates per second, or how many million grid points are computed per second. FluidX3D is a lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) fluid solver that computes density and velocity for all points on a cubic grid in every time step. LBM works by copying density distribution functions (DDFs, these are just floating-point numbers) around in memory, and is entirely bandwidth-bound. FluidX3D does all arithmetic in FP32, but has 3 levels of precision for this memory access: \n\nFP32: Standard FP32\nFP16S: IEEE-754 FP16 with a scaling factor before/after conversion; the conversion is supported in hardware \nFP16C: a custom 16-bit floating-point format with only 4-bit exponent and more accurate 11-bit mantissa. This is a bit more accurate than FP16S in some cases. The conversion is done manually with heavy integer arithmetic and takes ~51 instructions. Since LBM is bandwidth-bound, compressing the DDFs from FP32 to either FP16 format doubles performance. FP16C is heavy on int arithmetic and thus usually not as fast. In most cases, the compression does not affect accuracy at all.\n\nIf you want to see the types of simulations this OpenCL lattice Boltzmann CFD software does, you can see an example here with the Space Shuttle simulation:\n\nFor some data points, the power consumption for the above:\n\nFP32: 217W\nFP16S: 257W\nFP16C: 277W\n\nWith that, the efficiency was:\n\nFP32: 51.3MLUP/W\nFP16S: 74.5MLUP/W\nFP16C: 53.9MLUP/W\n\nIf you want to learn more about FluidX3D, Github is a great place to start.\nFinal Words\nWe are in an extremely busy period with SC22, the recent Genoa launch, aiming to show new DPUs and CXL in December, the US holiday season, and the upcoming Sapphire Rapids Xeon launch. Still, we wanted to highlight a cool project and get them some data on a new card while also showing our readers the jump from A100 to H100 performance. Also, interesting on this is that the H100 is roughly double the performance of Moritz\u2019s single GCD MI250 runs.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSH100HopperNVIDIA \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleIntel Data Center GPU Max 1100 Series aka Ponte Vecchio PCIe at SC22Next articleCoolIT CHx500 500kW 10U CDU at SC22 Eric Smithhttps://www.servethehome.comEric has been in the IT industry for over 15 years and specializes in infrastructure projects.  \n \nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBolt Graphics Zeus The New GPU Architecture with up to 2.25TB of Memory and 800GbE \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nIntel Falcon Shores GPU Not Coming to Market in an AI Hit \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nThis is the Massive AMD Instinct MI300A Heatsink in the Gigabyte G383-R80-AAP1 \n\n  \n\n\n\n4 COMMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancois Cattelain\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            November 18, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            2:21 am                                            \n\n\n\nThe H100 PCIe uses only HBM2e and has only 2TB/s of memory bandwidth. The SXM4 version uses HBM3 and offers 3.5TB/s of memory bandwith. So in this particular bandwidth-bound benchmark, we are not seeing much of an improvement over the A100 since the A100 already offers 1.5TB/s of memory bandwith. Testing the H100 SXM4 in this particular bandwidth-bound scenario would probably be showing a much more significant improvement over the A100.\nI think this should be added to the article.\nBest regards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrei\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            November 18, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            6:37 am                                            \n\n\n\n@Francois Cattelain\nWhile you are correct in your comment, there are some mistakes here and there. First off, H100 comes in the new SXM5 format, not SXM4. Second, it is indeed a big difference in memory type used in the PCIe version of the H100 and the SXM5 version, but the actual figure is lower than 3.5TB/s for the SXM5 HBM3 H100\u2026it\u2019s actually 3.35TB/s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancois Cattelain\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            November 18, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            7:03 am                                            \n\n\n\n@Andrei\nThanks for the corrections!

The Ada GPU is built upon the foundation set by Turing. NVIDIA terms the Ada Lovelace GPUs as a quantum leap over Ampere, and the GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition based on NVIDIA Ampere GPU excels at everything versus the previous gen.\nThe Ada GPU architecture has a lot to be talked about in this review, but so does the new RTX lineup. The Ada lineup offers faster shader performance, faster ray tracing performance, and faster AI performance. Built on a brand new process node and featuring an architecture designed from the ground up, Ada is a killer product with lots of numbers to talk about.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSThe fundamental of Ada was to take everything NVIDIA learned with its Turing & Ampere architectures and not only refine it but to use its DNA to form a product in a completely new performance category. Tall claims were made by NVIDIA when they introduced its Ada lineup last month with up to 4x performance claims & we will be finding out whether NVIDIA hit all the ticks with its Ada architecture as this review will be your guiding path to see what makes Ada and how it performs against its predecessors.\n\nToday, we will be taking a look at the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition graphics card. The card was provided by NVIDIA for the sole purpose of this review & we will be taking a look at their technology, design, and performance metrics in detail.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series Gaming Graphics Cards - The Biggest GPU Performance Leap in Recent History\nTuring wasn't just any graphics core, it was the graphics core that was to become the foundation of future GPUs. The future is realized now with next-generation consoles going deep in talks about ray tracing and AI-assisted super-sampling techniques. NVIDIA had a head start with Turing & Ampere and its Ada generation will only do things infinitely times better.\n\nThe Ada GPU does many traditional things which we would expect from a GPU, but at the same time, also breaks the barrier when it comes to untraditional GPU operations. Just to sum up some features:\n\nNew Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)\nNew Turing Tensor Cores\nNew Real-Time Ray Tracing Acceleration\nNew Shading Enhancements\nNew Deep Learning Features For Graphics & Inference\nNew GDDR6X High-Performance Memory Subsystem\nNew HDMI 2.1 Display Engine & Next-Gen NVENC/NVDEC\n\n\nThe technologies mentioned above are some of the main building blocks of the Ada GPU, but there's more within the graphics core itself which we will talk about in detail so let's get started.\n\n\nContents\n\n1.

But when a fierce power struggle threatens to destroy his new home, the aspiring hero realizes that with great power, there must also come great responsibility. To save all of Marvel\u2019s New York, Miles must take up the mantle of Spider-Man and own it in Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, launching on PC today, November 18th.\nSimilar to the PC version of Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man Remastered released earlier this year in close collaboration with Insomniac Games, Marvel Games, Nixxes Software and PlayStation Studios, Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales on PC features many enhancements, customizable settings, and support for a broad range of hardware configurations, all the way from high-end PCs to portable PC gaming devices.\nPlaying Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales on a GeForce RTX PC, laptop or graphics card enables you to experience the game at its very best, enhanced with NVIDIA DLSS 2 Super Resolution, NVIDIA DLAA, and upgraded ray-traced effects that run fastest on GeForce RTX thanks to the dedicated RT Cores found on each RTX GPU. And if you play with a GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics card, you can experience Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales with the game-changing NVIDIA DLSS 3, which accelerates performance at 4K by over 2X, giving you the fastest, highest-fidelity experience possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales PC Frame Rates Are Over 2X Faster With NVIDIA DLSS 3\nNVIDIA DLSS is our groundbreaking AI-powered tech that accelerates performance on GeForce RTX GPUs. Using dedicated GPU Tensor Cores, DLSS taps into the power of a deep learning neural network to boost frame rates and generate beautiful, sharp images in your favorite games. And with the release of our GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, we\u2019ve launched NVIDIA DLSS 3, a game-changing upgrade that multiplies frame rates.\nPowered by new hardware capabilities of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture found on GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, DLSS 3 generates entirely new high quality frames, rather than just pixels. Through a process detailed in full in our DLSS 3 explainer article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS 2 Super Resolution technology and DLSS 3 Frame Generation to reconstruct 7/8ths of the displayed pixels, accelerating performance to previously unimaginable degrees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you own a previous-generation GeForce RTX graphics card or laptop, you can use DLSS 2 Super Resolution in each DLSS 3 game. Additionally, integrations of DLSS 3 also include NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency for all GeForce RTX users, making games more responsive.\nWith our new Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Game Ready Driver installed, all GeForce RTX gamers can use NVIDIA DLSS to increase their frame rates by a significant degree. Players with previous-generation GPUs can use DLSS 2 Super Resolution to improve performance by over 2X at 4K, with max settings and all ray-traced settings set to their highest levels. And GeForce RTX 40 Series users can leverage the power of DLSS 3 to more than double frame rates, giving them over 120 FPS at 4K, and the definitive experience!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you already have excellent frame rates, you can instead enable NVIDIA DLAA, an AI-based anti-aliasing mode for users who have spare GPU headroom and want higher levels of image quality. DLAA uses the same technology developed for DLSS, but works on a native resolution image to maximize image quality instead of boosting performance. With NVIDIA DLAA, Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales will look even more detailed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales - PC Ray Tracing, Now Even More Refined\nLike Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man Remastered on PC, Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales includes ray-traced opaque reflections with multiple detail levels and options, enhancing Marvel\u2019s New York with high detail, physically accurate reflections that greatly improve image quality and immersion.\u00a0\nThe PC launch of Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales also sees the introduction of new ray-traced shadows for outdoor light cast by the sun and moon. These added ray-traced effects enhance shadows with natural gradients in softness, and improve their accuracy and appearance, further improving visual fidelity on PC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo experience these ray-traced effects running at their highest settings, with other options cranked up, and the resolution maxed, you\u2019ll need a GeForce RTX graphics card, desktop or laptop. In each GeForce RTX GPU there are dedicated RT Cores to crunch highly taxing ray tracing workloads, giving you the performance to enjoy ray-traced games at their best. And with DLSS also enabled, you\u2019ll have the performance to max out all ray-traced effects at 4K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex Optimizes System Latency In Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales On PC\nNVIDIA Reflex is a must-have in games, reducing system latency so your actions occur quicker, making you more competitive in multiplayer matches, and making single-player titles more responsive. It\u2019s available in the most popular multiplayer and esports games, is supported on GeForce graphics cards dating back to the 900 Series, and only takes a single click to enable.\nNVIDIA Reflex is used by over 20 million players each month, and when Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales launches on PC, those millions of GeForce gamers can reduce their system latency for a smoother, more responsive experience when swinging through Marvel\u2019s New York.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales On PC Boasts Enhanced Graphics and PC-Specific Features\nIn addition to all of the above, Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales on PC also boasts numerous graphical and experiential enhancements to make full use of the PC\u2019s capabilities. These include NVIDIA HBAO+, which improves the quality of ambient occlusion shadowing across the game, plus higher-resolution shadow maps, higher levels of detail, higher fidelity texture filtering, additional quality levels for numerous options, and much more, making the world of Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales look even more spectacular. Plus, the frame rate is unlocked, for a smoother, faster presentation.\nYou can also play in HDR on G-SYNC and G-SYNC ULTIMATE gaming monitors, TVs and displays*, and in 21:9, 32:9, 48:9, and NVIDIA Surround panoramic ultra-widescreen resolutions**, for the most immersive experience possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s also robust controller support and keyboard mapping customization. But if you would prefer playing on a controller, Nixxes has included support for the PlayStation DUALSENSE\u2122 controller, which delivers the same amazing PS5 haptic feedback and adaptive trigger responses when connected to a PC via USB. Additionally, there\u2019s support for a wide range of other gamepads, and a full range of UI, system options, plus other expected PC settings.\nIn other words, everything you know and love about Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man Remastered on PC is also present in the new PC release of Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales.\n*Compatible PC and HDR display device required **Compatible PC and display device required\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales PC System Requirements\nEager to experience Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, with all the above enhancements enabled on your PC?

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RTX 3060 Ti, now with GDDR6X VRAM.\n(Image credit: Asus)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is set to phase out the older and slower variant of its RTX 3060 Ti graphics card, and will only sell the newer 3060 Ti with faster video memory, if the rumor mill is right \u2013 with potential ramifications therein for Team Green\u2019s mid-range GPU strategy, and the RTX 4060 (we\u2019ll come back to that).First off, let\u2019s look at the rumor itself, which comes from a regular source of speculation in China, MyDrivers (as flagged by VideoCardz). The source claims that third-party graphics card manufacturers are now in the process of gradually \u2013 but assuredly \u2013 getting rid of the original, slower version of the 3060 Ti.If you recall, the faster variant that\u2019s purportedly being kept on is only different in terms of the VRAM \u2013 the new 3060 Ti has 19Gbps GDDR6X memory, compared to 14Gbps GDDR6 for the old card. That makes for a major bump in memory bandwidth from 448GB/s to 608GB/s (the loadout of 8GB of VRAM remains the same, by the way, as do all the other specs of these respective graphics cards).\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia could be drastically reducing RTX 4060 GPU supply right now \u2013 another heavy hint that the RTX 5060 is imminent\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5060 Ti GPU with 16GB rumored for March launch, followed by 8GB flavor in April \u2013 but where does that leave the vanilla RTX 5060?\n\n\n\nThe good news is that buyers will be getting this more performant RTX 3060 Ti with no change in price. At least that\u2019s what MyDrivers asserts will be the case for the Chinese market, and with any luck, that should extend to the global marketplace. We don\u2019t see why it wouldn\u2019t, but that said, you never know quite what might happen on the pricing front.MyDrivers also mentions Nvidia\u2019s new RTX 3060 8GB variant, which drops the VRAM of the existing RTX 3060 from 12GB (and trims the memory bus from 192-bit to 128-bit), and so is a bit different in terms of being a downgrade. However, it\u2019s unknown whether the older model will be similarly phased out in this case, though we\u2019d hope not (and it\u2019s likely sources would have heard about this, too, if it was the case; or that\u2019s what we\u2019d tentatively presume).Analysis: Putting an end to confusion \u2013 but also sending out a worrying signal?Obviously we still have to treat this as a rumor, as that\u2019s precisely what it is. But it is a piece of theorizing that makes sense, and we hope that this is the direction Nvidia intends to go in with the RTX 3060 Ti.After all, it\u2019s always confusing for consumers when a situation comes about that there are identically named models of graphics cards which have somewhat different specs, even if they aren\u2019t poles apart. Reducing it down to just the one variant of 3060 Ti will help clear any confusion, and ensure that less tech-savvy buyers aren\u2019t picking up a slightly inferior model of the 3060 Ti without even realizing that\u2019s the case.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The price being kept the same as the supposedly outgoing model is also a positive point, though as noted, we have to hope this applies outside China.However, this isn\u2019t all good news in terms of the signals it sends out from Nvidia \u2013 namely that the firm is looking to keep the RTX 3060 Ti as its mid-range workhorse going forward for some time. Or to put it another way, no RTX 4060 is likely to be on the horizon \u2013 even remotely \u2013 as the plan appears to be to continue pushing RTX 3000 stock on the wallet-friendly front.And this sadly matches with the freshest rumors we\u2019ve heard elsewhere regarding cheaper Lovelace GPUs, with the belief being that the RTX 4060 is still a long way off, and might not arrive until June 2023. Which is also backed up by how little we\u2019ve heard about the 4060 thus far on the rumor mill, too.All that said, we might see something for lower-end Lovelace GPUs in the near future, but for laptops, with a recent sighting of the RTX 4050 mobile version (add plenty of seasoning, naturally). But in short, from the way everything looks to be shaping up so far, don\u2019t hold your breath for more affordable RTX 4000 desktop GPUs \u2013 Nvidia looks to be relying on the RTX 3000 range to take the strain at that end of the market for some time yet.Today\u2019s best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $39.99 $34.99View $63ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

However, initial impressions were a tad bit underwhelming as the company validated only a handful of FreeSync panels that can run G-Sync to its full extent, without resorting to any major compatibility issues. \nNow comes the question: is it possible to activate Nvidia's Adaptive-Sync technology on a FreeSync display that hasn't been certified as G-Sync Compatible? Let's find out! \n                        How Nvidia G-Sync Works on AMD FreeSync Monitors\n               \nTo maintain exclusivity of its proprietary Adaptive-Sync solution, Nvidia's G-Sync technology has been categorized across three different tiers: G-Sync, G-Sync Compatible, and G-Sync Ultimate. While both G-Sync and G-Sync Ultimate monitors feature a dedicated module to drive VRR, G-Sync Compatible monitors are essentially FreeSync panels that have been validated by Nvidia to run G-Sync through its rigorous testing methodology. \n\n\n\n\nTrait\n\n\nG-Sync Ultimate\n\n\nG-Sync\n\n\nG-Sync Compatible\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidated for Artifact-Free Experience\n\n\nYes\n\n\nYes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nCertified with 300+ Image Quality Tests\n\n\nYes\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nCertified for \"Likelike HDR\" (~1000 nits Brightness with HDR)\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nVariable Overdrive Support\n\n\nYes\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nUltra-Low Motion Blur & Overclocking Support\n\n\nYes\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case you're wondering, Nvidia's G-Sync Compatibility program, which was introduced back in 2019, aims to certify a wide range of FreeSync monitors based on specific parameters. For starters, every G-Sync Compatible monitor should be able to deliver a baseline VRR experience without incurring any visual artifacts such as pulsing, flickering, blanking, or ghosting.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the retroactive program also validates whether a FreeSync display can operate across a VRR range of at least 2.4:1. Such calculations are performed by dividing the maximum refresh rate of a monitor to its minimum refresh rate within the VRR range.\nFor instance, if your FreeSync monitor supports a wide VRR range of 48-144Hz, which is greater than Nvidia's recommended value of 2.4, G-Sync functionality should be enabled right out-of-the-box. However, if the minimum VRR range went up to 75Hz, which does not comply with Nvidia's VRR threshold, the display loses an official \"G-Sync Compatible\" certification.\nAs of November 2022, Nvidia has validated over 150 FreeSync monitors that can run G-Sync at an adequate VRR range. For more information, check out Nvidia's official list of FreeSync monitors that have been certified as G-Sync Compatible.\nAlthough official G-Sync Compatibility has its perks on quite a few occasions, it is possible to drive Nvidia's Adaptive-Sync solution on most non-certified FreeSync monitors, provided that you possess the right set of hardware. Since both FreeSync and G-Sync technologies support VESA's (Video Electronics Standards Association) Adaptive-Sync protocol, any limitations that you might face are based solely on the manufacturing standards. \n                        Nvidia G-Sync on AMD FreeSync Monitors: Setup and Compatibility\n               \nUnlike AMD's FreeSync implementation, which works on both HDMI and DisplayPort (over USB Type-C as well), Nvidia's proprietary Adaptive-Sync solution seems somewhat limited in terms of connectivity. For G-Sync to work on a FreeSync display, ensure that your system meets the following requirements: \n\n                                        Connection Options: DisplayPort 1.2 (or higher) for AMD FreeSync monitors. HDMI 2.0/2.1 support for G-Sync Compatible TVs and BFGD (Big Format Gaming Displays).\n                        \n\n                                        Supported Graphics Cards: Nvidia GeForce GTX 10/16-Series and RTX 20/30/40-Series GPUs.\n                        \n\n                                        Driver Support: GeForce Game Ready Driver Version 417.71 (or newer).\n                        \n\n                                        Operating System: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)\n                        \n\nTo enable G-Sync functionality on a FreeSync monitor that lacks Nvidia's official certification, follow the walkthrough below.\nFirst, download and Install the latest GeForce Game Ready Drivers from Nvidia's official Driver Downloads page. Alternatively, it is possible to update your GPU drivers by using Nvidia's own software suite: GeForce Experience.\nAfter installing the latest GPU drivers, restart your PC and check whether FreeSync (Basic or Extended) has been enabled from the monitor's OSD (On-Screen Display).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor G-Sync Compatible monitors, G-Sync should be enabled by default when FreeSync has been activated from the monitor's OSD. However, if you are using a non-certified FreeSync display, you might need to change additional settings inside the Nvidia Control Panel. Right-click on the desktop and select NVIDIA Control Panel from the drop-down menu.\nInside the NVIDIA Control Panel, go to Manage 3D settings and look for Monitor Technology under the Global Settings tab. Set G-SYNC Compatible as the preferred option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn an additional note, check whether Preferred refresh rate has been set to Highest available. Doing so allows your FreeSync monitor to take advantage of its maximum refresh rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor an optimal G-Sync experience, we recommend using V-Sync along with G-Sync to eliminate screen tearing when the frame rate goes above the VRR range. Under Global Settings, scroll down to the bottom of the list and set Vertical sync to On. Click on Apply to save your changes.\n(Note: When playing a game, ensure that in-game V-Sync has been disabled. Doing so allows V-Sync to work in tandem with G-Sync at the driver level.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter modifying these settings, click on Set up G-SYNC under the Display tab. In case you're using multiple monitors, select your primary display and click on the checkbox, right next to Enable G-SYNC, G-SYNC Compatible.\nSince most non-certified FreeSync monitors suffer from major flickering issues when running G-Sync in windowed mode, it is advisable to enable G-Sync functionality exclusively for full screen mode. When you're done making these changes, click on the checkbox next to Enable settings for the selected display model and then on Apply to save your preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's it! G-Sync should now be enabled on your FreeSync monitor.\nTo test whether G-Sync is working properly on your FreeSync display, download and install Nvidia's G-SYNC Pendulum demo, a handy tool that can help demonstrate the benefits of Adaptive-Sync technology. Consider switching between No Vsync and G-SYNC to better understand the purpose of G-Sync in synchronizing your monitor's refresh rate with the frame rate of your GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, one of the major concerns for PC gamers when using V-Sync alongside G-Sync is the introduction of input lag. Not only does it contribute to additional system latency but also affects the overall experience by a significant margin.\nTo reduce any V-Sync level input lag while gaming on a FreeSync display, set the maximum frame rate to three frames below the monitor's refresh rate. For a 144Hz monitor, an FPS cap of 141 should be good enough for consistent frame pacing across the board.\nIf your game doesn't include an internal FPS limiter, try using an external frame rate limiter such as RTSS (Rivatuner Statistics Server) or Nvidia's Max Frame Rate option inside the Control Panel. \n                        Get a Smooth, Tear-Free Gaming Experience With Nvidia G-Sync\n               \nDespite Nvidia's claims about a suboptimal gaming experience when running G-Sync on non-certified FreeSync panels, we found little to no difference between both variants. Besides exclusive features such as ULMB (Ultra Low Motion Blur) and Variable Overdrive support, Nvidia GPUs tend to provide a similar VRR experience as AMD GPUs on most FreeSync monitors.\nInstead of going for a premium G-Sync monitor, you can save a large portion of your budget by opting for a FreeSync (Premium/Premium Pro) display that will deliver the best of both worlds. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Explained\n\n\n\n\nComputer Monitor\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support MakeUseOf.

Simons Foundation \n\n\nA new supercomputer operated by the Flatiron Institute in New York City tops the latest Green500 List of the most power-efficient supercomputers in the world.\nThe revised list, which ranks supercomputers based on the number of floating-point operations per second (or \u2018flops\u2019) per watt of power, clocks the new supercomputer at 65.091 billion flops per watt. That edges out the previous record holder, which managed 62.684 billion flops per watt. At 2.038 million billion flops, the new Flatiron Institute supercomputer is also the 405th most powerful computer in the world.\n\u201cThis supercomputer opens up opportunities for doing new kinds of science,\u201d says Ian Fisk, co-director of the Flatiron Institute\u2019s Scientific Computing Core. \u201cThis is a workhorse machine, and we\u2019re going to let our researchers try new things and drive discoveries.\u201d\nResearchers at the Flatiron Institute will tap the new supercomputer\u2019s power to tackle thorny problems in computational astrophysics, biology, mathematics, neuroscience and quantum physics. The system uses the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform, which is well-suited for machine learning applications, such as multibody simulations of the universe\u2019s evolution, predicting how proteins fold and function, and finding correlations in genomic studies. Accelerated computing platforms also excel at linear-algebra calculations that simulate how electrons behave at the quantum scale. That\u2019s because such platforms use graphical processing units (GPUs) to run many more calculations in parallel than traditional central processing units (CPUs) can.\nHoused in a data center in New Jersey, the system itself was built by Lenovo and leverages the efficiency capabilities of the company\u2019s ThinkSystem SR670 V2, a server designed to install easily into traditional data centers and to be accessible to more researchers. Its efficient design effectively keeps things cool even in a high-heat, multi-GPU environment. In its operating configuration, the machine boasts 20 nodes connected with the NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networking platform, with each node containing four NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs. (During the efficiency benchmarking, the machine used 10 nodes, each with eight GPUs.)\nThe transistors on the NVIDIA chipsets measure just 4 nanometers wide, which means that more computational muscle can be packed on the same size chip. That smaller transistor size and many other optimizations have helped reduce the new supercomputer\u2019s energy consumption and maximized its performance efficiency.\n\n\n\nSimons Foundation \n\n\nLowering a supercomputer\u2019s power usage without sacrificing performance comes with many benefits. Electricity is a significant component of a machine\u2019s operating costs and environmental impact. Every watt consumed is converted into heat that must be removed from the system, requiring even more power. Moreover, more energy-efficient systems can slot into existing data centers without needing costly electrical upgrades.\nFisk says the number one power-efficiency ranking wasn\u2019t the primary goal. \u201cThis computer will allow us to do more science with smarter technology that uses less electricity and contributes to a more sustainable future,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s important to us.\u201d\nThe new Flatiron Institute supercomputer supplants Frontier Test & Development System (TDS), located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, on the power efficiency list. Frontier TDS set an extremely high bar on the June 2022 list, at 62.684 billion flops per watt, while the main Frontier system \u2014 which broke the exaFLOP (1 billion billion flops) barrier and remains the fastest supercomputer in the world \u2014 checks in at 52.227 billion flops per watt. Unseating Frontier presented a daunting challenge, Fisk says.\nWhile both are record setters, the new Flatiron Institute supercomputer is a markedly different beast from Frontier, which was laboriously designed and built to reach 1 exaFLOP. Conversely, the new Flatiron Institute system utilizes commonly available systems, GPUs and networking, making it \u201cvery high performance and very efficient without being particularly exotic,\u201d Fisk says. \u201cIt only took a couple of people to load the system in. This kind of efficiency is now accessible to a lot more groups, rather than just the largest supercomputing centers.\u201d\nThe obtainability of the technology behind the new supercomputer represents a shift in the industry.\u00a0 \u201cLenovo is committed to making the same exascale-ready technologies available for users of all sizes and across all industries,\u201d says Kirk Skaugen, executive vice president of Lenovo and president of the company\u2019s Infrastructure Solutions Group. \u201cOur collaboration with Flatiron and NVIDIA demonstrates a pivotal milestone in enabling supercomputing technology at nearly any scale and supporting smarter technology for all.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent Articles\n\n\n\n\n\nNeuroscience February 20, 2025\n\n\nHow Do Our Brains Make Decisions?

Described as a multiyear collaboration, the project will integrate Microsoft's Azure cloud computing system with Nvidia's A100 and H100 chips, its Quantum-2 InfiniBand network and Nvidia AI Enterprise software. The AI computer will be the \"first public cloud\" to do so, the companies said.On Monday, Nvidia said that Microsoft Azure is the first to use the Quantum-2 InfiniBand platform, which performs data and simulation operations at high speeds. The A100 and H100 processors are the company's most powerful, and can be used in a variety of applications including science and manufacturing. The AI supercomputer will harness Microsoft's virtual machines to handle more complex research and automated functions for organizations.Nvidia also says it will use Azure to develop advanced generative AI that provides machines with the ability to create new content like code, text video or images.\u00a0    \n    Computing Guides\n   \n      Laptops\n     \n  \n          Best Laptop\n        \n          Best Chromebook\n        \n          Best Budget Laptop\n        \n          Best Cheap Gaming Laptop\n        \n          Best 2-in-1 Laptop\n        \n          Best Windows Laptop\n        \n          Best Macbook\n        \n          Best Gaming Laptop\n        \n          Best Macbook Deals\n        \n      Desktops & Monitors\n     \n  \n          Best Desktop PC\n        \n          Best Gaming PC\n        \n          Best Monitor Under 200\n        \n          Best Desktop Deals\n        \n          Best Monitors\n        \n          M2 Mac Mini Review\n        \n      Computer Accessories\n     \n  \n          Best PC Speakers\n        \n          Best Printer\n        \n          Best External Hard Drive SSD\n        \n          Best USB C Hub Docking Station\n        \n          Best Keyboard\n        \n          Best Webcams\n        \n          Best Mouse\n        \n          Best Laptop Backpack\n        \n      Photography\n     \n  \n          Best Camera to Buy\n        \n          Best Vlogging Camera\n        \n          Best Tripod\n        \n          Best Waterproof Camera\n        \n          Best Action Camera\n        \n          Best Camera Bag and Backpack\n        \n          Best Drone\n        \n      Tablets & E-Readers\n     \n  \n          Best E-Ink Tablets\n        \n          Best iPad Deals\n        \n          Best iPad\n        \n          Best E-Reader\n        \n          Best Tablet\n        \n          Best Android Tablet\n        \n      3D Printers\n     \n  \n          Best 3D Printer\n        \n          Best Budget 3D Printer\n        \n          Best 3D Printing Filament\n        \n          Best 3D Printer Deals\n                         Your guideto a better future DealsReviewsBest ProductsGift GuideCouponsVideosSoftware Downloads About CNET Press Room Newsletters Licensing Sitemap Careers Accessibility Cookie Settings Privacy Policy  Terms of Use Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information instagram youtube tiktok facebook x flipboard  US France Germany Japan Korea \n  \u00a9 2025 CNET, a Ziff Davis company.\n  All rights reserved.\n   \n\n\n"

As discovered by GamersNexus, we are now in the fourth week since the first issues appeared and more details pop up to tell what's causing these cables to melt.\nNVIDIA 16-Pin 12VHPWR Cable Problems Once Again Suggested To Be User-Error, Users Mount Up More Pressure on Green Team\nThere are three main topics to cover in this post, first and foremost are the new discoveries made by GamersNexus which once again point out two potential reasons why this issue is being caused. Now one should not call this the definitive reason for the issues as NVIDIA has yet to provide its own official update, but there are three sources that have said this might be the reason. First, we have Ronaldo Buassali from GALAX & TecLab who said this in the very beginning followed by Corsair's tech expert, JonnyGuru, and now, we have more details on the matter by GamersNexus who have also managed to recreate the melting issues live at their lab.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nGamersNexus Suggests User Error Is Causing NVIDIA's 16-Pin 12VHPWR Cables To Melt\nIn a very deep and detailed analysis that took several days of testing, Steve Burke and his team over at GamersNexus found two main causes behind the melting of the 16-Pin 12VHPWR cable from NVIDIA. Yesterday, we told that there were two cables provided by two different companies and one may feature problematic soldering and design. However, GamersNexus tested both and found out that the issue can occur on both cables, so the manufacturer doesn't matter.\nThe tech outlet continues to suggest that the issues are caused by either user error where users are not inserting the cables within the connector properly or foreign debris that might enter the connector after plugging the cable in or out or while manufacturing. Based on data from various AIB partners, GamersNexus reports that the failure rate is somewhere between 0.05 to 0.1% and that means that out of 100,000 units that have been shipped for the RTX 4090 so far, only 100 are really affected by this.\n\nA summary of the entire video has been provided by NVIDIA's subreddit mod, Nestledrink, which can be read below:\n\nPer Nvidia partner: Failure rate is 0.05% - 0.1%. Nvidia may provide more context on this later\nAny of them \"can\" fail because there are a few modes of failure and one of them involves user error\nConfirmed 2 Manufacturers: Astron / NTK (Also, subcontracted to Tricon?)\nFailure in general is overwhelmingly uncommon and many of the failures are very easily avoidable\n\nWhat are the causes:\n\nForeign object debris in the cable\nCaused by improper manufacturing and scraping of the bump combined with high current and or poor connection\nCreating poor points of contact\nExtremely improper insertion by the user\nImproper insertion in combination with a taut wire on one or more pins\nCausing one point of poor contact that heats up\n\nConclusion:\n\nCables are melting when the connector is unseated\nIt requires being very unseated AND pulling the cable at an angle\nDid not fail when tested unseated but not being pulled at an angle\n\"Partial insertion and angling of the pin into the socket could have increased susceptibility for a high resistance parallel connection at the lip of the socket\" - Failure Analysis Lab Testing sent to GN\nAny debris will make this worse\nFailures are rare\nDon't chase specific adapters as any of them can fail\nAnxiety surrounding the issue might exacerbate the issue\nWhen people are unplugging and re-plugging, it could create foreign object debris (not common)\nUser error when re-plugging the connector\nPurely objectively, GN feels you should be comfortable using a 12VHPWR connector but it requires them to be fully connected and seated (Critical)\nThere should not be any gap\nPush the cable until you can't wiggle it out anymore (GN gave an example of how he could pull the seemingly fully inserted cable out by wiggling it out -- this is an indication that the cable is NOT fully seated)\n\nNVIDIA Hit With Lawsuit Over 16-Pin 12VHPWR Melting Fiasco\nMoving on to story number two, an owner of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card who has filed a class action lawsuit against NVIDIA over the whole 16-Pin 12VHPWR cable. The lawsuit can be seen filed over at Justia and was filed at the California Federal court on 11 November 2022. The user states:\nNVIDIA \"marketed and sold the RTX 4090 with a defective and dangerous power cable plug and socket, which has rendered consumers' cards inoperable and poses a serious electrical and fire hazard for each and every purchaser.\"\nvia Tomshardware\n\nIt is stated within the lawsuit that he installed his graphics card correctly but despite that the 16-pin cable on the card melted. Now there's no evidence as to if the cable was properly inserted or not but despite that, the user should be able to RMA his card for a new unit without any issues. We should advise all RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 owners to check and make sure the cable is inserted fully within the 16-Pin connector on the card. The issue occurring this often shows that the design of the cable isn't very user-friendly as the previous 8-pin connectors if they require you to put in a lot of force.\nAnother Founders Edition's 16-Pn 12VHPWR Cable Melts\nOver this weekend on Reddit, another RTX 4090 GPU was mentioned as melting/malfunctioning, causing yet another user to contact their representative. This time, however, it comes from an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition card. This new development now stretches into the territory of NVIDIA's high-end proprietary cards.\nThe card was purchased on the 19th of October from Best Buy (it is unknown whether it was online or in-store). The GPU was inside an ASUS ROG Helios chassis with the side panel removed to ensure that the cable would not be bent on the 16-pin adaptor, as the user knew of the possible damage. The three 8-pin PCIe cables were confirmed to have been connected per the user to the ASUS ROG Thor 1200W PSU to offer adequate supply to the card.\nThe cable for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition. Image source: Party_Quail_1048 on Reddit.\nOn October 29th, the screen suddenly went black. Before the day, the user would play Call of Duty: Warzone each day, between two to three hours each. Upon investigation, the connector and corresponding adapter were already damaged, showing signs of melting. The graphics card has since been returned to NVIDIA for replacement, which will add to the list of cards that NVIDIA is currently examining for the actual cause of the problem. The user has reported that they have received the replacement graphics card but are very hesitant to install the new graphics card until a problem and solution have been found.\nThe connector on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition. Image source: Party_Quail_1048 on Reddit.\nThe problem has been active for the last month since the first day of the release of the Ada architecture-based graphics cards. However, this is the first known incident involving an NVIDIA-branded graphics card (i.e. Founder's Edition).\nOnce again, we wait for NVIDIA's official reply over the matter. The company has been working with AIBs to get to the bottom of all of this but hasn't really revealed the exact cause yet.\n\n\n\nAre you willing to buy a graphics card with the 16-pin 12VHPWR connector cable?\n\n\n Yes but only with ATX 3.0 PSU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Yes but I'll use it with non-ATX 3.0 PSU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n No, Neither with ATX 3.0 or older PSU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n I will stick to my non 16-Pin card till the dust settles\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n136\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n89\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n75\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n74\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n42\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1480\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1157\nComments\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n1035\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The new GPU promises up to a 1.6x performance uplift compared to its predecessor, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, powered by fourth-generation Tensor cores, third-generation RT cores, and more. The GPU has 9,572 CUDA cores and 16GB of GDDR6X memory on a 256-bit memory interface. \nNot only does the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 have more power, it's also the second Nvidia GPU to ship with AV1 encoders, meaning it can create higher-quality video with a lower bitrate, ideal for streaming and game capture. Along with the GeForce RTX 4090, this is one of the first GPUs on the market to have built-in hardware for AV1 encoding (though Intel was technically first with its Arc series). The new GPU arrives alongside the launch of the latest Nvidia Studio driver for November to improve performance in creative apps.\nThe GeForce RTX 4080 is also the second GPU to support Nvidia's new DLSS 3 technology with frame generation, which uses AI to generate new frames in-between traditionally rendered frames to create a smoother visual experience. This feature is exclusive to RTX 40 series cards, and considering the GeForce RTX 4090 is so expensive and power-hungry, it's good to have slightly more reasonable options.\nWith that being said, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 isn't exactly a budget-friendly option, with the Founders Edition card starting at $1,199.99, which is $500 more than the RTX 3080 started at officially, and $300 more than the RTX 3080 Ti. Indeed, GPU prices have gone up a lot for Nvidia, so this may be an upgrade that not everyone can stomach.

The 4080 launched at $1199 US, making it the single largest price bump we have ever seen on an '80' class GeForce graphics card.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSJust to put things into perspective. the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 launched at $699 US two years ago. The GeForce RTX 3080 12 GB launched at 899 US. Comparing these to the 4080's $1999 US price, we see a 71.5% and a 50% price bump gen-over-gen. Previously, the NVIDIA '80' class cards had been positioned well in the $550-$700 US range for several years.

And that leads us to today.\n\nNVIDIA 4080 shipment units:\n\ud83d\udfe230,000\nNVIDIA 4090 shipment units:\n\ud83d\udfe2130,000\nTotal RTX 40 shipment units:\n\ud83d\udfe2160,000\nNVIDIA's 4090 was pretty much sold out at launch.\nRetailers still have 4080 in stock. \ud83d\ude36\u200d\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f\ud83d\ude36\u200d\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f\n\u2014 Hassan Mujtaba (@hms1193) November 19, 2022\n\n\n8:30,0009:+30% of current shipment\n\u2014 chi11eddog (@g01d3nm4ng0) November 19, 2022\n\nRetailers in almost all regions are stocked with NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4080 graphics card. This is not a sight that was seen after the RTX 4090's launch and it is definitely not due to the massive inventory that NVIDIA has for the RTX 4080. In fact, based on the numbers we have, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 shipments are close to 30,000 units.\nThat's 70% less than RTX 4090's shipments which were at 100,000 units a few weeks back (we reported here exclusively) and are currently close to 130,000 units. So the entirety of the RTX 40 series cards has shipped around 160,000 units. That's 30,000 RTX 4080 and 130,000 RTX 4090 units. So despite a lower quantity of shipments, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 is still having a hard time selling and consumers are simply either waiting for a cheaper solution under the $1000 US bracket or getting themselves an RTX 4090.\nHere are just a few examples of various stores in the US sitting with piles of RTX 4080 graphics cards that no one is interested in buying:\n\nAnother Nvidia RTX 4080 inventory pile pic.twitter.com/ITEzCkZ96o\n\u2014 tae kim (@firstadopter) November 17, 2022\n\nFollowing is the situation at most retailers and while Newegg has all their cards sold out, it looks like eBay scalpers may have a big hand in causing these shortages as the site is loaded with cards priced above $1600 US and even some which are priced above $2000 US (we don't recommend buying any of these scalped cards):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThis leads us to the third part of the story and that's the individual AIB model pricing. Most NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 cards are priced neck-to-neck with an RTX 4090 Founders Edition or AIB models with reference pricing. For example, ASUS's RTX 4080 ROG STRIX and TUF Gaming are currently at $1500 & $1549 US, respectively. We also recently covered an anime-themed model which is priced higher than an RTX 4090. The RTX 4090 offers a 30-40% performance bump over the RTX 4080 so users would rather pay for that extra performance and massive VRAM pool for 10-15% more price rather than get an overly priced 4080.\nThe last and most crucial thing that is holding off consumers from buying an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 graphics card is the imminent launch of AMD's Radeon RX 7900 series graphics cards which the red team has been marketing directly against the RTX 4080, throwing shots at the 16-pin connectors (now confirmed as a user-error), its hugely oversized reference models and betting on its brand new set of features. The prices are very attractive at $899 and $999 US but despite that, we would recommend our readers wait for final reviews. Regardless, that doesn't change the fact that the GeForce RTX 4080 graphics card offers the worst perf to $ value at the moment.\n\n\n\nWhich flagship graphics cards are you most interested in?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n129\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n92\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n59\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

releases GPU driver update to fix 29 security flaws\n\n\n                            By Bill Toulas\n\n\nNovember 30, 2022\n11:27 AM\n0\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA has released a security update for its GPU display driver for Windows, containing a fix for a high-severity flaw that threat actors can exploit to perform, among other things, code execution and privilege escalation.\nThe latest security update addresses 25 vulnerabilities on the Windows and Linux GPU drivers, while seven flaws are categorized as high-severity.\nThe two most critical vulnerabilities are:\nCVE-2022-34669 (CVSS v3.1: 8.8) \u2013 Locally exploited user mode flaw in the Windows GPU driver allowing an unprivileged regular user to access or modify files critical to the application, potentially leading to code execution, privilege escalation, information disclosure, data tampering, and denial of service.\nCVE-2022-34671 (CVSS v3.1: 8.5) \u2013 Remotely exploited user mode flaw in the Windows GPU driver allowing an unprivileged regular user to cause an out-of-bounds write, potentially leading to code execution, privilege escalation, information disclosure, data tampering, and denial of service.\nCVE-2022-34671 has a lower severity rating despite being vulnerable to network attacks because of its high complexity, making its exploitation less likely.\nHowever, the CVE-2022-34669 flaw is more helpful to hackers and malware developers who already have access to a Windows device and are looking for ways to escalate their privileges or execute code.\nGPU and hardware drivers run with elevated privileges on the OS, so exploiting a vulnerability in a driver provides the same high level of privileges to malicious code or commands.\nConsidering the popularity of NVIDIA products, there's a high chance of finding vulnerable GPU drivers on targeted computers, allowing attackers to exploit these flaws to gain greater privileges and spread further on a network.\nNVIDIA has yet to release in-depth technical details about these flaws, allowing users enough time to patch first.\nThe NVIDIA driver versions that fix these vulnerabilities are the following:\n\nLinux users should consult this GPU driver version table instead:\n\nCheck out NVIDIA's security bulletin for details on all 25 fixes and every software and hardware product covered in this month's update.\nUsers are recommended to apply the released security updates by downloading the latest available version of the driver for their GPU model from NVIDIA's download central, where they can select the specific product and OS they are using.\nThe updates can also be fetched and applied automatically through NVIDIA's\u00a0GeForce Experience suite.\nUpdate 12/6/22 - Cisco Talos disclosed more information about CVE-2022-34671 in a dedicated report on their blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\u00a9 Techniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft March 2025 Patch Tuesday fixes 7 zero-days, 57 flawsJuniper

It is not intended to be used for gaming though one can still game on it if they want since NVIDIA's drivers are very flexible. One might easily get confused with the naming scheme of the new card but one should remember that the Ampere generation had an 'A' at the beginning of the model name whereas the Ada generation doesn't feature any alphabets in the beginning. The card is simply called the RTX 6000 instead of the RTX A6000 (Last-gen).\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe specifications of the NVIDIA RTX 6000 are also better than the GeForce RTX 4090. It has just 2 SMs disabled at 142 which offer up to 18,176 CUDA cores. That's 11% more cores & SMs than the RTX 4090 GPU. But NVIDIA surely has some room left for an even higher-end variant that will use those 2 remaining SM units. The card comes with a similar boost clock of 2.5 GHz and has double the VRAM capacity at 48 GB (EEC) versus the 24 GB featured on the RTX 4090. The card does use slower 20 Gbps GDDR6X memory dies versus the 21 Gbps dies featured on the gaming graphics card.\n\n\n\nArchitecture\nNVIDIA Ada Lovelace Architecture\n\n\nProcess Size\n4nm NVIDIA Custom Process | TSMC\n\n\nDie Size\n608.4 mm\n\n\nTransistors\n76.3 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n18176\n\n\nTensor Cores\n568 Gen-4\n\n\nRT Cores\n142 Gen-3\n\n\nGPU Memory\n48 GB GDDR6 with ECC\n\n\nMemory Interface\n384-bit\n\n\nGraphics Bus\nPCI Express Gen 4.0 x16\n\n\nDisplay Connectors\nDP 1.4 (4)\n\n\nForm Factor\n4.4\" H x 10.5\" L, Dual-Slot\n\n\nThermal Solution\nActive Fansink\n\n\nAR/MR/VR/XR Capable\nYes\n\n\nNVIDIA 3D Vision and 3D Vision Pro\nSupport via Optional 3-pin mini-DIN\n\n\nFrame Lock\nCompatible with NVIDIA Quadro Sync II\n\n\nMaximum Power Consumption\n300 W\n\n\nAuxiliary Power Connector\n1x PCIe CEMS 16-pin\n\n\nNVENC | NVDEC\n3x | 3x + AV1 Encode and Decode\n\n\n\nAs for performance, the NVIDIA RTX 6000 'Ada' graphics card offers 91.1 TFLOPs of FP32, 210.6 TFLOPs of RT, and 1457 TFLOPs of Tensor core performance. While the RTX 4090 requires 450W TBP, the RTX 6000 is rated at just 300W, making it quite the efficiency powerhouse. But all of that extra prowess and workstation goodness comes at a cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nNVIDIA's RTX 6000 graphics card is currently listed at ShopBLT in a PNY variant for $7350 US while the CompSource outlet has it listed for $8200 US.
